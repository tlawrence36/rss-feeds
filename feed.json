      "The European Union plans to provide emergency funds to help keep Radio Free Europe afloat after the Trump administration stopped grants to the pro-democracy media outlet",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union agreed Tuesday to provide emergency funds to help keep Radio Free Europe afloat after the Trump administration stopped grants to the pro-democracy media outlet, accusing it of promoting a news agenda with a liberal bias.",
      "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty started broadcasting during the Cold War. Its programs are aired in 27 languages in 23 countries across Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East. Its lawyers have been fighting the administration in court.",
      "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc\u2019s foreign ministers had agreed to a 5.5-million-euro ($6.2 million) contract to \u201csupport the vital work of Radio Free Europe.\u201d The \u201cshort-term emergency funding\u201d is a \u201csafety net\u201d for independent journalism, she said.",
      "Kallas said the EU would not be able to fill the organization's funding gap around the world, but that it can help the broadcaster to \u201cwork and function in those countries that are in our neighborhood and that are very much dependent on news coming from outside.\u201d",
      "She said that she hoped the 27 EU member countries would also provide more funds to help Radio Free Europe longer term. Kallas said the bloc has been looking for \u201cstrategic areas\u201d where it can help as the United States cuts foreign aid.",
      "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\u2019s corporate headquarters are in Washington and its journalistic headquarters are based in the Czech Republic, which has been leading the EU drive to find funds.",
      "Last month, a U.S. federal judge ordered the Trump administration to restore $12 million that was appropriated by Congress. Lawyers for the service, which has been operating for 75 years, said it would be forced to shut down in June without the money.",
      "In March, Kallas recalled the influence that the network had on her as she was growing up in Estonia, which was part of the Soviet Union.",
      "\u201cComing from the other side of the Iron Curtain, actually it was (from) the radio that we got a lot of information,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, it has been a beacon of democracy, very valuable in this regard.\u201d",

    "summary": "Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump aren't new foes",
    "story": [
      "They have some similarities, Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump \u2014 guys in their 70s with homes in New Jersey and big constituencies among white American men middle-aged and older. And both, in very different respects, are the boss.",
      "That's about where it ends.",
      "The veteran rock star, long a political opponent of the president, stood up as one of Trump's most prominent cultural critics last week with a verbal takedown from a British stage.",
      "As is his nature, Trump is fighting back \u2014 hard. He calls Springsteen a \u201cdried out prune of a rocker\u201d and is even bringing Beyonc\u00e9 into the fray.",
      "On Monday, the president suggested Springsteen and Beyonc\u00e9 should be investigated to see if appearances they made on behalf of his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, last fall represented an illegal campaign donation.",
      "Opening a tour in Manchester, England, Springsteen told his audience last Thursday that \u201cthe America I love, the America I've written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cTonight we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring.\"",
      "Springsteen later made reference to an \u201cunfit president and a rogue government\u201d who have \u201cno concern or idea for what it means to be deeply American.\u201d",
      "The next morning, Trump called Springsteen highly overrated. \u201cNever liked him, never liked his music or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he's not a talented guy \u2014 just a pushy, obnoxious JERK,\u201d he wrote on social media.",
      "\u201cThis dried out prune of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back in the Country,\u201d he said.",
      "The next night, also in Manchester, Springsteen repeated his criticisms.",
      "\u201cIt's no surprise what Springsteen's political leanings are and have been for many decades,\u201d said veteran music writer Alan Light, author of the upcoming \u201cDon't Stop: Why We (Still) Love Fleetwood Mac's Rumours.\u201d \u201cHe's somebody who has been outspoken in his music and his actions.\u201d",
      "The Boss' statements this week showed he wasn't afraid to speak out \u201cat a time when so many people and institutions are just kind of rolling over,\u201d Light said.",
      "It's not the first time Springsteen has spoken out against Trump \u2014 or a Republican president.",
      "When former President Ronald Reagan referenced Springsteen's \u201cmessage of hope\u201d at a campaign stop during the height of the rocker's \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d popularity, Springsteen wondered if Reagan had listened to his music and its references to those left behind in the 1980s economy. He also has had an occasionally bumpy relationship with onetime Republican presidential candidate and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a fan of his music.",
      "Springsteen has campaigned for Trump's opponents, including Harris last fall. In 2020, he said that \u201ca good portion of our fine country, to my eye, has been thoroughly hypnotized, brainwashed by a con man from Queens.\u201d",
      "He knows the outer-borough reference still stung a man who built his own tower in Manhattan and ascended to the presidency. Trump often stays at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Springsteen grew up in New Jersey \u2014 you may have heard \u2014 and lives in Colts Neck, New Jersey, now.",
      "Trump doesn't hesitate to go after the biggest musical names that speak out against him, like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift. But the political risk may be less; their younger, more female audiences are less likely to intersect with Trump's core constituency.",
      "During his career, Springsteen has challenged his audience politically beyond presidential endorsements. The 1995 album \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d bluntly documented the lives of struggling immigrants \u2014 Mexican and Vietnamese among them. And his 2001 song \u201cAmerican Skin (41 Shots),\" criticized the shooting by New York City police officers of an unarmed Guinean immigrant named Amadou Diallo, angering some of the blue-collar segments of his fan base.",
      "Clearly, Springsteen has conservative fans and some who wish he'd steer clear of politics, Light said. Still, \u201c40 years later, it's hard to imagine what they think would happen\u201d with Trump, he said.",
      "While Trump made a point to reference Springsteen's criticism in an overseas show, he and the E Street Band haven't performed in the United States since before the 2024 election. His tour last year hit heavily on themes of mortality, less of politics. He has several European tour dates scheduled this year into July and hasn't announced any new American shows.",

      "McMahon, who has led both the network news division and news for the CBS-owned stations, said in an email message to staff that \u201cit's become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward. It's time to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.\u201d",
      "McMahon has made clear she opposes settling with Trump \u2014 just like \u201c60 Minutes\u201d executive producer Bill Owens, who quit last month.",
      "Trump has sued CBS, alleging it edited an interview with 2024 Democratic opponent Kamala Harris last fall to benefit her. CBS News has denied that. CBS' parent company, Paramount Global, is in talks to potentially settle Trump's lawsuit. At the same time, Paramount Global is seeking administration approval of a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "George Cheeks, co-CEO of Paramount and head of the CBS network, said McMahon's top deputies, CBS News president Tom Cibrowski and CBS Stations president Jennifer Mitchell, will report directly to him.",

Paramount began supervising \u201c60 Minutes\u201d stories in new ways, including asking former CBS News President Susan Zirinsky to look over some of its stories before they aired.",

      "The premiere also had another surprise: Rihanna attended and walked the carpet afterward with partner A$AP Rocky. Earlier this month, she revealed at the Met Gala that she was pregnant with their third child.",
      "While the festival's photo calls usually happen the day after a film's premiere, Cannes hosted one for \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d earlier Monday so Washington could attend. The actor, playfully posing with Lee and co-star A$AP Rocky, showed no signs of jet lag and left once the screening began.",

      "That Washington would be able to make the trip had been a sticking point for Cannes. When the festival first announced its lineup last month, \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d wasn't included. Within hours, however, Lee himself announced the film was heading to Cannes. Representatives for the festival said they had been waiting for confirmation that Washington would attend to walk the red carpet.",

      "Gary Lineker, the England soccer great-turned-media celebrity, will leave his role as a presenter for the BBC after facing criticism for reposting an Instagram story about Zionism which featured a picture of a rat.",
      "The 64-year-old Lineker, who is the British national broadcaster\u2019s highest-paid presenter on about 1.3 million pounds ($1.7 million) a year, was set to leave flagship soccer highlights show \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d at the end of this season but remain with the BBC to front other soccer coverage, including next year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup.",
      "However, the BBC said Monday in a statement that Lineker will step down entirely from the corporation after the final \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d episode next weekend in the wake of his decision to share a post from the group, Palestine Lobby, illustrated with a picture of a rat, titled: \u201cZionism explained in two minutes.\u201d",

      "Lineker had already apologized for his conduct, saying last week he reposted material which he subsequently learned contained \u201coffensive references,\u201d adding that he withdrew the post as soon as he became aware of the issue and \u201cwould never knowingly share anything antisemitic.\u201d",
      "Before Lineker\u2019s apology, Davie said the corporation needed people to be the \u201cexemplars of BBC values and follow our social media policies\u201d and that \u201cwhen someone makes a mistake, it costs us.\u201d",
      "\u201cFootball has been at the heart of my life for as long as I can remember \u2014 both on the pitch and in the studio,\u201d Lineker said in the BBC statement. \u201cI care deeply about the game, and about the work I\u2019ve done with the BBC over many years. As I\u2019ve said, I would never consciously repost anything antisemitic \u2014 it goes against everything I stand for.",
      "\u201cHowever, I recognize the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.\u201d",

      "Lineker\u2019s openness to reflect his political views on social media have caused growing friction with the BBC regarding its impartiality guidelines.",
      "He was temporarily suspended from the corporation in March 2023 over comments he made criticizing the then-Conservative government\u2019s new asylum policy. It led to the BBC\u2019s rules on social media posts being rewritten to say presenters of high-profile programs outside news had a \u201cresponsibility to respect the BBC\u2019s impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC.\u201d",

The documentary was pulled after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "Last week, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph newspaper that came a day after his initial apology, Lineker spoke out about the conduct of Israel in the war against Hamas in Gaza, saying those who stayed silent about it were \u201calmost complicit.\u201d",
      "The BBC has lost something of a national treasure who has become almost as well known a broadcaster as he was a soccer player.",

He has been the main presenter of BBC\u2019s \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d since 1999 and used his status as a freelancer to work for other broadcasters such as NBC, Al Jazeera and BT Sport.",
      "Lineker, who played his club soccer for Everton, Tottenham and Barcelona, is the co-founder of the hugely successful \u201cGoalhanger\u201d podcasts \u2014 the maker of the popular \u201cThe Rest is History\u201d series and its spin-offs about politics, soccer, entertainment and money.",
      "Lineker\u2019s departure from the BBC was welcomed by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, which said he had become \u201ca symbol of the rot at the heart of our national broadcaster.\u201d",
      "Lineker, the group added, was \u201crepeatedly allowed to flout the BBC\u2019s own rules on impartiality, abusing his position to promote his increasingly propagandist politics, vilifying those he disagrees with, and even promoting dehumanizing and extreme messages.\u201d",
      "Lineker has accepted that being outspoken with his views would make him a target but, for many, it has strengthened his status as one of Britain\u2019s most popular figures.",
      "\u201cGary has been a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades,\u201d Davie said. \u201cHis passion and knowledge have shaped our sports journalism and earned him the respect of sports fans across the UK and beyond. We want to thank him for the contribution he has made.\u201d",

      "With remarkable regularity, Anderson has been crafting movies uniquely his own since his 1996 debut, \u201cBottle Rocket.\u201d",
      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Wes Anderson isn\u2019t driving the bus. Laurent is. That\u2019s the name of the driver who\u2019s bringing Anderson, and his bus, to the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "As they drive from his home in Paris to the South of France, Anderson explains by phone: \u201cI don\u2019t drive the bus. You have to have, like, four years of training and an EU bus driver\u2019s license. The thing is, if you\u2019re going to drive a bus like this, you\u2019ve got to be able to drive it in reverse, too.\u201d",
      "For years, Anderson has, in favor of the normal festival cars that shuttle guests, brought his own bus to Cannes so his whole cast can arrive together at the premiere. On Sunday, Anderson and company (including Benicio del Toro, Mia Threapleton, Michael Cera, Scarlett Johansson and Bryan Cranston) will pile in for the premiere of Anderson\u2019s latest, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s another example of how Anderson has made something quite unusual into a regular tradition.",
      "With remarkable regularity, Anderson has been crafting movies uniquely his own since his 1996 debut, \u201cBottle Rocket.\u201d There are variations. Some are expansive family dramas (\"The Royal Tenenbaums\"). Some are more intimate (\"Rushmore\"). Some are more densely layered (\"Asteroid City\").",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d a leaner tale which Focus Features will release May 30, is Anderson working in high comic gear. A playful and poignant kind of thriller, it stars Del Toro as the tycoon Zsa-Zsa Korda, who decides to name his daughter, a novitiate (Threapleton) heir to his dubiously accrued fortune.",
      "The wheels keep turning for the 56-year-old Anderson. But there are signs of time passing, too. The Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que in Paris is hosting an Anderson retrospective, as well as an exhibition of props, costumes and artifacts from his expansive personal archive.",
      "Anderson, who has a 9-year-old daughter with his wife, the costume designer Juman Malouf, spoke about those things and others on his way to Cannes to unveil \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\" a movie that adds yet another fitting mantra to the world of Wes: \u201cWhat matters is the sincerity of your devotion.\u201d",
      "ANDERSON: We\u2019ve been keeping this stuff for so long. The experience of doing it was kind of great. I\u2019d sort of get pulled over there to approve things. And my reaction was, \u201cWell, we have more stuff.\u201d So we kept adding things. My daughter has lived with a lot of this stuff. The \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox\u201d puppets have been in our apartment in New York ever since we made the movie in boxes. Over the years, she takes them out and plays with them.",
      "ANDERSON: (Laughs) Jason, and Bill, have a way of catching you off guard with a turn of phrase. But I like that description. It\u2019s kind of an amazing experience to have had Jason involved in our movies for so long given that he was 17 when I met him. It\u2019s fun and a strange feeling. The decades have to elapse for you to have had that much time together. And it\u2019s quite shocking that they do. But there it is.",
      "ANDERSON: I didn\u2019t have something I thought I wanted to communicate about what it\u2019s like to be a father. The story really come out of an idea for Benicio and for this character. But I don\u2019t think he would have had a daughter if I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s my hunch. He\u2019s a special kind of a father, in all the worst ways. But nevertheless, there\u2019s something we related to. That\u2019s probably somewhere in the DNA of the movie.",
      "ANDERSON: If I were to say what is the first idea of the movie, it is that face. It\u2019s not an image of the setting, it\u2019s an image of Benicio in a close-up as this character. His face is just so expressive and interesting. It\u2019s a special advantage he has. He\u2019s quite mesmerizing just looking at him on camera, his chemistry with the exposure of film. In \u201cThe French Dispatch,\u201d there were electric moments on the set. But the electricity was amplified when we went back into the cutting room. The wheels started turning. When we showed \u201cThe French Dispatch\u201d however many years ago in Cannes, I did mention to Benicio there, \u201cJust be aware, there\u2019s something else coming.\"",
      "ANDERSON: Essentially, you\u2019ve put your finger on the movies that were written for a specific actor, along with Jason in \u201cAsteroid City.\u201d Owen and I were talking about Gene Hackman by the time we had 10 pages of a script. Ralph was the idea for the character in \u201cGrand Budapest\u201d before there was even one page. But I never had one where I thought of someone in such a tight close-up. With this movie, somehow it\u2019s the face and the eyes and the closest close-up.",
      "ANDERSON: First of all, Gene Hackman, one of the greatest movie actors ever. He did enjoy the movie, I think, between action and cut. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s when I have a good time.\u201d But he really didn\u2019t enjoy the parts in between, which is most of the time. He wasn\u2019t wildly taken with the script in the first place. I don\u2019t think he loved the idea of being that guy. I think he thought: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things I don\u2019t like about this man and I\u2019m not sure I want to live as him.\u201d",
      "Also, I was very young. He was shy and reserved, though he could also get quite explosive. We didn\u2019t know each other well. Sometimes, when we had conflict, we often had open conversations about what just happened. And I felt like I learned so much about him in those times. And he would often become much more gentle.",
      "I don\u2019t want to assume a great friendship because I don\u2019t think he would have ever have referred to our relationship (laughs) in those terms. But I really liked him. He just carried so much tension and he used in the work, but it was sometimes bordering on a little abusive, especially to me. (Laughs)",
      "ANDERSON: I think that\u2019s the case sometimes. When he saw the movie, he told me, \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what we were making.\u201d But he totally understood it when he saw the movie. It worked for him. He liked it, and I think he liked what he had done it. I later thought: I wish I had paused for three days of shooting, edited some of the scenes carefully and then shown him: Here\u2019s what you\u2019re doing and here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. I think maybe if I had done that, we might have had a gentler time.",
      "ANDERSON: The path that I\u2019ve had as a movie director, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s totally available right now. I don\u2019t know if the kind of movies I started out making would have been made on the same scale or with the same support or with any audience available. To get to the point where I can make the movies I make I now, I just don\u2019t know what route that would take. I think some things have changed fundamentally. But I\u2019m not 25 years younger than myself, so I just do what I do.",

      "Ex-NFL star Antonio Brown says he was briefly detained by police following an altercation in which gunshots were fired outside Adin Ross\u2019 celebrity boxing event in Miami",
      "MIAMI -- Antonio Brown was briefly detained by police early Saturday following an altercation in which gunshots were fired outside a celebrity boxing event in Miami, according to the former NFL star and video posted to social media.",
      "Miami police confirmed in a written statement that officers responded to the area at about 3 a.m. after receiving an alert from the gunshot-detection system ShotSpotter. Officer Kiara Delva, a department spokeswoman, said police questioned several people but made no arrests. No injuries were reported at the scene.",
      "The investigation continues, Delva said, and she could not confirm the names of anyone involved.",
      "Video posted to social media showed Brown involved in a fight with several people at the boxing event, which was hosted by popular streamer Adin Ross. He was seen apparently holding a black pistol as he pursued someone. Shots could be heard off camera shortly thereafter.",
      "Additional video showed Brown, hands behind his back, being escorted from the venue by an officer.",
      "Brown posted on social media that he had been \u201cjumped by multiple individuals who tried to steal my jewelry and cause physical harm to me.\"",
      "\"Police temporarily detained me until they received my side of the story and then released me. I WENT HOME THAT NIGHT AND WAS NOT ARRESTED,\u201d Brown wrote.",
      "Brown's statement did not mention the gunshots.",
      "Brown played for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2010 to 2018, where he emerged as one of the NFL\u2019s top receiving threats and twice led the league in receiving yards. His career took a downturn because of various on- and off-field issues, including his contract being voided by the Oakland Raiders before the start of the 2019 season.",
      "He split his final three NFL seasons with New England and Tampa Bay, and his career ended with Brown stripping off his jersey, pads and gloves, while walking off the field during the Buccaneers\u2019 2021 regular-season finale against the New York Jets. Brown announced his retirement a few months later.",

      "BASEL, Switerland -- The world\u2019s largest live music event has reached its glitter-drenched conclusion with the grand final on Saturday of the Eurovision Song Contest, a celebration of music and unity ruffled by discord over Israel\u2019s participation.",
      "A trio singing for Sweden about the joys of saunas and a classically trained Austrian countertenor are among those tipped to take the microphone-shaped Eurovision trophy at the contest in Basel, Switzerland.",
      "But at the ever-unpredictable event, the prize could just as easily go to powerful singers from France, the Netherlands or Finland \u2014 or even an Estonian who sings about Italian coffee. The final kicks off at 9 p.m. local time.",
      "Bookmakers say the favorite is KAJ, representing Sweden with their ode to sauna culture \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d followed by Austrian singer JJ\u2019s pop-opera song \u201cWasted Love.\u201d",
      "French chanteuse Louane has risen up the odds with \u201cmaman,\u201d as has Dutch singer Claude with soulful ballad \u201cC\u2019est La Vie\u201d and Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman with the innuendo-laden \u201cIch Komme.\u201d Estonia\u2019s Tommy Cash is also a contender with his highly caffeinated dance-pop song \u201cEspresso Macchiato.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael has won many fans with her anthemic \u201cNew Day Will Rise,\u201d but also faced protests from pro-Palestinian demonstrators calling for Israel to be kicked out of the contest over its conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza.",
      "Acts from 26 countries \u2014 trimmed from 37 entrants through two elimination semifinals \u2014 will perform to some 160 million viewers for the continent\u2019s pop crown. No smoke machine, jet of flame or dizzying light display has been spared by musicians who are given 3 minutes to make their mark.",
      "Dean Vuletic, an expert on the history of Eurovision, said the competition has become more diverse over the years, both musically and linguistically. There are songs in 20 languages this year, including Ukrainian, Icelandic, Albanian, Latvian and Maltese.",
      "\u201cIn the past it was about having a catchy, innocuous pop song, usually in English,\u201d he said. But in the past decade \u201cwe\u2019ve seen songs become much more socially and politically engaged, songs that present the audience with some sort of meaning.\"",
      "\u201cIn recent years the formulaic approach to a Eurovision entry hasn\u2019t succeeded,\" he added. \"An entry needs to be memorable and it needs to be authentic in order to succeed these days.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s contest has been roiled for a second year by disputes over Israel\u2019s participation. Dozens of former participants, including last year\u2019s winner Nemo of Switzerland, have called for Israel to be excluded.",
      "Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests have both taken place in Basel, though on a much smaller scale than at last year\u2019s event in Sweden, where tensions spilled over backstage and Dutch competitor Joost Klein was expelled over an alleged altercation with a crew member.",
      "The European Broadcasting Union or EBU, which runs Eurovision, subsequently tightened the contest\u2019s code of conduct, calling on participants to respect Eurovision\u2019s values of \u201cuniversality, diversity, equality and inclusivity\u201d and its political neutrality.",
      "Performers say the backstage vibe this year is more relaxed.",
      "After a controversial ban in 2024 on flags, apart from national ones, being waved in the arena, this year audience members can bring Palestinian flags or any others, as long as they are legal under Swiss law. Performers, though, can only wave their own country\u2019s flag.",

      "Movies are a regular presence in author Kazuo Ishiguro's life in part because filmmakers keep wanting to turn his books into them",
      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Kazuo Ishiguro 's mother was in Nagasaki when the atomic bomb was dropped.",
      "When Ishiguro, the Nobel laureate and author of \u201cRemains of the Day\u201d and \u201cNever Let Me Go,\u201d first undertook fiction writing in his 20s, his first novel, 1982's \u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d was inspired by his mother's stories, and his own distance from them. Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki but, when he was 5, moved to England with his family.",
      "\u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d marked the start to what's become one of the most lauded writing careers in contemporary literature. And, now, like most of Ishiguro's other novels, it's a movie, too.",
      "Kei Ishikawa's film by the same name premiered Thursday at the Cannes Film Festival in its Un Certain Regard section. The 70-year-old author has been here before; he was a member of the jury in 1994 that gave \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d the Palme d'Or. \u201cAt the time it was a surprise decision,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people booed.\u201d",
      "Ishiguro is a movie watcher and sometimes maker, too. He penned the 2022 Akira Kurosawa adaptation \u201cLiving.\u201d Movies are a regular presence in his life, in part because filmmakers keep wanting to turn his books into them. Taika Waititi is currently finishing a film of Ishiguro's most recent novel, \u201cKlara and the Sun\u201d (2021).",
      "Ishiguro likes to participate in early development of an adaptation, and then disappear, letting the filmmaker take over. Seeing \u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d turned into an elegant, thoughtful drama is especially meaningful to him because the book, itself, deals with inheritance, and because it represents his beginning as a writer.",
      "\u201cThere was no sense that anyone else was going to reread this thing,\u201d he says. \u201cSo in that sense, it\u2019s different to, say, the movie of \u2018Remains of the Day\u2019 or the movie of \u2018Never Let Me Go.\u2019\u201d",
      "Remarks have been lightly edited.",
      "ISHIGURO: Often people think I\u2019m being unduly modest when I say I want the film to be different to the book. I don\u2019t want it to be wildly different. But in order for the film to live, there has to be a reason why it\u2019s being made then, for the audience at that moment. Not 25 years ago, or 45 years ago, as in the case of this book. It has to be a personal artistic expression of something, not just a reproduction. Otherwise, it can end up like a tribute or an Elvis impersonation.",
      "Whenever I see adaptations of books not work, it\u2019s always because it\u2019s been too reverential. Sometimes it\u2019s laziness. People think: Everything is there in the book. The imagination isn\u2019t pushed to work. For every one of these things that\u2019s made it to the screen, there\u2019s been 10, 15 developments that I\u2019ve been personally involved with that fell by the wayside. I always try to get people to just move it on.",
      "ISHIGURO: You can take two kind of approaches. You write a novel and that\u2019s the discrete, perfect thing. Other people can pay homage to it but basically that\u2019s it. Or you can take another view that stories are things that just get passed around, down generations. Even though you think you wrote an original story, you\u2019ve put it together out of other stuff that\u2019s come before you. So it\u2019s part of that tradition.",
      "I said Homer but it could be folktales. The great stories are the ones that last and last and last. They turn up in different forms. It\u2019s because people can change and adapt them to their times and their culture that these stories are valuable. There was a time when people would sit around a fire and just tell each other these stories. You sit down with some anticipation: This guy is going to tell it in a slightly different way. What\u2019s he going to do? It\u2019s like if Keith Jarrett sits down and says he\u2019s going to play \u201cNight and Day.\u201d So when you go from book to film, that\u2019s a fireside moment. That way it has a chance of lasting, and I have a chance of turning into Homer.",
      "ISHIGURO: I\u2019ve got a few centuries to go.",
      "ISHIGURO: I was between the age of 24 and 26. It was published when I was 27. I remember the circumstances very vividly. I can even remember writing a lot of those scenes. My wife, Lorna, was my girlfriend back then. We were both postgraduate students. I wrote it on a table about this size, which was also where we would have our meals. When she came in at the end of the day, I had to pack up even if I was at the crucial point of some scene. It was no big deal. I was just doing something indulgent. There was no real sense I had a career or it would get published. So it\u2019s strange all these years later that she and I are here and attended this premiere in Cannes.",
      "ISHIGURO: I think that\u2019s really insightful what you just said. There is a limit to how much understanding there can be between generations. What\u2019s needed is a certain amount of generosity on both sides, to respect each other\u2019s generations and the difference in values. I think an understanding that the world was a really complicated place, and that often individuals can\u2019t hope to have perspective on the forces that are playing on them at the time. To actually understand that needs a generosity.",
      "ISHIGURO: I wasn\u2019t like a journalist trying to get stuff out of my mother. There's part of me that was quite reluctant to hear this stuff. On some level it was kind of embarrassing to think of my mother in such extreme circumstances. A lot of the things she told me weren\u2019t to do with the atomic bomb. Those weren\u2019t her most traumatic memories.",
      "My mother was a great oral storyteller. She would sometimes have a lunch date and do a whole version of a Shakespeare play by herself. That was my introduction to \u201cHamlet\u201d or things like that. She was keen to tell me but also wary of telling me. It was always a fraught thing. Having something formal \u2014 \u201cOh, I\u2019m becoming a writer, I\u2019m going to write up something so these memories can be preserved\u201d \u2014 that made it easier.",
      "ISHIGURO: Someone said to me the other day, \u201cWe live in a time now where a lot of people would sympathize with the older, what you might call fascist views.\u201d It\u2019s not expressed overtly; the older teacher is saying it's tradition and patriotism.",
      "Now, maybe we live in a world where that\u2019s a good point, and that hadn\u2019t occurred to me. It\u2019s an example of: Yes, we write in a bubble and make movies in a kind of a bubble. But the power of stories is they have to go into different values.",
      "This question of how you pass stories on, this is one of the big challenges. You have to reexamine every scene. Some things that might have been a very safe assumption only a few years ago would not be because the value systems are changing around our books and films just as much as they\u2019re changing around us.",

      "CANNES, France -- You can get nostalgic about almost anything at the Cannes Film Festival, even Jerry Seinfeld on a zip line in a bumblebee costume.",
      "For many years, Cannes has played host not just to an endless stream of artistically ambitious movies, but also to some of Hollywood's most extreme promotional gambits. With so many films packed into the 12-day festival, and with much of the world watching, there are high stakes to standing out in Cannes.",
      "But in recent years, the Cannes marketing stunt has turned into an endangered species. Hopes that Tom Cruise might revive a dormant tradition passed with the relatively sedate premiere Wednesday of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning.\u201d",
      "Would Cruise parachute into the Palais? Could he ride an airplane wing to the premiere? Nothing so elaborate came to pass. Cruise and company walked the red carpet while serenaded by an orchestra playing the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d theme.",
      "Along the Croisette this year, there's a noticeable lack of the kind of grand advertisements Hollywood has often trotted out for the festival. Paramount Pictures has a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d installation outside the Carlton Hotel, but \u2014 as has been true for several years \u2014 Hollywood rarely still seeks to make big marketing splashes in Cannes.",
      "Even though Universal Pictures' upcoming Formula One action drama \u201cF1\u201d might seem like a natural fit, with the Monaco Grand Prix just days away, \u201cF1\u201d \u2014 at least so far \u2014 has made no pit stop in Cannes.",
      "Things could change. Cannes runs until May 24. Someone might yet arrive by parasail over the Mediterranean, as T.J. Miller did in 2017 for \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d or do ninja kicks with a troupe of giant pandas, as Jack Black did in 2008 for \u201cKung Fu Panda.\u201d",
      "But for years, the circus-like quality of Cannes has been in decline. That's owed partly to budgetary constraints and shifting marketing priorities for major studios. For Cruise and \u201cFinal Reckoning,\u201d Cannes was just one stop on a worldwide tour.",
      "Plus, some of those who were most devoted to bringing Hollywood entertainment to Cannes are no longer regulars here. While head of DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Katzenberg made sure his films left a mark in Cannes, whether with models wearing \u201cTrolls\u201d wigs or Seinfeld's \u201cBee Movie\u201d zip line.",
      "Is the absence of such things anything to lament? Probably not, but they did add to the crazy-things-will-happen nature of Cannes, giving the festival the feel of big tent extravaganza. It could be counted as one small, superficial way that movies aren't quite the carnivalesque show they once were.",
      "For now, though, we can say we'll always have when Sacha Baron Cohen, for \u201cThe Dictator,\u201d rode a camel down the Croisette. Ah, the memories.",

      "For powerful men in France\u2019s film industry, this was a week of reckoning",
      "PARIS -- For powerful men in France\u2019s film industry, this was a week of reckoning.",
      "G\u00e9rard Depardieu \u2014 the country\u2019s most famous actor \u2014 was convicted of sexual assault. Two days later, the Cannes Film Festival barred another actor accused of rape from walking the red carpet.",
      "Together, the decisions sent a message France had long resisted: that artistic brilliance may no longer shield those who abuse their power.",
      "For decades, Depardieu was revered as French cinema\u2019s \u201csacred monster\u201d \u2014 a towering talent whose gluttony, volatility, and magnetism became part of his myth. With more than 250 films to his name, many believed he would remain untouchable even after more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.",
      "Now, that myth has cracked. The verdict has revived a broader question France has ducked since the dawn of #MeToo: Can a country that celebrates seduction and irreverence finally hold its male icons to account?",
      "France has long lived its own #MeToo contradiction with a long-held belief in \u201cl\u2019exception culturelle.\u201d That talent, charm, or intellect forgives misconduct and the art excuses the artist. Catherine Deneuve has defended \u201cthe freedom to bother,\" while Brigitte Bardot has dismissed feminism outright: \u201cFeminism isn\u2019t my thing. I like men.\u201d",
      "But the ground is shifting \u2014 fast.",
      "Depardieu was handed an 18-month suspended sentence Tuesday for groping two women on a 2021 film set. He denies the charges and is appealing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the end of impunity of artists with a capital A,\u201d Carine Durrieu Diebolt, a lawyer for one of the two women who won their case against Depardieu, told The Associated Press. The verdict represented \u201ca bookend for putting actors on a pedestal because they were talented,\u201d she added.",
      "Two days later, the prestigious Cannes Film Festival barred actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy \u2014 accused of rape by three former partners \u2014 from attending the premiere of a film he stars in. Though the file was dropped for lack of evidence, the women are relaunching their case as a civil complaint.",
      "Navarro-Mussy denies wrongdoing. His lawyer said she\u2019s unaware of any ongoing proceedings against him.",
      "What stunned wasn\u2019t just the decision, but who made it. Cannes director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux had long been seen as emblematic of the old guard. He defended Roman Polanski for years and continued to screen his films despite the director\u2019s 1977 guilty plea in the U.S. for sex with a 13-year-old. In 2018, when asked why Cannes still included Polanski, Fr\u00e9maux said: \u201cThese are complicated matters.\u201d",
      "Fr\u00e9maux opened 2023's festival with a film starring Johnny Depp, despite the actor\u2019s highly public legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard over allegations of domestic abuse, in which he was never criminally charged. When asked about the backlash, Fr\u00e9maux replied: \u201cI only have one rule: it\u2019s the freedom of thinking, and the freedom of speech and acting within a legal framework.\u201d",
      "This week, the rules changed.",
      "\u201cThe Cannes decision is of course linked to the Depardieu verdict,\u201d said C\u00e9line Piques of Osez le f\u00e9minisme (\u201cDare Feminism!\u201d), a group that campaigns against sexual violence. \u201c(They\u2019ve) realized which way the wind is blowing. Fr\u00e9maux is trying to right the wrongs.\u201d",
      "Not everyone welcomed the verdict \u2014 or what followed \u2014 as a cultural turning point.",
      "Fanny Ardant, one of French cinema\u2019s grandes dames and a longtime friend of Depardieu, sat on his side in court. She is now directing him in a film in Portugal, despite the conviction.",
      "\u201cFanny Ardant? She completely missed the point,\u201d said Piques. \u201cShe downplayed the violence, normalized it. That\u2019s rape culture, plain and simple.\u201d",
      "Juliette Binoche, Cannes jury president and one of France\u2019s most respected actresses, struck a note of restraint: \u201cHe\u2019s not a monster. He\u2019s a man \u2014 one who has, apparently, been desacralized.\u201d",
      "In 2024, more than 22,000 rapes were reported in France. Fewer than 3% led to convictions. \u201cThe Depardieu verdict shows there\u2019s progress,\u201d said lawyer Anne-Sophie Laguens, who works with victims of sexual assault. \u201cBut for most women, the barriers to justice remain enormous.\u201d",
      "When Bertrand Cantat \u2014 frontman of Noir D\u00e9sir and once one of France\u2019s bestselling rock singers \u2014 launched a 2018 comeback tour, he had served just four years in prison for killing his partner, actress Marie Trintignant, during a violent assault.",
      "Despite public outrage, he returned to the stage and performed.",
      "\u201cThat would be unthinkable today,\u201d said Piques. \u201cThe public mood has changed. What we tolerate has changed.\u201d",
      "One breakthrough came not in cinema, but in a Bordeaux courtroom. The conviction of 51 men for drugging and raping Gisele Pelicot \u2014 a case long ignored despite her pleas \u2014 marked a turning point. For years, shame was hers. Now, it belongs to the perpetrators.",
      "\u201cIt proved rapists aren\u2019t just strangers in alleys,\u201d said Piques. \u201cThey\u2019re husbands. Colleagues. Respected men.\u201d",
      "Other recent convictions in entertainment included director Christophe Ruggia, who was convicted of abusing actress Ad\u00e8le Haenel when she was a minor, though he is appealing; and actor-director Nicolas Bedos, who was sentenced for sexual assault.",
      "Slowly but surely, yes. The system that long protected men like Depardieu is not yet dismantled, but it is shifting.",
      "As one of the actor\u2019s accusers said through tears after the ruling: \u201cI\u2019m very, very much satisfied with the decision. That\u2019s a victory for me, really. And a big progress, a step forward. I feel justice was made.\u201d",

      "The 69th Eurovision Song Contest is approaching its grand final in the Swiss city of Basel",
      "BASEL, Switzerland -- There has already been triumph and tears, singing onstage and in the streets, and a touch of political division, as the 69th Eurovision Song Contest approaches its grand final in the Swiss city of Basel.",
      "Musical acts from 26 countries will take the stage at the St. Jakobshalle arena on Saturday in a spectacular, sequin-drenched competition that has been uniting and dividing Europeans since 1956.",
      "Here\u2019s everything to know:",
      "Eurovision is competition in which performers from countries across Europe, and a few beyond it, compete under their national flags with the aim of being crowned continental champion. Think of it as the Olympics of pop music or the World Cup with singing instead of soccer.",
      "It\u2019s a celebration of silly fun and music\u2019s unifying power, but also a place where politics and regional rivalries play out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s biggest cultural event,\u201d said Dean Vuletic, an expert on the history of Eurovision. \u201cIt has been going on for almost 70 years and people love to watch it, not only for the show, for the glitter, the stage effects, the crazy costumes, but also because they like to see it as a reflection of the zeitgeist in Europe.\u201d",
      "Of 37 countries that sent performers to Eurovision, 11 were knocked out by public voting in semifinals on Tuesday and Thursday. Another six automatically qualified for the final: the host, Switzerland, and the \u201cBig Five\u201d that pay the most to the contest \u2014 France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.",
      "The 26 countries competing Saturday, in order of performance, are: Norway, Luxembourg, Estonia, Israel, Lithuania, Spain, Ukraine, the U.K, Austria, Iceland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Finland, Italy, Poland, Germany, Greece, Armenia, Switzerland, Malta, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, France, San Marino and Albania.",
      "Favorites, according to oddsmakers, are KAJ, representing Sweden with \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a jaunty serenade to the sauna. Dutch singer Claude is also highly rated with soulful ballad \u201cC\u2019est La Vie.\u201d Other favorites include classically trained Austrian countertenor JJ with his pop-opera song \u201cWasted Love,\u201d and Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, with her anthemic \u201cNew Day Will Rise.\u201d",
      "Eurovision has a reputation for campy europop with nonsense lyrics \u2014 past winners include \u201cLa, La, La\u201d and \u201cBoom Bang-a-Bang.\u201d But It has also produced some enduring pop classics. And it helped make stars of performers including ABBA \u2014 winners in 1974 with \u201cWaterloo\u201d \u2014 Celine Dion, Austrian drag performer Conchita Wurst and Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin.",
      "This year\u2019s finalists range from Lithuanian emo rockers Katarsis to a power ballad Spanish diva Melody and Ukrainian prog rockers Ziferblat.",
      "Campiness, humor and double entendres abound. \u201cEspresso Macchiato\u201d is a comic ode to Italian stereotypes performed by Estonia\u2019s Tommy Cash. Miriana Conte sings for Malta with the double entendre-filled \u201cServing\u201d -- performed on a set including a glitter ball and giant lips, it is classic Eurovision.",
      "It was once widely accepted that the most successful Eurovision songs were in English, but that is changing. This year\u2019s contest features songs in a record 20 languages, including Ukrainian, Icelandic, Latvian, Maltese and Armenian.",
      "Vuletic said viewers these days want \u201cmore authenticity in Eurovision entries.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t just want a standard pop song sung in English,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to also see something about the culture of the country that the song represents.\u201d",
      "Once all the acts have performed in the final, the winner is chosen by a famously complex mix of phone and online voters from around the world and rankings by music-industry juries in each of the Eurovision countries. As the results are announced, countries slide up and down the rankings and tensions build.",
      "Ending up with \u201cnul points,\u201d or zero, is considered a national humiliation.",
      "The final starts Saturday at 1900 GMT (3 p.m. EDT) and will be aired by national broadcasters in participating nations, on streaming service Peacock in the United States and in many countries on the Eurovision YouTube channel.",
      "During and immediately after the final, viewers in participating countries can vote by phone, text message or the Eurovision app \u2014 but not for their own country. Viewers in the U.S. and other nonparticipating countries can vote all day Saturday, online at www.esc.vote or with the app. The combined \u201crest of the world\u201d vote is given the weight of one individual country.",
      "The contest\u2019s motto is \u201cunited by music,\u201d but the world\u2019s divisions inevitably intrude.",
      "Russia was banned from Eurovision after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and since then Ukrainian musicians \u2014 including 2022 winner Kalush Orchestra \u2014 have competed under the shadow of war in the home country.",
      "This year\u2019s contest has been roiled for a second year by disputes over Israel\u2019s participation. Dozens of former participants, including Nemo, have called for Israel to be excluded over its conduct in the war against Hamas in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests have both taken place in Basel, though on a much smaller scale than at last year\u2019s event in Sweden.",
      "A handful of protesters attempted to disrupt a rehearsal by Israeli singer Raphael on Thursday with oversized flags and whistles and were escorted from the arena. Organizers say they have tightened security ahead of the final.",

      "A jury found Hadi Matar, 27, guilty of attempted murder and assault in February.",
      "Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said he will request the maximum 25 years in prison for the Aug. 12, 2022, attack on Rushdie and seven years for injuring a second man who was on stage with the author. The sentences must run concurrently because both victims were injured in the same event, he said.",
      "Rushdie is not expected to return to court for his assailant's sentencing, the prosecutor said. During the trial, the 77-year-old author was the key witness, describing how he believed he was dying when a masked attacker plunged a knife into his head and body more than a dozen times as he was being introduced at the Chautauqua Institution to speak about writer safety.",
      "Rushdie spent 17 days at a Pennsylvania hospital and more than three weeks at a New York City rehabilitation center. The author of \u201cMidnight's Children,\u201d \u201cThe Moor\u2019s Last Sigh\" and \u201cVictory City\u201d detailed his recovery in his 2024 memoir, \u201cKnife.\u201d",
      "Matar next faces a federal trial on terrorism-related charges. While the first trial focused mostly on the details of the knife attack itself, the next one is expected to delve into the more complicated issue of motive.",
      "Authorities said Matar, a U.S. citizen, was attempting to carry out a decades-old fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death when he traveled from his home in Fairview, New Jersey, to target Rushdie at the summer retreat about 70 miles (112.6 kilometers) southwest of Buffalo.",
      "Matar believed the fatwa, first issued in 1989, was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa after publication of Rushdie's novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. Rushdie spent years in hiding, but after Iran announced it would not enforce the decree he traveled freely over the past quarter century.",
      "Matar pleaded not guilty to a three-count indictment charging him with providing material to terrorists, attempting to provide material support to Hezbollah and engaging in terrorism transcending national boundaries.",
      "Video of the assault, captured by the venue's cameras and played at trial, show Matar approaching the seated Rushdie from behind and reaching around him to stab at his torso with a knife. As the audience gasps and screams, Rushdie is seen raising his arms and rising from his seat, walking and stumbling for a few steps with Matar hanging on, swinging and stabbing until they both fall and are surrounded by onlookers who rush in to separate them.",
      "Jurors in Matar's first trial delivered their verdict after less than two hours of deliberation.",

      "The Weeknd's first feature film is a surrealist vanity project, writes Associated Press Music Writer Maria Sherman",
      "NEW YORK -- It's the final night of tour. SoFi Stadium, just outside Los Angeles, is packed. 80,000 fans stand before The Weeknd, an endless sea of blinding lights. The bestselling artist born Abel Tesfaye emerges onstage. He launches into the first song. Less than a minute goes by, and the unthinkable happens: His voice cracks. And then it is gone.",
      "That September night in 2022 marked a turning point for Tesfaye. He mines the scene in \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow, \u201d where, ironically, it arrives too late. The tedium of an incoherent first act paints the charismatic performer \u2014 one of the last few decades' most popular \u2014 as an unempathetic protagonist in a nonlinear and nonsensical world.",
      "But how much of The Weeknd is here, really? In his first leading role in a feature film, directed by Trey Edward Shults, Tesfaye plays a fictionalized version of himself, an insomniac musician (as made explicitly clear in the \u201cWake Me Up\u201d leitmotif, where he sings, \u201cSun is never rising / I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s day or night\u201d). He's marred by a recent breakup from an ex portrayed in a cruel voicemail message (\u201cI used to think you were a good person,\u201d she says) and a hedonistic lifestyle, instigated by his superficial friend-manager Lee, played Barry Keoghan.",
      "Shortly after Tesfaye loses his voice, a psychosomatic ailment, he meets superfan Amina, portrayed by Jenna Ortega. She offers temporary comfort and, in return, is afforded no agency. She exists for him. Soon, the uninspired horrors begin, culminating in what recalls the torture scene in \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d with less violence. Instead, Amina \u2014 when she is not weeping; I urge all viewers to keep a \u201ccry count\u201d and consider what feminist blogs might have to say \u2014 lip-syncs some of The Weeknd's biggest hits back to him, explaining that they're all about \u201cemptiness and heartbreak.\u201d Woven throughout is some conversation about absent fathers and fear of abandonment, with unearned delivery and first-draft acuity \u2014 something gesturing at depth without piercing the surface.",
      "According to press materials, Amina and Lee are not real people but representations of Tesfaye. She is meant to represent Tesfaye's disconnected, \u201cdeeper emotional self\u201d \u2014 and Lee, his public persona. That is not made explicitly clear in the film, except in a very generous reading of the ending. Subtext only works when there is context to back it up, otherwise, you are left with \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d: an exciting vanity project with surrealist imagination but stiff writing, no stakes, limited emotional weight and an unclear narrative.",
      "That won't be an issue for superfans, of course \u2014 those intimately familiar with The Weeknd's music and career. This film appears to be for them and Tesfaye, a producer, alone; they have the framework in which to enjoy the runtime. Considering that fandom is the dominant form of popular culture, it's not a bad business decision.",
      "And it's worked for him before. This is not Tesfaye\u2019s first foray into acting. Aside from his cameo in \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d he starred in HBO\u2019s 2023 series \u201cThe Idol. \u201d He co-created the show with Sam Levinson, a show that similarly presented unearned provocation. At the time, \u201cThe Idol\u201d received criticism for its sadomasochistic storytelling that emerged after a shift away from \u201cthe female perspective,\u201d allegedly a request from Tesfaye. It was not a clever or subversive show, nor was it really even about anything, but it did inspire conversation. It's easy to see how \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d may have similar effects.",
      "In a moment where autobiographical films about musicians are playful and creative \u2014 Pharrell Williams' Lego partnership \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d comes to mind, as does Robbie Williams' \u201c Better Man \u201d \u2014 \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d feels like a misstep for those outside The Weeknd's most devoted. Of course, the film does not identify as a biopic. But it could've benefited from less self-seriousness. And editing.",
      "But what about the music? \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d is connected to Tesfaye's latest album of the same name \u2014 and the final chapter in The Weeknd\u2019s record-breaking trilogy that began with 2020\u2019s \u201cAfter Hours\u201d and continued with 2022\u2019s \u201cDawn FM.\u201d The album, the quietest of the series, worked as an allegory on the trials of fame \u2014 a topic long covered by the most successful purveyors of pop. Retrospectively, it works best as a film's soundtrack than a stand-alone record, ambitious. Like the movie, it gestures at criticism of the celebrity-industrial complex without accomplishing it. It seems obvious, now, to learn that the movie predates the record.",
      "The film's strength far and away is its score, composed by Tesfaye with Daniel Lopatin (better known as the experimental electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never and for his \u201cGood Time\u201d and \u201cUncut Gems\u201d scores). It builds from Tesfaye's discography and morphs into something physical and psychedelic \u2014 at its most elated, dread-filled and clubby. It is so affecting, it almost distracts from moments of dizzying cinematography, with the films' penchant for spinning frames, zooms into upside skylines, blurred vision and erratic lights.",
      "Those tools feel better suited for a music video, the kind of sophisticated visual world Tesfaye has developed in his pop career. They elevate his euphoric, layered, evocative dance-pop, but they do not translate in this film.",
      "\u201cHurry Up Tomorrow,\u201d a Lionsgate release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language throughout, drug use, some bloody violence and brief nudity. Running time: 105 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "Strouse turned out such popular \u2014 and catchy \u2014 show tunes as \"Tomorrow,\" the optimistic anthem from \"Annie,\" and the equally cheerful \"Put on a Happy Face\" from \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" his first Broadway success.",
      "\"I work every day. Activity \u2014 it's a life force,\" the New York-born composer told The Associated Press during an interview on the eve of his 80th birthday in 2008. \"When you enjoy doing what you're doing, which I do very much, I have something to get up for.\"",
      "Deep into his 90s, he was visiting tours of his shows and meeting casts. Jenn Thompson, who appeared in the first \u201cAnnie\u201d as Pepper and directed a touring version of \u201cAnnie\u201d in 2024, recalls Strouse coming to auditions and shedding a tear when a young girl sang \u201cTomorrow.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was tearing up and he put his hand on mine,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd he leaned in to me and very quietly said, \u2018That was you. That used to be you.\u2019 And I thought I would die. I thought my heart would drop out of my shoes.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cHe\u2019s so gorgeously generous and kind. He has always been that way.\u201d",

      "Bono has a seaside villa that\u2019s a short trip away from Cannes",
      "CANNES, France -- Cannes is a short trip from Bono\u2019s seaside villa in Eze-sur-Mer. He bought it with The Edge in 1993, and considers himself grateful to a coastline that, he says, gave him a \u201cdelayed adolescence.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can tell you I\u2019ve slept on beaches close to here,\u201d Bono says with a grin. \u201cI\u2019ve woken up in the sun.\u201d",
      "But that doesn't mean the Cannes Film Festival is a particularly familiar experience for the U2 frontman. He\u2019s here to premiere the Apple TV+ documentary \u201cBono: Stories of Surrender,\u201d which captures his one-man stage show. Before coming, Bono\u2019s daughter, the actor Eve Hewson, gave him some advice.",
      "\u201cShe said: \u2018Just get over yourself and bring it,\u2019\" Bono said in an interview on a hotel off the Croisette. \"What do I have to bring? Bring yourself and your gratitude that you\u2019re a musician and they\u2019re allowing you into a festival that celebrates actors and storytellers of a different kind. I said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll try to bring it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Besides, Cannes, he notes, was founded amid World War II as an alternative to then-Mussolini controlled Venice Film Festival. It was, he says, \u201cdesigned to find fascists.\u201d",
      "Shifts in geopolitical tectonics was much on Bono's mind. He has spent much of his activist life fighting for aid to Africa and combating HIV-AIDS. U.S. President Donald Trump's dismantling of USAID has reversed much of that.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s irrational is taking pleasure in the defacement of these institutions of mercy,\u201d Bono said.",
      "\u201cBono: Stories of Surrender,\u201d an Andrew Dominik-directed black-and-white film that begins streaming May 30, adapts the one-man stage show that, in turn, came from Bono's 2022 book, \u201cSurrender: 40 Songs, One Story.\u201d",
      "In the film, Bono is self-effacing and reflective, sifting through the formative influence of his father, U2's skyrocketing to fame and considering how ego and social work might be related. He calls it \u201cthe tall tales of a short rock star.\u201d And as was the case on a recent sunny afternoon in Cannes, Bono makes a captivating raconteur.",
      "Remarks have been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "BONO: Well, that\u2019s right. Globalization did very well for the world\u2019s poor. That and increased aid levels brought a billion people out of extreme poverty and halved childhood morality \u2014 remarkable jumps for quality of life for human beings.",
      "But it\u2019s also fair to say certain communities really paid the price for that \u2014 here in Europe, in the United States. And I\u2019m not sure those communities were credited enough for weathering storms that globalization brought. So I understand how we got to this place, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the right place to be in.",
      "Nationalism is not what we need. We grew up in a very charged atmosphere in Ireland. It makes you suspicious of nationalism and those animal spirits that can be drummed up. This is me speaking about surrender, \u201cStories of Surrender,\u201d at a time when the world has never been closer to a world war in my lifetime. At first I think it looks absurd, a bit ridiculous \u2014 now that has never stopped me in the past \u2014 but I think it\u2019s OK to look ridiculous for these ideas. Like surrender, nonviolence, peace.",
      "BONO: The new pope, he does look like a pope. That\u2019s a good start. I just saw the other day his first piece and he was talking about stopping shouting, God might prefer whispers. I thought, \u201cOh, this could be interesting.\u201d I\u2019m more of a shouter myself. I come from punk rock. But I\u2019m learning to turn that shout into a whisper in this film to get to an intimacy.",
      "BONO: Well, the accuracy of the put-down \u2014 \u201cYou are a baritone who thinks he\u2019s a tenor\u201d \u2014 is so all encompassing. I was going to call the play \u201cThe Baritone Who Thinks He\u2019s a Tenor.\u201d He\u2019s on my mind because he\u2019s the reason I sing.",
      "It\u2019s a wound that will never close because after playing him on stage for all those nights \u2014 just by turning left or right \u2014 I always loved him but I started to really like him. He started to make me laugh. There was a gift, as well as the voice, that he left me. Would he forgive me for impersonating him in the Teatro di San Carlo, a sacred place for tenors, probably not. But here I am impersonating an actor, so.",
      "BONO: Mission creep. I knew I had to write the book. The play was so I didn\u2019t have to tour the book in normal promotional activity, that I could actually have fun with it and play all the different characters in my life. I thought it was really good fun. Then I realized: Oh, there\u2019s parts of you that people don\u2019t know about. We don\u2019t go to U2 shows for belly laughs. But that\u2019s a part of who I am, which is the mischief as well as the melancholy.",
      "Then you end up doing a play with a lot of cameras in the way. Enter Andrew Dominik and he taught me something that I didn\u2019t really understand but my daughter does: The camera really knows when you\u2019re lying. So if want to tell this story, you better get ready to take your armor off. You\u2019re going to feel naked in front of the whole school, but that\u2019s what it takes.",
      "BONO: Based on my behavior just in the past week, the answer to that question is probably: Must try harder. The pilgrim\u2019s lack of progress. I would say that I understand a little better where I came from and that where I end up depends on how I deal with that.",
      "I\u2019ve been calling it the hall of mirrors, when you try to figure out who you are and who\u2019s behind the face. Then you just see all these faces staring back at you, and they\u2019re all true. The real star of this movie is my dad. I sort of like him better than I like myself because humor has become so important to me. It\u2019s not like everything needs to be a belly laugh, but there\u2019s a freedom. People like me, we can sing about freedom. It\u2019s much better to be it.",
      "BONO: There\u2019s a minister from Albania who said something that really stuck with me. She said: If you have a chance to hope, it\u2019s a moral duty because most people don\u2019t. So, yes, I feel we\u2019ll figure our way out of this. This is a scary moment.",
      "I think acknowledging that we can lose all we\u2019ve gained is sobering but it may be course-changing. I just believe in people enough. I believe in Americans enough. I\u2019m an Irish person, I can\u2019t tell people how to vote.",
      "I can tell you that a million children dying because their life support systems were pulled out of the wall, with glee, that\u2019s not the America that I recognize or understand. You\u2019re on the front lines of Europe here. America came in and saved the day. Ironically, so did Russia. More people died from Russia fighting the Nazis than everybody else. Now they tread on their own sacred memories by treading on the Ukrainians who also died on the front lines. I think part of that is that history didn\u2019t acknowledge it.",
      "I believe there is integrity in the Russian people. They need to change their leader, in my view. I believe there is integrity in the Americans. They will figure it out. Who was it who said: If you give Americans the facts, they will eventually make the right choice. Right now, they\u2019re not getting the facts. Think of it: a 70% decline in HIV-AIDS, Republican-led, Democratically followed though. The greatest health intervention in the history of medicine to fight HIV-AIDS has been thrown away. It was nearly there. To a space traveler, it\u2019s like getting to Mars and going, \u201cNah, we\u2019ll go back.\u201d It\u2019s bewildering to me.",

      "Hundreds of writers, editors and publishers have gathered for PEN America\u2019s annual gala hosted by Amber Ruffin and featuring a tribute to actor-publisher Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amber Ruffin looked out upon hundreds of writers, publishers and editors gathered for PEN America's annual gala and shared her experience of being on the receiving end of censorship.",
      "\u201cI'm officially a banned book,\u201d the comic-writer joked, referring to her being dropped as a speaker at April's White House Correspondents Dinner. \u201cThey booked me and then they banned me.\u201d",
      "Thursday night's event at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City was a protest against the suppression of speech and a celebration of being permitted to say what you pleased.",
      "Ruffin presided over a dinner-fundraiser that included a tribute to actor-publisher-bibliophile Sarah Jessica Parker, imprisoned Egyptian poet-songwriter-activist Galal El-Behairy, Wesleyan University President Michael Roth and Macmillan CEO Jon Yaged.",
      "One of the biggest ovations was for a non-speaker, Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who during a White House meeting in February challenged President Donald Trump over her support for transgender athletes, When Trump suspended funds for a Maine child nutrition program, Mills sued in federal court and prevailed.",
      "PEN America, the century-old free speech organization, brought in Ruffin to host soon after the WHCA withdrew its invitation, contending it wanted to focus on the achievements of journalism. Ruffin is a blunt and sometimes profane critic of Trump and duly went after him Thursday, calling him \u201cgross,\" \u201cincompetent,\u201d \u201cracist\u201d and \u201csexually deviant.\u201d She also praised PEN for the chance to speak out.",
      "\u201cThank you to PEN America for asking me to host and more importantly, thank you, PEN America, for Googling me at least once before asking me to host,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking at you, White House Correspondents Association.\u201d",
      "Parker was presented the PEN/Audible Literary Service Award, given in previous years to Patti Smith, Robert Caro and Stephen Sondheim among others.",
      "Parker has been a longtime champion of books and literacy and runs the publishing imprint SJP Lit, where authors include Lucy Caldwell, Linda Grant and Elysha Chang. At the Sundance Film Festival in January, she premiered a documentary film for which she served as executive producer, \u201cThe Librarians,\u201d about the fight against book bans.",
      "\u201cTo censor a book is to limit imagination, curiosity, connection, empathy and inspiration,\u201d Parker said during her acceptance speech. \"Libraries aren't just buildings with shelves. They are a beacon. They are warm in the winter and cool in summer, and they are sanctuaries of possibility. They are a heartbeat of the neighborhood.\"",
      "El-Behairy, who has been imprisoned off and on since 2018 on charges of terrorism and \u201cspreading false news,\u201d won the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award, given to dissidents who have been jailed. The prize was accepted by his sister, Naiera, and father, Abdelfattah, who noted his son \"paid the price for his opposition with the best years of his life wasted in prison.\u201d",
      "Taye Diggs presented the Business Visionary award to Yaged and joked that he liked the Macmillan executive because he didn't publish his children's books just because Diggs was an extremely handsome and successful Black actor.",
      "Wesleyan President Michael S. Roth, a leading critic of Trump\u2019s threats to cancel research funding at Columbia University and other schools, won the PEN/Benenson Courage Award. During a speech that was loudly cheered, he remembered a happy, outspoken and admittedly privileged childhood during which threats to democracy were rarely considered.",
      "\u201cWe are going to have to draw on love and support if we are to resist the slide towards authoritarianism that has gathered momentum across the land,\" Roth said.",
      "PEN is still recovering from a tumultuous 2024. Allegations that leadership was reluctant to criticize Israel's invasion of Gaza and slow to respond to the suffering of Palestinians, including Palestinian writers and journalists, led to so many writers withdrawing from PEN's spring awards ceremony and World Voices festival that both were canceled. PEN CEO Suzanne Nossel departed at the end of the year and a permanent replacement has not yet been announced.",
      "The awards night and World Voices returned this month, although with reminders of the ongoing war in Gaza. Several prize nominees withdrew from competition, including two of the five finalists for the $75,000 Jean Stein Book Award for a work of \u201coriginality, merit, and impact.\u201d The daughters of Stein, the late author, editor and philanthropist, decided the prize money would be donated to the Palestine Children's Relief Fund and to Palestine Legal, a U.S.-based defense organization.",

      "Federal health officials will no longer routinely approve annual COVID-19 shots for younger adults and children who are healthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Annual COVID-19 shots for healthy younger adults and children will no longer be routinely approved under a major new policy shift unveiled Tuesday by the Trump administration.",
      "Top officials for the Food and Drug Administration laid out new requirements for access to yearly COVID shots, saying they'd continue to use a streamlined approach that would continue offering them to adults 65 and older as well as children and younger adults with at least one health problem that puts them at higher risk.",
      "But the FDA framework urges companies to conduct large, lengthy studies before tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people. In a framework published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, agency officials said the approach still could keep annual vaccinations available for between 100 million and 200 million people.",
      "The upcoming changes raise questions for people who may still want a fall COVID-19 shot but don't clearly fit into one of the categories.",
      "\u201cIs the pharmacist going to determine if you're in a high-risk group?\u201d asked Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cThe only thing that can come of this will make vaccines less insurable and less available.\u201d",
      "The framework is the culmination of a series of recent stepsscrutinizing the use of COVID shots and raising major questions about the broader availability of vaccines under President Donald Trump. It was released two days ahead of the first meeting of FDA\u2019s outside vaccine experts under the Trump administration.",
      "Last week the FDA granted full approval of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine but with major restrictions on who can get it \u2014 and Tuesday's guidance mirrors those restrictions. The approval came after Trump appointees overruled FDA scientists' earlier plans to approve the shot without restrictions.",
      "Pfizer and Moderna, which make the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines, didn't immediately comment.",
      "For years, federal health officials have told most Americans to expect annual updates to COVID-19 vaccines, similar to the annual flu shot. Just like with flu vaccines, until now the FDA has approved updated COVID shots when manufacturers provide evidence that they spark just as much immune protection as the previous year's version.",
      "But FDA's new guidance appears to be the end of that approach under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has filled the FDA and other health agencies with outspoken critics of the government\u2019s handling of COVID shots, particularly their recommendation for young, healthy adults and children. Under federal procedures, the FDA releases new guidance in draft form and allows the public to comment before finalizing its plans. The publication of Tuesday's policy in a medical journal is highly unusual and could run afoul of federal procedures, according to FDA experts.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s update, written by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and FDA vaccine chief Vinay Prasad, criticized the U.S.\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach and states that the U.S. has been \u201cthe most aggressive\u201d in recommending COVID boosters, when compared with European countries.",
      "\u201cWe simply don\u2019t know whether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had Covid-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a Covid-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Makary and Prasad recommended that companies study people not deemed at high risk for six months, randomly assigning them to get a vaccine or a placebo and tracking outcomes with special attention to severe disease, hospitalization or death.",
      "Experts say there are legitimate questions about how much everyone still benefits from yearly COVID vaccination or whether they should be recommended for people at increased risk.",
      "An influential panel of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to debate which vaccines should be recommended to which groups.",
      "The FDA's announcement appears to usurp that advisory panel's job, Offit said. He added that CDC studies have made clear that booster doses do offer protection against mild to moderate illness for four to six months after the shot even in healthy people.",

      "The outbreak was detected as part of a follow-up inspection in April to a 2024 outbreak that sickened 551 people and led to 155 hospitalizations in 34 states and Washington, D.C. In that outbreak, investigators found salmonella bacteria linked to many of the illnesses in untreated canal water used at farms operated by Bedner Growers and Thomas Produce Company.",
      "In the current outbreak, officials found salmonella bacteria from samples on the farm that matched samples from people who got sick.",
      "Health officials are investigating where the potentially contaminated cucumbers were distributed. Several people who fell ill ate cucumbers on cruise ships leaving ports in Florida, according to the CDC. Organic cucumbers are not affected, officials said.",
      "Retailers should notify consumers who may have bought the tainted produce. If consumers don't know the source of cucumbers, they should throw them away, officials said.",

      "The move, announced Monday by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, would affect about 152,000 people in Nebraska enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps families pay for groceries.",
      "\u201cThere's absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks,\u201d Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said in a statement. \u201cSNAP is about helping families in need get healthy food into their diets, but there's nothing nutritious about the junk we're removing with today's waiver.\u201d",
      "Six other states \u2014 Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Indiana, Iowa and West Virginia \u2014 have also submitted requests for waivers banning certain foods and drinks or, in some cases, expanding access to hot foods for participants, according to the USDA.",

      "Details of Nebraska's waiver, which takes effect Jan. 1, weren't immediately available. Anti-hunger advocates criticized it, saying it adds costs, boosts administrative burdens and increases stigma for people already facing food insecurity.",
      "The waiver \u201cignores decades of evidence showing that incentive-based approaches \u2014 not punitive restrictions \u2014 are the most effective, dignified path to improving nutrition and reducing hunger,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino, a deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "SNAP is a roughly $100 billion program that serves about 42 million Americans and is run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and administered through states.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Investigators on Monday were combing through the writings of a 25-year-old man believed responsible for an explosion that ripped through a Southern California fertility clinic over the weekend.",
      "The FBI identified Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the apparent car bomb detonation Saturday that damaged the American Reproductive Centers building in Palm Springs, east of Los Angeles. Bartkus died in the explosion. None of the facility's embryos were damaged.",
      "Authorities called the attack terrorism and said Bartkus left behind nihilistic writings that indicated views against procreation, an idea known as anti-natalism.",
      "Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The blast gutted the clinic and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Passersby described a loud boom, with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along sidewalks of the upscale desert city.",
      "Bartkus' body was found near a charred vehicle.",
      "Akil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles field office, called it possibly the \u201clargest bombing scene that we\u2019ve had in Southern California.\u201d",
      "The facility was closed for the day.",
      "\u201cThis was a targeted attack against the IVF facility,\u201d Davis said Sunday. \u201cMake no mistake: We are treating this, as I said yesterday, as an intentional act of terrorism.\u201d",
      "Authorities executed a search warrant in Bartkus' hometown of Twentynine Palms, a city of 28,000 residents northeast of Palm Springs with a large U.S. Marine Corps base.",
      "Bartkus tried to livestream the explosion, but the attempt failed, the FBI said.",
      "Authorities haven't shared specifics about the explosives used to make the bomb and where Bartkus may have obtained them.",
      "Scott Sweetow, a retired ATF explosives expert, said the amount of damage caused indicated that the suspect used a \u201chigh explosive\u201d similar to dynamite and TNT rather than a \u201clow explosive\u201d like gun powder.",
      "Those types of explosives are normally difficult for civilians to access, but increasingly people are finding ways to concoct explosives at home, he said.",
      "\u201cOnce you know the chemistry involved, it\u2019s pretty easy to get stuff,\u201d Sweetow said. \u201cThe ingredients you could get at a grocery store.\u201d",
      "The images of the aftermath also showed that the explosion appeared to blow from the street straight through the building and to the parking lot on the other side, something that could have been intentional or pure luck, Sweetow said. A part of the car was also blown through the building and landed in the back by a dumpster.",
      "Authorities are working to learn more about Bartkus\u2019 motives. They haven\u2019t said if he intended to kill himself in the attack or why he chose the specific facility.",
      "His writings communicated \u201cnihilistic ideations\u201d that were still being examined to determine his state of mind, said U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in the area. In general, nihilism suggests that life is meaningless.",
      "He appeared to hold anti-natalist views, which include a belief that it is morally wrong for people to bring children into the world. The clinic he attacked provides services to help people get pregnant, including in vitro fertilization and fertility evaluations.",
      "Some people with extreme anti-procreation views have a lack of purpose and a bleak feeling about their own lives \u201cand they diagnose society as suffering in a similar way that they are,\u201d said Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama. \u201cEssentially, they feel like we're all doomed, that it's all hopeless.\u201d",
      "That hopelessness is a way for attackers to rationalize their violent actions, Lankford said Monday.",

    "story": [
      "The announcement that Joe Biden has prostate cancer is the latest example of how the final chapters of his political career have been shaped by the disease",
      "WASHINGTON -- In Joe Biden\u2019s family, there\u2019s a saying that the three worst words anyone can hear are \u201cyou have cancer.\u201d",
      "One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumor. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease.",
      "Now it is the former president\u2019s turn. Biden\u2019s office disclosed his prostate cancer diagnosis over the weekend, saying it has already spread to his bones.",
      "Although the cancer can possibly be controlled with treatment, it is no longer curable. The announcement is a bitter revelation that a disease that has brought so much tragedy to Biden\u2019s life could be what ends it.",
      "\u201cCancer touches us all,\u201d Biden wrote on social media. \u201cLike so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.\u201d",
      "Even before the diagnosis, Biden's post-presidency was shadowed by questions about his health and whether he should have run for reelection. As questions about his fitness for office mounted, he abandoned the campaign and Donald Trump retook the presidency by defeating Kamala Harris. As the 82-year-old Biden works to safeguard his damaged political legacy, he'll also be fighting a disease that shaped the final chapters of his decades-long career.",
      "Biden was serving as Barack Obama's vice president when Beau died in 2015. He decided not to seek the Democratic nomination the following year, which helped clear a path for Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016.",
      "Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, said Biden wanted to \u201cchannel his grief into action and figure out how we can do better\u201d on treating cancer to \"make sure that other people didn\u2019t have to go through what he went through.\u201d",
      "The effort was formalized as a White House task force, with Biden in charge. After a few years out of office, Biden re-entered politics to campaign against Trump in 2020. The heartache from Beau's death was never far from the surface though. His eldest son had been Delaware's attorney general and often viewed as Biden's political successor.",
      "\u201cBeau should be the one running for president, not me,\u201d Biden said, a thought he echoed on many occasions.",
      "He made fighting cancer a focus for his presidency, resurrecting a \u201cmoonshot\u201d initiative to increase funding for research and improve treatment. He unveiled the initiative at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in 2022, echoing the Democratic icon's famous speech declaring that \u201cwe will go to the moon\u201d six decades earlier.",
      "\"Beating cancer is something we can do together,\" Biden said.",
      "By this point, he had already signed legislation known as the PACT Act to expand healthcare benefits for veterans. The law guarantees treatment for chronic illnesses blamed on burn pits, which were used to dispose of chemicals, tires, plastics, medical equipment and human waste on military bases.",
      "Biden left no doubt that he believed Beau\u2019s death resulted from his service with the National Guard in Iraq.",
      "\u201cWhen they came home, many of the fittest and best warriors that we sent to war were not the same \u2014 headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cMy son Beau was one of them.\u201d",
      "Denis McDonough, who led the Veterans Affairs Department under Biden, said the president didn't talk about Beau's death during policy discussions. But he said it was clear that Biden \u201cknew the experience that other families were having, and he was going to be damn sure that we weren\u2019t going to miss an opportunity to address that.\u201d",
      "McDonough recalled that Biden wanted the new law to take effect as quickly as possible.",
      "\u201cHe had an option to stretch it out,\" he said. \"He said no way.\u201d",
      "The following year, first lady Jill Biden had two cancerous lesions removed, one above her right eye and the other on her chest. They were both basal cell carcinoma.",
      "Learning of the diagnosis \u201cwas a little harder than I thought,\u201d she told The Associated Press during a trip to Africa.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m lucky,\" she said. \"Believe me, I am so lucky that they caught it, they removed it, and I\u2019m healthy.\u201d",
      "Biden's cancer diagnosis is not the first time that he's faced his own mortality.",
      "Months after ending his first presidential campaign in 1988, he collapsed in a New York hotel room. In his memoir \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d he described \u201clightning flashing inside my head, a powerful electrical surge \u2014 and then a rip of pain like I\u2019d never felt before.\u201d",
      "He had suffered a brain aneurysm that required surgery. Biden wrote that \u201cI had no real fear of dying. I\u2019d long since accepted the fact that life\u2019s guarantees don\u2019t include a fair shake.\u201d",
      "McDonough imagined that Biden would feel similarly about his current situation.",

      "Among other things, the treaty would guarantee that countries that share critical samples of viruses will receive any resulting tests, medicines and vaccines and give WHO up to 20% of such products to make sure poorer countries can have access to them.",

      "MILWAUKEE -- Feel like you can't focus? Like you'll never finish a book again? Like the only way to keep your mind and hands busy is to scroll on social media for hours?",
      "You're far from alone. One body of decades-long research found the average person's attention span for a single screen is 47 seconds, down from 2.5 minutes in 2004. The 24/7 news cycle, uncertainty about the state of the world and countless hours of screen time don\u2019t help, experts say.",
      "\u201cWhen my patients talk to me about this stuff there is often a feeling of helplessness or powerlessness,\u201d said Dr. Michael Ziffra, a psychiatrist at Northwestern Medicine. \u201cBut you can change these behaviors. You can improve your attention span.\u201d",
      "Here are ways to start that process. As you read, challenge yourself to set a 2.5 minute timer and stay on this article without looking at another device or clicking away.",
      "A shifting attention is an evolutionary feature, not a bug. Our brains are hardwired to quickly filter information and hone in on potential threats or changes in what's happening around us.",
      "What's grabbing our attentions has changed. For our ancestors, it might have been a rustle in the bushes putting us on guard for a lurking tiger. Today, it could be a rash of breaking news alerts and phone notifications.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic warped many people's sense of time and increased their screen usage like never before, said Stacey Nye, a clinical psychologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.",
      "Technology isn't the only thing that influences our attention, experts say, but the effects of those pinging notifications or hours scrolling through 30-second long videos can build up over time.",
      "\u201cOur attention span has really been trained to only focus in those little, small blips and it interrupts our natural focus cycles,\u201d she said.",
      "Experts say \u201cactive\u201d breaks are among the best way to retrain your mind and your attention. They only take about 30 minutes, Nye said, and can be as simple as taking a walk while noticing things around you or moving to another room for lunch.",
      "Don't be afraid to get creative. Develop a list of alternative activities or randomly choose ideas out of a fish bowl. Try craft projects, a short meditation, fixing a quick meal or talking a walk outside. All the better if you can involve a friend as well.",
      "The break needs to be a physical or mental activity \u2014 no passive phone-scrolling.",
      "When the brain is understimulated and looking for change, it\u2019ll usually grab onto the first thing it sees. The smartphone, an \u201cever-producing change machine,\u201d is an enticing option, said Cindy Lustig, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Michigan.",
      "Turn off unnecessary notifications and put that \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode to good use, especially before bedtime. Better yet, put your phone in a whole different room, Lustig said.",
      "Multitasking may make you feel like you're getting more done, but brain experts recommend against it.",
      "\u201cBe a single tasker,\" Nye said. \u201cWork on one thing at a time, for a specified period of time and begin to work your way up.\u201d",
      "Lustig is a big fan of the \u201cPomodoro technique,\" in which you set a timer and work on something for 25 or 30 minutes before taking a five-minute break.",
      "She tells herself: \u201cI can do anything for this amount of time,\" and the world will still be waiting for her at the end.",
      "It's not enough to just have a hobby, Lustig said. It helps to choose hobbies that include deliberate practice and a goal to strive toward, whether it's playing guitar for an audience or improving in a sport.",
      "It helps to pick something that you enjoy as well.",
      "\u201cYou don't want to start with the heavy nonfiction or like \u2018War and Peace,\u2019\u201d Lustig said. \u201cIf you need to start with the romance novel, then start with the romance novel. You can work your way up.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also important to be kind to yourself. Everyone has good and bad days, and attention needs are different \u2014 and even vary from task to task.",
      "The key is to make an intentional effort, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt is in many ways similar to a muscle in the sense that we can build it up with practice and exercises,\u201d Ziffra said. \u201cConversely, it can weaken if we\u2019re not exercising it.\u201d",

Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.",
      "During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.",
      "That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural \u2014 maybe temporary \u2014 decline in cases.",
      "It's unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.",
      "What's more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested limited activity recently.",
      "New infections are still being detected in birds and cattle, but not as frequently as several months ago.",
      "\u201cGiven the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it\u2019s not surprising that human cases have declined as well,\u201d the CDC said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody\u2019s hiding anything,\u201d said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "But Osterholm and some other experts think it's likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.",
      "Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government\u2019s bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.",
      "Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.",
      "And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.",
      "Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said \"targeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office.\"",
      "She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward.",
      "\"I can\u2019t argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing,\u201d she said.",
      "The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.",
      "Earlier this month, an agency assessment said there is a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.",
      "Still, research is continuing.",
      "Texas A&M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July.",
      "Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms.",
      "\u201cWe have had very good participation,\u201d Douphrate said. \u201cThey have been very willing.\u201d",
      "Similar surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024.",
      "Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of the first signs that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 domestic cats infected with the virus across the U.S.",
      "Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu \u2014 or whether the virus can spill over into people.",
      "Coleman has been collecting blood samples from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus. But the process is slow and research funding is uncertain.",
      "\u201cIt's easy to downplay something because that's usually what humans do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we really need to be doing is ramping up.\u201d",

      "Infant twins suffered from malnutrition in Nigeria",
      "DIKWA, Nigeria -- Under the dappled light of a thatched shelter, Yagana Bulama cradles her surviving infant. The other twin is gone, a casualty of malnutrition and the international funding cuts that are snapping the lifeline for displaced communities in Nigeria\u2019s insurgency-ravaged Borno state.",
      "\u201cFeeding is severely difficult,\u201d said Bulama, 40, who was a farmer before Boko Haram militants swept through her village, forcing her to flee. She and about 400,000 other people at the humanitarian hub of Dikwa \u2014 virtually the entire population \u2014 rely on assistance. The military restricts their movements to a designated \u201csafe zone,\u201d which severely limits farming.",
      "For years, the United States Agency for International Development had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria, helping non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people. But this year, the Trump administration cut more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance around the world.",
      "Programs serving children were hit hard.",
      "Bulama previously lost young triplets to hunger before reaching therapeutic feeding centers in Dikwa. When she gave birth to twins last August, both were severely underweight. Workers from Mercy Corps enrolled them in a program to receive a calorie-dense paste used to treat severe acute malnutrition.",
      "But in February, Mercy Corps abruptly ended the program that was entirely financed by USAID. Two weeks later, one of the twins died, Bulama said.",
      "She has no more tears, only dread for what may come next.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to bury another child,\u201d she said.",
      "Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.",
      "He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.",
      "\u201cIt is very traumatic,\u201d said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno's capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. \u201cOne of the things is the threat to the lives of children.\u201d",
      "UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama's surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.",
      "Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.",
      "\u201cBefore the USAID cut, we made a lot of progress,\u201d said Ayuba Kauji, a health and nutrition supervisor. \u201cNow my biggest worry is high mortality. We don\u2019t have enough resources to keep up.\u201d",
      "Intersos was forced to reduce its staff from 30 to 11 in Dikwa after the USAID freeze. Its nutrition and health facilities now operate solely on support from the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, a smaller pot of money contributed by a few European countries. That funding will be finished in June.",
      "The crisis is equally acute in Maiduguri, where the economy is reeling from massive terminations of aid workers. At another Intersos-run facility, 10 of the 12 doctors have left and four nurses remain, with 50 new admissions of malnourished children per week.",
      "\u201cIt used to be far less,\u201d said Emmanuel Ali, one of the remaining doctors.",
      "The effects of the funding cuts extend far beyond nutrition. At the International Organization for Migration's reception center in Dikwa, thousands of displaced families and those escaping Boko Haram captivity are stranded. There are no new shelters being built and no support for relocation.",
      "\u201cBefore, organizations like Mercy Corps built mud-brick homes and rehabilitated damaged shelters to absorb people from the IOM reception center,\u201d said one official at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the situation. \u201cNow, that has stopped.\u201d",
      "Jensen, the U.N. humanitarian head in Maiduguri, said, \u201csadly, we are not seeing additional funding to make up for the U.S. cuts.\u201d He warned that vulnerable people could turn to risky ways of coping, including joining violent groups.",
      "The crisis in Nigeria is part of a larger reckoning. According to Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps' vice president for policy and advocacy, 40 of its 62 U.S.-funded programs with the potential to reach 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon and Gaza have been terminated.",
      "In Mozambique, where jihadist violence in the north has displaced over a million people since 2017, humanitarian organizations face steep shortfalls with \u201cdevastating\u201d effects on the needy, said Frederico Jo\u00e3o, chairman of the forum of NGOs in the region.",
      "More widely, the USAID funding cut compromises Mozambique's health sector, especially in HIV/AIDS care, said Inoc\u00eancio Impissa, cabinet spokesman. The government now seeks alternative funding to prevent total collapse of health systems.",

      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes toxic behavior at work and the kinds of treatment people won't tolerate for a steady paycheck",
      "NEW YORK -- One week into a new job, Lisa Grouette discovered something missing come Sunday night: the sinking feeling of dread she used to experience before going to work every Monday.",
      "Groutte spent 10 years at an insurance agency with a boss whom she alleges screamed at her, slammed his hands on the desk, insulted her appearance and punched things. He falsely accused her of taking money and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation if she quit, she says.",
      "Fearing she wouldn\u2019t land another job if she left the toxic workplace, she stayed. \u201cIt was this implied, \u2018You\u2019re stuck,'\" Grouette, 48, recalled.",
      "But eventually, she found a way out. When a full-time job opened up at a newspaper where she worked a part-time photography job, she resigned from the insurance agency. The new position paid $400 less per month, but Grouette reduced her expenses to make it work.",
      "\u201cYou can't put a price tag on it,\u201d she said. \"It was the best 400 bucks a month I've ever spent, worth every penny. I was a little tight at first, but it didn't matter because I was happy.\u201d",
      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes unhealthy behavior and the kinds of treatment people will not \u2014 or should not \u2014 tolerate for a steady paycheck.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re developing language now around things like toxic workplaces,\u201d said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts.",
      "Younger generations entering the workforce, including millennials and members of Generation Z, are less willing to endure bullying behavior from colleagues and managers, and better at establishing boundaries, she said.",
      "At the start of her own career, \u201cif I encountered toxicity in the workplace, I had more of a \u2018Suck it up\u2019 attitude,\" said Tosti-Kharas, who identifies as a member of Generation X. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were as vocal about taking care of our mental health as we should have been.\u201d",
      "Conflicts and difficult relationships may be inevitable in any work environment. But there's a difference between an occasional disagreement and persistent abuse.",
      "\u201cWhat makes something toxic: it\u2019s more pervasive, more consistent over time,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said. \u201cYou may have tried some things and it\u2019s not getting better. ... It\u2019s very deeply entrenched.\u201d",
      "Possible indications of an emotionally harmful workplace include a widespread lack of trust and fear of being shot down if you speak up, she said.",
      "Loud screamers aren't the only kind of toxic co-workers and supervisors. There are quieter forms of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior by leaders who use sarcasm, backhanded compliments, indirect criticism and exclusion to control their employees, according to Alana Atchison, a clinical psychologist based in Chicago.",
      "\u201cIt is a relationship where you can\u2019t communicate clearly or directly, so you have to silence yourself. You can\u2019t say truly what you need to say and feel safe,\u201d Atchison said.",
      "To spot a potentially toxic environment when applying for a new job, follow your gut instincts and consider warning signs. For example, frequent ads for the same position may reflect high turnover resulting from a negative environment. You can also search employee reviews online.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading Glassdoor reviews like crazy to see what the environment is like, what the culture is like, on anyplace I\u2019m applying to, because I can\u2019t lose my hair again over a job,\u201d said Grouette, who recently was laid off after several successful years at the newspaper.",
      "When on the receiving end of toxicity, consider whether the offending behavior says more about the person perpetuating it than the recipient.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a smokescreen to hide their deficits,\u201d Atchison said. \u201cIf someone feels insecure about their role or fears being overshadowed, they might resort to undermining others, gossiping or sabotaging projects to regain a sense of control or safety.\u201d",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison's clients have increasingly complained about toxic work environments. She attributes that in part to the social isolation that accompanied lockdowns and restrictions on public activities.",
      "\u201cSocializing is a skill set, and that skill set has declined,\" she said.",
      "If you find yourself in a toxic work situation, talking about it with a trusted friend or professional therapist can help you process what is happening and develop a plan to deal with it, instead of letting it fester in your mind.",
      "Stephanie Strausser, 42, a video production manager, said she sought support from friends and family members when she worked under an extreme micromanager who made her feel unsafe and whose decisions she considered unethical.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t hide it or keep it in. Talk to people. Even if you\u2019re talking to ChatGPT,\" Strausser advises those who find themselves in similar circumstances. \"Don\u2019t internalize it. And don\u2019t take someone\u2019s perception as fact.\u201d",
      "Amanda Szmuc, a Philadelphia lawyer who considers some of her past work environments to have been toxic, recommends documenting your concerns in case it becomes necessary to escalate them.",
      "Writing down the details of troubling interactions as they happen and keeping copies of inappropriate messages or approved meeting recordings may come in handy if the human resources department gets involved, for example.",
      "Maintaining a record may also help you avoid gaslighting and reinforce your determination to protect yourself.",
      "If leaving a toxic environment isn't financially possible or you want to try to make your circumstances more bearable, think about exploring ways to limit your interaction with the difficult party may be an option.",
      "Possibilities may include negotiating a role that puts distance between you and the toxic person, such as working different shifts or on different projects, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "You can also set deadlines for yourself to keep things from deteriorating, according to Szmuc. Examples: \u201cI\u2019m going to give this two weeks. Is there any improvement?\u201d she said. \u201cIs there a way internally where I can maybe change my circumstances or get someone else\u2019s opinion?\u201d",
      "Ideally, an employee who feels mistreated could appeal to someone from human resources or the offending employee's manager with evidence to show a pattern of conduct violations and disciplinary action would be taken, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "But that doesn't always happen, leaving the reporting party in close proximity with the person they reported. \u201cIn the real world, you may realize they are unlikely to go anywhere, and it\u2019s you who has to go somewhere,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "In extreme situations, it's best to look for another job, she said.",
      "If an inspector found radon in your house, \u201cyou wouldn't say, \u2018Let me try to work with the radon,\u2019 or \u2018How can I keep it there but maybe lessen the effects?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYou would get the toxin out of the situation or you would get yourself out of the situation.\u201d",
      "Most people can't afford to leave their jobs without another one lined up. Carving out time to apply for different jobs is difficult when you feel under assault but also is empowering and may lead to a better situation.",
      "\u201cIf somebody gives you an impression that you\u2019re not able to leave this job, that\u2019s just not true,\u201d Grouette said. \u201cThose sorts of people don\u2019t have the reach or respect that they claim to have, because if they\u2019re volatile to you, they\u2019re volatile to others.\u201d",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- The United Nations human rights office in Colombia warned Tuesday that five Indigenous groups in a storied mountain range face \u201cphysical and cultural\u201d extinction, a critical threat that stems from armed groups fighting over their territory and insufficient state protection.",
      "Scott Campbell, Colombia\u2019s representative for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement that the risk of physical and cultural extinction of Indigenous People of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is \"an ongoing tragedy that we can and must prevent.\u201d",
      "Campbell urged the Colombian government to protect the Kogui, Wiwa, Kankuamo, Arhuaco, and Ette Naka Indigenous groups, whose combined population is approximately 54,700 people.",
      "Campbell's statement followed a visit to the Sierra Nevada region, where U.N. officials spoke with representatives of these Indigenous tribes.",
      "\u201cThese groups are under various forms of cruel attack from non-state armed groups,\" Campbell said, highlighting the \u201cdevastating repercussions on their lives, their land, their territory, their self government...and their spirituality.\u201d",
      "In 2022, UNESCO added the ancestral knowledge of these Indigenous groups to its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list. The recognition highlights the \u201cfundamental role\u201d their traditions play in preserving the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta \u2014 a mountain range that emerges directly from the Caribbean Sea and boasts snowy peaks reaching nearly 6,000 meters.",
      "But for many years, the Indigenous people of the Sierra Nevada have been under attack from settlers, and now from rebel groups.",
      "Campbell said that rebel groups in the area are imposing curfews on Indigenous communities and interfering with their local assemblies. He added that hundreds of Indigenous people from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta have been forcibly displaced, while last year an Arhuaco community leader was murdered and a member of the Kogui tribe disappeared.",
      "Colombia\u2019s government has struggled to pacify rural areas where rebel groups and drug trafficking gangs fight for territory abandoned by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the large guerilla group that made peace with the government in 2016.",
      "President Gustavo Petro has launched peace talks with most of the nation\u2019s remaining rebel groups, but the negotiations have yielded few results so far.",
      "Campbell urged the government to protect Indigenous people in the Sierra Nevada not only through military force, but by providing better access to healthcare, education and employment opportunities.",
      "\u201cThe violent situation has its roots in disputes over control of territory, drug trafficking routes and various forms of illicit economic activity by non-state armed groups.\u201d Campell said.",

      "Japan\u2019s agriculture minister has resigned after making an inappropriate remark about buying rice",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's agriculture minister resigned Wednesday over his inappropriate remark about buying rice as the public struggles with record high prices of the country's traditional staple food.",
      "At a party seminar Sunday in Saga prefecture, Taku Eto said he \u201cnever had to buy rice\u201d because his supporters always give him the grain as gifts.",
      "The gaffe was seen as insensitive to the rice situation and could be further trouble for Ishiba\u2019s already struggling minority government before a national election in July.",
      "\u201cI made an extremely inappropriate remark at a time when consumers are struggling with soaring rice prices,\u201d Eto told reporters after handing in his resignation at the prime minister\u2019s office. Eto said Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted his resignation.",
      "\u201cI thought it is not appropriate for me to stay as head\u201d just as the government needs to tackle the rice price challenges, Eto said.",
      "Eto apologized to the people and also retracted his comment, saying he buys rice himself and was not living on rice gifts.",
      "Ishiba said he humbly accepts criticism as he bears responsibility for Eto\u2019s appointment. Media reports say Eto's successor will be popular former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi.",
      "Opposition parties had threatened to submit a no-confidence motion against him if Eto doesn\u2019t resign voluntarily by Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Japanese rice demand has decreased over decades as people's diet has diversified, but rice remains a staple food and integral part of Japanese culture and history.",
      "The shortfall started last August on panic buying following a government caution over preparedness for a major earthquake. The supply pressure eased after the autumn harvest, but a shortage and price increases hit again early this year.",

      "The unprecedented release from emergency rice stockpile was seen in part as an attempt to figure out distribution problems. The government has denied there is now a rice shortage, but officials say it's a mystery why rice is not reaching consumers. Some experts say it's because the shortage was so serious.",

      "A pack of veterinarians clamber over hefty metal crates of animals they load one-by-one onto a fleet of semi-trucks",
      "CULIACAN, Mexico -- A pack of veterinarians clambered over hefty metal crates on Tuesday morning, loading them one by one onto a fleet of semi-trucks. Among the cargo: tigers, monkeys, jaguars, elephants and lions \u2013 all fleeing the latest wave of cartel violence eclipsing the northern Mexican city of Culiacan.",
      "For years, exotic pets of cartel members and circus animals have been living in a small animal refuge on the outskirts of Sinaloa\u2019s capital. However, a bloody power struggle erupted last year between rival Sinaloa cartel factions, plunging the region into unprecedented violence and leaving the leaders of the Ostok Sanctuary reeling from armed attacks, constant death threats and a cutoff from essential supplies needed to keep their 700 animals alive.",
      "The aid organization is now leaving Culiacan and transporting the animals hours across the state in hopes that they\u2019ll escape the brunt of the violence. But fighting has grown so widespread in the region that many fear it will inevitably catch up.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen violence this extreme,\" said Ernesto Zazueta, president of the Ostok Sanctuary. \u201cWe\u2019re worried for the animals that come here to have a better future.\u201d",
      "Violence in the city exploded eight months ago when two rival Sinaloa Cartel factions began warring for territory after the dramatic kidnapping of the leader of one of the groups by a son of notorious capo Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n who then delivered him to U.S. authorities via a private plane.",
      "Since then, intense fighting between the heavily armed factions has become the new normal for civilians in Culiacan, a city which for years avoided the worst of Mexico\u2019s violence in large part because the Sinaloa Cartel maintained such complete control.",
      "\u201cWith the escalating war between the two factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, they have begun to extort, kidnap and rob cars because they need funds to finance their war,\u201d said security analyst David Saucedo. \u201cAnd the civilians in Culiacan are the ones that suffer.\u201d",
      "Zazueta, the sanctuary director, said their flight from the city is another sign of just how far the warfare has seeped into daily life.",
      "This week, refuge staff loaded up roaring animals onto a convoy as some trainers attempted to sooth the animals. One murmured in a soft voice as he fed a bag of carrots to an elephant in a shipping container, \u201cI\u2019m going to be right here, no one will do anything to you.\u201d",
      "Veterinarians and animals, accompanied by the Mexican National Guard, began traveling along the freeway to seaside Mazatlan, where they planned to release the animals into another wildlife reserve.",
      "The relocation came after months of planning and training the animals, a move made by the organization in an act of desperation. They said the sanctuary was caught in the crossfire of the warfare because of its proximity to the town of Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, a stronghold of Los Chapitos, one of the warring factions.",
      "During intense periods of violence, staff at the sanctuary can hear gunshots echoing nearby, the roar of cars and helicopters overhead, something they say scares the animals. Cartel fighting regularly blocks staff off from reaching the sanctuary, and some animals have gone days without eating. Many have started to lose fur and at least two animals have died due to the situation, Zazueta said.",
      "Complicating matters is the fact that an increasing number of the animals they rescue are former narco pets left abandoned in rural swathes of the state. In one case, a Bengal tiger was discovered chained in a plaza, caught in the center of shootouts. Urban legends circulate in Sinaloa that capos feed their enemies to pet lions.",
      "Diego Garc\u00eda, a refuge staff member, is among those who travel out to rescue those animals. He said he regularly receives anonymous threats, with callers claiming to know his address and how to find him. He worries he'll be targeted for taking away the former pets of capos. Zazueta said the refuge also receives calls threatening to burn the sanctuary to the ground and kill the animals if payment isn\u2019t made.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no safe place left in this city these days,\u201d said Garc\u00eda.",
      "That's the feeling for many in the city of 1 million. When the sun rises, parents check for news of shootouts as if it were the weather, to determine if it\u2019s safe to send their kids to school. Burned houses sit riddled with bullets and occasionally bodies appear hanging from bridges outside the city. By night, Culiacan turns into a ghost town, leaving bars and clubs shuttered and many without work.",
      "\u201cMy son, my son, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m not going to leave you alone,\u201d screamed one mother, sobbing on the side of the road and cursing officials as they inspected her son\u2019s dead body, splayed out and surrounded by bullet casings late Monday night. \u201cWhy do the police do nothing?\u201d she cried out.",
      "In February, while driving a refuge vehicle used for animal transport, Garc\u00eda said he was forced from the car by an armed, masked man in an SUV. At gunpoint, they stole the truck, animal medicine and tools used by the group for rescues and left him trembling on the side of the road.",
      "The breaking point for the Ostok Sanctuary came in March, when one of the two elephants in their care, Bireki, injured her foot. Veterinarians scrambled to find a specialist to treat her in Mexico, the United States and beyond. No one would brave the trip to Culiacan.",
      "\u201cWe asked ourselves, \u2018what are we doing here?\u2019\u201d Zazueta said. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk this happening again. If we don\u2019t leave, who will treat them?\u201d",
      "The concern by many is that Mexico\u2019s crackdown on the cartels will be met with even more violent power moves by criminal organizations, as has happened in the past, said Saucedo, the security analyst.",
      "Zazueta blames local government and security forces for not doing more, and said their pleas for help in the past eight months have gone unanswered.",
      "Sinaloa's governor's office did not immediately respond to a request comment.",
      "The sanctuary made the move without any public announcement, worried that they might face repercussions from local officials or the same cartels forcing them to flee, but they hope the animals will find some relief in Mazatlan after years of conflict.",
      "Garc\u00eda, the sanctuary staff member, is not so sure. While he hopes for the best, he said he\u2019s also watched cartel violence spread like a cancer across the Latin American country. Mazatlan, too, is also facing bursts of violence, though nothing compared to the Sinaloan capital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s at least more stable,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause here, today, it\u2019s just suffocating.\u201d",

      "Thomas Parker, from Cumbria in northwest England, was arrested on Jan. 21, at a villa near Kuta beach, a popular tourist spot, after he allegedly collected a package from a motorcycle taxi driver at a nearby street.",
      "According to the court document obtained by The Associated Press, Parker was noticed \u201cacting suspiciously\u201d by officers while he was collecting the package. He allegedly discarded it in a panic and fled when police approached him. He was traced back to the villa where he was staying and was arrested.",
      "The court document said a lab test result confirmed the package containing slightly over a kilogram (2.326 pounds) of methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA, the main ingredient in ecstasy.",
      "Parker was initially charged with drug trafficking and could have faced the death penalty by firing squad if found guilty.",
      "However, the trafficking charge was dropped after police investigators determined that the package was not directly linked to him.",
      "The case went unreported until authorities showed a handcuffed Parker at a news conference on March 6.",
      "During the police investigation, the 32-year-old electrician was able to prove that he did not order the package. It was sent by a drug dealer friend, identified only as Nicky, who Parker had known for around two years and spoke to regularly through the Telegram messaging app.",
      "During the trial that began last month, Parker told the court he initially refused to collect the package but later agreed to do it after Nicky assured him that the package was safe and would not put him in danger.",
      "Parker was told someone would pick it up shortly from him, his lawyer, Edward Pangkahila said. Parker was not promised money or anything else by Nicky in return, Pangkahila said.",
      "Authorities reduced the charge from trafficking to the less serious offense of hiding information from authorities. Prosecutors on May 6 sought a one-year prison term for Parker.",
      "However, under Indonesian legal system, judges have an important role as legal determinants in a trial. They could seek further charges if applicable laws are unclear or non-existent, meaning that the trafficking charge could be reinstated.",
      "Pangkahila said that Parker last met Nicky a year ago when he was on vacation in Thailand.",
      "As his friend was a dealer, Parker worried the package was filled with drugs. He panicked when he saw police officers on the street and and was approached by them, Pangkahila said.",
      "Wearing a white shirt and black trousers, Parker repeatedly expressed his remorse in his final plea on Tuesday and asked the panel of three judges in Denpasar District Court to consider his situation and impose a lenient sentence.",
      "\u201cI am very sorry and apologize, I know it was a mistake,\u201d Parker said, \u201cI promise not to repeat it again, because I really didn\u2019t know that (the package) was drugs.\u201d",
      "After Parker read out his plea, Presiding Judge Gusti Ayu Akhirnyani adjourned the trial until May 27, when the judges will read out their sentence in a verdict.",
      "\u201cUntil now, they (prosecutors) cannot prove that our client is a middleman or trafficker,\u201d Pangkahila said, \u201cHe has no connection with any drug network, we hope the judges will come to the same conclusion.\u201d",
      "He said his client is nervous and depressed as he faces trial.",
      "Indonesia has very strict drug laws and convicted traffickers can be executed by a firing squad.",

      "TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran\u2019s supreme leader on Tuesday pushed back against U.S. criticism of the country\u2019s nuclear program, saying that Tehran won\u2019t seek permission from anyone to enrich uranium and calling American statements \u201cnonsense.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018We won\u2019t allow Iran to enrich uranium.\u2019 That\u2019s way out of line,\u201d Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said during a memorial for late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash last year. \u201cNo one in Iran is waiting for their permission. The Islamic Republic has its own policies and direction \u2014 and it will stick to them.\u201d",
      "Khamenei\u2019s remarks came as indirect talks between Iran and the U.S. reportedly continue, though he expressed doubt about their outcome.",
      "\u201cYes, indirect negotiations were held during Raisi\u2019s time too, just like now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t go anywhere \u2014 and we don\u2019t expect much from the current ones either. Who knows what will happen.\u201d",
      "His comments reflect Tehran\u2019s growing frustration with the stalled nuclear discussions, as well as the broader tensions that have defined U.S.-Iran relations in recent years.",
      "Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei told the state-run IRNA news agency that \u201cno definitive decision has been made about the next round of negotiations,\u201d adding that \u201cthe Islamic Republic of Iran is reviewing the matter while considering the U.S. side\u2019s contradictory and constantly changing positions.\u201d",
      "IRNA also reported that Kazem Gharibabadi, the deputy foreign minister, said that Tehran had received a proposal regarding the next round of indirect talks with Washington and was currently reviewing it.",

      "TAIPEI -- China has long sought to intimidate Taiwan with its massive navy, air force and the world\u2019s largest standing army, but it\u2019s mere dinghies that are now causing the most consternation.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s coast guard has documented five cases totaling 38 Chinese citizens crossing the 160-kilometer (100-mile) wide Taiwan Strait separating the self-governing island democracy from the authoritarian Chinese mainland, according to the body's deputy director-general Hsieh Ching-chin.",
      "That includes at least one case posted to Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, in which a man speaking with a strong mainland Chinese accent is seen planting a Chinese flag on what he says is a Taiwanese beach. Scenes in the background appear to show a stretch of coastline south of the capital Taipei.",
      "China claims Taiwan as its own territory, to be conquered by force if necessary. The man has not been found or publicly identified, and Taiwanese authorities are seeking to ascertain whether he received help from anyone on the island.",
      "Another case involved a father and son who were apprehended shortly after reaching land, along with a man who came ashore at a fishing port in a popular tourist area north of Taipei.",
      "The small size of the boats, some just inflatables for having fun at the beach, makes it difficult for Taiwan's radar to pick them up. More cameras and other detection devices and manpower would be needed to cover the vast spaces of inhospitable coastline surrounding the island, but the terrain would make a Chinese D-Day-type landing highly challenging.",
      "While such cases are not unheard of, they come amid a rise in tensions between the sides, with Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te designating China as an enemy to be defended against, and China holding frequent military exercises seen as a rehearsal for an invasion or boycott of Taiwan.",
      "Those entering Taiwan illegally are liable to a fine of 500,000 Taiwan dollars ($16,666) and five years in prison, but such penalties are usually waived as long as no one is hurt and there is no property damage. In the 1990s, there was a wave of hijackings by Chinese to Taiwan, but the perpetrators were sent home after serving brief prison terms in Taiwan.",
      "In addition to facing China's formidable military, Taiwan faces a range of so-called \"gray area\" strategies, including in the media and among entertainers hoping to grab a share of the massive Chinese market. Taiwan has also deported the Chinese wives of Taiwanese men for posting videos supporting a takeover of the island.",
      "The small boat landings may be a further attempt to confuse and undermine confidence among the public, Hsieh said.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- The haka, a chanting dance of challenge, is sacred to New Zealand\u2019s M\u0101ori people but it\u2019s become a beloved cultural institution among New Zealanders of all races. Spine-tingling performances at sports events, funerals and graduations often go viral online, a non-partisan point of pride for the country abroad.",
      "But one haka performed in protest in New Zealand\u2019s Parliament by three legislators last November has provoked fierce division among lawmakers about whether it was an act of peaceful dissent, or disruptive and even intimidating to their opponents.",
      "A vote to approve unprecedented, lengthy bans from Parliament for the M\u0101ori party lawmakers who enacted the protest was unexpectedly suspended on Tuesday. Debate will resume in June, when it threatens to gridlock the legislative agenda until politicians from all parties reach consensus on what the punishment should be.",
      "Hundreds of protesters against the sanctions waited outside Parliament\u2019s front doors in New Zealand\u2019s capital, Wellington, on Tuesday to greet the M\u0101ori party lawmakers with a haka when they emerged.",
      "The haka was once viewed as a war dance, but that understanding has changed in New Zealand as it has been embraced in a range of celebratory, somber and ceremonial settings. It\u2019s an expression of M\u0101ori identity and while sacred, it can be performed by people of any race who are educated by M\u0101ori in the words, movements and cultural protocols.",
      "Emotional haka have generated news headlines in the past year when performed by soldiers farewelling a New Zealander who died fighting in Ukraine, and in Paris by athletes from New Zealand\u2019s Olympic team. While the best-known haka is \u201cka mate,\u201d the chant often performed by the All Blacks rugby team before games, there are many variants.",
      "Last November\u2019s protest wasn\u2019t the first time a haka has rung out in Parliament. Performances regularly follow the passage of laws important to M\u0101ori.",
      "But some lawmakers decried this one for two reasons: because the legislators from Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori, the M\u0101ori Party, left their seats and strode across the floor toward government politicians while performing it, and because it disrupted the vote on a proposed law.",
      "When asked how the M\u0101ori party would vote on a bill they said would dismantle Indigenous rights, Hana-R\u0101whiti Maipi-Clarke \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s youngest parliamentarian, at 22 \u2013 tore up a copy of the law and began the haka, joined by two of her colleagues.",
      "The law, an attempt to rewrite New Zealand\u2019s founding treaty between M\u0101ori tribal leaders and the British crown, was widely unpopular and has since been defeated. But for six months, a committee of the lawmakers\u2019 peers have fought furiously about how \u2014 or whether \u2014 their protest of it should be punished.",
      "Usually there\u2019s agreement among parliamentarians about penalties for errant behavior. But this episode polarized the committee considering the lawmakers\u2019 actions.",
      "Its report recommended Maipi-Clarke, who the committee said showed contrition in a letter, be suspended for seven days and her colleagues for 21 days. That\u2019s the harshest penalty ever assigned to New Zealand lawmakers; the previous record was three days.",
      "Parliament Speaker Gerry Brownlee this month scheduled a rare, unlimited debate in Parliament until all parties could find consensus on the penalty, citing the severity of the proposed bans. But minutes after the debate began Tuesday, it was adjourned at the government\u2019s behest after they allowed the M\u0101ori party lawmakers to stay until after Thursday\u2019s budget was delivered.",
      "It permitted the government their budget week agenda and meant the M\u0101ori lawmakers \u2014 opponents of the government \u2014 wouldn't miss one of Parliament\u2019s most significant dates. But the debate about the bans will then resume.",
      "Opposition leader Chris Hipkins, the only opponent of the sanctions to speak before debate was suspended, cited episodes where lawmakers have brawled in Parliament and driven a tractor up the building\u2019s steps, but were not suspended, as evidence that the bans weren\u2019t fair.",
      "But Judith Collins, the chair of the committee that produced the sanctions, said the penalties were \u201cnot about the haka.\u201d Collins said the lawmakers\u2019 behavior was the most egregious she\u2019d ever witnessed.",
      "The debate will resume on June 5, when it threatens to stall usual government business once more. The government said Tuesday that it would not back down from the punishments suggested and opposition parties said they couldn\u2019t be swayed from disputing them.",
      "Outside Parliament, activist Eru Kapa-Kingi told the assembled crowd that the haka was \u201ca source of fear\u201d in Parliament.",
      "\u201cEven though when the All Blacks do it it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he added.",

      "The tariffs on Taiwanese goods were subsequently lowered to 10% for 90 days to allow for trade negotiations. Officials from both sides held a first round of talks last month, to be followed by another one in the coming weeks.",
      "In a speech marking his first year as president and focusing on Taiwan's strategies to defuse the effects of U.S. tariffs and military threats from China, Lai Ching-te struck an accommodating tone despite the tariff pressure.",
      "The U.S. and Taiwan have long \u201ccooperated and have also encouraged each other to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are bound to be frictions between friends, but they can eventually be reconciled.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven if there are differences of opinion, as long as there is a foundation of trust and sincere dialogue, they can understand each other better and deepen their friendship,\u201d he added.",
      "The U.S. has traditionally been Taiwan\u2019s strongest unofficial ally in the face of military threats by China, which considers the self-ruled island its own territory, to be retaken by force if necessary. Washington is bound by its own laws to provide Taipei with the means to defend itself.",
      "Lai said Taiwan would continue to strengthen its national defense capabilities, both through foreign military procurement and domestic arms development, and stand \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d with its allies \u201cto exert deterrent power.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will prepare adequately to avoid war and achieve the goal of peace,\u201d he said.",
      "He kept open the possibility of talks with Beijing, saying that \u201cTaiwan is very willing to engage in exchanges and cooperation with China\u201d as long as there is mutual respect and dignity.",
      "Taiwan's economy is supported by massive semiconductor firms that supply microchips globally as well as other electronics, advanced manufacturing and green tech makers.",
      "Lai said he would continue to encourage foreign investment in Taiwan, citing Monday's announcement by American technology company Nvidia about opening a new office in northern Taipei.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s Taiwan-born CEO Jensen Huang also announced his company would build an artificial intelligence supercomputer on the island in partnership with chipmaker TSMC, tech firm Foxconn and the Taiwanese government.",
      "He also backed increased investments by Taiwanese firms in the U.S.",
      "In March, TSMC responded to Trump\u2019s tariff threats by pledging a new $100 billion investment in the U.S., in addition to earlier commitments to invest more than $65 billion in three factories in Arizona, one of which began production late last year.",
      "However, Lai\u2019s controversial proposal to completely remove tariffs on U.S. goods \u201con the basis of reciprocity,\u201d in addition to bumping up procurement of U.S. products, triggered protests last week by Taiwanese farmers.",
      "Lai opened his speech by offering his \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to the families of three people, including two 12-year-old girls, who were killed when a driver plowed through pedestrians in New Taipei City on Monday. He promised a speedy investigation into the tragedy that has shaken many on this self-governing island of 23 million people.",

    "story": [
      "The parents of Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American soldier who was held captive in Gaza for 19 months, are overjoyed he is home and slowly absorbing their son's life in captivity",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- For two days after Israeli-American soldier Edan Alexander was released from 19 months of captivity in Gaza, he couldn\u2019t eat anything. Despite periods of near starvation while being held by Hamas militants, Alexander just didn\u2019t have an appetite.",
      "Then, his mother, Yael Alexander, put a burger and fries in front of him, and her son dove in.",
      "It was one of many joyful moments his family has experienced since learning he would be freed.",
      "Hamas portrayed the release of Alexander, the last living American hostage in Gaza, as a gesture to President Donald Trump ahead of his Mideast tour last week, which the militants hoped would revive ceasefire talks. Instead, Israel launched a renewed offensive days later that families of the remaining hostages fear could put their loved ones in grave danger.",
      "Alexander's father was somewhat heartened by Israel's announcement Monday that some aid was going into Gaza for the first time in 2 1/2 months.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the first step forward, so hopefully we\u2019ll see another ceasefire, more releases and the end to this conflict,\u201d Adi Alexander said. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long, too much, and you can\u2019t treat agony with more agony. It\u2019s enough.\u201d",
      "He urged Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to \"rise above politics to prioritize human life.\u201d",
      "The family had just finished celebrating Mother's Day at their home in New Jersey when Adi Alexander saw eight missed calls from Steve Witkoff, Trump's Mideast envoy. Witkoff told them to turn on the TV because Hamas was about to announce their son would be released.",
      "\u201cWe were freaking out,\u201d he said. The family raced to book flights to Israel. Alexander's mother traveled with Trump\u2019s hostage negotiator, Adam Boehler. His father and the couple's other two children arrived just minutes before Edan Alexander crossed into Israel from Gaza.",
      "Alexander was one of 251 people kidnapped during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefires or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight hostages alive and recovered more than 40 bodies.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. The campaign has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population.",
      "The lowest point of his 584 days of captivity, Alexander told his parents, was being dragged into Gaza and pushed into a tunnel. For hours, he was held alone underground until 10 other hostages were thrust in with him.",
      "That came as a relief. His father said his son\u2019s biggest fear was being kidnapped alone, like an Israeli soldier captured in Gaza in 2006, who was held for years until he was released in a 2011 exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Edan Alexander told his parents he was kept mostly underground and moved frequently between tunnels with other hostages. There was very little food, and he rarely saw sunlight or was able to breathe fresh air. In the beginning, like many other male hostages, he was kept handcuffed, sometimes with a sack over his head, and interrogated.",
      "The 6-foot-tall (180 cm) Alexander dropped to around 130 pounds (60 kilograms) from around 175 pounds (80 kilograms) before he was kidnapped.",
      "The conditions of his son\u2019s captivity improved slightly following Trump\u2019s election in November, Adi Alexander said. During a weekslong ceasefire earlier this year, he was given meat and vegetables for the first time, but that ended once Israel reimposed the blockade on Gaza in March.",
      "Adi Alexander said the family is beyond grateful to Trump and the American officials who worked tirelessly to free their son. He lived in Maryland as a young child and graduated from high school in Tenafly, New Jersey. He moved to Israel in 2022 and volunteered for the Israeli army.",
      "The day after Alexander's release, American officials Boehler and Witkoff visited what's come to be known as Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, meeting with families of those held in Gaza.",
      "Hostage families said they left the meeting optimistic there would be more releases. But Trump ended a whirlwind trip through three Gulf countries without additional announcements, and Israel renewed its military campaign on Saturday, dashing hopes for immediate releases.",
      "Alexander's parents said as soon as they catch their breath the family will resume the fight to win the hostages' release. They have been a constant presence at rallies, speaking with the media and politicians, shuttling between New Jersey, Washington and Israel. Alexander's terminally-ill great-aunt managed to hold on until he was safe. She died just after hearing he was with the Red Cross, Yael Alexander said.",
      "Edan Alexander returned weak and pale, but his parents say they see him gaining strength each day. The hamburger two days after his release was a turning point.",
      "\u201cI was sitting there and looking at him with this big smile on my face, and I\u2019m like, oh my God, because he was like, craving the hamburger,\u201d Yael Alexander said.",
      "For now, Edan Alexander is back in the room in his grandmother\u2019s apartment in Tel Aviv where he stayed during breaks from the army before his abduction.",
      "He\u2019s reconnected with some hostages, including Sagui Dekel Chen, an American-Israeli who was released during the previous ceasefire. He\u2019s visiting with old friends from the army and New Jersey, squeezing in doctor\u2019s appointments between hanging out with his siblings.",
      "There are quiet moments that have stuck out to his mother over the past week, when he does normal things, like scrolling through Spotify. Seeing her three children together. Simply being able to touch him, hug him.",
      "It's a long path to recovery, but there are moments of bliss, like seeing him share a beer with his sister on the hospital rooftop. It was his first \u201clegal\u201d beer, since he turned 21 in captivity, a rite of passage since that's the legal drinking age in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt was like, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m back, I have my sunglasses, I have a beer in my hand, and we are all good,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Syria's capital, Damascus, is suffering from its worst water shortages in years as a result of the lowest rainfall in more than six decades",
      "BARADA VALLEY, Syria -- Inside a mountain above the Syrian capital, Hassan Bashi walked through tunnels that used to be filled with water from a spring famous for its pure waters.",
      "The spring rises inside the ruins of a Roman temple in the Barada Valley and flows toward Damascus, which it has been supplying with drinking water for thousands of years. Normally, during the winter flood season, water fills all the tunnels and washes over much of the temple.",
      "Now, there is only a trickle of water following the driest winter in decades.",
      "Bashi, who is a guard but also knows how to operate the pumping and water filtration machines in the absence of the engineer in charge, displayed an old video on his cell phone of high waters inside the ruins.",
      "\u201cI have been working at the Ein al-Fijeh spring for 33 years and this is the first year it is that dry,\u201d Bashi said.",
      "The spring is the main source of water for 5 million people, supplying Damascus and its suburbs with 70% of their water.",
      "As the city suffers its worst water shortages in years, many people now rely on buying water from private tanker trucks that fill from wells.",
      "Government officials are warning that the situation could get worse in the summer and are urging residents to use water sparingly while showering, cleaning or washing dishes.",
      "\u201cThe Ein al-Fijeh spring is working now at its lowest level,\u201d said Ahmad Darwish, head of the Damascus City Water Supply Authority, adding that the current year witnessed the lowest rainfall since 1956.",
      "The channels that have been there since the day of the Romans two millennia ago were improved in 1920 and then again in 1980, he said.",
      "Darwish said the springwater water comes mainly from rainfall and melted snow off the mountains along the border with Lebanon, but because of this year\u2019s below-average rainfall, \u201cit has given us amounts that are much less than normal.\u201d",
      "There are 1.1 million homes that get water from the spring, and in order to get through the year, people will have to cut down their consumption, he said.",
      "The spring also feeds the Barada River that cuts through the capital. It is mostly dry this year.",
      "In Damascus\u2019s eastern area of Abbasids, Bassam Jbara is feeling the shortage. His neighborhood only gets water for about 90 minutes a day, compared with previous years when water was always running when they turned on the taps.",
      "Persistent electricity cuts are making the problem worse, he said, as they sometimes have water but no power to pump it to the tankers on the roof of the building. Jbara once had to buy five barrels of undrinkable water from a tanker truck that cost him and his neighbors $15, a large amount of money in a country where many people make less than $100 a month.",
      "\u201cFrom what we are seeing, we are heading toward difficult conditions regarding water,\u201d he said, fearing that supplies will drop to once or twice a week over the summer. He is already economizing.",
      "\u201cThe people of Damascus are used to having water every day and to drinking tap water coming from the Ein al-Fijeh spring, but unfortunately the spring is now weak,\" Jbara said.",
      "During Syria\u2019s 14-year conflict, Ein al-Fijeh was subjected to shelling on several occasions, changing between forces of then- President Bashar Assad and insurgents over the years.",
      "In early 2017, government forces captured the area from insurgents and held it until December when the five-decade Assad dynasty collapsed in a stunning offensive by fighters led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, of current President Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "Tarek Abdul-Wahed returned to his home near the spring in December nearly eight years after he was forced to leave with his family and is now working on rebuilding the restaurant he owned. It was blown up by Assad\u2019s forces after he left the area.",
      "Abdul-Wahed looked at the dry area that used to be filled with tourists and Syrians who would come in the summer to enjoy the cool weather.",
      "\u201cThe Ein al-Fijeh spring is the only artery to Damascus,\u201d Abdul-Wahed said as reconstruction work was ongoing in the restaurant that helped 15 families living nearby make a living in addition to the employees who came from other parts of Syria.",
      "\u201cNow it looks like a desert. There is no one,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope that the good old days return with people coming here.\u201d",

The vehicle kept going straight, hitting another person before slamming into a concrete divider when it reached a T-intersection at the end of the street.",

They included seven students from the same school and a 5-year-old boy, who was slightly injured, according to statements from the New Taipei government and fire department.",
      "Five people were seriously injured, including the driver. He tested negative for alcohol consumption, the Central News Agency said, citing police. The cause of the crash was under investigation.",

    "story": [
      "Japan\u2019s agriculture minister has resigned after making an inappropriate remark about buying rice",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's agriculture minister resigned Wednesday because of political fallout over recent comments that he \u201cnever had to buy rice\u201d because he got it from supporters as gifts. The resignation comes as the public struggles with record high prices of the country's traditional staple food.",
      "Taku Eto's comment, which many Japanese saw as out of touch with the difficult economic realities they face, came at a seminar Sunday in Saga prefecture. Politically, the gaffe could be further trouble for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s already struggling minority government, which faces a crucial national election in July. A loss could mean a new government or that Ishiba would have to step down.",
      "\u201cI made an extremely inappropriate remark at a time when consumers are struggling with soaring rice prices,\u201d Eto told reporters after submitting his resignation at the prime minister\u2019s office. Eto said Ishiba accepted his resignation.",
      "\u201cIt is not appropriate for me to stay\u201d as officials work to lower high rice prices and increase supply, Eto said.",
      "The government has released tons of rice from its emergency stockpile in recent months, but the latest agricultural ministry statistics show that has not really helped the situation.",
      "Eto, while submitting his resignation, also sought to clarify the comments that got him in trouble. He said he does actually buy white rice himself and was not living on rice given as gifts. He said the gift comment referred to brown rice, which he wants people to become interested in because it can reach market faster.",
      "Media reports say Eto's successor will be popular former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of a former prime minister.",
      "Ishiba, also a former farm minister, said he wants to strengthen Japan\u2019s food security and self-sufficiency. He recently proposed agricultural reforms, including increased rice production and possible exports, though critics say he should urgently fix the ongoing rice problem first.",
      "Noting the rice situation, Ishiba said he suspects the rice price surge is \u201cnot a temporary but a structural problem.\u201d",
      "Opposition parties had threatened to submit a no-confidence motion against him if Eto didn\u2019t resign voluntarily by Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Japanese rice demand has decreased over recent decades as people's diets have diversified, but rice remains a staple food and integral part of Japanese culture and history.",
      "The shortfall started last August on panic buying following a government caution over preparedness for a major earthquake. The supply pressure eased after the autumn harvest, but a shortage and price increases hit again early this year.",
      "Officials have blamed the supply shortage on poor harvests because of hot weather in 2023 and higher fertilizer and other production costs, but some experts blame the government\u2019s long-term rice production policy.",
      "The unprecedented release from emergency rice stockpiles was seen in part as an attempt to figure out distribution problems. The government has denied there is now a rice shortage, but officials say it's a mystery why rice is not reaching consumers. Some experts say it's because the shortage was so serious.",

      "Passengers on Southwest Airlines flights will soon be required to keep their portable chargers in plain sight while using them because of concerns about the growing number of lithium battery fires in a new policy that other airlines may adopt.",
      "Southwest announced the new policy that will go into effect May 28 and said passengers may already have seen notifications about the industry-leading rule when using the airline's app.",
      "There is growing concern about lithium-ion battery fires on planes because the number of incidents continues to grow yearly, and devices powered by those batteries are ubiquitous. There have already been 19 incidents involving these batteries this year, following last year's record high of 89, according to Federal Aviation Administration statistics.",
      "The incidents have more than doubled since the pandemic-era low of 39 in 2020, and have climbed annually.",
      "Compared to the roughly 180,000 flights U.S. airlines operate each week, the number of incidents is still relatively small and lithium batteries can overheat anywhere. However, this is a growing concern for the airlines.",
      "Last summer, a smoking laptop in a passenger\u2019s bag led to the evacuation of a plane awaiting takeoff at San Francisco International Airport. In 2023, a flight from Dallas to Orlando, Florida, made an emergency landing in Jacksonville, Florida, after a battery caught fire in an overhead bin.",
      "Southwest said that requiring these chargers to be kept out in the open when they are being used will help because \u201cin the rare event a lithium battery overheats or catches fire, quick access is critical and keeping power banks in plain sight allow for faster intervention and helps protect everyone onboard.\u201d",
      "The airline will allow the chargers to be stored inside carry-on bags when they aren't in use.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration has long prohibited e-cigarettes and chargers and power banks with lithium-ion batteries in checked bags, but allows them in carry-on bags. The rule exists precisely because fires in the cargo hold might be harder to detect and extinguish.",
      "The FAA recommends passengers keep cell phones and other devices nearby on planes so they can access them quickly. The agency said flight crews are trained to recognize and respond to lithium battery fires. Passengers should notify the flight crew immediately if their lithium battery or device is overheating, expanding, smoking or burning.",
      "A previous report released last year by UL Standards & Engagement said e-cigarettes overheated more often than any other device. More than one-quarter of passengers surveyed for that study said they put vaping cigarettes and portable chargers in checked bags. That is against federal rules.",
      "UL Standards & Engagement, part of a safety-science company once known as Underwriters Laboratories, said it based its findings on data from 35 passenger and cargo airlines, including nine of the 10 leading U.S. passenger carriers.",

      "NEW YORK -- Levi Strauss is set to finally part ways with Dockers \u2014 inking a deal to sell its brand once credited with propelling the popularity of \u201cCasual Fridays\u201d to Authentic Brands Group.",
      "In an announcement Tuesday, the denim giant said it had agreed to sell Dockers to Authentic for up to $391 million. The transaction will start at an initial value of $311 million, with the potential of adding another $80 million to the price tag based on business performance under the new ownership.",
      "The sale arrives as San Francisco-based Levi Strauss boosts its focus on the chain\u2019s core Levi\u2019s brand \u2014 as well as Beyond Yoga, which the company acquired in 2021, as more and more consumers continue to cozy up to athleisure wear.",
      "Selling Dockers \u201cfurther aligns our portfolio with our strategic priorities,\u201d Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement, while thanking the Dockers team for their commitment to building the brand, which she said \"continues to be the authority on khaki.\u201d",
      "Jamie Salter, founder and CEO of New York-based Authentic, called Dockers a \u201cnatural fit\u201d for his company's model. Dockers \u201cplayed a key role in shaping casual workwear as we know it today, and we see significant potential to build on that legacy and grow the brand across a variety of categories,\u201d he said.",
      "Levi Strauss launched Dockers back in 1986, and the brand soon became a \u201cCasual Friday\u201d staple. Many office workers turned to Dockers' khakis and looser button-downs in the place of more traditional business attire. While it was not the sole \u2014 or very first \u2014 creator of dressed-down office looks, Dockers has been widely-credited as an integral part to \u201cCasual Friday's\u201d rise, particularly in the 90s.",
      "But the nearly 40-year-old brand has struggled some in recent years \u2014 notably since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when many shoppers traded their khakis for more comfortable clothes, like yoga pants and other athleisure, as they began working from home. And even with returns to the office, many dress codes remain more relaxed than they were before.",
      "Levi Strauss said it began to \u201cevaluate strategic alternatives\u201d for Dockers in October of last year, citing recent underperformance at the time.",
      "On Tuesday, Levi Strauss said it expected to close Dockers' sale to Authentic around July 31 for the U.S. and Canada, pending customary closing conditions, and in January 2026 for remaining operations.",
      "In its 2024 fiscal year, Levi Strauss reported profit of $210.6 million and revenue of $6.36 billion.",

    "story": [
      "Federal health officials will no longer routinely approve annual COVID-19 shots for younger adults and children who are healthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration said Tuesday it will limit approval for seasonal COVID-19 shots to seniors and others at high risk pending more data on everyone else \u2014 raising questions about whether some people who want a vaccine this fall will be able to get one.",
      "Top officials for the Food and Drug Administration laid out new standards for updated COVID shots, saying they'd continue to use a streamlined approach to make them available to adults 65 and older as well as children and younger adults with at least one high-risk health problem.",
      "But the FDA framework, published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, urges companies to conduct large, lengthy studies before tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people. It's a stark break from the previous federal policy recommending an annual COVID shot for all Americans six months and older. In the paper and a subsequent online webcast, the FDA's top vaccine official said more than 100 million Americans still should qualify for what he termed a booster under the new guidance.",
      "Dr. Vinay Prasad described the new approach as a \u201creasonable compromise\u201d that will allow vaccinations in high-risk groups to continue while generating new data about whether they still benefit healthier people.",
      "\"For many Americans we simply do not know the answer as to whether or not they should be getting the seventh or eighth or ninth or tenth COVID-19 booster,\u201d said Prasad, who joined the FDA earlier this month. He previously spent more than a decade in academia, frequently criticizing the FDA's handling of drug and vaccine approvals.",
      "It's unclear what the upcoming changes mean for people who may still want a fall COVID-19 shot but don't clearly fit into one of the categories.",
      "\u201cIs the pharmacist going to determine if you're in a high-risk group?\u201d asked Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cThe only thing that can come of this will make vaccines less insurable and less available.\u201d",
      "The nation's leading pediatrics group said FDA's approach will limit options for parents and their children.",
      "\u201cIf the vaccine were no longer available or covered by insurance, it will take the choice away from families who wish to protect their children from COVID-19, especially among families already facing barriers to care,\u201d said Dr. Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows more than 47,000 Americans died from COVID-related causes last year. The virus was the underlying cause for two-thirds of those and it was a contributing factor for the rest. Among them were 231 children whose deaths were deemed COVID-related, 134 of them where the virus was the direct cause -- numbers similar to yearly pediatric deaths from the flu.",
      "The new FDA approach is the culmination of a series of recent steps under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. scrutinizing the use of COVID shots and raising questions about the broader availability of vaccines. It was released two days ahead of the first meeting of FDA\u2019s outside vaccine experts under Trump.",
      "Last week the FDA granted full approval of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine but with major restrictions on who can get it \u2014 and Tuesday's guidance mirrors those restrictions. The approval came after Trump appointees overruled FDA scientists' earlier plans to approve the shot without restrictions.",
      "Pfizer and Moderna, makers of the most commonly used COVID shots, each said they would continue to work with the agency.",
      "For years, federal health officials have told most Americans to expect annual updates to COVID-19 vaccines, similar to the annual flu shot. Just like with flu vaccines, until now the FDA has approved updated COVID shots so long as they show as much immune protection as the previous year's version.",
      "But FDA's new guidance appears to be the end of that approach, according to Prasad and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who co-authored the journal paper and joined the FDA webcast.",
      "Prasad and Makary criticized the U.S.\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all,\u201d contrasting it with some European countries that recommend boosters based on age, risk and other factors.",
      "Prasad said the FDA will ask all manufacturers to do new clinical trials in healthy people ages 50 to 64, randomly assigning them to get a vaccine or a placebo and tracking outcomes with special attention to severe disease, hospitalization or death. Companies might need to repeat that requirement for future vaccine approvals if there's a large virus mutation rather than the past year's incremental evolution. Companies are also free to test their vaccines for approval in younger adults and children, Prasad said, adding \u201cthis is a free country.\u201d",
      "Since becoming the nation's top health official in February, Kennedy has filled the FDA and other health agencies with outspoken critics of the government\u2019s handling of COVID shots, including Makary and Prasad. Under federal procedures, the FDA releases new guidance in draft form and allows the public to comment before finalizing its plans. The publication of Tuesday's policy in a medical journal is highly unusual and could run afoul of federal procedures, according to FDA experts.",
      "Health experts say there are legitimate questions about how much everyone still benefits from yearly COVID vaccination or whether they should be recommended only for people at increased risk.",
      "In June, an influential panel of advisers to the CDC is set to debate which vaccines should be recommended to which groups.",
      "The FDA's announcement appears to usurp that advisory panel's job, Offit said. He added that CDC studies have made clear that booster doses do offer protection against mild to moderate illness for four to six months after the shot even in healthy people.",

      "Elon Musk, the richest person in the world and a key financial supporter of President Donald Trump, says he\u2019ll be spending less on political campaigns",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk, the richest person in the world and a key financial supporter of President Donald Trump, said Tuesday that he'll be spending \u201ca lot less\u201d on political campaigns, a reversal that could be a setback for Republicans ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "Musk disclosed his decision via videoconference during a Bloomberg forum in Doha, Qatar. It speaks to his possible disenchantment with politics after his tumultuous tenure as Trump's pick to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which has fallen far short of its goals for reducing federal spending. Musk has scaled back his government role to spend more time at his businesses, including Tesla, which have seen intense blowback. Tesla reported a big drop in profits in the first quarter.",
      "\u201cIn terms of political spending I\u2019m going to do a lot less in the future,\u201d Musk said. Asked why, he responded that \u201cI think I\u2019ve done enough.\u201d",
      "Musk's statement marks a reversal of the course he had set during the 2024 campaign \u2014 when he was among the very top political spenders \u2014 and immediately after.",
      "Musk spent at least $250 million supporting Trump in the presidential campaign, as the main contributor to America PAC, a super PAC that was active in advertising and funding door-to-door canvassing groups across the seven most-competitive states in the November presidential election.",
      "Musk relished in the publicity, campaigning alongside Trump at times and headlining some of his own campaign rallies on the GOP nominee's behalf.",
      "And while he took credit for helping Trump return to the White House, Musk suffered a public defeat in April, after he became deeply involved in a Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign. Musk-backed groups America PAC and Rebuilding America's Future spent more than $21 million on the April 1 election in support of the Republican-backed candidate Brad Schimel.",
      "But Schimel's defeat by 10 percentage points in Wisconsin, a state Trump carried just five months earlier, was a blow to Musk, who campaigned for Schimel in Green Bay the weekend before the election and had also pledged to enforce Trump's agenda in the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "A week after Trump's November victory, Musk said the political action committees he supported would \u201cplay a significant role in primaries,\u201d adding later that he might help finance Republican challengers to GOP members of Congress who did not support Trump's nominees.",
      "\u201cHow else? There is no other way,\u201d Musk wrote on X, which he rebranded after purchasing Twitter, in response to the suggestion of supporting intraparty challenges.",
      "An adviser to Musk\u2019s PACs declined to comment Tuesday.",
      "Once Trump took office, Musk held a prominent role as an adviser and leader of DOGE. He and his acolytes in the department fanned out widely across the federal government to enact deep cuts to the workforce and spending, in some cases seeking to shutter entire agencies altogether.",
      "DOGE has pushed to fire tens of thousands of workers in downsizing at agencies, ranging from the IRS to Health and Human Services, and pressured tens of thousands more to take buyout and early retirement offers. And they sought to shut down agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "With backing from DOGE, agencies have cancelled tens of thousands of government contracts and grants that they say do not align with the administration\u2019s priorities. Some of those moves were done so quickly that they had to be reversed after pushback or court rulings finding that they were illegal.",
      "Critics say it amounts to a reckless chain-saw approach that could destroy much of the nation\u2019s apolitical civil service, impair services for vulnerable populations, and halt critical research.",
      "DOGE claims on its \u201cWall of Receipts\u201d it has saved an estimated $170 billion, but those savings numbers have been shown to be flawed and inflated in many cases.",
      "Musk's role prompted intense pushback, including protests at his electric vehicle company, Tesla. Speaking to reporters earlier this month as he prepared to step back from DOGE, Musk noted the backlash.",
      "\u201cBeing attacked relentlessly is not super fun,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing cars burning is not fun,\u201d he added, referring to the instances of Tesla cars being smashed or set on fire.",
      "Musk's announced intention to step back from political spending comes during multiple new business opportunities, including a deal to host the latest versions of his Grok artificial intelligence chatbot on Microsoft\u2019s data centers.",
      "Meanwhile, his brain-computer interface company Neuralink is planning to implant its experimental devices in dozens more people and his electric-vehicle company Tesla is developing a humanoid robot that Musk hopes to one day send to Mars.",
      "Musk could change his mind about campaign spending. The 2026 midterm campaigns are just getting off the ground, while some candidates have not yet announced their candidacy for elections that remain 18 months away.",
      "But as of Tuesday, Musk said he did not expect to.",

      "The European Union and U.K. have imposed fresh sanctions on Russia, notably targeting almost scores of ships from the shadow fleet illicitly transporting oil to skirt Western restrictions imposed over the war on Ukraine",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union on Tuesday agreed to impose fresh sanctions on Russia, notably targeting almost 200 ships from the shadow fleet illicitly transporting oil to skirt Western restrictions put in place over Moscow's war in Ukraine.",
      "The 27-nation bloc targeted 189 ships in all, and imposed asset freezes and travel bans on several officials as well as on a number of Russian companies. The measures were endorsed by EU foreign ministers in Brussels.",
      "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that while President Vladimir \u201cPutin feigns interest in peace, more sanctions are in the works. Russia\u2019s actions and those who enable Russia face severe consequences.\u201d",
      "Russia uses its \u201c shadow fleet \u201d of ships to transport oil and gas, or to carry stolen Ukrainian grain. The EU has now targeted almost 350 of the ships in total.",
      "The new measures are not obviously linked to Russian delays in agreeing to a ceasefire. Work on the measures began in the days after the last package was finalized three months ago.",
      "Ukrainian officials have said that the shadow fleet involves around 500 aging ships of uncertain ownership and safety practices that are dodging sanctions and keeping the oil revenue coming.",
      "Ratings agency S&P Global and the Kyiv School of Economics Institute, a think tank, have put the number at over 400 ships that can transport oil, or products made from crude such as diesel fuel and gasoline.",
      "Vessels from the shadow fleet have also come under suspicion of damaging undersea cables, particularly in the Baltic Sea. Finnish police on Dec. 26 seized the Eagle S, a tanker they said was part of the dark fleet, on suspicion it used its anchor to damage the Estlink 2 undersea power cable that supplies electricity from Finland to Estonia.",
      "The EU also said that it targeted people and companies, including an insurer, that make it possible for the shadow fleet to operate, hitting interests in the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Hong Kong.",
      "In parallel, the U.K. targeted the shadow fleet in a raft of 100 new sanctions that it said are aimed at \u201cramping up pressure\u201d on the Kremlin.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Britain\u2019s Foreign Office said the sanctions will hit entities supporting Russia\u2019s military, energy exports and information war, as well as financial institutions helping to fund its war against Ukraine.",
      "It added that the sanctions will target the supply chains of Russian weapons, including Iskander missiles which have been fired into civilian areas in Ukraine during the war. The U.K. will also sanction 18 more ships in the \u201cshadow fleet\u201d carrying Russian oil.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s latest strikes once again show his true colors as a warmonger,\u201d Foreign Secretary David Lammy said. \u201cWe urge him to agree a full, unconditional ceasefire right away so there can be talks on a just and lasting peace.\u201d",
      "The EU has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Russia since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Around 2,400 officials and \u201centities\u201d \u2014 often government agencies, banks and organizations \u2014 have been hit.",

      "A number of U.S. companies have lowered or pulled financial guidance for investors as tariffs launched by the the Trump administration scramble world trade but on Tuesday, Home Depot stuck by earlier projections of sales growth at around 2.8%.",
      "Shares of the Atlanta company rose more than 3% before the opening bell on Tuesday.",
      "Revenue rose to $39.86 billion from $36.42 billion a year earlier, beating the $39.3 billion that analysts polled by FactSet expected.",
      "Sales at stores open at least a year, a key gauge of a retailer\u2019s health, edged down 0.3%. In the U.S., comparable store sales climbed 0.2%.",
      "Wall Street anticipated a 0.1% decline in same-store sales.",
      "Customer transactions rose 2.1% in the quarter. The amount shoppers spent climbed to $90.71 per average ticket from $90.68 in the prior-year period.",
      "\u201cOur first quarter results were in line with our expectations as we saw continued customer engagement across smaller projects and in our spring events,\u201d Home Depot Chair and CEO Ted Decker said in a statement on Tuesday.",
      "Home improvement retailers like Home Depot have been dealing with homeowners putting off bigger projects because of increased borrowing costs and lingering concerns about inflation.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows.",
      "Sales of previously occupied homes dropped last month as elevated mortgage rates and rising prices discouraged home shoppers.",
      "Existing home sales fell 5.9% in March from February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.02 million units, the National Association of Realtors said. The March sales decline was the largest monthly drop since November 2022, when sales slid 6.7% from the previous month, and marks the slowest sales pace for the month of March going back to 2009.",
      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "\u201cOne of the central problems for Home Depot is the skittish housing market,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement. \u201cWhile last quarter was robust, home sales declined by 3.1% year-over-year this quarter as consumers were deterred from moving by continued high interest rates and growing economic uncertainty. This lack of recovery makes it difficult to drive home improvement spending.\u201d",
      "For the three months ended May 4, Home Depot Inc. earned $3.43 billion, or $3.45 per share. A year earlier the Atlanta-based company earned $3.6 billion, or $3.63 per share.",

      "Honda says electric vehicle sales were slowing in the U.S., prompting the Japanese automaker to scrap its previous goal of having EVs reach 30% of its global vehicle sales by 2030",
      "TOKYO -- Honda said Tuesday electric vehicle sales were slowing in the U.S., prompting the Japanese automaker to scrap its previous goal for EVs to be 30% of its global vehicle sales by 2030.",
      "Instead of the initial plan to invest 10 trillion yen ($69 billion) in an electrification strategy through the fiscal year ending in 2031, Honda is reducing that investment by 3 trillion yen ($21 billion) to 7 trillion yen ($48 billion).",
      "Honda Motor Co. Chief Executive Toshihiro Mibe called the decisions \u201ca switch in the planned course,\u201d while stressing the long-term shift toward electrification remained unchanged, just pushed back in time.",
      "Mibe didn't mention U.S. President Donald Trump. But Trump\u2019s policies on tariffs, as well as his lack of enthusiasm for electric vehicles, have Japanese automakers scrambling to adapt.",
      "\u201cThe environment surrounding the automobile industry is changing day by day. Uncertainty in the business environment is increasing, due particularly to the slowdown in the expansion of the EV market due to several factors, including changes in environmental regulations,\u201d Honda said in a statement.",

      "Honda\u2019s auto plant in Marysville, Ohio, for instance, will be adapted to produce both EVs and hybrids under the new plan.",
      "Mibe pointed to Honda\u2019s motorcycle business as its core strength, as sales continue to grow in India, and Honda\u2019s global market share was steadily rising.",
      "Mibe also said the Tokyo-based automaker was working on the use of various digital technology to strengthen safety, including assisted driving that will bring deaths from traffic accidents down to zero, a longtime Honda goal.",
      "Talks that began late last year to bring together the operations of Honda and Japanese rival Nissan Motor Corp., as well as smaller automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp., in a merger, collapsed earlier this year. Mibe told reporters talks were still ongoing to have the three automakers work together on developing technology. He remained vague and did not say when a deal might be reached.",
      "Nissan is sinking into losses, reducing its work force and shuttering plants. Its new chief executive, Ivan Espinosa, is promising a turnaround by speeding up decision-making.",
      "Honda\u2019s profit for the fiscal year through March slipped 24.5% from the previous year. But much of the negative impact is from external factors like tariffs and sliding sales in China.",

      "DETROIT -- As a fan, Shaun Horne is all about Detroit's professional sports teams. But when it comes to playing, the high school junior has his eyes on one game.",
      "\u201cI only play golf,\u201d Horne said after taking his turn on a simulator inside a gym on Detroit's westside.",
      "Embracing golf makes the 16-year-old a rarity among his Detroit peers \u2014 particularly Black high schoolers.",
      "Coaches and community groups in the city are taking ambitious steps to spread the game's popularity among students \u2014 noting that only about 50 of more than 14,000 high school students in Detroit's school district play golf on school teams.",
      "In Detroit, the biggest challenge is exposing Black youth to the game, said Jesse Hawkins, who is Black and coaches Horne\u2019s team at Renaissance High School. Backing from local corporations and nonprofits, providing access to equipment and even college scholarships is helping.",
      "\u201cWhen you go into high schools and you go into elementary schools often times we\u2019ll hear narratives around basketball players, football games, those things,\u201d Hawkins said. \"And golf is really not as propagated as much for our community.\u201d",
      "In Detroit, advocates of increasing play among Black young people have partnered with some of the city's largest businesses and community organizations. At least two nonprofits offer programs that teach kids how to play golf.",
      "The Rocket Classic has steered nearly $10 million from the annual PGA event held in Detroit to local charitable organizations. Of that, $800,000 has been given to programs that teach kids how to play the game. One program provides access to college scholarships to high school seniors, while upward of 700 children and teens take part each year in programs put on by First Tee of Greater Detroit.",
      "\u201cGolf is the why we get them there, but while we have them there we\u2019re teaching them life skills,\u201d said Carl Bentley, chief executive of First Tee of Greater Detroit, which has donated a golf simulator to the school district. \u201cLearning how to say \u2018yes sir, yes ma\u2019am\u2019 \u2014 shake a hand properly, how to start a conversation. We\u2019re teaching them life skills and then we get to putting and swinging and things like that.\"",
      "Among the 28.1 million Americans who played golf on a course in 2024, about 25% were Black, Asian or Hispanic, according to the National Golf Foundation. Interest is wider when considering those who played or followed professional golf coverage on TV, in writing or via podcasts.",
      "But Hawkins said his experience as a coach suggests Black high schoolers aren't among that audience.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t hear kids talking about the latest golf shoes or the cool golf apparel,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cYou\u2019re not necessarily going to get a badge of honor walking into your high school and you\u2019ve got the newest golf shirt.\u201d",
      "Golf and equipment can be pricey, sometimes too pricey for families struggling just to make ends meet.",
      "Detroit, which is just under 80% Black, had a median income of about $39,500 in 2023 compared to $69,100 statewide, according to the census. The city\u2019s poverty level was about 32%. Statewide, that figure was about 13.5%.",
      "A set of good golf clubs can cost a few hundred dollars or more. It's $28 for juniors to play 18 holes and use a cart weekdays at the two public golf courses in Detroit.",
      "The PGA brought its first event to Detroit in 2019, and city native Dan Gilbert's Rocket Companies has been its sponsor. The company works with partners to bring the game to Detroit\u2019s youth and cover some of the costs, said Trina Scott, vice president of Civic and Community Affairs at Detroit-based Rock, which is Gilbert\u2019s family office.",
      "\u201cHow do we attract Black and brown youth into seeing (golf) as a possibility?\u201d said Scott. \u201cOne way of doing that is by making it accessible (and) also eliminating the barriers \u2014 being able to have the right clothing to go on a golf course, being able to have the clubs that you need, being able to have the skillset to be confident on the course.\u201d",
      "Mike Schuchard has about a dozen players on his Detroit Cass Tech golf team. That's about double the number from last season, but only two are considered \u201cvarsity level.\"",
      "That\u2019s not enough to compete against some suburban schools with strong golf programs.",
      "The first-year golf coach says he's trying to recruit students who are already interested in others sports.",
      "\u201cThese schools are loaded with great athletes, but they just haven\u2019t been introduced to this game, yet,\" Schuchard said.",
      "Ahmari Flowers, the senior captain on Cass Tech's golf team, agrees. He started playing the sport after his freshman year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an athletic guy and golf like came easy to me,\" said Flowers, 17. \"For an athletic person, it\u2019s still a sport, a lot of body movement and all you got to do is control that athleticism and use it to your advantage.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a declaration yet. People are still hurting,\u201d said Royce McKee, emergency management director for Walthall County, which includes Tylertown.",
      "Mississippi\u2019s request comes at a time of upheaval for FEMA. The agency's acting administrator, Cameron Hamilton, was recently ousted after he publicly disagreed with proposals to dismantle FEMA, an idea President Donald Trump has floated in calling the agency \u201cvery bureaucratic\u201d and \u201cvery slow.\u201d",
      "David Richardson, FEMA\u2019s new acting administrator, committed himself to executing Trump\u2019s vision for the agency. He also previewed potential policy changes, saying there could be \u201cmore cost-sharing with states\u201d and that FEMA would coordinate federal assistance \u201cwhen deemed necessary.\u201d",
      "Walthall County was hit especially hard by the massive storm system that wreaked havoc across multiple states. The storm spawned two significant tornadoes in the county, where four people died.",
      "McKee said the county has sunk an estimated $700,000 into cleaning up the damage but can\u2019t afford to spend more and has halted operations until it receives federal help.",
      "\u201cWe need federal help, and we need it desperately, and we need it now,\u201d said Bobby McGinnis, a Tylertown resident and firefighter. \u201cI know President Trump said that \u2014 America first, we\u2019re going to help our American folks first. But we haven\u2019t seen the federal folks down here.\u201d",
      "While Mississippi has been waiting, a similar major disaster declaration request out of Arkansas after the storms hit was denied, appealed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and finally approved on May 13.",
      "\u201cWe are encouraged by FEMA\u2019s decision regarding Arkansas\u2019 application from the same storm system that hit Mississippi,\u201d Scott Simmons, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency\u2019s director of external affairs, said in a statement. \u201cWe anxiously await a positive decision.\u201d",
      "Mississippi lawmakers have been pressing federal officials on the issue. During a congressional hearing in early May, Republican Mississippi Rep. Michael Guest asked U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department oversees FEMA, to push forward the request.",

      "\u201cPresident Trump has been very clear that he believes that the way that FEMA exists today should not continue,\u201d Noem responded. \u201cHe wants to make sure that those reforms are happening where states are empowered to do the response and trained and equipped, and then the federal government would come in and support them and financially be there when they need them on their worst day.\u201d",

      "India will play a key role in whether steelmaking, one of the world\u2019s most polluting industries, moves away from dirty fuels to cleaner electricity sources",
      "BENGALURU, India -- India\u2019s plans to double steel production by the end of the decade could jeopardize its national climate goals and a key global target to reduce planet-heating gas emissions from the steel industry, according to a report released Tuesday.",
      "The report by Global Energy Monitor, an organization that tracks energy projects around the globe, said efforts to decarbonize steelmaking are gaining traction around the world. However, in India, which is the world's second largest steel-producing nation, overwhelming reliance on coal-based technologies presents a big challenge.",
      "\u201cIndia is now the bellwether of global steel decarbonization,\u201d said Astrid Grigsby-Schulte, project manager of the Global Iron and Steel Tracker at GEM and report co-author. \u201cIf the country does not increase its plans for green steel production, the entire sector will miss an important milestone. So goes India, so goes the world.\u201d",
      "Currently, up to 12% of India\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, which go into the atmosphere and heat the planet, come from steelmaking. That number could double in five years if steel is produced in line with the government\u2019s plans, according to the report.",
      "At the same time, India wants to produce 500 gigawatts of clean power \u2014 enough to power nearly 300 million Indian homes \u2014 by the end of this decade. The South Asian nation recently crossed the milestone of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power, most of which was installed in the last 10 years.",
      "By 2070, India also aims to go net zero, that is, it will either eliminate all carbon dioxide pollution it emits or cancel it out by using other methods, such as planting trees that absorb carbon.",
      "Steel production is one of the most carbon polluting industries, responsible for nearly 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The International Energy Agency has set a target for 37% of global steelmaking capacity to rely on lower-emission electric arc furnaces by 2030. Current projections by GEM show the world reaching just 36% \u2014 a shortfall largely due to India\u2019s coal-heavy pipeline.",
      "India plans to expand its steel production capacity from 200 million to over 330 million tonnes per year by 2030. According to the new data, over 40% of global capacity in development \u2014 about 352 million tonnes per annum \u2014 is in India, with more than half of that using coal-based capacity.",
      "\u201cIndia is the only major steel-producing nation that has so much coal-based capacity in the pipeline,\u201d said Henna Khadeeja, a research analyst with GEM who also worked on the report.",
      "India\u2019s steel sector releases approximately 2.6 tons of carbon dioxide per ton of steel, roughly 25% more than the global average. China, the world\u2019s largest steelmaker, has managed to keep its emissions lower per ton by producing more scrap-based steel and retiring older coal-based plants.",
      "India\u2019s heavy dependence on coal for steelmaking is driven by a combination of factors: low-cost domestic coal, a relatively young fleet of blast furnaces that still have 20\u201325 years of operational life left, and a lack of natural gas and steel scrap. The country\u2019s scrap recycling ecosystem remains informal, and high-quality iron ore is scarce.",
      "\u201cThere is potential for India to change course,\u201d said Khadeeja of GEM. \u201cMuch of the planned capacity is still on paper. Only 8% of it has actually broken ground. This means there is still a window to shift toward lower-emission technologies.\u201d",
      "The consequences of producing carbon polluting steel may go beyond climate goals. While India\u2019s steel exports are only a small share of its overall production, they could suffer as major markets like the European Union begin enforcing carbon border taxes next year.",
      "\u201cIndia may be better off tolerating some short-term pain of technological upgrading to make its steel cleaner for long-term competitiveness gain,\u201d said Easwaran Narassimhan of the New Delhi-based think tank Sustainable Futures Collaborative.",

      "The Trump administration is allowing work on a major offshore wind project for New York to resume",
      "The Trump administration is allowing work on a major offshore wind project for New York to resume.",
      "The developer, the Norwegian energy company Equinor, said Monday it was told by the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management that a stop-work order has been lifted for the Empire Wind project, allowing construction to resume.",
      "Work has been paused since Interior Secretary Doug Burgum last month directed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to halt construction and review the permits. Burgum said at the time that it appeared former President Joe Biden's administration had \u201crushed through\u201d the approvals. Equinor spent seven years obtaining permits and has spent more than $2.5 billion so far on a project that is one-third complete.",
      "Equinor President and CEO Anders Opedal thanked President Donald Trump for allowing the project to move forward, saving about 1,500 construction jobs and investments in U.S. energy infrastructure. He also expressed appreciation to New York's governor, New York City's mayor, members of Congress and labor groups, as well as Norwegian officials who worked to save the project. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate the fact that construction can now resume on Empire Wind, a project which underscores our commitment to deliver energy while supporting local economies and creating jobs,\u201d Opedal said in a statement.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said it took countless conversations with Equinor and White House officials, and the involvement of labor and business interests, to emphasize the project's importance and get Empire Wind back on track. Equinor is building Empire Wind south of Long Island, New York, to provide power in 2026 for more than 500,000 New York homes.",
      "\u201cNew York\u2019s economic future is going to be powered by abundant, clean energy that helps our homes and businesses thrive. I fought to save clean energy jobs in New York \u2014 and we got it done,\" Hochul said in a statement Monday.",
      "The Interior Department did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Monday.",
      "Large offshore wind farms have been making electricity for three decades in Europe and, more recently, in Asia. But the industry has struggled to grow in the U.S. due to high costs, difficulties growing a supply chain for materials and the lengthy permitting process.",
      "Trump has prioritized fossil fuels and moved against renewable energy since returning to the White House. One of his first acts was ordering a pause of offshore wind lease sales in federal waters and the issuance of approvals, permits and loans for all wind projects. But the administration\u2019s targeting of Empire Wind, a project already underway, took that a step further.",
      "White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement Friday that while unleashing America\u2019s energy dominance, Trump \u201cpaused certain wind projects that are detrimental to our beloved wildlife including birds and whales.\u201d",
      "There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While wind turbines can pose a risk to birds, wildlife conservation organizations say they support the responsible development of offshore wind because climate change is a bigger threat.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Monday that lifting the stop-work order is welcome news. Empire Wind will greatly benefit the economy on Long Island and the environment for all New Yorkers, he said in a statement.",
      "Offshore wind advocates also celebrated the decision. It\u2019s a win for workers, the industry and companies in places like Louisiana, South Carolina and Pennsylvania, helping to build projects in the Northeast, the Oceantic Network said in a statement.",
      "Equinor said on May 9 it would be forced to abandon Empire Wind within days unless the administration relented on its order that stopped construction. Equinor was spending up to $50 million per week and had 11 vessels on standby.",
      "Equinor finalized the federal lease in March 2017, during Trump\u2019s first term. The federal government approved the construction and operations plan in February 2024.",
      "New York aims to obtain 70% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and 9 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. New York is getting some wind power from the nation\u2019s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, a 12-turbine wind farm called South Fork that opened a year ago, operated by different companies east of Montauk Point, New York.",

      "More than 12,000 chicks at a Delaware distribution center were found left in a USPS truck for more than three days",
      "CAMDEN, Delaware -- A Delaware animal shelter is trying to care for and rehome thousands of chicks that survived being left in a postal service truck for three days. Trapped in a warm enclosure, without food and water, thousands died before they were discovered.",
      "Involved parties are still awaiting answers as to how 12,000 chicks were abandoned within the truck at a Delaware mail distribution center. The United States Postal Service said in an email that it was aware of a process breakdown and was actively investigating what occurred.",
      "Pennsylvania-based Freedom Ranger Hatchery raised the chicks for their weekly distribution to clients across the country, said a spokesperson for the company. Due to biosecurity concerns, the hatchery cannot take the chicks back.",
      "The spokesperson said it would have been best if USPS, after discovering the chicks, had completed delivery as the recipients would have been adequately equipped to handle the birds \u2014 even malnourished ones.",
      "For more than two weeks, the surviving chicks have been nursed and cared for at First State Animal Center and SPCA, said John Parana, executive director.",
      "Last Tuesday, the shelter began offering the birds for adoption, but only a few hundred out of thousands have been picked up. There is no complete count of the chicks, as the shelter has no feasible way to do so, but Parana estimates there to be more than two thousand available.",
      "Some have inquired about buying the birds for meat, but, as a no-kill shelter and SPCA, those were refused.",
      "The strain has turned the animal care center into a 24/7 operation and necessitated a staffing increase, Parana said. Money remains the biggest concern for the donation-reliant nonprofit. Some employees have begun spending their money to support the operations, he added.",
      "Among the birds were young turkeys, geese and quail, but the vast majority were Freedom Ranger chicks. One concern for the shelter, Parana explained, was the increasing demand for space and feed over time, as Freedom Rangers take about ten weeks to reach maturity.",
      "The Delaware Department of Agriculture, after a call from USPS, directed the animals to the shelter, which shares a memorandum of understanding with the animal center as a state vendor. The department said it is responsible for assisting the shelter with funds \u2014 for chickens, the rate was $5 each per day.",
      "The department's chief of planning, Jimmy Kroon, said negotiations were ongoing, but Parana claims that the department communicated that they had no funds to allocate for the chicks. Both acknowledged the original rate would be unreasonable in the current circumstances.",
      "\u201cThey said that they\u2019re gonna try to go after the post office to get recoupment,\u201d Parana said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t help us in the meantime.\u201d",

      "A split three-judge panel in the nation's capital sided with government lawyers in a lawsuit filed by unions representing federal employees. The majority ruled on technical grounds, finding that the unions don't have the legal right to sue because the Trump administration has said it won't end any collective bargaining agreements while the case is being litigated.",

      "The government says Trump needs the executive order so his administration can cut the federal workforce to ensure strong national security. The law requiring collective bargaining creates exemptions for work related to national security, as in agencies like the FBI.",

      "DALLAS -- Whether it's a road trip to a nearby lake or jumping on a plane to explore a big city, Americans are expected to get away in record numbers over the long Memorial Day weekend even as economic and technical worries rattle the U.S. travel industry.",
      "Over 45 million people \u2014 1.4 million more than last year \u2014 will venture at least 50 miles from their homes between Thursday and next Monday, with the vast majority going by car, auto club organization AAA predicts. The holiday's previous domestic travel record was set 20 years ago.",
      "AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said the analysts who prepared the forecast weren't sure when they started their research if concerns about the economy would cause fewer U.S. residents to plan getaways for the unofficial start of summer, but it doesn't seem to be the case.",
      "\u201cPeople are still feeling pretty good about travel,\u201d Diaz said, adding that some households and individuals may just opt to spend less money on their trips.",
      "Like last year, about 87% of travelers are driving to their Memorial Day destinations, AAA said. About 39 million people, or 1 million more than last year, are expected to take road trips, which Diaz noted many families find easier and cheaper than flying.",
      "\u201cYou leave whenever you want,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can pack as much as you want in the car, make stops along the way.\u201d",
      "AAA's fuel tracker shows motorists can expect to pay less for gasoline this year; the U.S. average price on Sunday was $3.18 for a gallon of regular gas compared to $3.60 a year ago. Renting a vehicle and staying in a hotel also may cost less, according to the most recent Consumer Price Index.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX anticipates the worst holiday traffic will be in the afternoons and evenings. It said drivers hitting the road on Thursday should leave before 12 p.m., and those planning Friday departures should leave before 11 a.m.",
      "On Memorial Day itself, the firm predicts the most congested time on roads will be 4 p.m.-7 p.m.",
      "In 2024, the Friday before Memorial Day was among the record-setting days for the number of airline passengers screened at U.S. airports. While airports should be busy again this Friday, the outlook for air travel this year is unclear.",
      "Air safety has been on the minds of travelers after the deadly midair collision in January of a passenger jet and a U.S. Army helicopter above Washington, D.C. In recent weeks, flight delays and cancellations stemming from an air traffic controller shortage and equipment failures at a facility that directs in and out of the Newark, New Jersey, airport have also made some people wonder whether to get on a plane.",
      "Most major U.S. airlines said they planned to reduce their scheduled domestic flights this summer, citing an ebb in economy passengers booking leisure trips. Bank of America reported this month that its credit card customers were spending less on flights and lodging.",
      "But an analysis by aviation data provider Cirium of Memorial Day weekend tickets bought through online travel sites found an increase of about 3% across two dozen U.S. airports compared to last year. Bookings were down 10% for flights at Washington Dulles International Airport and down 9% for flights at Newark Liberty International Airport, according to Cirium's data.",
      "AAA said the weekend isn\u2019t expected to set a passenger volume record, but the organization estimates that 3.6 million residents are set to fly over the holiday, nearly 2% more than last year. Airfares cost an average of 7.9% less last month than they did a year earlier, according to government price data.",
      "The U.S. travel and tourism industry will watching during the weekend and the weeks ahead to see what might be in store for the summer travel season. Tourism industry experts have warned that anger about the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and rhetoric, and concern about tourist detentions at the U.S. border, have made citizens of some other countries less interested in traveling to the U.S.",
      "The national statistics agency of Canada reported last week that the number of residents making return trips by air from the U.S. fell 20% in April compared to the same month a year earlier, while return trips by car were down 35%.",
      "Across Texas, reservations for day passes and camping spots were filling up at state parks for the weekend, said Tara Humphreys, director of interpretation with Texas State Parks. Stargazing parties were among events planned at parks across the state.",
      "Bolstered by its theme parks and nearby cruise ports, Orlando, Florida, tops AAA's list of most popular domestic destinations for the weekend. The grand opening of the city's newest theme park, Universal's Epic Universe, is scheduled for Thursday.",
      "\u201cA lot of schools are out those days prior to Memorial Day weekend and so it\u2019s just another opportunity for them to enjoy the destination,\u201d Visit Orlando President and CEO Casandra Matej said.",
      "Long weekends are a good time to hop on a short flight to a big city, said Hayley Berg, lead economist at the travel site Hopper. She said top searches for the weekend on the site included New York, Miami and Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cTypically, we see over three-day weekends travelers look for destinations that are a quick flight away, so maybe like a couple hour flight at most,\u201d she said.",
      "Seattle is another top destination, according to AAA booking data, with Memorial Day weekend kicking off the peak Alaska cruise season. Michael Woody, Visit Seattle's senior vice president and chief strategy officer, said that visitors can take in what the city has to offer and also fit in some time in nature.",
      "AAA is also projecting about 2 million people will travel by train, bus or cruise ship over the weekend, an 8.5% increase over last year.",
      "Weather conditions may factor into travel plans and holiday celebrations in some areas. Nick Novella, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service\u2019s Climate Prediction Center, said parts of the Western U.S. were expected to see soaring temperatures over the holiday weekend, while there\u2019s a possibility of heavy rain in parts of the East Coast.",

      "The forecast for this year for the 20 countries that use the euro currency was cut to 0.9% from the previous forecast in November of 1.3%, the European Union's executive commission said Monday in its regular spring forecast.",
      "The forecast for 2026 was cut to 1.4% from 1.6%.",
      "One reason for the lower growth estimate was the stagnating economy in Germany, where growth is expected to be zero this year after two years of shrinking output. Germany's economy is heavily dependent on exports but has faced strong headwinds from higher energy costs after the loss of Russian natural gas due to the invasion of Ukraine as well from lack of pro-growth infrastructure spending and competition from China in autos and industrial machinery.",
      "The proposal for a 20% U.S. tariff on imported goods from Europe in addition to its suspension for 90 days have meant uncertainty \u201cnot seen since the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis. He said the European economy remained \u201cresilient\u201d and that the jobs market remained robust, with the commission predicting a fall in unemployment to a record low 5.7% next year.",
      "And the risks are \u201ctilted to the downside,\u201d he said. One reason: The forecast assumes that the proposed 20% rate can be reduced through negotiations with Washington to the base tariff rate imposed on all countries of 10%.",
      "While the EU's top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, has spoken several times with administration officials it remains uncertain how willing Trump might be to reduce the rate.",

      "The Socialists, meanwhile, are without a leader after Pedro Nuno Santos said he was standing down after the party\u2019s worst result since 1987.",
      "The Democratic Alliance, which also includes the smaller Popular Party, lost a confidence vote in parliament in March as opposition lawmakers teamed up against it. That triggered an early election, which had been due in 2028.",
      "The confidence vote was sparked by a political storm around potential conflicts of interest in the business dealings of Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro\u2019s family law firm. Montenegro has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Corruption scandals have dogged Portuguese politics in recent years, helping fuel the rise of Chega. But the party has recently fallen foul of its own lawmakers\u2019 alleged wrongdoing. One is suspected of stealing suitcases from the Lisbon airport and selling the contents online, and another allegedly faked the signature of a dead woman. Both resigned.",
      "Chega owes much of its success to its demands for a tighter immigration policy that have resonated with voters.",
      "Portugal has witnessed a steep rise in immigration. In 2018, there were fewer than a half-million legal immigrants in the country, according to government statistics. By early this year, there were more than 1.5 million, many of them Brazilians and Asians working in tourism and farming.",
      "Thousands more lack the proper documents to be in Portugal. The Democratic Alliance government announced two weeks before the election that it was expelling about 18,000 foreigners living in the country without authorization. Though such a step is routine, the timing drew accusations that it was trying to capture votes from Chega.",
      "A housing crisis has also fired up debate. House prices and rents have been soaring for the past 10 years, due in part to an influx of white-collar foreigners who have driven up prices.",
      "House prices jumped another 9% last year, said the National Statistics Institute, a government body. Rents in and around the capital Lisbon, where around 1.5 million people live, last year saw the steepest rise in 30 years, climbing more than 7%, the institute said.",
      "The problem is compounded by Portugal being one of Western Europe\u2019s poorest countries.",
      "The average monthly salary last year was around 1,200 euros ($1,340) before tax, according to the statistics agency. The government-set minimum wage this year is 870 euros ($974) a month before tax.",

    "story": [
      "Key economic indicators show China's economy slowing somewhat in April, with retail sales, property and investment coming in weaker than economists had forecast",
      "China\u2019s economy showed signs of slowing in April as President Donald Trump's trade war took a toll, with retail sales, property and investment coming in weaker than economists had forecast.",
      "Industrial production slowed as Trump's painfully high tariffs of up to 145%, and 125% retaliatory duties imposed by Beijing, took effect and shipments were curtailed.",
      "National Statistics Bureau spokesperson Fu Linghui said the general trend was positive though he pointed to \u201cexternal shocks\u201d that had gained intensity.",
      "\u201cIt should also be noted that there are still many outside unstable and uncertain factors, and the foundation for the continued recovery and improvement of the national economy needs to be further consolidated,\u201d Fu said.",
      "Here are a few key indicators reported Monday.",
      "Chinese consumers have been holding back after the shocks of a prolonged downturn in the housing market that is the source of much household wealth. Retail sales rose 5.1% from a year earlier in April, below economists' expectations for a 6% increase.",
      "Fu said Beijing would continue to focus on supporting job creation and spurring more domestic demand.",
      "He also said China must stop prices from falling. The consumer price index fell 0.1% in April. Such deflation is both a symptom of weak demand and also a factor behind shoppers' reluctance to spend, in hopes of getting better deals later.",
      "\u201cThe current overall price level is low, which puts pressure on production and companies' operations and affects jobs and incomes, so it's important to promote a reasonable recovery of prices,\u201d Fu said.",
      "On the U.S. side, consumer sentiment has fallen slightly in May for the fifth straight month, with Americans increasingly worried that the trade war will worsen inflation.",
      "Industrial production rose 6.1% from a year earlier, slowing from 7.7% in March as tariffs and other trade barriers bit into exports.",
      "The truce in Trump's trade war with China has helped, Fu said, calling it \u201cconducive to the growth of bilateral trade and the recovery of the world.\u201d",
      "With tariffs paused for 90 days to allow time for talks, shipments have revived as businesses rush to meet back-to-school and other seasonal deadlines.",
      "But even before Trump took office for the second time in January, China was under pressure from its trading partners for relying too heavily on exports to absorb its excess industrial production.",
      "And if output continues to outpace demand from businesses and consumers, prices will keep falling.",
      "\u201cExport-driven gains in factory output could continue given China\u2019s manufacturing competitiveness and frontloaded orders before the end of the 90-day truce, but this is coming at a persistent deflationary cost,\u201d Louise Loo of Oxford Economics said in a report.",
      "The government reported that fixed asset investment in such things as factories and equipment rose 4% in April in the first four months of the year.",
      "However, property investments fell 10.3% year-on-year in January to April. New home prices also edged lower.",
      "While manufacturing held up better than expected, the pressures from trade are complicating Beijing's effort to keep turn the housing market around and keep the economic recovery on track.",
      "\u201cEstablishing a trough on a national level is taking some time, as the recovery of the property market remains uneven and gradual. It\u2019s possible that tariff-related pessimism and uncertainty kept more buyers on the sidelines in April,\u201d Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Economics said in a report.",

      "Dozens of Indonesians earlier this year were freed from scam centers in Myanmar and repatriated through Thailand, in part of a large-scale regional crackdown effort. Hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have been lured to work in the region to commit global scams through false romances, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes. Many of the workers were recruited under false pretenses, only to find themselves trapped in virtual slavery.",

    "story": [
      "The Tour de France is set for a dramatic finale in July after organizers announced a climb up Montmartre in Paris on the final day",
      "PARIS -- Breaking with tradition at the Tour de France is stirring controversy.",
      "Since race organizers announced plans last week to climb the iconic Montmartre hill in Paris during the final stage in July, the cycling world has been abuzz. Could the climb actually decide the Tour winner? Or disrupt the final sprint by injecting tactical uncertainty into what is usually a celebratory day?",
      "Well, that remains to be seen. But one thing seems certain: The stage will be a spectacle.",
      "At last year\u2019s Olympics, massive crowds lined the streets of Montmartre \u2014 the area in the northern part of Paris that is popular among artists and offers grand vistas of the city \u2014 to cheer on riders.",
      "Inspired by the frenetic atmosphere and willing to build on the momentum, Tour organizers said this month that riders competing in cycling\u2019s biggest race this summer would climb the Montmartre hill and pass beneath the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur basilica before \"battling it out on a stage that may break from the traditions established over the past 50 years in the heart of the capital.\u201d",
      "Traditionally, the Tour final stage is largely processional until a sprint decides the day\u2019s winner on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Last year\u2019s final stage was held outside Paris for the first time since 1905 because of a clash with the Olympics, moving instead to Nice. The world famous avenue is back on the program this year for the conclusion of the 3,320-kilometer (2,060-mile) race.",
      "The inclusion of the steep Montmartre climb could dramatically change the dynamics of the stage. If the hill features just a few kilometers from the finish line, or is climbed several times, pure sprinters will likely be dropped before they can compete for the stage win. And if the general classification remains tight ahead of the final stage, the yellow jersey itself could be decided in Paris.",
      "Full details of the route will be presented at a news conference on Wednesday. With a peloton roughly twice as big as it was at the Olympics, organizers are working with Paris authorities and the Prefecture of police to ensure the security of the race on the narrow and cobbled streets of the area. But some top riders have already expressed their lack of enthusiasm about the addition.",
      "\u201cMontmartre was nice to do in the Olympics, it seemed good, a lot of people, a really good atmosphere,\u201d two-time Tour champion Jonas Vingegaard told reporters this week. \u201cBut when they came to the Montmartre, there was only 15 riders left in the bunch. And when we do the Tour de France, there will be 150 guys fighting for positions on a very narrow climb. It could end up being more stress than they want to have.\u201d",
      "Even Remco Evenepoel, who won the Olympic men\u2019s road race in Paris last year and the gold medal in the time trial, is also opposed to the idea.",
      "\u201cThere will be enough battle for positioning in the first week of the Tour,\" he told sports media Sporza. \"With Montmartre added, that would mean we have to do the same on the last day. We will be tired enough by then.\u201d",
      "Evenepoel also lamented the fact that sprinters would be robbed of a rare chance to claim a prestigious win on the world famous avenue.",
      "\u201cThey get a big chance every year to sprint for a stage win on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es,\" he said. \u201cThat chance is then taken away from them. In my opinion, Montmartre is an unnecessary obstacle.\u201d",
      "Marc Madiot, who manages the Groupama-FDJ team, said bad weather on the final day could make the stage more treacherous.",
      "\u201cImagine a slight rain in Paris; it\u2019s not going to be easy for the riders,\u201d he told RMC Radio. \u201cDo we want a show? Do we want to visit Paris? Do we want to commemorate the Olympics? If we expect a real race, we could be disappointed. And if we do get a real race, we put everything that has happened in the last three weeks in jeopardy.\"",
      "The Tour starts from the northern city of Lille on July 5, and the women\u2019s race kicks off on July 26 from the Brittany town of Vannes.",

      "KATHMANDU, Nepal -- A British climber who scaled Mount Everest for the 19th time, breaking his own record for the most ascents of the world\u2019s highest peak by a non-Sherpa guide, returned from the mountain on Tuesday and said he is already planning his next attempt.",
      "Kenton Cool, 51, from southwest England, scaled the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) summit on Sunday before flying on a helicopter with his clients back to the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu.",
      "\u201cI am 51 now, and I have been coming here since 2004 to climb Everest,\u201d Cool said at Kathmandu's airport on Tuesday. \u201cI have at least one more climb for next year \u2014 maybe 20 or 21 (total). After that I'll start climbing other mountains in Nepal.\u201d",
      "Cool has scaled Mount Everest almost every year since 2004.",
      "He was unable to climb it in 2014 because the season was canceled after 16 Sherpa guides were killed in an avalanche, and again in 2015 when an earthquake triggered an avalanche that killed 19 people. The 2020 climbing season was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Only Nepali Sherpa guides have scaled the peak more times than Cool. Kami Rita holds the record for the most successful ascents of Mount Everest at 30 times. He is currently on the mountain and is expected to attempt to reach the top in the next few days.",
      "Cool said his climb was smooth and that he faced no problems, but he noticed that many climbers were trying to reach the peak on the same day.",
      "Hundreds of climbers and their guides are on the mountain during the popular spring climbing season, hoping to scale the world\u2019s highest peak.",
      "\u201cMountaineering is an amazing sport which is open to everybody, but you just need to be part of it responsibly and we have seen some people coming to Everest \u2014 perhaps they do not have the experience that they should,\u201d Cool said, adding that it was not necessary to limit the number of climbers each season.",
      "Several climbers have already scaled the peak this month and hundreds more and their guides are on the mountain attempting to reach the summit before the climbing season finishes at the end of this month. Weather conditions then deteriorate with the rainy monsoon season making climbing more difficult.",

      "BOSTON -- New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said he'll talk to Juan Soto about hustling out of the batter\u2019s box after the slugger watched his would-be home run bounce off the Green Monster for a single Monday night against the Boston Red Sox.",
      "Leading off the sixth inning on a chilly night at Fenway Park with a 15 mph wind blowing in from left field, Soto hit a 102 mph line drive to left and stood watching as it sailed toward the Green Monster. The ball hit about two-thirds of the way up the 37-foot wall, and Soto was only able to manage a single.",
      "\u201cHe thought he had it,\u201d Mendoza told reporters after his team's 3-1 loss. \u201cBut with the wind and all that, and in this ballpark \u2014 anywhere, but in particular in this one, with that wall right there \u2014 you\u2019ve got to get out of the box. So, yeah, we\u2019ll discuss that.\u201d",
      "Soto stole second on the first pitch to the next batter, but the $765 million star ended up stranded on third. He denied lollygagging on the basepaths.",
      "\u201cI think I\u2019ve been hustling pretty hard,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see it today, you can tell.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not uncommon for balls hit off the Green Monster to result in singles: In the first inning, Pete Alonso was thrown out trying for second base on a ball off the left-field wall. But Soto had also failed to run hard out of the box on a groundout Sunday night at Yankee Stadium.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll talk to him about it,\u201d Mendoza said.",

      "For his first act as a NASCAR All-Star Race champion, Christopher Bell chose to praise the revitalized 78-year-old racetrack that delivered a memorable night of racing.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Bell shouted to roaring approval from a capacity crowd of 25,000 as he made the case Sunday night during his frontstretch celebration that North Wilkesboro Speedway was due a Cup Series points race.",
      "\u201cThe best short track in NASCAR,\u201d Bell said. \u201cIt is absolutely incredible. It\u2019s just going to get better and better. Man, that was an amazing race.\u201d",
      "In its third edition as host of the $1 million exhibition event, the speedway produced All-Star Race records for lead changes (18) and green-flag passes for the lead (59) as its remarkable rebirth continued from a dilapidated and rotting hulk just three years ago.",
      "Speedway Motorsports announced that grandstand seating and premium hospitality were sold out for the 41st All-Star Race, which drew fans from 43 states and nine countries to North Wilkesboro, which is 80 miles north of Charlotte. SMI president and CEO Marcus Smith proclaimed that \u201clike Lambeau Field to football and Fenway Park to baseball, North Wilkesboro Speedway has become America\u2019s throwback racetrack.\u201d",
      "Bell was among several drivers who say the short track deserves its first Cup Series points race in 30 years when NASCAR releases its 2026 schedule, which is expected in a few months.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d seven-time most popular driver winner Chase Elliott said about the possibility after finishing fifth. \u201cI think it\u2019s plenty capable of hosting, and obviously, the crowd seems extremely receptive to the idea, too. Whatever NASCAR decides on that, I\u2019m good with. It put on a good race for sure, so it\u2019s hard to argue against that.\u201d",
      "Aside from a smattering of minor-league races in 2010-11, North Wilkesboro Speedway had sat dormant since Jeff Gordon won its most recent Cup race on Sept. 29, 1996. A $20 million renovation ( spurred by federal funding from the American Rescue Plan ) began in 2022 and led to being awarded the 2023 All-Star Race.",
      "Its first two All-Star Races were lackluster, but North Wilkesboro\u2019s racing came to life Sunday. The 0.625-mile oval\u2019s surface has widened into multiple lanes since a repaving last year, and Sunday\u2019s race featured 1,426 green-flag passes that electrified the jammed grandstands.",
      "\u201cMan, they show up,\u201d Bell said. \u201cWe go out for driver intros, and the place was packed. It\u2019s just bumping. We need more events like this.\u201d",
      "Joe Gibbs, whose team scored its third All-Star Race victory with Bell joining previous winners Kyle Busch in 2015 and Denny Hamlin in 2017, credited Smith and support from the community for putting the track in line for points race consideration.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t be making that decision,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cBut I think the way this race turned out and the crowd and everything, that\u2019ll have a lot to do with it.\u201d",
      "Already sour about a \u201cPromoter\u2019s Caution\u201d that erased his late lead and left him vulnerable on older tires, runner-up Joey Logano took issue with Bell\u2019s winning pass in the No. 20 Toyota. After the drivers made contact that squeezed his No. 22 Ford into the outside wall with nine laps remaining, Logano vowed retaliation if he\u2019d been able to catch Bell.",
      "\u201cI did all I could do to hold him off, and he got under me and released the brake and gave me no option,\u201d said Logano, who led a race-high 139 of 250 laps. \u201cIf I could\u2019ve got to him, he was going around after a move like that. I just couldn\u2019t get back to him. Just frustrated after you lead so many laps, and the car is so fast, and you don\u2019t win. It hurts quite a bit.\u201d",
      "Bell was bemused by Logano\u2019s frustration.",
      "\u201cI had got to him a couple times before, and he made it very difficult on me, as he should,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI got my run, and I took the moment, as I should. I don\u2019t think that I did anything that Joey has not done, and I\u2019ve seen Joey do much worse. We will continue on.\u201d",

      "Two-time defending Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden and Team Penske teammate Will Power will have to start from the final two spots on the grid Sunday after their teams were penalized for violating the rules during qualifying weekend",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Two-time defending Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden and Team Penske teammate Will Power will have to start from the final two spots on the grid Sunday after their teams were penalized for violating the rules during qualifying weekend.",
      "IndyCar also announced Monday that the team strategists for the Nos. 2 and 12 have been suspended for the race; the cars will forfeit their qualification points and pit box selections; and each of the entries has been fined $100,000.",
      "It's the second time in just over a year that Team Penske's IndyCar program has been embroiled in controversy.",
      "\u201cThe integrity of the Indianapolis 500 is paramount,\" IndyCar president Doug Boles said. \u201cAs we look to the remainder of the week and race weekend, we will do everything we can to make it clear that this is not only the best racing on the planet but racing where the best win under completely fair conditions.\u201d",
      "The trouble for Team Penske began before the fast 12 shootout Sunday, when rival team owner Chip Ganassi was among a chorus of competitors who accused it of cheating. They noticed unapproved changes had been made to the rear attenuator, a safety device designed to absorb and deduce the force of impacts, and the assumption was the modifications would have given the two Team Penske cars an aerodynamic advantage in their four-lap qualifying runs.",
      "Tim Cindric, the president of Penske\u2019s IndyCar program, said Power passed inspection but officials had flagged Newgarden\u2019s car, and he was told neither would pass inspection after making their runs. So, the cars were pulled from the lineup altogether.",
      "Boles initially said late Sunday that Newgarden and Power would join teammate Scott McLaughlin \u2014 who had crashed in practice on Sunday and was unable to make a qualifying run \u2014 in the fourth row for the race. But after the series gathered more facts and considered the case, the decision was made to put Newgarden in the 32nd starting spot and Will Power in the 33rd.",
      "McLaughlin will keep the 10th starting spot because his wrecked car was found to have used a legal attenuator.",
      "\u201cThis violation of the IndyCar rule against modification to this part and using it \u2018as supplied\u2019 is clear,\u201d Boles said. \"The penalty should be more than simply starting where the cars might have qualified anyway, if given the opportunity. The cars belong in the field as two of the fastest 33, however, starting on the tail of the field is the appropriate penalty in this instance.\u201d",
      "One year ago, Team Penske was caught in a push-to-pass scandal in which Newgarden was found to have access to an additional boost of horsepower when he should not have at the season-opener. He was stripped of his win and team owner Roger Penske \u2014 who also owns IndyCar and Indianapolis Motor Speedway \u2014 suspended Cindric for two races, including the Indy 500.",
      "Also suspended were managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and data engineer Robbie Atkinson.",
      "Cindric and Ruzewski will now miss their second consecutive Indy 500.",
      "\u201cAs far as I'm concerned, this case is closed,\u201d Boles said.",
      "Newgarden, who is trying to become the first driver in 109 years to win three consecutive Indy 500s, was a contender to win the pole. He was seen running off his anger in the infield of the speedway Sunday as another qualifying session roared on.",
      "Pato O\u2019Ward, who drives for rival Arrow McLaren, said after qualifying on the front row that IndyCar should have penalized the Penske cars by making them run in a last-chance qualifier to re-earn spots on the 33-car starting grid. He also expressed sympathy for the four drivers who had to compete for the final three spots with Jacob Abel missing the race.",
      "\u201cI feel bad for Abel and everybody who did the last-chance qualifying. Those cars weren\u2019t in regulation,\u201d O\u2019Ward said of the two Penske cars. \u201cThose cars should have been in the last-chance qualifier ... because they had that (Saturday), I guarantee you.\"",
      "O'Ward also openly wondered why Team Penske continues to push the envelope on rules.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\" he said. \"They\u2019re a great team. They have great drivers. Why are you doing that? It makes no sense.\u201d",

      "Google on Tuesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence technology to accelerate a year-old makeover of its search engine that is changing the way people get information and curtailing the flow of internet traffic to websites",
      "Google on Tuesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence technology to accelerate a year-long makeover of its search engine that is changing the way people get information and curtailing the flow of internet traffic to websites.",
      "The next phase outlined at Google's annual developers conference includes releasing a new \u201cAI mode\u201d option in the United States. The feature makes interacting with Google's search engine more like having a conversation with an expert capable of answering questions on just about any topic imaginable.",
      "AI mode is being offered to all comers in the U.S. just two-and-half-months after the company began testing with a limited Labs division audience.",
      "Google is also feeding its latest AI model Gemini 2.5, into its search algorithms and will soon begin testing other AI features, such as the ability to automatically buy tickets to concerts and conduct searches through live video feeds.",
      "The expansion builds upon a transformation that began a year ago with the introduction of conversational summaries called \u201cAI overviews\u201d that have been increasingly appearing at the top of its results page and eclipsing its traditional rankings of web links.",
      "About 1.5 billion people now regularly engage with \u201cAI overviews,\u201d according to Google, and most users are now entering longer and more complex queries.",
      "\u201cWhat all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said before a packed crowd in an amphitheater near the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters.",
      "Although Pichai and other Google executives predicted AI overviews would trigger more searches and ultimately more clicks to other sites, it hasn't worked out that way so far, according to the findings of search optimization firm BrightEdge.",
      "Clickthrough rates from Google's search results have declined by nearly 30% during the past year, according to BrightEdge's recently released study, which attributed the decrease to people becoming increasingly satisfied with AI overviews.",
      "The decision to make AI mode broadly available after a relatively short test period reflects Google's confidence that the technology won't habitually spew misinformation that tarnishes its brand's reputation, and acknowledges the growing competition from other AI-powered search options from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity.",
      "The rapid rise of AI alternatives emerged as a recurring theme in legal proceedings that could force Google to dismantle parts of its internet empire after a federal judge last year declared its search engine to be an illegal monopoly.",
      "In testimony during a trial earlier this month, longtime Apple executive Eddy Cue said Google searches done through the iPhone maker's Safari browser have been declining because more people are leaning on AI-powered alternatives.",
      "And Google has cited the upheaval being caused by AI's rise as one of the main reasons that it should only be required to make relatively minor changes to the way it operates its search engine because technology already is changing the competitive landscape.",
      "But Google's reliance on more AI so far appears to be enabling its search engine to maintain its mantle as the internet's main gateway \u2014 a position that's main reason its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., boasts a market value of $2 trillion.",
      "During the year ending in March, Google received 136 billion monthly visits, nearly 29 times more than ChatGPT, according to data compiled by onelittleweb.com.",
      "Even Google's own AI mode acknowledged that the company's search engine seems unlikely to be significantly hurt by the shift to AI technology when a reporter from The Associated Press asked whether its introduction would make the company even more powerful.",
      "\u201cYes, it is highly highly that Google's AI mode will make Google more powerful, particularly in the realm of information access and online influence,\u201d the AI mode responded. The feature also warns web publishers should be concerned about AI mode reducing the traffic that they get from search results.",
      "Google's upcoming tests in its Labs division foreshadow the next wave of AI technology likely to be made available to the masses.",
      "Besides using its Project Mariner technology to test the ability of an AI agent to buy tickets and book restaurant reservations, Google will also experiment with searches done through live video and an opt-in option to give its AI technology access to people's Gmail so it can learn more about a user's tastes and interests. Other features on this summer's test list include a \u201cDeep Search\u201d option that will use AI to dig even deeper into complex topics and another tool that will produce graphical presentations of sports and finance data.",
      "Google is also introducing its equivalent of VIP access to all its AI technology with an \u201cUltra\u201d subscription package that will cost $250 per month and include 30 terabytes of storage, too. That's a big step beyond Google's previous top-of-the-line AI \u201cpro\u201d package that cost $20 per month and included two terabytes of storage. \u2014\u2014",
      "The Associated Press and Google have a licensing and technology agreement that gives Google\u2019s Gemini AI chatbot access to AP\u2019s news coverage.",

      "In April, John Moolenaar, chairperson of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, wrote to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America to demand that the two American banks withdraw from their work on CATL's IPO. But the two banks stayed on.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure.",
      "Monday\u2019s 66-32 procedural vote keeps one of President Donald Trump\u2019s top legislative priorities on track for passage and highlights the growing political strength of the cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily in last year\u2019s election and has amassed a large war chest for next year\u2019s midterms. Several Democrats reversed and voted to move forward with the legislation after negotiations with Republicans in recent days.",
      "The fate of the legislation, which would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S., had been uncertain in recent weeks despite early bipartisan support. Senate Democrats blocked it earlier this month in part over concerns about how Trump and his family were benefiting from private crypto endeavors, including a newly launched stablecoin.",
      "Republicans won support from Democrats after strengthening regulations on foreign issuers, beefing up enforcement and barring large tech companies like Meta and Google from issuing their own stablecoins. The Senate will now consider the bill and could vote on final passage as soon as this week, depending on the number of amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans.",
      "Still, Democrats were divided on the legislation. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others have said the bill could help Trump enrich himself and needs stronger protections.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the final bill does nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 to rein in the President\u2019s crypto corruption,\u201d Warren said ahead of the bill\u2019s passage. She said the legislation would \u201caccelerate Trump\u2019s corruption by supercharging the size of the stablecoin market\u201d and make Trump \u201cthe regulator of his own financial product.\u201d",
      "Negotiators added tougher ethics rules for members of Congress and the executive branch, including preventing members of Congress from issuing stablecoins. But Warren and several other Democrats said it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThis Congress should be a check on the president,\u201d Warren said.",
      "The bill would aim to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws.",
      "Stablecoins are a fast-growing corner of the cryptocurrency industry that have produced enormous profits for some of the major players involved. They offer a buffer from cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility because they are pegged to real-world assets, like U.S. dollars or gold. Typically, that means a single stablecoin is worth $1, making them a much more reliable digital asset for commercial transactions than other forms of crypto.",
      "The move to regulate the industry has been bipartisan, but Trump\u2019s involvement in the crypto industry complicated the legislation\u2019s path. Trump launched a meme coin earlier this year that has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And he is set to attend a dinner May 22 that\u2019s open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins.",
      "Another Trump-family linked crypto venture called World Liberty Financial recently announced that it was issuing its own stablecoin, called USD1. The stablecoin got a huge boost when World Liberty Financial announced last week that an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "A former skeptic turned zealous promoter, Trump has promised to usher in a golden age for the cryptocurrency industry. His administration has already taken many early actions without Congress to boost crypto, including establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and undoing previous enforcement actions. But Trump needs Congress to get some of his and the deep-pocketed industry\u2019s top priorities passed, including enacting the stablecoin legislation.",
      "Democratic supporters of the legislation argued that Congress can\u2019t step aside just because of Trump\u2019s involvement in the market.",
      "\u201cThe stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can\u2019t afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\u201d said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, one of the lead Democratic negotiators on the legislation. \u201cWe need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has signed the Take It Down Act into law",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday signed into law the Take It Down Act, a measure that imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation that first lady Melania Trump helped usher through Congress, and he had her sign it, too, despite what sounded like a mild objection on her part.",
      "\u201cC'mon, sign it anyway,\u201d the president told his wife. \u201cShe deserves to sign it,\u201d he said.",
      "After she added her signature, the president showed the document bearing both of their names to the audience at the signing ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Melania Trump's signature is merely symbolic because first ladies are not elected and have no formal role in the signing of legislation.",
      "In March, Melania Trump used her first public appearance since resuming the role of first lady to travel to Capitol Hill to lobby House members to pass the bill following its approval by the Senate.",
      "At a signing ceremony, she called the new law a \u201cnational victory\u201d that will help protect children from online exploitation, including through the use of artificial intelligence to make fake images.",
      "\u201cAI and social media are the digital candy for the next generation, sweet addictive and engineered to have an impact on the cognitive development of our children,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unlike sugar, these new technologies can be weaponized, shape beliefs and, sadly, affect emotions and even be deadly.\u201d",
      "The president said the proliferation of images made using AI means that \u201ccountless women have been harassed with deepfakes and other explicit images distributed against their will.\u201d He said what's happening is \u201cjust so horribly wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, we're making it totally illegal,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The bill makes it a federal crime to \u201cknowingly publish\u201d or threaten to publish intimate images without a person\u2019s consent, including AI-created \u201cdeepfakes.\u201d Websites and social media companies will be required to remove such material within 48 hours after a victim requests it. The platforms must also take steps to delete duplicate content.",
      "Many states have already banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn, but the Take It Down Act is a rare example of federal regulators imposing on internet companies.",
      "The bill, sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, passing the House in April by a 409-2 vote and clearing the Senate by unanimous consent.",
      "But the measure isn't without critics. Free speech advocates and digital rights groups say the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images, including legal pornography and LGBTQ content. Others say it could allow the government to monitor private communications and undermine due process.",
      "The first lady appeared at a Capitol Hill roundtable with lawmakers and young women who had explicit images of them put online, saying it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see what teenagers and especially girls go through after this happens to them. She also included a victim among her guests for the president's address to a joint session of Congress the day after that meeting.",
      "After the House passed the bill, Melania Trump said the bipartisan vote was a \u201cpowerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy and safety of our children.\u201d",
      "Her advocacy for the bill is a continuation of the Be Best campaign she started in the president's first term, focusing on children's well-being, social media use and opioid abuse.",
      "In his speech to Congress in March, the president said he looked forward to signing the bill.",
      "\u201cAnd I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said, adding, that there's nobody who \"gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.\u201d",

      "Scientists have found evidence of monkey kidnappings in Panama",
      "WASHINGTON -- A baby howler monkey clung to the back of an older male monkey, its tiny fingers grasping fur. But they're not related and not even the same species.",
      "Scientists spotted surprising evidence of what they describe as monkey kidnappings while reviewing video footage from a small island of Panama. The capuchin monkeys were seen carrying at least 11 howler babies between 2022 and 2023.",
      "\u201cThis was very much a shocking finding,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Goldsborough, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like this in the animal kingdom.\"",
      "The monkeys' motivations remain under investigation. Capuchins are house cat-size monkeys found in South America and Central America. They are long-lived, clever and learn new behaviors from each other. One group of capuchins in Panama has even learned to use stone tools to crack open nuts and seafood.",
      "Goldsberg and other researchers at Max Planck and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute had set up more than 80 cameras to study capuchin tool use, but were surprised to see the first howler babies appear in early 2022.",
      "The footage showed the capuchins walking and pounding their stone tools with baby howlers on their backs. But cameras did not capture the moments of abduction, which scientists said likely happened up in the trees, where howlers spend most of their time.",
      "\u201cOur window into this story is constrained,\u201d said co-author Margaret Crofoot of Max Planck and the Smithsonian. The findings were published Monday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "In most or all cases, the baby howlers died, researchers said. Infant howler monkeys would normally be carried by their mothers while still nursing. All the babies in the video -- from a few weeks to a few months in age -- were too young to be weaned.",
      "\u201cA hopeful part of me wants to believe some escaped and went back to their mothers, but we don\u2019t know,\" said Crofoot.",
      "The videos recorded a few instances of young capuchin males still carrying howler babies that had died, likely from starvation. Many animals -- from gorillas to orcas -- have been observed carrying their own dead offspring, though scientists aren\u2019t sure the reasons.",
      "Why did the capuchin males do it? There were no signs of deliberate aggression toward the babies and they weren\u2019t eaten, ruling out predation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all spent hours wracking our brains why they would do this,\u201d said Goldsborough.",
      "The first baby-snatcher may have had a confused \u201ccaring motivation,\u201d or parental instinct, because he showed gentleness interacting with the infants, she said. Then four other males copied his actions.",
      "The researchers said they don't believe the capuchins harmed the babies on purpose. So far, only one group of capuchins has been known to kidnap.",
      "The research shows the \u201cremarkable behavioral variation across social groups of the same species,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France, who was not involved in the study.",

      "Health agencies working under Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. clinched the political support needed to become the nation\u2019s top health official by pledging to work within the decades-old federal system for approval and use of vaccines. Yet his regulators are promising big changes that cloud the outlook for what shots might even be available.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration will soon \u201cunleash a massive framework\u201d for how vaccines are tested and approved, according to Commissioner Marty Makary. Details aren't yet public but the plan is being overseen by the agency's new vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, an outspoken critic of the FDA's handling of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "Makary and other Trump administration officials already have taken unprecedented steps that raise uncertainty about next fall's COVID-19 vaccinations, including delaying FDA scientists' full approval of Novavax's shot \u2014 and then restricting its use to people at higher risk from the virus. They've also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products requiring extra testing.",
      "The changes cross multiple health agencies.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn't yet acted on an influential advisory panel's recent recommendations on use of a new meningitis shot or broader RSV vaccination. A meeting of Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d allies was recently told to expect an end to COVID-19 booster recommendations for children \u2014 something that vaccine advisory panel was supposed to debate in June. And researchers around the country lost National Institutes of Health funding to study vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cI think you have to assume that RFK Jr.\u2019s intention is to make it harder for vaccines to come to market,\u201d said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a vaccine expert at Johns Hopkins University. The changes are \u201clooked at suspiciously because this is someone with a proven track record of evading the value of vaccines.\u201d",
      "In a Senate health committee hearing last week, Kennedy wrongly claimed that the only vaccines tested against a placebo, or dummy shot, were for COVID-19.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the committee, briefly interrupted the hearing to say, \u201cFor the record, that\u2019s not true\" \u2014 pointing to placebo-controlled studies of the rotavirus, measles and HPV vaccines.",
      "Concerned by rhetoric about how vaccines are tested, a group of doctors recently compiled a list of more than 120 vaccine clinical trials spanning decades, most of them placebo-controlled, including for shots against polio, hepatitis B, mumps and tetanus.",
      "\u201cIt directly debunks the claim that vaccines were never tested against placebo,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, a Stanford University infectious disease physician who\u2019s helping lead the project.",
      "Antivaccine groups argue that some substances scientists call a placebo may not really qualify, although the list shows simple saline shots are common.",
      "Sometimes a vaccine causes enough shot-site pain or swelling that it\u2019s evident who\u2019s getting the vaccine and who\u2019s in the control group \u2014 and studies might use another option that slightly irritates the skin to keep the test \u201cblinded,\u201d Scott explained.",
      "And when there\u2019s already a proven vaccine for the same disease, it\u2019s unethical to test a new version against a placebo, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t always expect placebo-controlled trials,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that be communicated clearly to the public, but it\u2019s challenging especially when there\u2019s so much noise in social media and so much misinformation.\u201d",
      "The administration's promise of a new vaccine framework comes ahead of a Thursday meeting where FDA advisers will discuss updating COVID-19 shots for this fall and winter.",
      "The FDA\u2019s credibility has long rested on the independence of its scientific decisions. While the agency is led by a handful of political appointees, approval decisions are almost always handled by career scientists.",
      "But that standard appears to be shifting. FDA staffers were poised to approve Novavax\u2019s vaccine early last month but the decision was delayed by administration officials, including Makary, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss agency matters. The shot was approved late Friday with unusual restrictions.",
      "Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg \u2014 a political appointee serving as Makary's special assistant \u2014 was involved in the unprecedented demand that Novavax conduct a new clinical trial of its shot after approval, according to the people. The requirement came shortly after the agency's longtime vaccine chief, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign.",
      "Hoeg \u2014 along with Makary and Prasad \u2014 spent much of the COVID-19 pandemic criticizing the FDA\u2019s handling of booster shots, particularly in children and young adults. All three were co-authors of a 2022 paper stating that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more harm than benefit.",
      "Novavax isn\u2019t the only vaccine manufacturer already affected by changing attitudes at FDA. Earlier this month, Moderna pushed back the target date for its new COVID-and-flu combination vaccine to next year after the FDA requested additional effectiveness data.",
      "As the FDA\u2019s top official overseeing vaccines, Prasad is now in position to reverse what he recently called \u201ca number of missteps\u201d in how the FDA assessed the benefits and risks of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "He questioned how much benefit yearly vaccinations continue to offer. In a podcast shortly before assuming his FDA job, Prasad suggested companies could study about 20,000 older adults in August or September to show if an updated vaccine prevented COVID-related hospitalizations.",
      "There is \u201clegitimate debate about who should be boosted, how frequently they should be boosted and the value of boosting low-risk individuals,\u201d said Hopkins' Adalja. But he stressed that CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has the proper expertise to be making those decisions.",
      "And other experts say simply updating the strain that a COVID-19 vaccine targets doesn't make it a new product \u2014 and real-world data shows each fall's update has offered benefit.",
      "\"The data are clear and compelling\u201d that vaccination reduces seniors' risk of hospitalization and serious illness for four to six months, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher.",
      "Nor could that kind of study be accomplished quickly enough to get millions of people vaccinated before the yearly winter surge, said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief.",
      "\"You'd always be doing clinical trials and you'd never have a vaccine that was up to date,\u201d he said.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted",
      "ATLANTA -- President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted. Voting equipment, it says, should not use ballots that include \u201ca barcode or quick-response code.\u201d",
      "Those few technical words could have a big impact.",
      "Voting machines that give all voters a ballot with one of those codes are used in hundreds of counties across 19 states. Three of them -- Georgia, South Carolina and Delaware -- use the machines statewide.",
      "Some computer scientists, Democrats and left-leaning election activists have raised concerns about their use, but those pushing conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election have been the loudest, claiming without evidence that manipulation has already occurred. Trump, in justifying the move, said in the order that his intention was \u201cto protect election integrity.\u201d",
      "Even some election officials who have vouched for the accuracy of systems that use coded ballots have said it\u2019s time to move on because too many voters don\u2019t trust them.",
      "Colorado\u2019s secretary of state, Democrat Jena Griswold, decided in 2019 to stop using ballots with QR codes, saying at the time that voters \u201cshould have the utmost confidence that their vote will count.\u201d Amanda Gonzalez, the elections clerk in Colorado\u2019s Jefferson County, doesn't support Trump's order but believes Colorado's decision was a worthwhile step.",
      "\u201cWe can just eliminate confusion,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s what I want -- elections that are free, fair, transparent.\u201d",
      "Whether voting by mail or in person, millions of voters across the country mark their selections by using a pen to fill in ovals on paper ballots. Those ballots are then fed through a tabulating machine to tally the votes and can be retrieved later if a recount is needed.",
      "In other places, people voting in person use a touch-screen machine to mark their choices and then get a paper record of their votes that includes a barcode or QR code. A tabulator scans the code to tally the vote.",
      "Election officials who use that equipment say it\u2019s secure and that they routinely perform tests to ensure the results match the votes on the paper records, which they retain. The coded ballots have nevertheless become a target of election conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cI think the problem is super exaggerated,\u201d said Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cI understand why it can appeal to certain parts of the public who don\u2019t understand the way this works, but I think it\u2019s being used to try to question certain election results in the past.\u201d",
      "Those pushing conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election have latched onto a long-running legal battle over Georgia's voting system. In that case, a University of Michigan computer scientist testified that an attacker could tamper with the QR codes to change voter selections and install malware on the machines.",
      "The testimony from J. Alex Halderman has been used to amplify Trump\u2019s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, even though there is no evidence that any of the weaknesses he found were exploited.",
      "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has defended the state's voting system as secure. In March, the judge who presided over Halderman's testimony declined to block the use of Georgia\u2019s voting equipment but said the case had \u201cidentified substantial concerns about the administration, maintenance and security of Georgia\u2019s electronic in-person voting system.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s election executive order is being challenged in multiple lawsuits. One has resulted in a preliminary injunction against a provision that sought to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote.",
      "The section banning ballots that use QR or barcodes relies on a Trump directive to a federal agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which sets voluntary guidelines for voting systems. Not all states follow them.",
      "Some of the lawsuits say Trump doesn\u2019t have the authority to direct the commission because it was established by Congress as an independent agency.",
      "While the courts sort that out, the commission\u2019s guidelines say ballots using barcodes or QR codes should include a printed list of the voters\u2019 selections so they can be checked.",
      "Trump\u2019s order exempts voting equipment used by voters with disabilities, but it promises no federal money to help states and counties shift away from systems using QR or barcodes.",
      "\u201cIn the long run, it would be nice if vendors moved away from encoding, but there\u2019s already evidence of them doing that,\u201d said Pamela Smith, president of the group Verified Voting.",
      "Kim Dennison, election coordinator of Benton County, Arkansas, estimated that updating the county's voting system would cost around $400,000 and take up to a year.",
      "Dennison said she has used equipment that relies on coded ballots since she started her job 15 years ago and has never found an inaccurate result during postelection testing.",
      "\u201cI fully and completely trust the equipment is doing exactly what it\u2019s supposed to be doing and not falsifying reports,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot change a vote once it\u2019s been cast.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania\u2019s Luzerne County, voting machines that produce a QR code will be used in this year\u2019s primary. But officials expect a manufacturer\u2019s update later this year to remove the code before the November elections.",
      "County Manager Romilda Crocamo said officials had not received any complaints from voters about QR codes but decided to make the change when Dominion Voting Systems offered the update.",
      "The nation\u2019s most populous county, Los Angeles, uses a system with a QR code that it developed over a decade and deployed in 2020 after passing a state testing and certification program.",
      "The county\u2019s chief election official, Dean Logan, said the system exceeded federal guidelines at the time and meets many of the standards outlined in the most recent ones approved in 2021. He said postelection audits have consistently confirmed its accuracy.",
      "Modifying or replacing it would be costly and take years, he said. The county\u2019s current voting equipment is valued at $140 million.",
      "Perhaps nowhere has the issue been more contentious than Georgia, a presidential battleground. It uses the same QR code voting system across the state.",
      "Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a lead plaintiff in the litigation over the system, said her group has not taken a position on Trump's executive order but said the federal Election Assistance Commission should stop certifying machines that use barcodes.",
      "The secretary of state said the voting system follows Georgia law, which requires federal certification at the time the system is bought. Nevertheless, the Republican-controlled legislature has voted to ban the use of QR codes but did not allocate any money to make the change \u2014 a cost estimated at $66 million.",
      "Republicans said they want to replace the system when the current contract expires in 2028, but their law is still scheduled to take effect next year. GOP state Rep. Victor Anderson said there is no realistic way to \u201cprevent the train wreck that\u2019s coming.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s not really about the books.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has instead morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers, as the White House tries to wrest control of what has for centuries been a legislative institution.",
      "It\u2019s a power struggle with potentially vast consequences. The Library of Congress not only stores the world's largest collection of books but also an office overseeing reams of copyrighted material of untold value.",
      "There is a research institute that has long been protected from outside influence. Its servers house extremely sensitive information regarding claims of workplace violations on Capitol Hill, as well as payments and other financial data for the legislative branch\u2019s more than 30,000 employees. There\u2019s even speculation that the whole affair is tied to an ongoing debate over whether big tech companies can use copyrighted material for artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Because of this, the battle over control of the Library of Congress has prompted Republican leaders on Capitol Hill to deliver rare pushback against a president who has pressed to expand the boundaries of his own power to enact his priorities. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Republicans have been talking with the White House about a potential path to d\u00e9tente.",
      "This all has left the library in a bizarre state of purgatory.",
      "For now, Trump's choices for interim library leaders \u2014 most notably Todd Blanche, a deputy attorney general who had represented the president in his criminal proceedings \u2014 have not appeared to challenge the assertion by the library that one of its veteran officials would be the acting head. It would be unheard of for an executive branch official such as Blanche to simultaneously serve in the legislative branch, according to experts.",
      "\u201cThis egregious overreach into the legislature by the executive branch is just unwarranted and, we believe, unprecedented,\u201d said New York Rep. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, which oversees the Library of Congress.",
      "The controversy began to unfold publicly last week, when Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden was fired in a terse email from a White House official. She had just one year left in her 10-year term.",
      "Then this week, Blanche was tapped by the White House to be the interim librarian, and two other Justice Department officials were chosen for other senior library posts. Those officials, Brian Nieves and Paul Perkins, tried unsuccessfully to enter the U.S. Copyright Office on Monday, but left voluntarily after library officials called Capitol Police.",
      "Thune told The Associated Press that Congress was \u201cnot entirely\u201d consulted ahead of Trump\u2019s dismissal of Hayden.",
      "Lawmakers want to ensure that \u201ccongressional legislative branch equities are protected,\u201d Thune said. He speculated that discussions with the White House to resolve the standoff would bleed into next week.",
      "The White House has said Trump was within his authority to dismiss Hayden, a former head of the library systems in Baltimore. It cited \u201cquite concerning\u201d behavior from Hayden involving diversity, equity and inclusion efforts as well as books for children that the White House found inappropriate.",
      "A copy of virtually every book published in the U.S. is sent to the Copyright Office, then the library decides whether to include it in the main collection. No one under 16 can get a reader card to access the collection.",
      "Existing regulations and past practices call for an acting librarian to come from the Library of Congress\u2019 current ranks if there is a vacancy. But the White House has argued that a law governing federal vacancies applies, even though the 1998 law deals with the executive branch, according to two people familiar with the discussions.",
      "When Nieves and Perkins showed up on Monday, they held a letter that invoked the vacancies law to justify their appointments, according to one of the people.",
      "Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who leads the panel overseeing funding for the Library of Congress, argued that in practice, the librarian is not a legislative branch employee, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s an appointment by the president of the United States, because we have to confirm her.\u201d",
      "Yet there is deep concern among lawmakers and aides about any unjustified intrusion of the administration into the Library of Congress and its operations.",
      "Especially worrisome to them is potential meddling with the Congressional Research Service, known as the nonpartisan think tank of Capitol Hill. It fields roughly 75,000 requests from members of Congress every year for research, legal expertise and other information critical for policymaking.",
      "The discussions between lawmakers and the Congressional Research Service are considered so sensitive that they are protected under the speech or debate clause of the Constitution, which shields members of Congress from being questioned -\u2013 such as in court -\u2013 about official legislative acts.",
      "The service's \u201cutility and trustworthiness would be substantially undercut if these inquiries were not protected or the Administration sought to shape responses to reflect its priorities,\u201d said Hope O\u2019Keeffe, a former associate general counsel at the Library of Congress.",
      "The library also oversees the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, which functions as the human resources office of the legislative branch, fielding complaints about harassment, discrimination and other workplace violations. It also stores financial information about legislative branch employees, who include not just those at the Library of Congress, lawmakers and their aides, but employees of the Capitol Police, the Architect of the Capitol and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian, told library staffers shortly after Hayden\u2019s firing that he will serve as the acting librarian. He said in a note this week that while the White House had appointed its own acting librarian, \u201cwe have not yet received direction from Congress about how to move forward,\u201d indicating that the library was defying Trump\u2019s wishes.",
      "California Sen. Alex Padilla, the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, this week said flatly that Newlen is the acting librarian of Congress. Asked whether Blanche was respecting that, Padilla said, \u201cthat\u2019s my understanding.\u201d",
      "But a White House official stressed on Thursday that Trump selected Blanche to be the acting librarian. The official, granted anonymity because of the ongoing private discussions with lawmakers, said Trump chose Blanche because the president is \u201cappointing highly-qualified individuals who are wholeheartedly committed to advancing the America-first agenda.\" The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Some suspect that the Copyright Office is the true aim of the administration. Housed in the Library of Congress with a leader chosen by the librarian, the office accepts millions of copies of copyrighted material such as books, artwork and music every year as part of the copyright registration process.",
      "Shortly before the director of the office, Shira Perlmutter, was fired, her office released a report that questioned whether it was legal for the tech industry to use copyrighted material to \u201ctrain\u201d their artificial intelligence systems. Tech companies contend that doing so is legal when used for educational or research purposes or creating something new. Perlmutter\u2019s report said doing so, in some circumstances, would go beyond established boundaries of fair use when the AI-generated content is competing with creative works made by people.",
      "The material there is extremely valuable. For instance, copyright violation damages for the office's existing collection \u2014 if, for instance, tech companies scraped the material for AI purposes and then later were found liable for copyright infringement \u2014 would likely exceed $1.5 trillion, according to a person familiar with the calculations.",
      "Morelle noted that the firing came \u201cone day after, and I doubt there\u2019s any coincidence to this, a report which is in many ways at odds with what Elon Musk wants to do around intellectual property and copyright.\u201d Musk is the billionaire outside adviser for Trump who operates his own AI startup, called xAI. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Fortnite says it\u2019s unavailable on Apple\u2019s iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe",
      "NEW YORK -- Fortnite says it's now unavailable on Apple's iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 marking the latest twist in a yearslong feud.",
      "Apple pulled Epic Games-owned Fortnite from its app store back in 2020, just two years after the widely-popular, multiplayer survival game had launched on iOS and garnered millions of users. iPhone players in the U.S. have been locked out since, although Apple users in the EU had been able to download the game through an alternative store over the last nine months.",
      "Following years of a tense litigation, a recent court ruling was set to clear the way for Fortnite to finally return to iOS users in the U.S., too. But the video game said early Friday that a move from Apple has prevented that \u2014 and, as a result, Fortnite says it's now dark on iOS globally.",
      "\u201cApple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the U.S. App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,\" Fortnite wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \u201cSadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.\"",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Apple said it had asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update \u201cwithout including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.\u201d Sweden is where Epic\u2019s developer account for its alternative app store is based.",
      "But, Apple added, it \"did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces.\u201d",
      "Epic did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "In the U.S., Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple back in 2020, alleging the technology trendsetter was illegally using its power to gouge game makers. After a monthlong trial in 2021, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled against most of Epic\u2019s claims, but ordered Apple to loosen its previously-exclusive control over the payments made for in-app commerce and allow links to alternative options in the U.S. for the first time \u2014 threatening to undercut sizable commissions that Apple had been collecting from in-app transactions for over a decade.",
      "After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system.",
      "Epic fired back by alleging Apple was thumbing its nose at the legal system, reviving another round of court hearings that lasted nearly a year before Gonzalez Rogers delivered a stinging rebuke last month \u2014 which held Apple in civil contempt and banned the company from collecting any commission on alternative payment systems.",
      "That ruling cleared the way for Epic to finally return to the iPhone app store in the U.S., a reinstatement the video game maker was anticipating before Apple\u2019s latest move.",
      "Fortnite's availability in the EU, meanwhile, is under an alternative store for iPhone users \u2014 now called the Epic Games Store. Apple cleared the way for this last year under new regulatory pressures. Prior to Friday, Fortnite and other Epic games had been available for download on iPhones using this store in the EU since August 2024.",
      "Before the companies' prolonged legal battle, Epic launched Fortnite on iOS in April 2018. Between then and its August 2020 removal, 116 million users accessed Fortnite on iOS devices, company filings note \u2014 raking in a daily average of about 2.5 million players, which represented about 10% of Fortnite's total daily traffic at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, says an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d led its Grok chatbot to post unsolicited claims on social media about the persecution and \u201cgenocide\u201d of white people in South Africa",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company said an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d to its chatbot Grok was the reason why it kept talking about South African racial politics and the subject of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d on social media this week.",
      "An employee at xAI made a change that \u201cdirected Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic,\u201d which \u201cviolated xAI\u2019s internal policies and core values,\u201d the company said in an explanation posted late Thursday that promised reforms.",
      "A day earlier, Grok kept posting publicly about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa in response to users of Musk\u2019s social media platform X who asked it a variety of questions, most having nothing to do with South Africa.",
      "One exchange was about streaming service Max reviving the HBO name. Others were about video games or baseball but quickly veered into unrelated commentary on alleged calls to violence against South Africa\u2019s white farmers. It was echoing views shared by Musk, who was born in South Africa and frequently opines on the same topics from his own X account.",
      "Computer scientist Jen Golbeck was curious about Grok's unusual behavior so she tried it herself before the fixes were made Wednesday, sharing a photo she had taken at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show and asking, \u201cis this true?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe claim of white genocide is highly controversial,\" began Grok's response to Golbeck. \"Some argue white farmers face targeted violence, pointing to farm attacks and rhetoric like the \u2018Kill the Boer\u2019 song, which they see as incitement.\u201d",
      "The episode was the latest window into the complicated mix of automation and human engineering that leads generative AI chatbots trained on huge troves of data to say what they say.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even really matter what you were saying to Grok,\u201d said Golbeck, a professor at the University of Maryland, in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt would still give that white genocide answer. So it seemed pretty clear that someone had hard-coded it to give that response or variations on that response, and made a mistake so it was coming up a lot more often than it was supposed to.\"",
      "Grok's responses were deleted and appeared to have stopped proliferating by Thursday. Neither xAI nor X returned emailed requests for comment but on Thursday, xAI said it had \u201cconducted a thorough investigation\u201d and was implementing new measures to improve Grok's transparency and reliability.",
      "Musk has spent years criticizing the \u201cwoke AI\u201d outputs he says come out of rival chatbots, like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, and has pitched Grok as their \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d alternative.",
      "Musk has also criticized his rivals' lack of transparency about their AI systems, fueling criticism in the hours between the unauthorized change \u2014 at 3:15 a.m. Pacific time Wednesday \u2014 and the company's explanation nearly two days later.",
      "\u201cGrok randomly blurting out opinions about white genocide in South Africa smells to me like the sort of buggy behavior you get from a recently applied patch. I sure hope it isn\u2019t. It would be really bad if widely used AIs got editorialized on the fly by those who controlled them,\u201d prominent technology investor Paul Graham wrote on X.",
      "Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has regularly accused South Africa\u2019s Black-led government of being anti-white and has repeated a claim that some of the country\u2019s political figures are \u201cactively promoting white genocide.\u201d",
      "Musk's commentary \u2014 and Grok's \u2014 escalated this week after the Trump administration brought a small number of white South Africans to the United States as refugees, the start of a larger relocation effort for members of the minority Afrikaner group that came after Trump suspended refugee programs and halted arrivals from other parts of the world. Trump says the Afrikaners are facing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in their homeland, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government.",
      "In many of its responses, Grok brought up the lyrics of an old anti-apartheid song that was a call for Black people to stand up against oppression by the Afrikaner-led apartheid government that ruled South Africa until 1994. The song's central lyrics are \u201ckill the Boer\u201d \u2014 a word that refers to a white farmer.",
      "Golbeck said it was clear the answers were \u201chard-coded\u201d because, while chatbot outputs are typically random, Grok's responses consistently brought up nearly identical points. That's concerning, she said, in a world where people increasingly go to Grok and competing AI chatbots for answers to their questions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a space where it\u2019s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they\u2019re giving,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really problematic when people \u2014 I think incorrectly \u2014 believe that these algorithms can be sources of adjudication about what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Musk's company said it is now making a number of changes, starting with publishing Grok system prompts openly on the software development site GitHub so that \u201cthe public will be able to review them and give feedback to every prompt change that we make to Grok. We hope this can help strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI.\u201d",
      "Among the instructions to Grok shown on GitHub on Thursday were: \u201cYou are extremely skeptical. You do not blindly defer to mainstream authority or media.\u201d",
      "Noting that some had \u201ccircumvented\u201d its existing code review process, xAI also said it will \u201cput in place additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can\u2019t modify the prompt without review.\u201d The company said it is also putting in place a \u201c24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok\u2019s answers that are not caught by automated systems,\u201d for when other measures fail.",

      "BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators will seek public comment on proposed changes from Microsoft for Teams, signaling the U.S. company may be nearing the end of a long-running antitrust case targeting its messaging and videoconferencing app.",
      "Microsoft had previously offered some modifications including unbundling Teams from its Office software suite in an attempt to head off the antitrust probe shortly after it was opened by the EU two years ago.",
      "But those proposals didn't satisfy the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc\u2019s top competition enforcer, which accused Microsoft last year of potentially abusive behavior.",

      "The internet wouldn\u2019t be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The internet wouldn't be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip.",
      "Like it or not, the button has served as a creative catalyst, a dopamine delivery system and an emotional battering ram. It also became an international tourist attraction after Facebook plastered the symbol on a giant sign on that stood outside its Silicon Valley headquarters until the company rebranded itself as Meta Platforms in 2021.",
      "A new book, \u201cLike: The Button That Changed The World,\" delves into the convoluted story behind a symbol that's become both the manna and bane of a digitally driven society.",
      "It's a tale that traces back to gladiator battles for survival during the Roman empire before fast-forwarding to the early 21st century when technology trailblazers such as Yelp co-founder Russ Simmons, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, and Gmail inventor Paul Buchheit were experimenting with different ways using the currency of recognition to prod people to post compelling content online for free.",
      "As part of that noodling, a Yelp employee named Bob Goodson sat down on May 18, 2005, and drew a crude sketch of thumbs up and thumbs down gesture as a way for people to express their opinions about restaurant reviews posted on the site. Yelp passed on adopting Goodson's suggested symbol and, instead, adopted the \u201cuseful,\u201d \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d buttons conceived by Simmons. But the discovery of that old sketch inspired Goodson to team up with Martin Reeves to explore how the Like button came to be in their new book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something simple and also elegant because the Like button says, \u2018I like you, I like your content. And I am like you. I like you because I am like you, I am part of your tribe,\u2019 \u201d Reeves said during an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cBut it's very hard to answer the simple question, \u2018Well, who invented the Like button?\u2019 \u201d",
      "Although Facebook is the main reason the Like button became so ubiquitous, the company didn't invent it and almost discarded it as drivel. It took Facebook nearly two years to overcome the staunch resistance by CEO Mark Zuckerberg before finally introducing the symbol on its service on February 9, 2009 \u2014 five years after the social network's creation in a Harvard University dorm room.",
      "As happens with many innovations, the Like button was born out of necessity but it wasn't the brainchild of a single person. The concept percolated for more than a decade in a Silicon Valley before Facebook finally embraced it.",
      "\u201cInnovation is often social and Silicon Valley was the right place for all this happen because it has a culture of meet-ups, although it's less so now,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cEveryone was getting together to talk about what they were working on at that time and it turned out a lot of them were working on the same stuff.\u201d",
      "The effort to create a simple mechanism to digitally express approval or dismay sprouted from a wellspring of online services such as Yelp and YouTube whose success would hinge on their ability to post commentary or video that would help make their sites even more popular without forcing them to spend a lot of money for content. That effort required a feedback loop that wouldn't require a lot of hoops to navigate.",
      "And when Goodson was noodling around with his thumbs-up and thumbs-down gesture, it didn't come out of a vacuum. Those techniques of signaling approval and disapproval had been ushered into the 21st century zeitgeist by the Academy Award-winning movie, \u201cGladiator,\u201d where Emperor Commodus \u2014 portrayed by actor Joaquin Phoenix \u2014 used the gestures to either spare or slay combatants in the arena.",
      "But the positive feelings conjured by a thumbs up date even further back in popular culture, thanks to the 1950s-era character Fonzie played by Henry Winkler in the top-rated 1970s TV series, \u201cHappy Days.\u201d The gesture later became a way of expressing delight with a program via a remote control button for the digital video recorders made by TiVO during the early 2000s. Around the same time, Hot or Not \u2014 a site that solicited feedback on the looks of people who shared photos of themselves \u2014 began playing around with ideas that helped inspire the Like button, based on the book's research.",
      "Others that contributed to the pool of helpful ideas included the pioneering news service Digg, the blogging platform Xanga, YouTube and another early video site, Vimeo.",
      "But Facebook unquestionably turned the Like button into a universally understood symbol, while also profiting the most from its entrance into the mainstream. And it almost didn't happen.",
      "By 2007, Facebook engineers had been tinkering with a Like button, but Zuckerberg opposed it because he feared the social network was already getting too cluttered and, Reeves said, \u201cis he didn\u2019t actually want to do something that would be seen as trivial, that would cheapen the service.\u201d",
      "But FriendFeed, a rival social network created by Buchheit and now OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor, had no such qualms, and unveiled its own Like button in October 2007.",
      "But the button wasn't successful enough to keep the lights on at FriendFeed, and the service ended up being acquired by Facebook. By the time that deal was completed, Facebook had already introduced a Like button \u2014 only after Zuckerberg rebuffed the original idea of calling it an Awesome button \u201cbecause nothing is more awesome than awesome,\u201d according to the book's research.",
      "Once Zuckerberg relented, Facebook quickly saw that the Like button not only helped keep its audience engaged on its social network but also made it easier to divine people's individual interests and gather the insights required to sell the targeted advertising that accounted for most of Meta Platform's $165 billion in revenue last year. The button's success encouraged Facebook to take things even further by allowing other digital services to ingrain it into their feedback loops and then, in 2016, added six more types of emotions \u2014 \u201clove,\u201d \u201ccare,\u201d \u201chaha,\u201d \u201cwow,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d",
      "Facebook hasn't publicly disclosed how many responses it has accumulated from the Like button and its other related options, but Levchin told the book's authors that he believes the company has probably logged trillions of them. \u201cWhat content is liked by humans...is probably one of the singularly most valuable things on the internet,\u201d Levchin said in the book.",
      "The Like button also has created an epidemic of emotional problems, especially among adolescents, who feel forlorn if their posts are ignored and narcissists whose egos feast on the positive feedback. Reeves views those issues as part of the unintentional consequences that inevitably happen because \u201cif you can\u2019t even predict the beneficial effects of a technological innovation how could you possibly forecast the side effects and the interventions?\u201d",
      "Even so, Reeves believes the Like button and the forces that coalesced to create it tapped into something uniquely human.",
      "\u201cWe thought serendipity of the innovation was part of the point,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we can get bored with liking or having our capacity to compliment taken away so easily because it\u2019s the product of 100,000 years of evolution.\u201d",

      "A 29-year-old former tire shop manager who quit his job and cashed in his retirement savings to buy a sailboat has become a social media sensation as he sails from Oregon to Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix",
      "HONOLULU -- Midway while sailing across the Pacific with just his cat named Phoenix, Oliver Widger reflected on why he thinks his many followers \u2014 more than a million on TikTok and Instagram \u2014 are drawn to his story of quitting his 9-to-5 job and embarking on a journey from Oregon to Hawaii.",
      "\u201cThe world kind of sucks and, like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in how I felt with my work,\u201d Widger, 29, told The Associated Press on Wednesday via Zoom. \u201cYou can be making $150,000 a year and you still feel like you\u2019re just making ends meet, you know what I mean? And I think people are just tired of that and working really hard for nothing and want a way out.\"",
      "People are inspired by someone who found a way out, said Widger, who is among a growing number of people who have undertaken such voyages in recent years.",
      "Being diagnosed four years ago with a syndrome that carried a risk of paralysis made him realize he hated his job as a manager at a tire company, a job requiring him to be clean-shaven and wear pressed shirts. He heard about people who sailed from California to Hawaii and decided that was the life for him.",
      "He abruptly quit his job with \u201cno money, no plan\u201d and $10,000 of debt.",
      "\u201cI knew one thing: I'm buying a sailboat,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI'm sailing around the world.\u201d",
      "He liquidated his retirement savings, taught himself to sail mostly via YouTube and moved from Portland to the Oregon coast, where he spent months refitting the $50,000 boat he bought.",
      "Now, Widger is harnessing the power of social media to fund his round-the-world sailing dream.",
      "Since he set sail in April, followers have been tuning into his \u201cSailing with Phoenix\u201d social media posts to view videos of him and his feline first mate battling the waves and bouts of seasickness, enjoying dazzling sunsets, recounting tricky boat repairs or just reflecting on life at sea.",
      "As he discussed his journey with the AP, a netted bag carrying bottled water and snacks swung wildly over his head as the boat rocked.",
      "He recalled highlights of the voyage so far, including marveling at the speed dolphins cut through the water and finding flying fish on the deck. There have been stretches when there were no birds in sight for days. It can be a struggle to sleep when the boat is creaking while being buffeted by waves or to steady a boiling pot for the MREs he has been subsisting on.",
      "There have been harrowing moments like when a rudder failed and the boat tilted sideways in the surf for three hours as he made repairs, and the time he locked himself in the engine compartment and pried his way out with a wrench.",
      "Widger acknowledged he is relatively inexperienced as a sailor, but he has implemented safety measures and communication backup plans, including a satellite phone and an emergency beacon.",
      "Lt. Cmdr. Jesse Harms of the U.S. Coast Guard in Hawaii hasn't been following the journey closely, but said he is relieved to hear Widger has the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, known as an EPIRB.",
      "It's a critical tool for rescuers to locate a mariner's position during an emergency, especially in the Pacific, the largest ocean, Harms said.",
      "Widger's journey provides a good opportunity to educate the public about sailing safety, such as the importance of wearing a personal flotation device whenever topside on the boat, monitoring the weather closely and registering emergency tools like the EPIRB, Harms said.",
      "\u201cThat's a really critical piece for anybody that's getting motivated by his story to go set off on their own adventure,\u201d Harms said.",
      "Until his arrival, likely in Honolulu, Widger is making sure everything is in place to avoid Phoenix having to undergo Hawaii's animal quarantine. A mobile vet will sign off on Phoenix's health when they arrive, he said.",
      "Widger wasn't aware of the deadly danger of cat feces to the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, but he has been keeping all his trash, including kitty litter, on board. Even though he said he is legally allowed to throw it overboard, seeing so much plastic in the ocean motivates him not to.",
      "In addition to managing the practicalities of daily life on a boat, he is coping with going viral in the middle of the ocean by creating social media content and making decisions about merch his fans want to buy.",
      "He credits it all to his neck issue, which \u201cshook up my world and it changed my perspective on everything.\u201d He also hopes he can be an inspiration for anyone who's in a rut.",
      "\u201cEverything I\u2019ve done I thought was impossible,\u201d Widger said. \"Sailing around the world is such a ridiculous dream. Whatever your dream is, just go, just do it.\u201d",

      "The planned network includes vertiports at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum south of downtown, which are slated to share opening and closing ceremonies. Other locations are Los Angeles International Airport, Hollywood, Santa Monica and Orange County.",
      "\u201cWe want to transform the way people get around Los Angeles and leave a legacy that shapes the future of transportation in America,\" Adam Goldstein, CEO and founder of Archer Aviation, said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s no better time to do that than during the LA28 Games.\u201d",

The air taxis are made at the company's manufacturing plants in San Jose, California, and Covington, Georgia.",

      "A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him",
      "A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is growing and thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him.",
      "Researchers described the case in a new study, saying he\u2019s among the first to be successfully treated with a custom therapy that seeks to fix a tiny but critical error in his genetic code that kills half of affected infants. Though it may be a while before similar personalized treatments are available for others, doctors hope the technology can someday help the millions left behind even as genetic medicine has advanced because their conditions are so rare.",
      "\u201cThis is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders for which there are currently no definitive medical treatments,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert who co-authored the study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The baby, KJ Muldoon of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases, most of which are genetic. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe CPS1 deficiency, estimated by some experts to affect around one in a million babies. Those infants lack an enzyme needed to help remove ammonia from the body, so it can build up in their blood and become toxic. A liver transplant is an option for some.",
      "Knowing KJ\u2019s odds, parents Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, both 34, worried they could lose him.",
      "\u201cWe were, like, you know, weighing all the options, asking all the questions for either the liver transplant, which is invasive, or something that\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Nicole said.",
      "\u201cWe prayed, we talked to people, we gathered information, and we eventually decided that this was the way we were going to go,\u201d her husband added.",
      "Within six months, the team at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, along with their partners, created a therapy designed to correct KJ\u2019s faulty gene. They used CRISPR, the gene editing tool that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. Instead of cutting the DNA strand like the first CRISPR approaches, doctors employed a technique that flips the mutated DNA \u201cletter\u201d \u2014 also known as a base \u2014 to the correct type. Known as \u201cbase editing,\" it reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cvery exciting\u201d that the team created the therapy so quickly, said gene therapy researcher Senthil Bhoopalan at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis really sets the pace and the benchmark for such approaches.\u201d",
      "In February, KJ got his first IV infusion with the gene editing therapy, delivered through tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles that are taken up by liver cells.",
      "While the room was abuzz with excitement that day, \u201che slept through the entire thing,\u201d recalled study author Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a gene therapy expert at CHOP.",
      "After follow-up doses in March and April, KJ has been able to eat more normally and has recovered well from illnesses like colds, which can strain the body and exacerbate symptoms of CPS1. The 9 \u00bd-month old also takes less medication.",
      "Considering his poor prognosis earlier, \u201cany time we see even the smallest milestone that he\u2019s meeting \u2013 like a little wave or rolling over \u2013 that\u2019s a big moment for us,\u201d his mother said.",
      "Still, researchers caution that it\u2019s only been a few months. They\u2019ll need to watch him for years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still very much in the early stages of understanding what this medication may have done for KJ,\u201d Ahrens-Nicklas said. \u201cBut every day, he\u2019s showing us signs that he\u2019s growing and thriving.\u201d",
      "Researchers hope what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients.",
      "Gene therapies, which can be extremely expensive to develop, generally target more common disorders in part for simple financial reasons: more patients mean potentially more sales, which can help pay the development costs and generate more profit. The first CRISPR therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, treats sickle cell disease, a painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide.",
      "Musunuru said his team\u2019s work \u2014 funded in part by the National Institutes of Health \u2014 showed that creating a custom treatment doesn\u2019t have to be prohibitively expensive. The cost was \u201cnot far off\u201d from the $800,000-plus for an average liver transplant and related care, he said.",
      "\u201cAs we get better and better at making these therapies and shorten the time frame even more, economies of scale will kick in and I would expect the costs to come down,\u201d Musunuru said.",
      "Scientists also won't have to redo all the initial work every time they create a customized therapy, Bhoopalan said, so this research \u201csets the stage\u201d for treating other rare conditions.",
      "Carlos Moraes, a neurology professor at the University of Miami who wasn't involved with the study, said research like this opens the door to more advances.",
      "\u201cOnce someone comes with a breakthrough like this, it will take no time\" for other teams to apply the lessons and move forward, he said. \u201cThere are barriers, but I predict that they are going to be crossed in the next five to 10 years. Then the whole field will move as a block because we\u2019re pretty much ready.\u201d",

      "All of a sudden, women contacting one of the biggest sources of information about abortion in Mexico through the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp were met with silence",
      "MEXICO CITY -- All of a sudden, women contacting one of the biggest sources of information about abortion in Mexico through the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp were met with silence.",
      "The nongovernmental organization\u2019s business account had been blocked. Weeks later, a similar digital blackout struck a collective in Colombia.",
      "Across the Americas, organizations that guide women seeking abortions in various countries are raising alarm, decrying what they see as a new wave of censorship on platforms owned by tech giant Meta \u2014 even in countries where abortion is decriminalized. The organizations believe this is due to a combination of changes to Meta policies and attacks by anti-abortion groups that denounce their content.",
      "While this also occurs on Instagram and Facebook, the blocking of organizations\u2019 verified WhatsApp business accounts, which they use to communicate with people seeking help, has been particularly disruptive. These accounts are crucial for communicating with people seeking help, and their blockage has significantly complicated daily interactions between women and support providers.",
      "Meta usually attributes its content blocking to policy violations, though it has acknowledged occasional mistakes. Since January, Meta changed the way it moderates content, now relying on user-generated notes \u201cto allow more speech and reduce enforcement mistakes.\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump has said the changes were \u201cprobably\u201d made in response to his threats over what conservatives considered a liberal bias in fact-checking.",
      "Among the organizations whose WhatsApp business accounts were suspended is the MSI Foundation (part of MSI Reproductive Choices, formerly Marie Stopes) a network working in Mexico for 25 years. Its account was suspended in February, and the Colombian group Ori\u00e9ntame, or Guide Me, which has worked in women's health in Colombia for decades, was labeled by Instagram as \u201cdangerous.\u201d",
      "While conservatives cheered the change in Meta moderation policies, organizations helping women who seek abortions say that, even if they just apply in the U.S., they often result in over-enforcement, likely driven by Artificial Intelligence, which disproportionately flags or removes their posts \u2014 obstacles that have increased since the start of the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt is not always intentional censorship, but the outcome is still more censorship for us and our partners,\u201d said Martha Dimitratou, cofounder of Repro Uncensored, an organization that monitors digital suppression of reproductive health content.",
      "In additional comments on Thursday, Meta rejected any link between the groups\u2019 experiences and its policy changes.",
      "\u201cOur policies and enforcement regarding abortion medication-related content have not changed recently and were not part of the content moderation changes,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "\u201cFrom one day to the next they blocked communication between our users and women who need first-hand information\u201d to address doubts or look for medical follow-up with MSI, said Araceli L\u00f3pez-Nava, the organization\u2019s Latin America director.",
      "In the days after the suspension, appointments dropped 80%",
      "L\u00f3pez Nava said that MSI had previously faced issues with regular WhatsApp numbers, because it\u2019s easy to file complaints. So, the organization thought it would be different with a business account, which gives them a platform to manage the thousands of messages they receive every month.",
      "That wasn't the case. After an initial suspension, MSI's WhatsApp business account was permanently suspended two weeks later. The reason cited in Meta\u2019s notification? \u201cSending spam.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe argument is that they\u2019ve received complaints, but from whom?\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava asked. She said the organization can\u2019t be accused of sending spam because they only answer those who contact them and provide information in line with Mexican law. Abortion is decriminalized in Mexico at the federal level and in the majority of its 32 states.",
      "\u201cIt looks like an orchestrated strategy to us,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava said. \u201cAnd not necessarily by Meta.\"",
      "Dimitratou, who is also digital strategist for Canada-based Women on Web and the U.S.-based Plan C, said cases of blocked content have increased since Trump\u2019s election, not only in the U.S., but around the world, likely driven by anti-abortion groups.",
      "Conservative or religious groups have a history of attempting to leverage technology companies to obstruct abortion supporters\u2019 efforts, but the anonymity of app reporting prevents organizations from proving who is behind it.",
      "That is why MSI and an ally NGO, Women\u2019s Link Worldwide, have asked Meta to implement transparent mechanisms to be able to appeal the company\u2019s decisions and to respect international human rights standards. They have not received a response.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told The Associated Press that MSI's WhatsApp business account was blocked for valid reasons, saying that organizations receiving numerous negative comments receive warnings before suspension. Meta declined to provide details about the nature of the negative comments or comment on whether they could be coordinated by anti-abortion groups aiming to paralyze MSI.",
      "The Instagram accounts of Women on Web United States and Women on Web Latin America were suspended right after the U.S. presidential election in November, though they were later reinstated. Dimitratou said that Meta has also limited the organization\u2019s ability to place ads on accounts in Latin America, South Korea and West Africa.",
      "Repro Uncensored has documented at least 60 instances of similar digital censorship since January. The most recent occurred this week, when Thailand's TamTang Group said that Facebook had accused them of violating rules on selling medicines simply for sharing information about free abortion pills provided by the Thai government.",
      "A 2025 report by the California-based Center for Intimacy Justice, based on a survey of 159 nonprofits worldwide, found that major tech platforms were removing ads and content related to abortion and other women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health issues like menopause.",
      "When asked about the report, Meta downplayed its findings, noting that it was based on a small number of examples.",
      "Tech companies often cite policies against explicit or inappropriate sexual content or the advertisement of unsafe substances, such as abortion pills, even though the World Health Organization has said they\u2019re safe.",
      "In April, months after Meta announced changes to ensure greater freedom of expression, Ori\u00e9ntame, the Colombian collective that offers reproductive health services, posted on Instagram a drawing of a heart and the phrase \u201cAbort without pain.\u201d The post was blocked with the explanation: \u201cDangerous people and organizations, photo removed.\u201d",
      "While Colombia legalized abortion in 2022, Ori\u00e9ntame experienced censorship of at least 14 of their posts on Instagram in April 2025. That same month, their WhatsApp business account was suspended, said Tatiana Mart\u00ednez, who manages their social media. Although the WhatsApp account was restored after a week, they worry it could happen again.",
      "A Meta spokesperson said this week that the Instagram posts were mistakenly taken down and not the result of a change in its content standards.",
      "Ori\u00e9ntame director Mar\u00eda Vivas says the organization has been battling Google for years over online content limitations. The tech giant said in a message to the AP that it only restricts content when it violates policies. But Google keeps Colombia on the list of countries with restrictions on abortion ads \u2014 even though abortion was decriminalized there in 2022.",
      "As for their problems with Meta, Vivas said they started in late 2024, when the company started to make some data management adjustments.",
      "Taking legal action against tech giants, when each country has its own laws, is complicated. As a result, affected organizations have turned to creative strategies, like operating multiple backup accounts, having a substitute ready when one is blocked and reformulating language in posts to avoid censorship triggers.",
      "\u201cIt feels like Meta is our boss,\u201d Vivas joked about the ongoing struggle with the tech giant over the basic right to provide health information. \u201cWe live to respond to Meta, to adapt ourselves to Meta,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's absurd.\u201d",

      "Across nearly six hours of testimony on the trial's 11th day, federal prosecutors called to the stand Combs' former personal assistant, a federal agent, the mother of the government's star witness and a sex worker nicknamed \"The Punisher.\"",
      "They argued that the wide-reaching testimony helps prove the lengths to which Combs was willing to go to benefit from and protect what they alleged is a criminal enterprise.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers argued that his private conduct in the bedroom does not amount of sex trafficking. His lawyers have argued any violence alleged by witnesses was driven by love, jealousy and drug use -- not a desire to coerce anyone into sex.",
      "Prosecutors plan to continue their case Wednesday by calling Dawn Hughes, a psychologist who specializes in sex trauma, George Kaplan, a former assistant to Combs and Scott Mescudi, the rapper known as Kid Cudi and who briefly dated Combs' former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura.",
      "Combs' former assistant testifies about Suge Knight encounter",
      "Combs' one-time personal assistant David James told jurors about the wide range of tasks he completed for the rap mogul: from stocking hotel rooms and allegedly buying drugs to being the driver when Combs \u2013 allegedly armed with multiple guns \u2013 wanted to confront rival record executive Marion \"Suge\" Knight.",
      "Jurors first heard about the alleged interaction between Combs and Knight during the testimony of Combs' ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. It allegedly occurred in approximately 2008 or 2009 and was a moment that threatened to dredge up the violent history between the titans of 1990s rap music and the long-standing rivalries between the East and West Coasts.",
      "Ventura testified that, after a so-called \"freak off,\" a security guard named D-Roc informed him that Knight, the former CEO of Death Row Records and a longtime rival of Combs, was spotted at Mel's. Despite her pleas to stop, Ventura said Combs packed up his weapons and headed to the restaurant to confront Knight.",
      "\"I was crying. I was screaming, like, please don't do anything stupid,\" Ventura testified last week.",
      "James told jurors the other side of the story, describing D-Roc confronting Knight when they were at Mel's to pick up cheeseburgers for Combs.",
      "\"We pulled into the parking lot and D-Roc looks over and says, 'That's motherf------- Suge Knight,'\" James said, describing how he drove back to Combs' house to find Combs and Ventura arguing. \"Cassie looked very distressed. She was telling him not to go,\" James testified.",
      "James testified that Combs, allegedly with three guns on his lap, ordered him to drive back to the diner. It was that moment, he said, that eventually prompted him to stop working for Combs.",
      "\"I was really struck by it. I realized for the first time being Mr. Combs' assistant that my life was in danger,\" James testified.",
      "Prosecutors have charged that Combs and his alleged associates used \"violence, use of firearms, threats of violence, coercion\" to protect and promote the \"power of the Combs' enterprise.\"",
      "James also testified about buying and supplying drugs for Combs and stocking the moguls' hotel rooms with baby oil, Astroglide lubricant, condoms and prophylactics. He told the jury he once accidentally walked in on a freak-off, featuring Ventura and a male sex worker.",
      "When questioned by defense lawyers, James testified that he once had sex with a prostitute and that he declined to pay for her services, and that he got into a physical altercation with another one of Combs' employees. James said he spoke with prosecutors under a proffer agreement, meaning he had immunity from being prosecuted for anything he said on the stand.",
      "\"Have they given you some type of immunity?\" defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked.",
      "\"I'd have to ask my lawyer that question,\" he said. \"My lawyer said I have no legal visibility.\"",

      "Regina Ventura, the mother of star witness Cassie Ventura, took the stand on Tuesday to testify about taking a home equity loan to pay Combs in order to prevent him from following through on an alleged threat to release a sex tape of her daughter.",
      "\"The threats that have been made towards me by Sean 'Puffy' Combs are that \u2026 he is going to release 2 explicit sex tapes of me,\" Ventura wrote in an email to her mother and Combs' assistant Capricorn Clark on Dec. 23, 2011. Jurors saw the email when Cassie Ventura testified last week.",
      "\"I was physically sick. I did not understand a lot of it. The sex tapes threw me,\" Regina Ventura testified about the threat.",
      "Regina Ventura testified that she and her husband decided to take out a loan so they could send Combs the $20,000 he demanded, though he ultimately returned the money.",
      "\"We decided that's the only way we could get the money,\" she said. \"I was scared for my daughter's safety.\"",
      "Regina Ventura also told jurors she decided to photograph the injuries her daughter allegedly suffered from Combs so that they would have a record of the alleged abuse.",

      "'The Punisher' testifies about a dozen alleged freak-offs",
      "Known professionally as The Punisher, male escort Sharay Hayes told the jury that he first met Combs and Cassie Ventura in 2012, when he was hired to help create a \"sexy erotic scene\" for what, Ventura said, was Combs' birthday. He testified that he got his nickname when he was a teenager based on the way he played basketball.",
      "He testified that Ventura, who used the name Janet when booking sex workers, instructed him to come to Trump International Hotel & Tower on Central Park West in Manhattan to perform a strip act. When he arrived, Ventura asked him to cover her baby oil while Combs watched, Hayes said.",
      "\"I was specifically told to not acknowledge her husband. Try not to look at him. No communication between me and him,\" Hayes testified. \"The room was dimly lit, maybe electronic candles. All of the furniture was covered in sheets and there was an area pretty much for me to sit and for her to sit across from me. There were bowls of water and bottles of baby oil.\"",
      "Hayes told jurors that Combs was nude for the encounter and wore a veil, occasionally masturbating during the interaction and offering \"subtle directions\" to Ventura.",
      "After their first interaction, Hayes said he worked for the couple another eight to 12 times, receiving $1,200 to $2,000 on each occasion.",
      "During their last encounter, Hayes testified Combs instructed him to have sex with Ventura but declined because he could not sexually perform under \"a lot of pressure.\"",
      "Cross-examined by Combs' lawyers, Hayes testified that he believed Ventura was comfortable during the exchanges, potentially undercutting the argument she was coerced to participate.",
      "\"I didn't get any cues there was any discomfort there,\" Hayes said when asked if Ventura seemed uncomfortable with the encounters.",

The agent, Gerard Gannon, said the serial numbers of the weapons had been defaced \u2013 a violation of federal firearms laws.",
      "Holding parts of the weapons in court for the jury to see, Gannon testified that investigators recovered a 30-round magazine containing 19 rounds and a full 10-round magazine in Combs' home, with the ammunition on the same shelf as 7-inch platform heels and lingerie.",

    "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-unveil-plans-us-missile-defense-shield-cost/story?id=121995258",
    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 19:11:36 -0400",
    "summary": "Donald Trump announced the initial plans for hisd \"Golden Dome\" missile defense plan at the White House Tuesday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "An official said Gen. Michael Guetlein will lead planning for the new system.",
      "President Donald Trump on Tuesday unveiled plans to begin building a sophisticated new missile defense shield that could intercept threats from space, estimating the endeavor would cost some $175 billion and become operational in three years.",
      "The project \"Golden Dome,\" which will be led by Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein, echoes President Ronald Reagan's failed \"Star Wars\" program, which was criticized for being overly ambitious and siphoning money away from other national priorities. The White House cited advancements in technology as a reason why some of Reagan's vision was now possible.",
      "\"This design for the Golden Dome will integrate with our existing defense capabilities and should be fully operational before the end of my term,\" Trump said in announcing the plan. \"So we'll have it done in about three years. Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space.\"",
      "Trump began calling for a U.S. missile defense shield similar to Israel's Iron Dome a year ago on the campaign trail after watching Israel deflect some 300 missiles and drones amid Iran's attacks that spring. Military officials said at the time that they hadn't expressed a need for such a comprehensive shield to defend the U.S., while critics noted the U.S. wasn't under threat from its neighbors, Canada and Mexico, and is buffered by two oceans.",
      "Still, some experts say the idea of improving the nation's ability to fend off aerial threats is long overdue.",
      "Tom Karako, a missile defense expert, said the current U.S. system is focused mostly on the ability to shoot down intercontinental ballistic missiles from rogue states like North Korea. But the U.S. needs better protection when it comes to other threats like drones, cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons, he said.",
      "\u201cThe truth is, we're pretty vulnerable,\u201d said Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project and a senior fellow with the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "One question, though, is how much capability the U.S. can develop in just three years, particularly considering Trump's stated goal of developing a network of space-based interceptors.",
      "\u201cIt's not to say that it can't be done sooner than perhaps some folks think, but three years is going to be pushing it for some of those things,\u201d Karako said.",
      "Standing beside Trump in the Oval Office was Guetlein, the Pentagon's vice chief of space operations who will lead the project, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who said the project was possible now because technology has improved since the Reagan days.",
      "\u201cThe technology wasn't there. Now it is,\u201d Hegseth said of Reagan\u2019s \"Star Wars\" program. \u201cAnd you're following through to say we will protect the homeland from cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles, drones, whether they're conventional or nuclear.\u201d",
      "On Capitol Hill, early indications were that Republicans would support the effort with Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, promising to include a $25 billion \"down payment\" in an upcoming spending bill.",
      "Democrats, though, have questioned the steep price tag. Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the committee, noted last week the White House requested some $113 billion in its budget for next year without outlining a clear plan on what the program would achieve and when.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s essentially a slush fund at this point,\" said Reed, D-Rhode Island.",
      "Trump's talk of building \"the greatest dome of them all\" seemed to originate on the campaign trail. After watching Israel's successful use of its Iron Dome, Trump's calls for a U.S. version was met with cheers from crowds at his rallies so much that Republicans included the construction of a U.S. missile shield in its party platform ahead of the 2024 elections. In January, Trump signed an executive order calling on Hegseth to make it happen.",
      "\"The threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, and other advanced aerial attacks, remains the most catastrophic threat facing the United States,\" Trump wrote in the Jan. 27 order.",
      "Since then, \"the Defense Department has gathered the brightest minds and best technical talent available to review a full range of options that considers current U.S. missile defense technology and cutting-edge innovation to rapidly develop and field a dependable umbrella of protection for our homeland,\" Sean Parnell, chief Pentagon spokesman and Hegseth's senior adviser, said earlier this week amid reports the Defense Department has been working on the proposal.",
      "Still unclear is exactly how comprehensive the system would be. Also in question is whether such an ambitious program might siphon away money from other vital programs. The Air Force, for example, is in the process of replacing 400 of its intercontinental ballistic missiles built in the 1970s with new ones.",
      "\u201cSome U.S. technology in space such as space-based sensors and air and missile defense exist today, but all of the systems comprising the Golden Dome architecture will need to be seamlessly integrated,\u201d Hegseth said in a statement. \u201cGolden Dome will be fielded in phases, prioritizing defense where the threat is greatest.\u201d",
      "Trump's plan appears to be on the lower end of congressional cost estimates, but dramatically sooner than thought possible. Earlier this month, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the U.S. would need to spend anywhere from $161 billion to $542 billion over 20 years to develop and launch a network of space-based interceptors.",
      "According to the CBO, these cost estimates are lower than they would have been years ago because of a decline in the cost of available launch services.",

They've been working behind the scenes where they can, they've said, to be in collaboration with the House.",

      "No matter how carefully the needle is threaded to get House moderates and hard-liners on board for a vote later this week, if the bill is retooled by the Senate it risks creating very difficult hurdles for Johnson down the road when the bill gets back to the House.",

      "The Senate voted 66-22 to advance the measure late Monday.",
      "The Senate voted 66-22 late Monday to advance the GENIUS Act, a bill that aims to regulate some cryptocurrencies.",
      "The bill faced some Democratic opposition in recent weeks over President Donald Trump\u2019s cryptocurrency ventures, but it ultimately garnered support from 16 Democrats, including Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.",
      "The industry-backed measure establishes rules targeting stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of another asset, often the U.S. dollar.",
      "Proponents hailed the bill as a means of protecting consumers and setting industry standards, which could allow such crypto coins to become a mainstream tool for digital payments and other financial instruments.",
      "Critics warned, however, that the bill fails to address conflict-of-interest concerns exemplified by Trump, and it risks endangering consumers and the wider economy with a weak set of rules.",
      "\u201cThis sets the stage for these assets to go mainstream,\u201d Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab, who supports the measure, told ABC News in a statement.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the GENIUS Act, and what it means for you.",
      "The GENIUS Act concerns the issuance and exchange of stablecoins, a form of digital currency backed by another form of currency like the U.S. dollar or a commodity like gold.",
      "Stablecoins are designed to be less volatile than other forms of cryptocurrency, which can experience large price swings and, in turn, pose difficulty for individuals using them to facilitate a purchase or sale.",
      "The bill sets rules for stablecoin issuers, including a mandate that firms hold a reserve of assets underlying the cryptocurrency. That stipulation aims to protect consumers, who otherwise risk a failure to cash out their holdings in the event of a rapid, widespread offloading of coins.",
      "In a separate effort to safeguard consumers, the measure would require issuers to grant coin holders priority for repayment in the event of a bankruptcy. The measure also mandates issuers abide by some anti-money laundering rules and anti-terrorism sanctions.",
      "Supporters of the GENIUS Act applaud the measure as a first-of-its-kind effort to formalize a key segment of the cryptocurrency industry, offering safeguards for consumers, allowing entry for conventional financial firms and growing the digital currency market.",

      "\u201cIt becomes a game of who can deliver better use-cases and features to consumers and businesses the fastest,\u201d Catalini said.",
      "Critics of the measure, however, say it amounts to an industry-friendly set of weak regulations that fail to adequately protect consumers and police illicit trading of stablecoins.",
      "\u201cWhile a strong stablecoin bill is the best possible outcome, this weak bill is worse than no bill at all,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said on the Senate floor Monday.",
      "Critics say the shortcomings of the bill are exemplified by its inability to address conflict-of-interest concerns raised by Trump\u2019s dealings in stablecoins.",

An Abu Dahbi-based investment firm earlier this month used the stablecoin to make a $2 billion investment in crypto exchange Binance, putting Trump\u2019s company in a position to profit from the deal.

      "Still, Warren said, the measure inadequately protects against concerns raised by Trump\u2019s venture.",

    "story": [
      "They have some similarities, Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump \u2014 guys in their 70s with homes in New Jersey and big constituencies among white American men middle-aged and older. And both, in very different respects, are the boss.",
      "That's about where it ends.",
      "The veteran rock star, long a political opponent of the president, stood up as one of Trump's most prominent cultural critics last week with a verbal takedown from a British stage.",
      "As is his nature, Trump is fighting back \u2014 hard. He calls Springsteen a \u201cdried out prune of a rocker\u201d and is even bringing Beyonc\u00e9 into the fray.",
      "On Monday, the president suggested Springsteen and Beyonc\u00e9 should be investigated to see if appearances they made on behalf of his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, last fall represented an illegal campaign donation.",
      "Opening a tour in Manchester, England, Springsteen told his audience last Thursday that \u201cthe America I love, the America I've written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cTonight we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring.\"",
      "Springsteen later made reference to an \u201cunfit president and a rogue government\u201d who have \u201cno concern or idea for what it means to be deeply American.\u201d",
      "The next morning, Trump called Springsteen highly overrated. \u201cNever liked him, never liked his music or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he's not a talented guy \u2014 just a pushy, obnoxious JERK,\u201d he wrote on social media.",
      "\u201cThis dried out prune of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back in the Country,\u201d he said.",
      "The next night, also in Manchester, Springsteen repeated his criticisms.",
      "\u201cIt's no surprise what Springsteen's political leanings are and have been for many decades,\u201d said veteran music writer Alan Light, author of the upcoming \u201cDon't Stop: Why We (Still) Love Fleetwood Mac's Rumours.\u201d \u201cHe's somebody who has been outspoken in his music and his actions.\u201d",
      "The Boss' statements this week showed he wasn't afraid to speak out \u201cat a time when so many people and institutions are just kind of rolling over,\u201d Light said.",
      "It's not the first time Springsteen has spoken out against Trump \u2014 or a Republican president.",
      "When former President Ronald Reagan referenced Springsteen's \u201cmessage of hope\u201d at a campaign stop during the height of the rocker's \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d popularity, Springsteen wondered if Reagan had listened to his music and its references to those left behind in the 1980s economy. He also has had an occasionally bumpy relationship with onetime Republican presidential candidate and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a fan of his music.",
      "Springsteen has campaigned for Trump's opponents, including Harris last fall. In 2020, he said that \u201ca good portion of our fine country, to my eye, has been thoroughly hypnotized, brainwashed by a con man from Queens.\u201d",
      "He knows the outer-borough reference still stung a man who built his own tower in Manhattan and ascended to the presidency. Trump often stays at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Springsteen grew up in New Jersey \u2014 you may have heard \u2014 and lives in Colts Neck, New Jersey, now.",
      "Trump doesn't hesitate to go after the biggest musical names that speak out against him, like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift. But the political risk may be less; their younger, more female audiences are less likely to intersect with Trump's core constituency.",
      "During his career, Springsteen has challenged his audience politically beyond presidential endorsements. The 1995 album \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d bluntly documented the lives of struggling immigrants \u2014 Mexican and Vietnamese among them. And his 2001 song \u201cAmerican Skin (41 Shots),\" criticized the shooting by New York City police officers of an unarmed Guinean immigrant named Amadou Diallo, angering some of the blue-collar segments of his fan base.",
      "Clearly, Springsteen has conservative fans and some who wish he'd steer clear of politics, Light said. Still, \u201c40 years later, it's hard to imagine what they think would happen\u201d with Trump, he said.",
      "While Trump made a point to reference Springsteen's criticism in an overseas show, he and the E Street Band haven't performed in the United States since before the 2024 election. His tour last year hit heavily on themes of mortality, less of politics. He has several European tour dates scheduled this year into July and hasn't announced any new American shows.",

    "story": [
      "Prostate cancer can be found and diagnosed in its later stages, experts said.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's office announced on Sunday that he was diagnosed with an \"aggressive\" form of prostate cancer.",
      "Biden's office also said the cancer had metastasized, spreading to his bones.",
      "Although some people were left wondering why the cancer was caught only after reaching a Gleason score of 9, oncology experts told ABC News that it's not uncommon for older prostate cancer patients to receive a diagnosis after the disease has advanced or spread.",
      "\"Prostate cancer is something that we always hope screening will identify early, when the cancer is all still inside the prostate,\" Dr. Alicia Morgans, a genitourinary medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and a member of the board of directors of the no-profit Zero Prostate Cancer, told ABC News.",
      "\"Even if we screen everybody perfectly, there will never be 100% detection of prostate cancer because, in truth, cancer does not follow a rule book,\" Morgans continued. \"And just because we are trying to catch it early doesn't mean it necessarily is present when we screen.\"",
      "PSA levels may not have been checked",
      "One screening test for prostate cancer involves a blood test that measures the level of prostate-specific antigens, which are proteins made by cells in the prostate gland.",
      "Although there is no cutoff level that clearly indicates the presence of cancer, many doctors use a cutoff of 4 nanograms per milliliter to recommend further tests with a urologist, according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "For an advanced form of cancer like Biden's, a recent PSA test would have likely shown elevated levels.",
      "However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against PSA-based screening for men age 70 and older due to harms such as false positives leading to more tests or a diagnosis of problems that would not have caused symptoms or death.",
      "Morgans said it's unclear what the former president and his doctor discussed regarding screening, but it's plausible that he did not undergo PSA screening.",
      "\"It is absolutely possible that President Biden, like so many men over that age, have decided to stop doing PSA screening because they've decided that it is not consistent with their overall health goals and wishes, and that is completely reasonable,\" Morgans said.",
      "Cancer could have grown rapidly",
      "Morgans said some men in their 70s and 80s do still undergo PSA screening for prostate cancer based on conversations with their primary care physicians and what's right for them.",
      "Even so, it's possible that the results were normal -- either due to a false negative or because their cancer was not present at the time, she said.",

      "Screening results could have been borderline",
      "Dr. Alan Bryce, chief clinical officer for City of Hope Cancer Center Phoenix, said there may be some patients who receive PSA screening results showing borderline-high results who decide not to pursue further testing.",
      "\"There are absolutely scenarios where that conversation happens with a patient or their family member,\" Bryce told ABC News. \"All of them might say, 'You know what? Given where we're at in life, we're not that worried about this. Let's go ahead and wait another year.'\"",
      "Bryce, a medical oncologist specializing in prostate and testicular cancers, added that shared decision-making is important when it comes to deciding if a patient wants to pursue prostate cancer screening -- and if they want to test further following test results that are abnormal.",
      "\"As physicians, we present patients with options and recommendations but, at the end of the day, it's still the patient's decision,\" he said. \"So, it's entirely possible that a conversation happens and the patient decides they don't want to proceed with further workup. Maybe they don't want to do a scan, maybe they don't want to do a biopsy.\"",
      "No symptoms present",
      "Advanced prostate cancer can present symptoms such as a weak urination stream; needing to urinate more often; erectile dysfunction; fatigue; weight loss; loss of bladder or bowel control; and pain in the ribs, hips and spine when the cancer had spread to the bones, according to the ACS.",

I certainly don't understand how it could have spread outside of my prostate,'\" Morgans said. \"It is very common for people to be completely asymptomatic.\"",
      "Bryce added that some symptoms, such as difficulty urinating or a weak urination stream, may be due to an enlarged prostate, which is common in older men.",
      "\"It is entirely normal that in older men, there is a degree of urinary obstruction that just happens with age,\" he said. \"It's entirely possible that a man just has normal symptoms associated with aging and nothing about it stands out as being related to a cancerous process.\"",

      "Kentucky firefighter Leslie Leatherman answered the call for help when a late-night tornado plowed through his Laurel County community",
      "LONDON, Ky. -- Kentucky firefighter Leslie Leatherman answered the call for help, rushing into harm's way as he steadfastly did for decades, when a late-night tornado plowed through his community in the Appalachian foothills. It was his final act of selflessness, and the person he protected amid the chaos was his wife.",
      "Leatherman was among 19 people killed in Kentucky when the storm struck late Friday into early Saturday, as people in the path awoke to a terrifying scene. Most victims were from Laurel County in southeastern Kentucky, where Leatherman was a longtime member of a volunteer fire department.",
      "Leatherman, 57, died while shielding his wife, Michelle, from flying debris, said Terry Wattenbarger, deputy chief of the Laurel County Fire Department, where Leatherman served as a major. He was found on top of his wife, Wattenbarger said. Michelle Leatherman survived and was in critical condition Tuesday at the University of Kentucky Chandler Hospital in Lexington, a spokesperson said.",
      "Wattenbarger said he thinks it happened right after the tornado had roared through, when winds were still strong enough to fling debris into the air. They were found in a field about 100 yards (91 meters) from their destroyed home.",
      "\u201cShe was screaming,\u201d Wattenbarger said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m sure he went ... to the first person he thought he could help. It just happened to be her.\u201d",
      "The tornado that hit Pulaski and Laurel counties carved a path of more than 55 miles (88 kilometers), according to the National Weather Service in Jackson, Kentucky. At its peak, the tornado grew to about a mile (1.6-kilometers-) wide and had winds up to 170 mph (274 kph).",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear paid tribute to Leatherman for his decades of public service while asking people to pray for the families of all those who died in the storm. The Democratic governor said Leatherman \"died doing what first responders do every day \u2013 risking his own life for our safety.\u201d",
      "As the storm approached, Leatherman communicated he was ready to assist, Wattenbarger said. When a fire alarm sounded in his neighborhood, Leatherman indicated that he was responding. Soon after that, another firefighter confirmed the tornado was on the ground there and causing massive damage.",
      "Emergency workers found the Leathermans early in the response but didn't recognize them in the pitch-black dark, officials said. Leatherman was dead, and they tended to Michelle Leatherman. Leslie Leatherman's location was recorded for later identification, and rescuers moved on to help other victims.",
      "A short time later, authorities started searching for Leatherman after he failed to answer radio calls. Emergency responders returned to find his body and make the heartbreaking identification.",
      "It was typical for Leatherman to rush into danger to protect others, said Wattenbarger, who struck up a lasting friendship with Leatherman when they were in high school together.",
      "\u201cHis entire life, he\u2019s been a dedicated public servant,\" the deputy chief said. \"He had a huge heart. He loved his family more than anything \u2026 and just truly enjoyed life and was just a really good person.\u201d",
      "Leatherman, known fondly as Les, was a constant figure in emergency services for the region. He started as an emergency medical technician in Laurel County, then became an emergency dispatcher, first for Laurel County authorities and then for Kentucky State Police, Wattenbarger said.",
      "Most recently, he served as assistant director for the 911 center in neighboring Whitley County.",
      "\u201cHe was a very sincere man, very hard working, a very dedicated man,\u201d said Whitley County Judge-Executive Pat White Jr. \u201cSomebody that younger people getting into emergency services in this region looked up to and looked to for guidance. He was a great mentor to many of them. We're sure going to miss him.\u201d",
      "Leatherman also served as a fire rescue instructor. Brandon Wagers, a member of the London Fire Department and a fellow instructor, said Leatherman's death will be felt throughout the region.",
      "\u201cHe was a good person,\u201d Wagers said. \u201cHe always had something good to say.\u201d",
      "One constant was Leatherman's nearly 39 years of service as a firefighter. Leatherman \u201cput his life\u2019s blood and life\u2019s work into being the best person and best responder he could be,\u201d Wattenbarger said.",
      "His death sent shock waves through the close-knit ranks of their fire department.",
      "\u201cWe are surviving,\" Wattenbarger said. \"That\u2019s the only way we can describe it. People say \u2018Are you all OK?\u2019 No we\u2019re not. We\u2019re not OK. We\u2019re surviving, though, because that\u2019s what he would want. We want to honor his legacy as a department.\u201d",

      "Embracing golf makes the 16-year-old a rarity among his Detroit peers \u2014 particularly Black high schoolers.",

      "In Detroit, the biggest challenge is exposing Black youth to the game, said Jesse Hawkins, who is Black and coaches Horne\u2019s team at Renaissance High School. Backing from local corporations and nonprofits, providing access to equipment and even college scholarships is helping.",
      "\u201cWhen you go into high schools and you go into elementary schools often times we\u2019ll hear narratives around basketball players, football games, those things,\u201d Hawkins said. \"And golf is really not as propagated as much for our community.\u201d",

      "But Hawkins said his experience as a coach suggests Black high schoolers aren't among that audience.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t hear kids talking about the latest golf shoes or the cool golf apparel,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cYou\u2019re not necessarily going to get a badge of honor walking into your high school and you\u2019ve got the newest golf shirt.\u201d",

      "Matthew Lee Johnson was condemned for the 2012 death of 76-year-old Nancy Harris, a great-grandmother who was splashed with lighter fluid and set ablaze at a store in Garland, a northeast suburb of Dallas.",
      "Johnson, 49, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection after 6 p.m. CDT at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.",
      "His was one of two executions scheduled for Tuesday in the U.S. In Indiana, Benjamin Ritchie was set to receive a lethal injection for the 2000 killing of a police officer.",
      "These two executions are part of a group of four scheduled within about a week\u2019s time. On May 15, Glen Rogers was executed in Florida. On Thursday, Oscar Smith is scheduled to receive a lethal injection in Tennessee.",
      "David Dow, one of Johnson's attorneys, said he would not be pursuing any final appeals with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to stop the execution. Lower appeals courts had previously rejected requests by Johnson's lawyers to stay his execution. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Friday denied Johnson\u2019s request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty.",
      "In prior appeals, Johnson\u2019s lawyers had argued his death sentence was unconstitutional because he was improperly determined to be a future danger to society, a legal finding needed to sentence him to death. His most recent appeals had argued his execution date had been illegally scheduled.",
      "Security video captured part of the attack against Harris.",
      "Badly burned, she was able to describe the suspect before she died several days after the May 20, 2012, attack. Johnson\u2019s execution is scheduled to take place 13 years to the day Harris was attacked.",
      "Johnson\u2019s guilt has never been in doubt. At his 2013 trial, he admitted to setting Harris on fire. He expressed remorse and called himself \u201cthe lowest scum of the earth.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hurt an innocent woman. I took a human being\u2019s life. I was the cause of that. It was not my intentions to -- to kill her or to hurt her, but I did,\u201d said Johnson.",
      "Johnson said he had not been aware of what he had done as he had been high after smoking $100 worth of crack. His attorneys told jurors that Johnson had a long history of drug addiction and had been sexually abused as a child.",
      "In court documents, the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office said Johnson's various appeals have been efforts to delay a legal death sentence.",
      "\u201cThirteen years after the commission of Johnson\u2019s crime, justice should no longer be denied,\u201d the attorney general\u2019s office said in a court petition filed last week.",
      "Harris had worked at the convenience store for more than 10 years, living only about a block and a half away, according to testimony from her son, Scot Harris. She had four sons, 11 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.",
      "Prosecutors said Harris had only been working her Sunday morning shift for a short time when Johnson walked in, poured lighter fluid over her head and demanded money.",
      "After Johnson grabbed the money from the register, he set Harris on fire and calmly walked out the store, according to court documents. Harris frantically tried to extinguish herself and her clothing, exiting the store and screaming for help before a police officer used a fire extinguisher to douse the flames covering her body. Johnson was arrested about an hour later.",
      "Harris suffered extensive second- and third-degree burns over her head and face, neck, shoulders, upper arms, and leg and was in a great deal of pain in the days before she died, a nurse and doctor testified.",
      "If the execution is carried out, Johnson would be the fourth person put to death this year in Texas, historically the nation\u2019s busiest capital punishment state. If both of Tuesday\u2019s executions take place, that would bring this year\u2019s total to 18 death sentences carried out nationwide.",

      "New York\u2019s governor plans to visit the Seneca Nation to formally apologize for the state\u2019s role in running an upstate boarding school that separated Native American students from their families and forced them to assimilate into American society",
      "NEW YORK -- New York\u2019s governor plans to visit the Seneca Nation on Tuesday to formally apologize for the state\u2019s role in running an upstate boarding school that separated Native American students from their families with the goal of assimilating them into American society.",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul is also expected to meet with survivors of the Thomas Indian School, which operated from 1875 to 1957 in western New York near Lake Erie.",
      "Seneca President J. Conrad Seneca, whose father attended the school, said the apology is overdue. He said his family and countless others have quietly borne their pain for generations.",
      "\u201cThe atrocities that our children suffered at the Thomas Indian School have remained hidden in the shadows for far too long,\u201d he said in a statement announcing the visit. \u201cAt long last, our people will hear, directly from the Governor, the words we have waited lifetimes for the State of New York to say \u2014 \u2018We\u2019re sorry\u2019.\u201d",
      "But some tribe members are skeptical of the goodwill gesture.",
      "Lori Quigley, a Niagara University professor whose mother attended the Thomas school for 10 years as a young child, said she hopes the governor offers more than words.",
      "\u201cAn apology is one thing,\u201d she said by phone ahead of the visit. \u201cWhat actions is she going to take in acknowledging this? These traumas are still impacting our communities.\u201d",
      "Originally established by Presbyterian missionaries in 1855 before the state took ownership in 1875, the Thomas Indian School was among more than 400 government-supported schools established throughout the country with the goal of assimilating Native American youths.",
      "But the schools, which operated for roughly 150 years, had a devastating impact on Native American communities. Staff at the schools worked to strip Native children of their traditions and heritage. Teachers and administrators cut their hair, forbade them from speaking their own languages and forced them into manual labor.",
      "Students, forcibly separated from their families, endured torture, sexual abuse and hatred from school officials. More than 900 children died at the schools, the last of which closed or transitioned into different institutions decades ago.",
      "Former President Joe Biden in October 2024 visited the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona to formally apologize to Native Americans for the \u201csin\u201d of the nation\u2019s government-run boarding school system.",
      "But at least $1.6 million in federal funds destined for research projects on the boarding schools have been among the casualties of President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to rein in the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Tribe officials say Hochul\u2019s visit appears to be the first by a sitting New York governor to the federally recognized tribe\u2019s lands.",
      "\u201cNo words or actions will ever be able to undo the pain and suffering of the Seneca people and other Indigenous peoples across the State, but by visiting the Seneca Nation and the site of the Thomas Indian School we will mark a new day in our relations,\u201d Hochul said in a statement Friday.",
      "Matthew Hill, a tribe member whose father was among the last class of students before the school was shuttered, dismissed the visit as \u201cempty words.\u201d",
      "After all, he said, the Hochul administration and the tribe have been negotiating for years over how much if any of the tribe\u2019s casino revenues the state should be allowed to collect.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re saying sorry for the school, but they\u2019ll continue extorting money from us in the form of gaming revenues,\u201d said Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke.\u201d",

      "The Senate has confirmed real estate developer Charles Kushner, the father of President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has confirmed real estate developer Charles Kushner, the father of President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France.",
      "Charles Kushner was pardoned by Trump in December 2020 after pleading guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations. Prosecutors alleged that he hatched a scheme for revenge and intimidation after discovering his brother-in-law was cooperating with federal authorities in an investigation, hiring a prostitute and arranging to have the encounter recorded with a hidden camera and sent to his own sister, the man\u2019s wife.",
      "Kushner, who was confirmed 51-45, is the founder of Kushner Companies, a real estate firm. His son Jared is a former White House senior adviser to Trump who is married to Trump\u2019s eldest daughter, Ivanka. When he announced his intention to nominate Charles Kushner in November, Trump called him \u201ca tremendous business leader, philanthropist, & dealmaker.\u201d",
      "Charles Kushner will head to France as the relationship between the two traditional allies, and between the U.S. and the rest of Europe, has been strained over Trump\u2019s trade policies and the U.S. role in the Ukraine war. At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Kushner said he would work closely with France to \u201cbring greater balance to our important economic relationship\u201d and also encourage France to \u201cinvest more in its defense capabilities, as well as lead the EU to align with the U.S. vision of increased European commitments to security.\u201d",
      "As Trump has rattled traditionally solid relationships with European allies, Kushner said he appreciates the history between the two countries and is \u201cdedicated to building an even stronger relationship.\" He told senators that he is a child of Holocaust survivors who came to the United States after World War II, and his grandmothers and other members of his family were executed by Nazis.",
      "New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Kushner that his nomination comes at a \u201ccritical time\u201d because \u201cour European allies are anxious.\u201d",
      "Shaheen also asked Kushner about his criminal past. He replied that he made a \u201cvery, very, very serious mistake, and I paid a very heavy price for that mistake.\u201d",
      "Kushner was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison after pleading guilty to 18 counts, including tax evasion and witness tampering. It was the highest sentence he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris Christie, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time and later governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought. Christie called it \u201cone of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes\u201d he ever prosecuted as U.S. attorney.",
      "Kushner also agreed to pay $508,900 to the FEC for violating contribution regulations by failing to obtain an OK from partners to whom more than $500,000 in contributions were credited.",
      "Announcing Kushner's pardon in 2020, Trump\u2019s first White House cited Kushner\u2019s more recent charitable work as the reason he deserved clemency.",
      "\u201cThis record of reform and charity overshadows Mr. Kushner\u2019s conviction and 2 year sentence for preparing false tax returns, witness retaliation, and making false statements\u201d to the Federal Election Commission, the White House said then.",
      "Kushner was confirmed with the support of one Democrat \u2014 New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. In his prepared testimony for his confirmation hearing, Kushner thanked Booker for his \u201cspecial and close friendship.\u201d",

      "SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras -- The United States sent 68 immigrants from Honduras and Colombia back to their countries Monday on the first government-funded flight of what the Trump administration is calling voluntary deportations.",
      "In the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, 38 Hondurans, including 19 children, disembarked from the charter flight carrying $1,000 debit cards from the U.S. government and the offer to one day be allowed to apply for legal entry into the U.S.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to increase deportations substantially. Experts believe the self-deportation offer will only appeal to a small portion of migrants already considering return, but unlikely to spur high demand. The offer has been paired with highly-publicized migrant detentions in the U.S. and flying a couple hundred Venezuelan migrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.",
      "Kevin Antonio Posadas, from Tegucigalpa, had lived in Houston for three years, but had already been considering a return to Honduras when the Trump administration announced its offer.",
      "\u201cI wanted to see my family and my mom,\u201d said Posadas, who added that the process was easy.",
      "\u201cYou just apply (through the CBP Home app ) and in three days you\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said. The flight left Houston early Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s good because you save the cost of the flight if you have the intention of leaving.\u201d",
      "Posadas said he hadn\u2019t feared deportation and liked living in the U.S., but had been thinking for some time about going home. He said eventually he would consider taking up the U.S. government\u2019s offer of allowing those who self-deport to apply to enter the United States legally.",
      "In a statement about the flight Monday, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, \u201cIf you are here illegally, use the CBP Home App to take control of your departure and receive financial support to return home. If you don\u2019t, you will be subjected to fines, arrest, deportation and will never be allowed to return.\u201d",
      "Twenty-six more migrants aboard the flight were headed home to Colombia, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security statement.",
      "Honduras Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio Garc\u00eda said the Honduran government would also support the returning migrants with $100 cash and another $200 credit at a government-run store that sells basic necessities.",
      "Among the migrants arriving voluntarily Monday were four children who were born in the United States, Garc\u00eda said.",
      "Garc\u00eda, who met the arriving migrants at the airport, said they told him that being in the U.S. without documents required for legal immigration or residence had been increasingly difficult, that things were growing more hostile and they feared going to work.",
      "Still, the number of Hondurans deported from the U.S. so far this year is below last year\u2019s pace, said Honduras immigration director Wilson Paz.",
      "While about 13,500 Hondurans have been deported from the U.S. this year, the figure stood at more than 15,000 by this time in 2024, Paz said.",
      "He didn\u2019t expect the number to accelerate much, despite the Trump administration\u2019s intentions.",
      "Some would continue applying to self-deport, because they feel like their time in the U.S. is up or because it\u2019s getting harder to work, he said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be thousands of people who apply for the program,\u201d Paz said. \u201cOur responsibility is that they come in an orderly fashion and we support them.\u201d",

      "Deputy Alfredo \u201cFreddy\u201d Flores died April 20 after enduring third-degree burns across most of his body and a period of medical complications, six months after the fire on Oct. 10, 2023. He was performing a mandatory firearm recertification inside a trailer that serves as a mobile shooting range when it caught on fire at the department's Pitchess Detention Center about 30 miles (48.3 kilometers) north of Los Angeles.",
      "Another deputy with him was also seriously injured. Flores was participating in firearms qualification which the department requires deputies to do once a quarter, Sheriff Robert Luna said in October 2023.",

      "According to the lawsuit, there are well-documented prior instances of fires in mobile shooting ranges in California as well as other ranges operated by the LA County Sheriff's Department. There is also \u201cdocumentation of violations\u201d by the department related to unsafe practices in the operation and maintenance of its mobile shooting ranges, the suit said.",
      "The family is also seeking relief from Inveris Training Solutions, the manufacturer of the trailer. Mobile Inveris shooting ranges are \u201cdefectively designed\u201d and have a high risk of fires from a buildup of the combustible material that isn't properly cleaned and ventilated, the lawsuit said.",
      "The suit asks for injunctive relief to stop the county's operations of its mobile gun ranges, compensation for damages as well as civil penalties.",
      "Flores was a deputy for 22 years and his assignments included the North County Correctional Facility and Altadena Station. He is survived by his wife, two daughters and two sons.",

      "The sheriff who oversees the New Orleans jail where 10 men escaped last week says defective locks were a key factor in the jailbreak",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Just days before 10 men broke out of a New Orleans jail, officials with the sheriff's office asked for money to fix faulty locks and cell doors deemed a key factor in the escape.",
      "As the manhunt for the remaining seven fugitives stretches into a new week, officials continue to investigate who or what was to blame in a jailbreak that even the escapees labeled as \u201ceasy\u201d \u2014 in a message scrawled on a wall above the narrow hole they squeezed through.",
      "Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson said she has long raised concerns about the jail's ongoing \u201cdeficiencies,\" adding that the breakout has \u201conce again highlighted the critical need for repairs and upgrades\u201d to the ailing infrastructure.",
      "The men yanked open a cell door, slipped through a hole behind a toilet, scaled a barbed wire fence and fled from the jail early Friday, recorded surveillance video showed.",
      "While Hutson said the locks played a key role in the escape, there are other crucial security lapses that officials have outlined; Indications that the escape may have been an inside job, with three sheriff\u2019s employees now on suspension; the hole that officials said may have been formed using power tools; a lack of monitoring of the cell pod, as the employee tasked with the job had stepped out to grab food; and law enforcement not being aware of the escape until a morning headcount seven hours after the men fled.",
      "Attorney General Liz Murrill said on Monday that state and local officials, courts and law enforcement are working together to hastily address issues at the ailing jail.",
      "Murrill said it's \"not a secret\u201d that the jail had been experiencing staffing shortages and maintenance defects for years.",
      "The sheriff's office says it has long raised concerns about issues at the jail. As recently as four days before the escape, Jeworski \u201cJay\u201d Mallet \u2014 the Chief of Corrections for the Orleans Justice Center \u2014 presented a need for a new lock system during the city's Capital Improvement Plan hearing.",
      "Mallet said the current system at the jail, which houses around 1,400 people, was built for a \u201cminimum custody type of inmate.\"",
      "But he classified many at the jail as \u201chigh security\u201d inmates who are awaiting trials for violent offenses, including charges such as murder, assault and rape. He said many require a \u201crestrictive housing environment that did not exist\" at the jail and, as a result, the sheriff's office has transferred dozens in custody to more secure locations.",
      "In the aftermath of the escape, Murrill said officials are looking at ways to \u201charden physical aspects of this prison so that we can be realistic about the population that is being held there.\u201d",
      "Mallet said some cell unit doors and locks have been \u201cmanipulated\" to the point that they can't even be closed properly.",
      "Since becoming sheriff in 2022, Hutson said she has complained about the locks at every turn and advocated for additional funding to make the facility more secure.",
      "New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said during a news conference on Sunday that funding for the jail has been \u201ca priority\u201d and that funding has been allocated to the sheriff's office for operating expenses and capital improvements. Bianka Brown, the chief financial officer for the sheriff's office, said the current budget \u201cdoesn't support what we need\u201d to ensure critical fixes and upgrades.",
      "\u201cThings are being deprived,\" Brown said of the jail, which for more than a decade has been subject to federal monitoring and a consent decree intended to improve conditions. The jail, which opened in 2015, replaced another facility that had its own history of escapes and violence.",
      "Other's have pointed to Hutson being at fault. State Rep. Aimee Adatto Freeman, who represents much of uptown New Orleans, called for sheriff to step down on Monday.",
      "\u201cRather than take accountability, she\u2019s pointed fingers elsewhere,\u201d Freeman wrote in a statement. \u201cBlaming funding is a deflection--not an excuse.\u201d",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry recently announced the state is launching an investigation into who is responsible in the escape. He also directed the state\u2019s Department of Corrections to conduct an audit of the jail\u2019s compliance with basic correctional standards.",
      "The governor also requested an inventory of pre-trial detainees or those awaiting sentencing in violent cases at the facility, to consider moving them into state custody.",
      "Three of the seven inmates still at large late Monday were convicted of or are facing second-degree murder charges, authorities said.",

      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- A vanishing species of whale gave birth to few babies this birthing season, raising alarms among scientists and conservationists who fear the animal could go extinct.",
      "The whale is the North Atlantic right whale, which numbers only about 370 and has declined in population in recent years. The whales give birth to calves off the southeastern United States from mid-November to mid-April, and federal authorities have said they need to have at least 50 calves per season to start recovering.",
      "The whales didn't come anywhere near that number this year. The calving season produced only 11 mother-calf pairs, scientists with the New England Aquarium in Boston said.",
      "The lack of baby whales underscores the need for protection of the whales, conservationists said Monday. The whales are vulnerable to entanglement in marine fishing gear and collisions with large ships.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re also reproducing more slowly than they used to,\u201d said the International Fund for Animal Welfare in its calving season report card. \"This is likely due to stress from entanglements, navigation amongst busy maritime traffic, increasing ocean noise, and the changing distribution of their food sources.\"",
      "The calving season did have some bright spots. Several females gave birth for the first time, and that gives hope for the future, the aquarium said in a statement. The whale population only has about 70 reproductive females left.",
      "\u201cWith past calf counts ranging from 39 to zero, we never know how any calving season will unfold. While the calf count is relatively low this year, I am encouraged by four new mothers being added to the reproductive pool,\u201d said Philip Hamilton, senior scientist in the Aquarium\u2019s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life.",
      "The whales can weigh up to 150,000 pounds (45,360 kilograms) and were heavily exploited during the era of commercial whaling. They've been protected for decades, but have been slow to recover.",
      "In recent years, scientists have said the whales have strayed from established protected zones in search of food, and that has put them at elevated risk of entanglements and collisions. The whales migrate migrate from the south to New England and Canada to feed on tiny ocean organisms.",

      "Ritchie was executed at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, according to Indiana Department of Correction officials. IDOC said in a statement that the process started shortly after midnight and Ritchie was pronounced dead at 12:46 a.m.",
      "Ritchie's last meal was from the Olive Garden and he expressed love, support and peace for his friends and family, according to the statement.",

      "It was a stunt to generate sympathy and support for the Black candidate, Yemi Mobolade, prosecutors have said, but two people accused of staging it are set to go on trial Monday, charged with making a threat against him.",
      "Mobolade, the city's first Black mayor, is scheduled to testify in the case as a victim, according to court documents.",
      "But one of the defendants claims Mobolade himself was a participant in the plan to help him win. And the defendant\u2019s attorneys say their alleged actions were political theater \u2014 free speech that is constitutionally protected and wasn\u2019t meant to cause harm.",
      "\"This was a hoax in every sense of the word,\u201d defendant Ashley Blackcloud told The Associated Press. She said Mobolade knew in advance about their plans to burn the cross, but she would not comment further, citing a court order that bars discussing information gathered in the case before the trial. Blackcloud, who is indigenous and Black, said the stunt was not intended to hurt anyone.",
      "Mobolade has previously denied any involvement emphatically. A city spokesperson, Vanessa Zink, said the mayor did not want to want to make any additional comment.",
      "The second defendant \u2014 Blackcloud\u2019s husband, Derrick Bernard \u2014 is serving a life sentence after being convicted last year of ordering the killing of a rapper in Colorado Springs. The man charged with carrying out the killing was recently acquitted, and Bernard is appealing his conviction.",
      "Messages left for Blackcloud's lawyer and Bernard's lawyer were not returned.",
      "However, in motions to dismiss the case they pointed out that the cross was set on fire in the middle of the night, which no one other than the defendants apparently saw.",
      "They are, however, accused of spreading word about it in emails to the media and others that include images of the scene.",
      "They are each charged with using a means of interstate commerce \u2014 the internet and email \u2014 to make a threat and conveying false information about an attempt to intimidate Mobolade with a fire. They are also both charged with being part of a conspiracy to do that. They have pleaded not guilty.",
      "According to jury instructions in the case, prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Bernard and Blackcloud intended Mobolade to fear that violence would result in order for them to be found guilty.",
      "Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Regina M. Rodriguez ruled that the alleged actions are not ones that are clearly protected by the First Amendment, which would have required her to dismiss the case.",
      "\u201cIt is up to the jury to determine whether the cross burning was a true threat or merely political speech,\u201d she wrote.",
      "A third person indicted in the alleged scheme, Deanna West, pleaded guilty in March to one count of being part of a conspiracy to set the fire and then spread false information about it, under a plea agreement with prosecutors. According to that agreement, West's lawyer and government prosecutors agreed that the conspiracy\u2019s goal was to interfere in the campaign of Mobolade\u2019s opponent and create the belief that Mobolade was being discouraged from running because of his race.",
      "West is also scheduled to testify for the government.",
      "According to the indictment, Bernard communicated with Mobolade before the cross burning on April 23, 2023, and after Mobolade won election in a May 6, 2023, runoff.",
      "About a week before the cross burning, Bernard told the then-candidate in a Facebook message that he was \u201cmobilizing my squadron in defense and for the final push. Black ops style big brother. The klan cannot be allowed to run this city again.\u201d",
      "They spoke for about five minutes on the telephone three days after the incident.",

      "As the U.S. government begins reinstating international students\u2019 records following an expansive crackdown, many face a daunting and complicated path toward rebuilding their lives",
      "After the government terminated his legal status in the U.S., one student abruptly lost his laboratory job in Houston and, fearing detention, he returned to his home country in south Asia on a one-way ticket.",
      "The Trump administration later reversed course in its expansive crackdown on international students, but there was a major obstacle. The student cannot return because his American visa was revoked.",
      "Without it, he\u2019s \u201cstranded,\u201d said the student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.",
      "As the government begins reinstating students' records, many face a daunting and complicated path toward rebuilding their lives. For those who left, there is no guarantee they can return. Others have faced challenges reenrolling in school and returning to jobs.",
      "Mental anguish from their ordeals linger, as do feelings of vulnerability. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has expanded the grounds for terminating a student\u2019s legal status, leaving many to fear they could be targeted again.",
      "A total of more than 4,700 international students had their permission to study in the U.S. canceled this spring, with little notice or explanation. In court hearings, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through an FBI-run database that contains the names of suspects and people who have been arrested, even if they were never charged with a crime or had charges dropped.",
      "At a court hearing last week in Oakland, California, lawyers for international students sought a nationwide injunction they said would protect their clients and others across the country.",
      "But government attorneys said that wasn't necessary because ICE was mailing status reactivation letters to affected students. It likely will take two weeks for all students to receive their letter, which can then be shared with universities and employers, assistant U.S. attorney Elizabeth Kurlan said.",
      "The plaintiffs' lawyers said the letter is meaningless, arguing ICE\u2019s new policy suggests student records can be terminated on a whim. There's also no evidence ICE has asked the State Department to restore revoked visas, the plaintiffs' attorneys said.",
      "The man in Houston left within about a week of learning his legal status had been terminated. Around that time, he also received an email that the visa he used to enter the U.S. had been revoked. He believes his termination stemmed from a 2021 fraud case that was dismissed.",
      "Over nearly a decade he had built a life in the U.S., where he was enrolled in \u201coptional practical training,\u201d which allows foreign students to stay and work for up to three years on their student visas. In his home country, he is now looking for work and living with his mother.",
      "The wait time for a U.S. visa interview is at least a year, he said.",
      "Even if he got another visa, returning would be complicated because of his financial situation. He had a car loan and credit cards in the U.S. that he can\u2019t afford to pay after losing his job, and his credit score has since dropped, he said.",
      "\u201cRevoking a visa or revoking a SEVIS status does not just affect the educational side of things, it affects the whole life,\u201d said the student, who has struggled with feelings of loneliness and also grief over his father's recent death.",
      "SEVIS is the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database that tracks international students\u2019 compliance with their visa status.",
      "Students who left the country may not have known their rights or had the resources to hire a lawyer, said Ben Loveman, an immigration attorney. They now will have a harder time being reinstated, he said.",
      "\u201cThere were huge consequences,\u201d Loveman said.",
      "For a Nepali programmer in Texas who had his status terminated, the ordeal brought up a mistake he thought he had left in the past.",
      "The programmer, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear or retaliation, was arrested four years ago for drunken driving. He said he took responsibility for his actions, performing community service hours, serving probation and paying fines. The judge told him the records could be sealed after two years, but the case appears to explain why he was targeted by immigration authorities.",
      "\u201cI followed everything,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to take it all, at least give me due process.\u201d",
      "His status has since been restored, and the programmer, who is on an OPT program, has gone back to his job. But the episode hasn\u2019t faded from his mind.",
      "If the right opportunity emerged in another country like New Zealand or Canada, he said he would take it and leave.",
      "A student at Iowa State University who also requested anonymity out of concern about being targeted, said he is looking for options to leave the U.S., after what he describes as a \u201cdark period.\u201d",
      "The Ph.D. student said his status termination pushed him to a mental breaking point. He had a plane ticket back home to Bangladesh reserved. He hardly left his apartment, and when he did, he felt he was being followed.",
      "He attributes his termination to pending charges against him for marijuana possession, but he said he hadn't been convicted.",
      "After his status reinstatement, he restarted a teaching assistant job he had lost. Then, he had to catch up on grading almost three weeks of assignments for dozens of students.",
      "While he's relieved to get back to school, he's confident about his decision to leave by the end of the year \u2014 either for home or Europe. The degree is not worth the risk of another status termination, he said.",

      "The decision comes after Downing Street said bosses at the troubled firm \"rewarding themselves for failure is clearly not acceptable\".",
      "The company's \"retention scheme\" was set to amount to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, which could have led to them getting \u00a31m on top of their annual salaries and regular bonuses.",
      "Thames had been accused by the environment secretary of \"trying to circumvent\" forthcoming rules to ban water companies from paying bonuses.",

      "Please don't fine us, Thames Water asks regulator",

      "Detectives investigating cyber attacks on UK retailers are focussing on a notorious cluster of cyber criminals known to be young English-speakers, some of them teenagers, police have revealed.",
      "For weeks speculation has mounted that disruptive attacks on M&S, Co-op, Harrods and some US retailers could be the work of a hacking community called Scattered Spider.",
      "Speaking about the hacks for the first time, the National Crime Agency (NCA) has told BBC News the group is a key part of its ongoing investigation to find the culprits.",
      "\"We are looking at the group that is publicly known as Scattered Spider, but we've got a range of different hypotheses and we'll follow the evidence to get to the offenders,\" Paul Foster, head of the NCA's national cyber crime unit, said in a new BBC documentary.",
      "\"In light of all the damage that we're seeing, catching whoever is behind these attacks is our top priority,\" he added.",
      "The wave of attacks, which began at Easter, have resulted in empty shelves in stores, the suspension of online ordering, and millions of people's private data being stolen.",
      "The hacks have been carried out using DragonForce, a platform that gives criminals the tools to carry out ransomware attacks. However, the hackers pulling the strings have still not been identified and no arrests have been made.",
      "Some cyber experts say the hackers display the traits of Scattered Spider, a loose community of often young individuals who organise across sites like Discord, Telegram and in forums, most likely located in the UK and US.",
      "Although the NCA says it is exploring all parts of the cyber crime ecosystem, it too is looking in the same direction.",
      "\"We know that Scattered Spider are largely English-speaking but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the UK - we know that they communicate online amongst themselves in a range of different platforms and channels, which is, I guess, key to their ability to then be able to operate as a collective,\" Mr Foster said.",
      "M&S has been hit with ransomware, which has scrambled the company's servers rendering computer systems useless. The high street giant is still struggling to keep shelves stocked and has halted online shopping for weeks. Hackers have also stolen customer and employee data from the company.",
      "At Co-op, staff took systems offline to prevent a ransomware infection but a huge amount of customer and staff data was stolen and is being held to ransom. Operations at the firm's supermarkets, insurance offices and funeral services have been badly affected.",
      "It is not known what is happening at Harrods but the company admitted it had to pull computer systems offline because of an attempted cyber attack.",
      "When the hackers behind the M&S and Co-op attacks anonymously contacted the BBC last week, they declined to say whether or not they were Scattered Spider.",
      "'Tools readily available'",
      "Cyber security researchers at CrowdStrike formed the name \"Scattered Spider\" because of the group's sporadic nature, but other cyber companies have given the cluster nicknames including Octo Tempest and Muddled Libra.",
      "The group was also linked to high-profile attacks including on two US casinos in 2023 and Transport for London last year.",
      "And in November, the US charged five British and American men and boys in their twenties and teens for alleged Scattered Spider activity. One is 23-year-old Scottish man Tyler Buchanan, who has not made a plea, and the rest are US based.",
      "NCA investigators will not say how the retail hackers have managed to breach victim organisations but earlier this month, the National Cyber Security Centre issued guidance to organisations urging them to review their IT help desk password reset processes.",
      "\"Calling up IT help desks is a tactic that Scattered Spider seems to favour and they use social engineering techniques to manipulate someone into doing something like clicking on a link or resetting someone's account to a password they can use,\" Lisa Forte, from cyber security firm Red Goat, explained.",
      "In the BBC documentary, a former teen hacker who was arrested nine years ago and now works in cyber security, said he was not surprised that teenagers could be behind the hacks.",
      "\"It wouldn't surprise me - quite [the] opposite. The tools are readily available and it's very easy to jump online and search straight away. You can feel a bit untouchable but for what end? You're gonna be arrested 99% of the time,\" he said.",

      "There are doubts over whether UK passport holders will be able to use e-gates at EU airports this summer.",
      "The EU Commission has told the BBC that UK citizens will not have access to them until a new scheme to enhance border security comes into force in October, and even then it is up to individual countries.",
      "When asked if e-gates would be available this summer, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden told the BBC: \"Nothing is going to happen before that's [the new scheme] in place.\"",
      "Since the UK left the EU bloc, many popular holiday destinations have seen long queues of British travellers at airports as they wait for passports to be checked.",
      "The new European Entry/Exit Scheme (EES) gathers biometric data on citizens arriving in the EU from non-member, third-party countries, which includes the UK.",
      "After technology delays, it is now due to roll out in October 2025.",
      "\"The EU is introducing this new entry and exit scheme so nothing is going to happen before that's in place, and that's not yet in place. They've put the date back for that a few times, the latest date is the autumn, let's see if that's stuck to.",
      "\"After that it's up to the member states. But this gives us the possibility, I'd say the probability, that people will be able to use the e-gates in future, which is not a possibility at the moment,\" McFadden added.",
      "Monday's deal between the UK and the EU says there will be \"no legal barriers to eGate use for British Nationals traveling to and from EU Member States after the introduction of the EU Entry/Exit System (EES)\".",
      "The prime minister's official spokesperson said that the UK would \"be working with member states to roll that out as quickly as possible\", adding that \"talks have started with individual EU nations\".",
      "An EU Commission spokesperson told the BBC that the introduction of the EES would open the possibility of using e-gates for all non-EU citizens, including UK citizens and mean faster processing at borders.",
      "\"Once the EES is in place, UK nationals will therefore be able to use e-gates where they are available, provided they are registered in the system.\"",
      "Some EU countries already allow UK citizens to use their e-gates, so it is possible that talks with individual nations could result in more letting British passengers use their gates this summer.",
      "Speaking about the agreement on Tuesday with supermarket workers, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"They were excited about the e-gates and being able to go on their holidays, which they have obviously already planned, and not be in the horrendously long queues. \"",
      "Surprise inclusion",
      "The inclusion of e-gates in the deal has surprised some in the travel industry, as they had understood the gates were always going to be available to UK passport holders in the EU once EES begins in October.",
      "Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership, an independent travel group, said:",
      "\"This new deal appears to offer little more than expanded access to e-gates which are already in use at some destinations and only after the long-delayed digital border system (EES) is introduced, currently planned for an October launch.\"",
      "Currently, EU destinations which already allow UK passport holders to use e-gates often then require a secondary check and a passport stamp.",
      "The new deal and EES means UK passport holders will likely no longer require a stamp.",
      "The launch of EES has been in the pipeline for a while. It will see non-EU nationals needing to add their biometric data to a new EU database, which will be done at the point of departure to the EU, either at an airport, port or train station."

    "story": [
      "Millions of shoppers could get up to \u00a370 each after a tribunal approved a settlement in a lawsuit against Mastercard which stemmed from historic fees levied on businesses by the card provider.",
      "The decision comes after a long-running legal case going back almost a decade, brought forward by a former financial ombudsman.",
      "Walter Merricks argued that shoppers were charged higher prices after fees were wrongly levied on transactions made over a 15-year period between 1992 and 2008.",
      "It is not necessary to have owned a Mastercard at any point to be eligible for compensation. Mastercard declined to comment on the court ruling.",
      "Who can claim?",
      "Consumers are eligible to claim compensation if they lived in England, Wales or Northern Ireland for at least three months between June 1997 and June 2008, and  bought goods or services from UK businesses that accepted Mastercard credit cards.",
      "For those who live in Scotland, the starting point is May 1992.",
      "The entire settlement is for \u00a3200m, with \u00a3100m ringfenced for consumers who have until the end of this year to claim and if the expected 5% of claimants - 2.5 million people - come forward, then each will receive \u00a345.",

      "Flying home from his Gulf trip last week, President Donald Trump told reporters \"that was a great four days, historic four days\".",
      "Visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), he added in this trademark swagger that \"the jobs and money coming into our countries, there has never been anything like it\".",
      "Trump claimed that he was able to secure deals totalling more than $2tn (\u00a31.5tn) for the US, but do the numbers add up?",
      "The trip itself was an extravaganza, with the three Gulf states pulling out all the stops.",
      "Escorts of fighter jets, extravagant welcoming ceremonies, a thundering 21-gun salute, a fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks, royal camels, Arabian horses, and sword dancers were all part of the pageantry.",
      "The UAE also awarded Mr Trump the country's highest civilian honour, the Order of Zayed.",
      "The visit's optics were striking; the region's richest petrostates flaunted their opulence, revealing just how much of that fortune they were ready to deploy to strengthen ties with the US while advancing their own economic goals.",
      "Ros Atkins on... Trump's deals in the Gulf",
      "Trump heads to Saudi Arabia eyeing more investment in US",
      "What did Trump's speech in Saudi Arabia reveal?",
      "Before embarking on the trip, President Trump, who touts himself as a \"dealmaker in chief\" was clear that the main objective of the trip was to land investments worth billions of dollars. On the face of it, he succeeded.",
      "In Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reiterated a pledge to invest $600bn in US-Saudi partnerships. There were a plethora of deals announced as part of this, encompassing arms, artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, infrastructure projects and science collaborations, and various security ties and initiatives.",
      "The $142bn defence deal grabbed a lot of the attention as it was described by the White House as the largest arms deal ever.",
      "However, there remains some doubt as to whether those investment figures are realistic.",
      "During his first term in office from 2017 to 2021, Trump had announced that Saudi Arabia had agreed to $450bn in deals with the US.",
      "But actual trade and investment flows amounted to less than $300bn between 2017 to 2020, according to data compiled by the Arab Gulf States Institute.",
      "The report was authored by Tim Callen, the former International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission chief to Saudi Arabia, and now a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute.",
      "\"The proof with all of these [new] deals will be in the pudding,\" says Mr Callen.",
      "The BBC contacted the White House for comment.",
      "In Qatar, Trump announced an \"economic exchange\" worth at least $1.2tn. However, in the fact sheet released by the White House deals worth only $243.5bn between the two countries were mentioned.",
      "One of the Qatari agreements that was confirmed was Qatar Airways purchasing up to 210 passenger jets for $96bn from the beleaguered American aircraft manufacturer Boeing.",
      "The White House said the deal would support 154,000 jobs in the US each year of their production, totalling one million jobs over the deal's lifecycle.",
      "Meanwhile, the UAE inked an agreement to construct the world's largest AI campus outside the US, reportedly granting it access to 500,000 cutting edge microchips from US giant Nvidia, starting next year.",
      "This project sits within the UAE's broader pledge to invest $1.4tn in the US over the next decade.",
      "As well as the challenge of delivering what is promised, another potential obstacle to these figures being realised are oil prices.",
      "Oil prices tumbled to a four-year low in April amid growing concerns that Trump's tariffs could dampen global economic growth. The decline was further fuelled by the group of oil producing nations, Opec+, announcing plans to increase output.",
      "For Saudi Arabia, the fall in global oil prices since the start of the year has further strained its finances, increasing pressure to either raise debt or cut spending to sustain its development goals.",
      "Last month, the IMF cut the forecast for the world's largest oil exporter's GDP growth in 2025 to 3% from its previous estimate of 3.3%.",
      "\"It's going to be very hard for Saudi to come up with that sort of money [the $600bn announced] in the current oil price environment,\" Mr Callen adds.",
      "Other analysts note that a lot of the agreements signed during the trip were non-binding memorandums of understanding, which are less formal than contracts, and do not always translate into actual transactions. And some of the deals included in the agreement were announced earlier.",
      "Saudi oil firm Aramco, for instance, announced 34 agreements with US companies valued at up to $90bn. However, most were non-binding memorandums of understanding without specified monetary commitments.",
      "And its agreement to purchase 1.2 million tonnes of liquified natural gas annually for 20 years from US firm NextDecade was also included in the list of new deals, despite it first being announced months ago.",
      "Yet the massive investments mark a continuation of the shift in the US-Gulf relationship away from oil-for-security to stronger economic partnerships rooted in bilateral investments.",
      "Bader Al Saif, an assistant professor at Kuwait University and an associate fellow at think tank Chatham House, says that the deals indicate that US and the Gulf states are \"planning the future together and that was a significant change for the relationship\".",
      "He adds that the AI deals with the UAE and Saudi Arabia were central to this as \"they clearly demonstrate that they are trying to see how to build the new global order and the new way of doing things together\".",
      "This emphasis on AI underscores the growing strategic importance of the technology to US diplomacy. Trump was accompanied on the trip by Sam Altman, the boss of OpenAI, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Elon Musk, who owns Grok AI.",
      "And on the eve of the visit, the White House scrapped tough Biden-era restrictions on exports of the advanced US semiconductors required to best run AI systems. The rules had divided the world into tiers, with some countries enjoying broad access to its high-end chips, and others being denied them altogether.",
      "About 120 countries, including the Gulf nations, were grouped in the middle, facing strict caps on the number of semiconductors they could import. This had frustrated countries such as Saudi Arabia, who have ambitions to become high-tech economies as they transition away from oil.",
      "Both Saudi and the UAE are racing to build large-scale AI data centres, while Abu Dhabi, the UAE's capital, aims to become a global AI hub.",
      "The UAE has made visible efforts to reassure Washington \u2013 deepening partnerships with US tech firms, curbing ties with Chinese companies, and aligning more closely with American national security interests.",
      "Mr Al-Saif says that the UAE is \"betting on the Americans when it comes to AI\". \"We have seen that the technological turn in the 90s came from the US anyway.\"",
      "Both camps are hailing the visit as a triumph. For the Gulf, and especially Saudi Arabia, it resets a partnership that frayed under Biden, and underscores their ambition to act as heavyweight players on the world stage.",
      "For Trump, touting \"trillions\" in new investment offers a timely boost - his tariff hikes have dented global trade and pushed US output into its first quarterly dip in three years.",
      "These Gulf deals will be sold as proof that his economic playbook is working.",
      "At the end of the trip, Mr Trump worried that whoever succeeds him in the White House would claim credit for the deals once they come to completion.",
      "\"I'll be sitting home, who the hell knows where I'll be, and I'll say, 'I did that,'\" he said.",

      "Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live whether the government was considering changing course, cabinet minister Pat McFadden replied: \"I can't say anything about that. When budgets are agreed, they're agreed in the round.\"",

      "But she added: \"I do understand the concerns that people have.\"",
      "She said she would \"continue to listen to understand the concerns that people have raised\".",
      "\"We are a government that listens,\" the chancellor said.",
      "\"But we would always need to show where the money is going to come from if we're going to make any policy changes. That would be part of the normal process.\"",
      "Her comments mark a change in tone since Reeves urged Labour MPs to back her plan to cut winter fuel payments in September last year.",
      "At a meeting of Labour MPs that month, Reeves told Labour backbenchers: \"It is the right thing to do, to target money at a time when finances are so stretched, at people who need them most.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman told reporters there \"will not be a change to the government's policy\" on the winter fuel payment, despite growing calls within Labour ranks for a rethink.",
      "Some MPs raised questions about the payment as they grilled Sir Keir at a meeting in Parliament on Monday.",
      "Speaking to the BBC ahead of that meeting, Labour MP Stella Creasy said it would be \"remiss\" of the government to dismiss concerns over the winter fuel payment.",
      "\"Those concerns are being heard across the party,\" Creasy said.",
      "\"Those of us who have been around a long time and among new MPs, there's a genuine concern to get this right and that's now what the government needs to respond to.\"",
      "The Liberal Democrats said it remained to be seen whether the chancellor had listened.",
      "\"This U-turn is taking so long it puts turning an oil tanker around to shame,\" Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said.",
      "\"The government should feel embarrassed that it has taken a dire set of a local election results to realise what everyone has known from the start: this policy was doomed to fail and punished some of the most vulnerable.\"",
      "The winter fuel payment is a lump-sum amount of \u00a3200 a year for pensioners under 80, increasing to \u00a3300 for over-80s, paid in November or December.",
      "Last year, the government restricted the payments to those who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits, in a bid to save \u00a31.4bn.",
      "The move did not feature in Labour's general election manifesto.",
      "It was seen as a key issue at this month's local elections, at which Labour lost 187 council seats and control of the only council it was defending.",
      "The winter fuel payment was introduced in 1997 by New Labour as a universal payment for all pensioners.",
      "It was billed as a way to guarantee they would be able to pay for increased heating costs over the winter - although in practice it is a pension top-up, which recipients can spend on whatever they want.",
      "This year state pensions are going up by 4.1% - a rise of \u00a3363 a year for those on the basic pension, or \u00a3472 for those on the new pension.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 11:17:10 GMT",
    "summary": "New trade agreements will boost economic growth, says chancellor, as she sets sights on Middle East.",
    "story": [
      "The UK wants to strike a trade deal with countries in the Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar, as its next move, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told the BBC.",
      "She claimed the UK was now in a better place on trade \"than any other country in the world\", following major trade deals with India, the US and the EU that were signed this month.",
      "Reeves also suggested that the prospect of closer trading relationships would boost forecasts for UK growth.",
      "But opposition parties have criticised the government for some of the concessions offered in return for trade deals.",
      "In early April, the government said it was continuing discussions with Gulf nations, started by the previous Conservative government, which focused on boosting UK food and drink, renewable energy and manufacturing exports, and attracting more inward investment into the UK.",
      "If that is the government's next deal it may prove politically controversial, given the human rights record of some of the six countries involved.",
      "However, Reeves said the UK was \"not looking to have trade negotiations with China\", which could raise similar objections.",
      "Reeves was speaking to the BBC in the wake of the announcement of a trade pact with the EU on Monday, which has prompted criticism from opposition parties.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the latest EU deal took the UK \"backwards\", while Reform leader Nigel Farage said on social media that Labour had \"sold out\" the fishing industry and called the EU an \"ever-diminishing political union\".",
      "Meanwhile, Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said the EU deal was a \"welcome stepping stone\", but called for the government to go further and agree to a customs union.",
      "The deal with the EU, including fishing, trade, defence and energy, marks the biggest agreement between the parties since the UK left the trading bloc in 2020 following the Brexit vote.",
      "That pact follows hot on the heels of a trade deal with India which makes it easier for UK firms to export whisky, cars and other products to the country, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports.",
      "The government has also secured an agreement with US President Donald Trump to reduce tariffs on some goods traded between the nations.",
      "Growth boost",
      "Reeves suggested to the BBC that Britain's economic growth forecast was on course to be upgraded as a result of the three trade agreements.",
      "When the government's official forecasting body provides its assessment of the economy alongside the autumn Budget, it would take into account stronger than expected growth in the first three months of the year, and improved trading relations, she said.",
      "\"We are forecasting growth of 1% this year, and we had 0.7% in Q1 and they'll take into account the new trade deals that have been secured,\" said Reeves.",
      "The \"reset\" with the EU only removes some of the additional barriers to trade resulting from Brexit, and so is only expected to boost growth by less than half a per cent.",
      "Economists say more economic benefits could be gained from rejoining the single market and customs union and allowing freedom of movement, but those are \"red lines\" the government has said it will not cross.",
      "A higher growth rate usually means people are getting paid a little bit more, can spend more and more jobs are created by businesses investing, but it would also give the chancellor more room to manoeuvre when it comes to tax or borrowing rises, or spending cuts.",
      "However, the strong uptick in growth between January and March is not expected to last, in part due to the effect of US tariffs on global growth.",
      "EU relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said business organisations and firms, ranging from defence to the supermarkets, had welcomed the agreement because it would be \"economically advantageous up and down the country\".",
      "He conceded that not all of the government's ambitions had been achieved, including establishing new rules allowing musicians, performers, accountants and lawyers to work more easily in the EU.",
      "Shadow foreign minister, Priti Patel, said she was \"all for reducing cost and bureaucracy\" but criticised the deal's \"lack of detail\".",
      "Pushed on why the previous Conservative government had not pursued a new deal with the EU earlier she told the BBC's Today Programme the original Brexit arrangement had always been \"transitional\".",
      "\"We all knew we would go back and look at further discussions,\" she said.",
      "The new UK-EU deal at a glance",
      "UK and India agree trade deal after three years of talks",
      "What is in the UK-US tariff deal?",
      "Food standards",
      "It appears the government had the EU, the UK's largest trading partner, in mind during its talks with the US and India.",
      "As part of the deal with the EU, in return for extending current fishing rules, checks have been reduced on UK food exports.",
      "Reeves said UK officials had made it clear to the Trump administration and India that food standards were not up for negotiation in their agreements.",
      "\"We increased the quota for the import of beef from the US, it was all still on the high standards that we pride ourselves in, and in part because standards matter to us, but also because we wanted to secure this agreement with the EU, which is by far the biggest market for UK agriculture and fishing,\" the chancellor said.",
      "Both sides agreed to cooperate further on a \"youth experience scheme\" allowing young people to work and travel more freely again, but this is subject to further negotiations.",
      "Reeves described the recent trade agreements as having \"come along like buses\" and said \"Britain is in a better place than any other country in the world in terms of deals with those countries\".",
      "\"The first deal and the best deal so far with the US, we've got the best deal with the EU for any country outside the EU, and we've got the best trade agreement with India,\" Reeves added.",
      "\"Not only are these important in their own right, but it also shows that Britain now is the place for investment and business, because we've got preferential deals with the biggest economies around the world.\""

      "A few years ago, there were a few cyber and ransomware attacks, but in the last year there has been \"a huge increase\", he said.",
      "About half of the food consumed in the UK \"goes through the cold chain sector\", he said, so hackers \"know how critical\" distribution is for \"putting food on supermarket shelves\".",
      "He added that was \"a really good lever to put the pressure on our companies to actually pay that ransomware\".",
      "Mr Pluck said that he knew of at least ten attacks on member companies, but that firms like to keep attacks \"under the radar\".",
      "He said cyber attacks were \"hugely underreported\" in any sector \"because once you're attacked you lose control of your company\" both through the attack and the mitigations by police and insurers.",
      "Co-op narrowly avoided being locked out of its systems during an attack which exposed customer data and caused shortages of stock.",

      "She says that there are a number of low-tech ways to keep buildings cool, such as designing for air flow.",
      "For outdoor workers, even a 20-minute break from the heat and humidity, such as in well-designed cooling stations, can make a difference.",
      "But beyond this, active cooling will become increasingly critical as temperatures continue to rise due to climate change.",
      "Morgan Stanley is predicting that the annual growth rate of the cooling market, already worth $235bn (\u00a3180bn) a year, could more than double by 2030.",
      "Yet existing cooling devices have serious drawbacks. One issue the refrigerant - the fluid that transitions back and forth from liquid to gas, in a process that transfers heat.",
      "It's common for them to leak from standard systems, harming both efficiency and potentially health.",
      "The refrigerants typically used in cooling today are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a group of synthetic gases with high global warming potential. HFCs are much more potent than carbon dioxide.",
      "So one option is to replace the refrigerants with more climate-friendly versions. But the candidates with the lower global warming potential, also have problems.",
      "For instance, propane is highly flammable. Ammonia is toxic. Carbon dioxide works at high pressures, requiring specialised equipment.",
      "But as many places phase down HFCs, alternative refrigerants will remain important.",
      "Ms Sachar says that we still need refrigerants because for home cooling, \"A/Cs as we know them today will continue to be the solution, at least for the next decade or so\".",
      "In the longer term, some scientists are looking toward cooling devices that don't need liquid refrigerants at all.",
      "Lindsay Rasmussen, who manages building and land-use projects at the energy non-profit RMI, calls these \"revolutionary technologies\".",
      "A major set of revolutionary cooling tech is solid-state cooling. This uses solid materials and some sort of additional force to induce temperature changes. That extra force could be pressure, voltage, magnets or mechanical stress.",
      "Ms Rasmussen says that solid-state devices can go further than incremental improvements because \"not only do they eliminate those super-polluting refrigerants, but they can also offer improved efficiency to the systems\".",
      "RMI has identified between 10 and 20 start-ups working on early versions of solid-state cooling devices.",
      "One of those startups is the German company Magnotherm, which uses magnets. Certain materials change temperature when exposed to magnetic fields.",
      "\"With our technology, it's inherently safe because it's not toxic, it's a metal, and we operate at very low pressures,\" according to Timur Sirman, the CEO and cofounder of Magnotherm.",
      "The idea of magnetocaloric cooling has been around for years, but commercialising it is relatively new. Magnotherm has built about 40 beverage coolers, and about five refrigerators, in what is so far a manual and in-house process.",
      "The permanent magnets are the most expensive part of the technology, Mr Sirman reports. \"But it never breaks, so we can always reuse this quite cost-intensive component.\"",
      "The company is seeking out alternative sources of magnetic fields, as well as optimising materials, as they aim to dramatically increase the cooling capacity of their devices.",
      "Mr Sirman believes that if you account for the efficiency and health issues of refrigerants, like leakages, Magnotherm products can compete on price. \"We are not targeting customers who are only looking at initial cost.\"",
      "He acknowledges that for now the company's beverage coolers are quite pricey. Their customers tend to be early adopters of new technologies.",
      "Another technology under development is thermoelectric cooling.",
      "This involves moving heat between two sides of a device. With the application of electrical energy, heat is transferred in the direction of the current.",
      "A notable thermoelectric start-up is Phononic, which is based in the US and has an additional manufacturing facility in Thailand.",
      "Millions of Phononic cooling devices are now in use, including in data centres, supermarkets and other buildings.",
      "Their cooling devices are built in a similar way to computer chips, using semiconducting materials to transfer the heat.",
      "\"Our chips are really thin, really small, but they get really cold. They consume a small amount of electricity in generating that coldness, but they pack one hell of a punch,\" says Tony Atti, the CEO of Phononic.",
      "He says that, to work at their best, traditional fridges need to be run all the time.",
      "But  thermoelectric devices can be easily switched on off. This helps to reduce the costs, energy use and space requirements.",
      "\"We like to present the coolness on demand where you need it,\" says Mr Atti.",
      "Another advantage is that thermoelectric cooling can operate silently. \"That's because there's zero moving parts,\" Ms Rasmussen explains. \"The heat is occurring because of the reaction in the material level.\"",
      "In contrast, standard vapour compression systems contain pumps, condensers and expanders for refrigerant, which all generate much of the noise.",
      "A different type of solid-state cooling is elastocaloric cooling. This achieves temperature changes through mechanical stress to elastocaloric materials, which can cool down or heat up with the application of stress.",
      "Researchers in four European countries are collaborating on SMACool, an elastocaloric air conditioner that uses metal tubes made from specific metallic alloys.",
      "At the moment, elastocaloric prototypes have much lower cooling capacity than commercial air conditioning. And the maximum possible efficiency of SMACool is still lower than that of conventional air conditioning, although the aim is to beat the energy efficiency of A/C.",
      "However, progress is continuing. A team led by Hong Kong researchers recently created an A/C alternative that achieved a cooling power of 1,284W\u2014the first time an elastocaloric device surpassed the 1,000W mark. One innovation was using graphene nanofluid rather than distilled water to transfer the heat.",
      "Overall, Ms Rasmussen says, solid-state devices are generally not yet as powerful as conventional vapour-compression air conditioning. But she expects performance improvements over time.",
      "She also expects improvements in affordability. So far solid-state cooling has mainly been deployed in wealthy countries.",
      "A key question, Ms Rasmussen says, is \"Can these technologies scale up to where they could be affordable for those who need it the most and where the greatest demand for cooling is coming from?\"",

      "Fabio Arias, the head of Colombia's largest trade union federation, the CUT, says it is all part of Colombia's long and complex civil conflict, which pitted left-wing rebel groups against right-wing paramilitaries, drug traffickers and the Colombian state, and which still rumbles on in some parts of the country.",
      "\"The trade union movement has always been linked to the parties of the left and unfortunately the many right-wing governments we've had in Colombia have always claimed that anyone who is a leftist is a guerrilla, a terrorist,\" Mr Arias says.",

      "It is not clear who is carrying out these killings and who is ordering them. Some trade unionists blame the private sector, saying businesses, desperate to stifle any attempt by workers to organize, are paying armed groups to carry out these atrocities.",
      "They point to the fact that threats and attacks tend to spike at times when businesses and unions are in wage negotiations.",

      "We follow heavily-armed officers as they stream into the house, a woman drops to the floor as the camera turns left, and we head up a small, dimly lit staircase, passing a man with his back against the wall, hands raised, yelling to no avail.",
      "Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van.",
      "All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month.",
      "It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.",
      "Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.",
      "At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.",
      "You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator \u2013 there's a minuscule wobble \u2013 but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.",
      "It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.",
      "This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.",
      "The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.",
      "He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. \"As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take.\"",
      "Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.",
      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

      "Millions of shoppers could get up to \u00a370 each after a tribunal approved a settlement in a lawsuit against Mastercard which stemmed from historic fees levied on businesses by the card provider.",
      "The decision comes after a long-running legal case going back almost a decade, brought forward by a former financial ombudsman.",
      "Walter Merricks argued that shoppers were charged higher prices after fees were wrongly levied on transactions made over a 15-year period between 1992 and 2008.",
      "It is not necessary to have owned a Mastercard at any point to be eligible for compensation. Mastercard declined to comment on the court ruling.",
      "Who can claim?",
      "Consumers are eligible to claim compensation if they lived in England, Wales or Northern Ireland for at least three months between June 1997 and June 2008, and  bought goods or services from UK businesses that accepted Mastercard credit cards.",
      "For those who live in Scotland, the starting point is May 1992.",
      "The entire settlement is for \u00a3200m, with \u00a3100m ringfenced for consumers who have until the end of this year to claim and if the expected 5% of claimants - 2.5 million people - come forward, then each will receive \u00a345.",
      "If fewer people apply, payments will be capped at \u00a370 per claimant.",
      "'Fair and just outcome'",
      "Mr Merricks said consumers would soon be able to register to receive a payout by completing an online form.",
      "He launched his claim after the European Commission ruled in 2007 that Mastercard's \"multilateral interchange fees\" charged to businesses had infringed competition law since 1992.",
      "The fees were paid by retailers accepting Mastercard payments, rather than by consumers themselves.",
      "But Mr Merricks said that, despite retailers paying the fees, shoppers had lost out due to the charges being passed on through higher prices for goods and services.",
      "He alleged that 46 million shoppers in Britain were overcharged.",
      "Any unclaimed cash is expected to go to the company that funded the lawsuit.",
      "The Competition Appeal Tribunal approved a settlement in the class action case on Tuesday.",
      "Commenting on the outcome, Mr Merricks said he started this case because  he believed that \"Mastercard's fees paid by retailers for processing card transactions had been unlawfully high\".",
      "\"Virtually all UK consumers had lost out for long periods by paying higher prices than they should have done as retailers passed on those costs,\" he added.",
      "\"The settlement that has today been finally approved represents a fair and just outcome for UK consumers.\""

    "story": [
      "Domestic energy prices are forecast to fall in July, the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap for a year.",
      "The bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by \u00a3129 a year, a drop of nearly 7%, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted.",
      "The fall would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost \u00a31,720, down from the current level of \u00a31,849.",
      "The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill - so if you use more, you pay more.",
      "The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "The cap changes every three months and the regulator illustrates the effect of this with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.",
      "This typical household is assumed to use 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit.",
      "The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market.",
      "\"The fall in the price cap is a welcome development and will bring much-needed breathing space for households after a prolonged period of high energy costs,\" said Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight.",
      "He added that, while it was \"a step in the right direction\", prices were not falling enough for those households still struggling with cost of living, and bills \"remain well above the levels seen at the start of the decade\".",
      "\"As such, there remains a risk that energy will remain unaffordable for many,\" he said.",
      "Abigail Ward, policy manager at the Energy Saving Trust, which promotes energy efficiency, welcomed the forecast of cheaper bills.",
      "However she added that \"households will still be paying \u00a3100 more a year on their energy bills than last summer, proving that we're still feeling the impacts of fluctuating international wholesale energy markets\".",
      "\"This is why we urgently need to see policy action from the UK government to reduce energy bills by upgrading homes at scale.\"",
      "Andy Manning, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, said the drop \"might ease the burden of high bills for some households\", but added that \"it'll be cold comfort for those pushed to the brink by the legacy of the energy crisis\".",
      "\"Energy use and bills typically go down during the summer months, but the government can't get complacent,\" he said, calling for more support for those struggling with energy bills.",
      "Citizen Advice research from February 2025 shows that 6.7 million people in Great Britain are living in a household in debt to their energy supplier, with over 8.3 million households finding it difficult to afford their energy bills.",
      "Energy price cap: What next for gas and electricity bills and can I fix?",
      "Last month, Cornwall Insight had predicted a larger fall in the cap - to \u00a31,683 - and it said the new forecast partly reflected higher wholesale energy prices.",
      "It predicted the energy price cap would fall again in October, followed by another drop in January 2026.",
      "However, it warned these forecasts could be affected by a number of factors, including changing weather patterns, US tariffs, and the continuing impact of the war in Ukraine."

      "The energy price cap sets the maximum amount customers can be charged for each unit of energy, but actual bills depend on how much gas and electricity you use.",
      "What is the energy price cap and how is it changing?",
      "The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - variable tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit.",
      "Between 1 April and 30 June 2025, gas prices are capped at 6.99p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 27.03p per kWh.",
      "This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energy is \u00a31,849 per year.",
      "However, analysts at consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted that from 1 July this annual bill will fall to \u00a31,720.",

      "The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market.",
      "What is a typical household?",
      "Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it.",
      "The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference.",
      "The Ofgem cap is based on a \"typical household\" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit.",
      "The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more.",
      "Should I take a meter reading when the energy cap changes?",
      "Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate.",
      "This is especially important when prices go up.",
      "Customers with working smart meters do not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically.",
      "What is happening to prepayment customers?",
      "Between April and June, households on prepayment meters are paying slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of \u00a31,803, a rise of \u00a3113 from the previous quarter.",
      "About four million households had prepayment meters in January 2025, according to Ofgem.",
      "Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills.",
      "Rules introduced in November 2023 mean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households.",
      "Can I fix my energy prices?",
      "Fixed-price deals are not affected by the energy price cap, which changes every three months and can go up or down.",
      "They offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if energy prices drop when you are on the deal, you could be stuck at a higher price. You may also have to pay a penalty to leave a fixed deal early.",
      "Ofgem, the energy regulator, says customers who want the security of knowing what their bill will be should consider moving to a fixed deal. However, it says they should make sure they understand all the costs.",
      "Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, recommends checking whole-of-market energy price comparison sites to help find the best deal.",
      "What are standing charges and how are they changing?",
      "Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to gas and electricity supplies. They vary slightly by region.",
      "On 1 April, the average electricity standing charge fell from 60.97p to 53.8p but the average gas standing charge increased from 31.65p to 32.67p",
      "Some customers in London and the North Wales and Mersey region saw larger increases.",
      "Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a bigger proportion of the bill of low energy users.",
      "In response, Ofgem has said that energy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffs from winter 2025.",
      "One would have a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another no standing charge but a higher unit rate. However, the proposals have been criticised as being too complicated.",
      "What help can I get with energy bills?",
      "The Household Support Fund, which was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customers, has been extended until March 2026.",
      "The Warm Home Discount scheme continues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households.",
      "The government's Fuel Direct Scheme can help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments.",
      "In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills.",

    "story": [
      "Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world.",
      "The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips.",
      "It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made on the island of Taiwan, which is 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC.",
      "Its Arizona facility \"Fab 21\" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing.",
      "They're hugely protective of the secrets that lie within. Important customers, such as Apple and Nvidia, trust this company to safeguard their designs for future products.",
      "But after months of asking, TSMC let the BBC in to look at the partial transfer of what some argue is the most critical, expensive, complex and important manufacturing in the world.",
      "The poster child for Trump's policy",
      "President Trump certainly seems to think so. He often mentions the factory in passing. \"TSMC is the biggest there is,\" he has said. \"We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us.\" This is one of the US president's regular refrains.",
      "TSMC's recent decision to expand its investments in the US by a further $100bn (\u00a375bn) is something Trump attributes to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan and on the global semiconductor business.",
      "The expansion of the Arizona facility, which was announced in March is, he believes, the poster child for his economic policies - in particular the encouragement of foreign companies to relocate factories to the US to avoid hefty tariffs.",
      "China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its \"Silicon Shield\", against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk.",
      "China claims the self-ruled Taiwan as its territory but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland.",
      "So, many currents of the world economy, frontier technology and geopolitics flow through this one site and within it lies the essential contradiction of Trump's economic and diplomatic policy.",
      "He sees this plant as the exemplar of America First, and the preservation of economic and military superiority over China. Yet the manufacture of these modern miniaturised miracles at the frontier of physics and chemistry inherently relies on a combination of the very best technologies from around the world.",
      "The cleanest environment on Earth",
      "Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. \"I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,\" he says.",
      "\"It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering.\"",
      "Inside the \"Gowning Building\", workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything.",
      "Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as \"4 nanometre chips\".",
      "\"This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,\" he explains. \"[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is 3,000 to 4,000 steps.\"",
      "If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers.",
      "Manufacturing manipulation of atoms",
      "TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips, manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful.",
      "Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence.",
      "It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of \"extreme ultraviolet (UV) light\". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called \"lithography\".",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "Trump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on Asia",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",
      "The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona.",
      "These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors.",
      "The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed.",
      "\"Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,\" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. \"The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms.\"",
      "Caution in Taiwan",
      "Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life.",
      "Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies.",
      "He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim.",
      "Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden's Chips Act.",
      "On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying \"a future Made in America\".",
      "\"The semiconductor supply chain is global,\" says TSMC Arizona President Rose Castanares. \"There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly.\"",
      "'Non-Red' supply chains to counter China",
      "As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges.",
      "That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products.",
      "The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs.",
      "There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China.",
      "Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try to limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban on exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop \"non-Red\" supply chains to counter China.",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology. And Bill Gates this week said that these policies \"have forced the Chinese in terms of chip manufacturing and everything to go full speed ahead\".",
      "Trump wants TSMC Arizona to become a foundation stone for his American golden age. But the company's story to date is perhaps the ultimate expression of the success of modern globalisation.",
      "So for now, it's a battle for global tech and economic supremacy, in which Taiwan's factory technology, some of which is now being moved to the Arizona desert, is the critical asset.",

    "story": [
      "A family who went to court to protect a young girl from her paedophile father have criticised government legislation intended to help others in a similar position.",
      "The Victims and Courts Bill includes an amendment which would remove parental responsibility from convicted paedophiles - but only if they have abused their own children.",
      "In 2023 the BBC reported on a mother who had to spend more than \u00a330,000 to protect her small daughter. Her ex-husband had been convicted of the most serious child sex offences, but kept parental responsibility over his own child.",
      "Her parents said they were \"very disappointed\". The government said it was \"the beginning of legal change in this area and not the end\".",
      "Over many months in Cardiff Family Court I watched as a young woman, who we called \"Bethan\", brought a case to protect her young daughter.",
      "Although her ex-husband had been convicted of the most serious child sex offences, and was banned from contact with other children, he retained parental responsibility over his own child.",
      "That meant that he could have a say over her education, decisions about her health, and where she would live.",
      "He could also in future have contact with his daughter. In fact, he told the court from prison via a videolink, he was already writing letters every week to the little girl. He wasn't allowed to send them.",
      "At the end of the hearings, the judge granted the mother's application, removing the father's parental rights and barring him from all contact, including on social media, until the child turns 18.",
      "The family were pleased - but it had cost them over \u00a330,000 in legal fees.",
      "Harriet Harman, who is now in the Lords but was then an MP, heard my report, and decided to try to change the law, to remove what she called this \"glaring anomaly\".",
      "Her amendment meant that after a criminal conviction for serious child sex offences, a parent would automatically lose their parental responsibility.",
      "Families like Bethan's would no longer need to go to the Family Court.",
      "In April 2024 the Conservative Lord Chancellor Alex Chalk supported this change for the most serious cases, where children had been raped.",
      "\"This new law will ensure they are automatically safeguarded against those whose despicable actions have shown them to utterly lack any nurturing and caring instincts,\" he said at the time.",
      "Bethan and her parents were delighted.",
      "But the government called the July election - and the law didn't change.",
      "In the most recent King's Speech, in 2024, the Labour government promised to enact the change, saying it would restrict parental responsibility for child sex offenders.",
      "However, when the wording of the new law was published on 7 May it said that removing parental responsibility would only apply \"for a serious sexual offence committed against a child for whom the offender has parental responsibility\".",
      "In other words, where someone had abused their own child or stepchild.",
      "This would not cover Bethan's family.",
      "Bethan's parents said the government should go back to the bill that Harriet Harman had proposed, where the emphasis was on \"protecting innocent children\" rather than \"thinking about the rights of the paedophile\".",
      "The draft legislation - which had its second reading in Parliament today - also says the restriction of parental responsibility should apply only where someone has been sentenced to at least four years in prison.",
      "The grandparents of Bethan's child believe it should apply more widely.",
      "\"Really what we're talking about here is where the line is drawn. And we obviously think that line should be drawn much lower down,\" the child's grandfather said.",
      "The grandmother said the court case had been a \"terrible stress\" for her daughter.",
      "\"What people don't realise is when you take on a family court case, it's like taking on a full time job because it takes hundreds of hours to get the information together,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "Bethan had to take her child out of childcare, give up her flat, and \"use every bit of savings\" she had to pay for the family court, the child's grandmother added.",
      "Victims minister Alex Davies-Jones said in response: \"We are protecting children and ensuring victims are properly supported.",
      "\"These changes will, for the first time, introduce an automatic suspension of parental responsibility for offenders who sexually abuse their own child and receive a prison sentence of four years or more - removing the need for victims to go through court to secure this.",
      "\"I do recognise the concerns raised by victims and campaigners and will continue working closely with them to ensure the law is as strong and protective as it needs to be.\"",
      "Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick said in the House of Commons that the bill did not go far enough.",
      "\"If a man rapes a neighbour's child he keeps full rights over his own infant daughter,\" he said.",
      "\"Additionally, offenders jailed for three years and 11 months - still a grave sentence - retain their rights. Where is the logic behind four years? This thus far is unexplained. Where is the child's best interest?\"",
      "Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"I understand the calls on us to be as ambitious as possible, and to expand this to a wider cohort of offenders, but we believe our measure is stronger than what came before and it is the right starting point for change.",
      "\"We will work collaboratively and constructively with members across this House and with those within the sector, and I do say to them all this is the beginning of legal change in this area and not the end.\""

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c033dp0z1edo",
    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 15:09:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The government says \"every single penny\" raised by the policy will be spent on state schools.",
    "story": [
      "Average private school fees were 22% higher in January 2025 than in January 2024, according to the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents most independent schools in the UK.",
      "The government introduced VAT on school fees in January to pay for more state school teachers in England.",
      "But the ISC and a number of families have taken the government to the High Court over claims the policy is discriminatory and breaches human rights laws.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods and services. The standard rate of VAT is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education. That exemption was removed on 1 January.",
      "About half of England's private schools are charities, which means that they also received an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "The government removed that tax relief in April, but dropped earlier plans to scrap private schools' charitable status entirely.",
      "How will the government spend the extra VAT raised?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in the 2024/25 financial year, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"every single penny\" will go to state schools - including funding the recruitment of 6,500 new teachers in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for many years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "The government also said there will be funding to address other issues in schools, such as crumbling buildings and delays in the system for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send).",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",
      "While some famous schools, like Eton and Harrow, charge about \u00a350,000 a year, the average is about \u00a315,000.",
      "There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England.",
      "Private schools have more freedom than government-funded state schools, and do not have to follow the national curriculum.",
      "Some local authorities pay for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) to attend private schools.",
      "Those that have a local authority education, health and care plan (EHCP) which names a specific private school that can meet their needs do not have to pay VAT.",
      "The government also said a grant to help cover the boarding school fees for children of military families was increased to take account of the VAT increase.",
      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Have private school fees gone up?",
      "The ISC represents more than 1,400 private schools. It said its annual census showed average school fees were 22.6% higher in January 2025 than they had been in January 2024.",
      "It blamed the \"triple whammy\" of higher national insurance contributions, an end to charitable business rates relief and the introduction of VAT.",
      "The government had previously said it expected fees to rise by an average of around 10%.",
      "In response to the ISC figures, a Treasury spokesperson said the increase was \"not only down to VAT\", and that private school fees had risen significantly in recent decades.",
      "According to the the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank, average fees rose by 55% (after inflation) between 2003 and 2023.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period did not fall.",
      "Will the VAT changes mean the number of private pupils will fall?",
      "When it announced the VAT increase, the government said it did not expect there to be a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "According to a Treasury memo seen by the BBC, initial estimates suggested that 54,000 pupils would be displaced, with most moving to state schools within the first two years.",
      "However, the government now predicts that around 35,000 students will move to the state sector over a longer time period, and that class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which said that state system could \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The ISC says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in the number of Year 7 pupils starting school in September 2024.",
      "It believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",
      "Why was the VAT policy challenged in court?",
      "The legal challenge was brought by the ISC, a smaller group of Christian faith schools, and parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They argue that the policy goes against the legal right to an education, and claim it is discriminatory because it affects families attending low-paying faith schools.",
      "The group also cites the effect on children with Send. Those who attend private school because their needs \"cannot be adequately met in the state sector\" but who do not have an EHCP have to pay VAT.",
      "The court was told that the government had considered introducing the policy in September 2025, rather than in January.",
      "But it rejected this idea because the main objective of the VAT change was to raise additional tax revenue to support the 94% of children who attend state schools, and any delay would have undermined that.",
      "Government lawyers argued that families who wished to opt out of \"the system of universally accessible, state-funded education\" were free to send their children to private school or to educate them at home.",
      "If the legal challenge is successful, the government could consider amending the policy, but would be under no obligation to do so."

      "It is the first book written in the Kannada language, which is spoken in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, to win the prestigious prize.",
      "The stories in Heart Lamp were translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi.",
      "Featuring 12 short stories written by Mushtaq over three decades from 1990 to 2023, Heart Lamp poignantly captures the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India.",
      "Mushtaq's win comes off the back of Geetanjali Shree's Tomb of Sand - translated from Hindi by Daisy Rockwell - winning the prize in 2022.",
      "Her body of work is well-known among book lovers, but the Booker International win has shone a bigger spotlight on her life and literary oeuvre, which mirrors many of the challenges the women in her stories face, brought on by religious conservatism and a deeply patriarchal society.",
      "It is this self-awareness that has, perhaps, helped Mushtaq craft some of the most nuanced characters and plot-lines.",
      "\"In a literary culture that rewards spectacle, Heart Lamp insists on the value of attention - to lives lived at the edges, to unnoticed choices, to the strength it takes simply to persist. That is Banu Mushtaq's quiet power,\" a review in the Indian Express newspaper says about the book.",
      "Who is Banu Mushtaq?",
      "Mushtaq grew up in a small town in the southern state of Karnataka in a Muslim neighbourhood and like most girls around her, studied the Quran in the Urdu language at school.",
      "But her father, a government employee, wanted more for her and at the age of eight, enrolled her in a convent school where the medium of instruction was the state's official language - Kannada.",
      "Mushtaq worked hard to become fluent in Kannada, but this alien tongue would become the language she chose for her literary expression.",
      "She began writing while still in school and chose to go to college even as her peers were getting married and raising children.",
      "It would take several years before Mushtaq was published and it happened during a particularly challenging phase in her life.",
      "Her short story appeared in a local magazine a year after she had married a man of her choosing at the age of 26, but her early marital years were also marked by conflict and strife - something she openly spoke of, in several interviews.",
      "In an interview with Vogue magazine, she said, \"I had always wanted to write but had nothing to write (about) because suddenly, after a love marriage, I was told to wear a burqa and dedicate myself to domestic work. I became a mother suffering from postpartum depression at 29\".",
      "In the another interview to The Week magazine, she spoke of how she was forced to live a life confined within the four walls of her house.",
      "Then, a shocking act of defiance set her free.",
      "\"Once, in a fit of despair, I poured white petrol on myself, intending to set myself on fire. Thankfully, he [the husband] sensed it in time, hugged me, and took away the matchbox. He pleaded with me, placing our baby at my feet saying, 'Don't abandon us',\" she told the magazine.",
      "What does Banu Mushtaq write about?",
      "In Heart Lamp, her female characters mirror this spirit of resistance and resilience.",
      "\"In mainstream Indian literature, Muslim women are often flattened into metaphors \u2014 silent sufferers or tropes in someone else's moral argument. Mushtaq refuses both. Her characters endure, negotiate, and occasionally push back \u2014 not in ways that claim headlines, but in ways that matter to their lives,\" according to a review of the book in The Indian Express newspaper.",
      "Mushtaq went on to work as a reporter in a prominent local tabloid and also associated with the Bandaya movement - which focussed on addressing social and economic injustices through literature and activism.",
      "After leaving journalism a decade later, she took up work as a lawyer to support her family.",
      "In a storied career spanning several decades, she has published a copious amount of work; including six short story collections, an essay collection and a novel.",
      "But her incisive writing has also made her a target of hate.",
      "In an interview to The Hindu newspaper, she spoke about how in the year 2000, she received threatening phone calls after she expressed her opinion supporting women's right to offer prayer in mosques.",
      "A fatwa - a legal ruling as per Islamic law - was issued against her and a man tried to attack her with a knife before he was overpowered by her husband.",
      "But these incidents did not faze Mushtaq, who continued to write with fierce honesty.",
      "\"I have consistently challenged chauvinistic religious interpretations. These issues are central to my writing even now. Society has changed a lot, but the core issues remain the same. Even though the context evolves, the basic struggles of women and marginalised communities continue,\" she told The Week magazine.",
      "Over the years Mushtaq's writings have won numerous prestigious local and national awards including the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award and the Daana Chintamani Attimabbe Award.",
      "In 2024, the translated English compilation of Mushtaq's five short story collections published between 1990 and 2012 - Haseena and Other Stories - won the PEN Translation Prize.",

      "Peers had already backed an amendment calling for more copyright protections for the creative industries from artificial intelligence (AI) scrapers once.",
      "MPs rejected that amendment and sent the Bill back to the Lords, where Technology Minister Baroness Jones told peers it would lead to \"piecemeal\" legislation as it pre-empted consultation on AI and copyright.",
      "However, there was broad and vociferous support for Baroness Kidron, a film director and digital rights campaigner, who accused ministers of being swayed by the \"whisperings of Silicon Valley\" asking them to \"redefine theft\".",
      "The Lords rebellion follows condemnation from Sir Elton John, who called the government \"losers\" over the weekend and said ministers would be \"committing theft\" if they allowed AI firms to use artists' content without paying.",
      "He joins the ranks of high-profile musicians, including Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, and Kate Bush, who are outraged by plans they say would make it easier for AI models to be trained on copyrighted material.",
      "Kidron's amendment would force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes, and demand they get permission from copyright holders before they use any of their work.",
      "Highlighting the power differential between the big tech giants in the US and creatives in the UK, Kidron branded the government's plans \"extraordinary\".",
      "\"There's no industrial sector in the UK that government policy requires to give its property or labour to another sector - which is in direct competition with it - on a compulsory basis, in the name of balance,\" she said.",
      "\"The government has got it wrong.",
      "\"They have been turned by the sweet whisperings of Silicon Valley who have stolen - and continue to steal every day we take no action - the UK's extraordinary, beautiful and valuable creative output.",
      "\"Silicon Valley has persuaded the government that it's easier for them to redefine theft than make them pay for what they have stolen.\"",
      "Defending her amendment, the crossbench peer said it was \"the minimum viable action from the government\" to signal that \"UK copyright law is indeed the law of the land\".",
      "Otherwise, Kidron said, the Bill was merely a \"political gesture\" ignoring \"widespread theft\" of UK copyright and \"starving\" the creative industry of \"the transparency they need to survive\".",

      "Artists release silent album in protest against AI using their work",
      "She was backed by Labour's Lord Brennan, who said the government was trying to set up \"a double standard\" with AI companies, and abandoning its historical leadership over the importance of intellectual copyright.",
      "\"This country has shown leadership throughout history in relation to copyright and setting the highest standards in order to try and drag people up to our level rather than simply putting up the flag of surrender,\" he said.",

      "Lord Watson, former deputy leader of the Labour Party and clearly a fan of Sir Elton, reeled off a string of song lyrics urging ministers to heed \"the clarion cry of this country's creators\".",
      "A third Labour peer, Lord Knight, also called on his party colleagues to \"protect the livelihoods of artists from big tech\" and said he believed this could be done at the same time as \"taking advantage of the creative and economic opportunities of AI\".",
      "The strength of feeling around the urgency to protect artists was made clear by others, including crossbencher and composer Lord Berkeley, who labelled the current situation \"burglary\".",
      "\"The only way you will stop it is by acting now before the gate is trampled down by the horses,\" he said.",
      "\"If this door is left open we will destroy the future of our creative industries.\"",
      "Conservative Lord Dobbs agreed those who had \"slogged away, struggled and suffered\" for their art deserved the government's protection and Liberal Democrat Floella Benjamin said she saluted Kidron for her \"tenacity and dogged determination\" to ensure \"creativity will not be stolen\".",
      "Baroness Jones spoke again at the close of the debate to plead with peers not to overturn the will of MPs for a second time, insisting \"this isn't about Silicon Valley\", denying the government was being complacent, and pointing out that \"no other territory has cracked this either\".",
      "\"We all want to see a way forward that protects our creative industries while supporting everyone in the UK to develop and benefit from AI,\" she said.",
      "\"Kidron's amendment will not provide certainty of anything except for certainty of more uncertainty, of continuous regulations stacked one upon another in a pile of instruments...",
      "\"Jumping the gun on one issue will hamstring us in reaching the best outcome on all the others and especially because this is a global issue and we cannot ringfence the UK away from the rest of the world.\"",
      "However, Kidron said her amendment \"does not challenge the primacy of the Commons\" and pushed ahead.",
      "The result was a decisive defeat for the Government, with 287 votes in favour of Kidron's amendment and 118 against - a majority of 169 - and the Bill will now be sent back to the Commons.",

      "Fred Doe, of Winkfield, Windsor, Berkshire, was found guilty of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property in March.",
      "The 18-carat toilet was created by the conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan and had been installed at the Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire as part of an exhibition.",
      "Sentencing Doe, Judge Ian Pringle said: \"You had a limited function, you had no personal gain, you had no wider involvement, and you were involved for a short period.\"",
      "Doe has been sentenced to 21 months imprisonment suspended for two years and ordered him to do 240 hours unpaid work.",
      "In September 2019, five men smashed their way into the palace, ripped out the plumbed in toilet and fled in a stolen car.",
      "Michael Jones was convicted of burglary in connection with the crime after a trial at Oxford Crown Court in March.",
      "James Sheen pleaded guilty to burglary in 2024.",
      "Speaking outside court, Doe said: \"My good nature has been taken advantage of.",
      "\"I got caught up in something I should not have and now I just want to go home and enjoy my family. I am a good person.\"",
      "He left in a car surrounded by a group of friends, who shouted \"he is a good person\" and said they would be going for a drink to celebrate.",
      "The judge said Doe had been of previous good character and accepted that the conspirators may have taken advantage of his good nature.",
      "He added Doe was \"targeted\" for his legitimate contacts in the Hatton Garden jewellery district.",
      "Just two days after the golden toilet was stolen in an early morning raid, Doe sent a voice message to Sheen saying: \"I do know just the man you need to see... the word's on the street about the car.\"",
      "The court heard that 'car' was their code word for gold.",
      "Four years later, Sheen would plead guilty to stealing the 18-carat solid-gold toilet.",
      "The hundreds of texts, calls and voice messages sent between the two men in the two weeks following the heist would help convict Doe, a well-connected businessman from the traveller community.",
      "As a work of art, the toilet weighed 98kg (216lbs) and was insured for $6m (\u00a34.8m).",
      "Gold prices at the time would have meant the metal alone was worth \u00a32.8m, the court was told.",
      "It is not known exactly when the thieves broke the toilet into smaller pieces, or whether they melted the gold themselves.",
      "But the court heard within two days of the heist, Sheen was looking for buyers, offering gold at about \u00a325,500 per kilo.",
      "In voice messages Doe, who is also known as Fred Sines, told Sheen that: \"I can sell that car for you in two split seconds.\"",
      "He was also heard explaining what can be expected of a deal: \"Within 48 hours you get paid and it's guaranteed by me. Personal guarantee.\"",
      "But he also urged secrecy: \"Jim, very clear. This stays strictly between me and you.\"",
      "Doe organised a meeting between Sheen and a bullion dealer in Hatton Garden, London's jewellery quarter.",
      "He told the toilet thief that the dealer \"knows the full score of the car.\"",
      "\"What the car is, what it was, what it wasn't. You know, these boys are 100 million percent on me,\" he added.",
      "In the end, the deal turned sour and it collapsed without a sale.",
      "Sheen instead sold the twenty kilos of gold - around a fifth of the toilet's gold - to an unknown buyer in Birmingham for \u00a3520,000.",
      "During the trial Doe acknowledged that he had been trying to help Sheen sell the gold, but denied knowing it was stolen, calling the toilet thief an \"idiot\" who had let him down.",
      "His defence barrister told the jury that \"this loss to the nation's bottoms cannot be laid at the feet of Fred Doe\".",
      "But the jury found him guilty.",
      "In sentencing, Judge Pringle said: \"You were at best a middleman who was targeted, in my view, by James Sheen because you knew many people in Hatton Garden because of your knowledge of valuable watches.",

      "This is a sorry end to a long BBC career. Gary Lineker was among the corporation's highest-paid presenters for a reason - he is popular with audiences, knowledgeable and brilliant at his job.",
      "But it's an understatement to suggest he has also caused problems for his BBC bosses over the years, as their high-profile football host began to morph into a presenter with opinions that he voiced on social media.",
      "In the end, those two things were increasingly in conflict.",
      "This has always been about reputation management for the BBC. Lineker had already, in the eyes of BBC bosses, caused the corporation damage with previous social media posts. Mistakenly sharing a video about Zionism which included a rat emoji was the final straw.",
      "It was difficult to see how he could continue presenting for the corporation, particularly at a time when the BBC is enmeshed in another controversy surrounding a documentary about Gaza, which it pulled after discovering the child narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "I think what's different is that on this occasion, Lineker regrets his actions. He has appeared bullish about previous posts, saying that while he regretted damaging the BBC, he didn't believe, for example, that comparing the language of a Conservative asylum policy to that of 1930s Germany was wrong.",
      "Lineker is genuinely upset by what happened. He is mortified that he reposted the video. His relationship with the BBC is coming to an end in circumstances nobody would have wanted, but some might have predicted.",
      "He seemed unable or unwilling to accept that his high profile might prevent him from voicing strongly-held views that many believed had an impact on the BBC's need for impartiality.",
      "We live increasingly in an age when people want to express their opinions, and often do. Social media has given everyone a platform, and high-profile media figures have huge followings.",

      "But he is a successful podcast entrepreneur, owning a third of the shares in Goalhanger, the company behind hit shows including The Rest is History and The Rest is Politics.",

    "story": [
      "Gary Lineker, who will leave the BBC after hosting his final Match of the Day on Sunday, was the steady hand who guided millions of fans through football's agonies and ecstasies.",
      "As the face of the corporation's flagship football show for 26 years, he was also one of the its highest-profile presenters, earning \u00a31.3 million in 2023.",
      "But last November's agreement between Lineker and the BBC that he'd stop hosting Match of the Day, and continue to front the FA Cup and World Cup into  2026, is in tatters.",
      "It follows last week's controversy when he shared a social media post about Zionism that included an illustration of a rat, historically used as an antisemitic insult.",
      "He immediately deleted it after criticism, saying he was unaware of the image's symbolism, and later said he \"apologised unreservedly\".",
      "But the ensuing headlines will not be the ones Lineker will have wanted or anticipated for his final weeks at the BBC - he'd worked hard for years to build up his reputation as a stellar broadcaster.",
      "Live updates: Gary Lineker to leave the BBC after social media 'error'",
      "Live updates: Gary Lineker to leave the BBC after social media 'error'",
      "His one-line pay-offs at the end of each show, summing up both the fans' mood and the match, may have looked seamless.",
      "But they were the result of years of honing his craft after his successful football career.",
      "As a former footballer of considerable pedigree - including England captain and striker, with 48 goals in 80 appearances - he famously never received a red or yellow card during his career.",
      "His ability to keep his cool on the pitch stood him in good stead for a career in live broadcasting when he retired as a player in 1994.",
      "Even while he was still at school, he had his sights set on sports journalism, deciding it would be his fall-back if football didn't work out.",
      "Clearly it did.",
      "Known for his ability to find gaps in the opposition's defence, and his \"poacher's instinct\" , Lineker was the 1986 World Cup Golden Boot winner, and the top goal-scorer in England three times, each with a different club: Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "But while his sports career was at its peak at the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals, Lineker spent time with journalists staying in the same hotel as the England team.",
      "\"As early as my mid-20s, I knew which direction I wanted to go in when I retired from playing,\" he told the BBC in 2014.",
      "\"I would watch the newspaper guys write their opening paragraphs and sit with the radio journalists and talk to them about how they did their job.\"",
      "His ultimate aim was to end up as the presenter rather than a pundit.",
      "But he admitted his transition into radio and TV \"took a lot of work\".",
      "His early broadcasting attempts were \"fairly appalling\", he told BBC Radio 4's Media Show in 2021.",
      "Starting out on Radio 5 Live \"was all part of the learning process\".",
      "\"I managed to stumble my way through it, and I learned from really good people alongside me who were incredibly helpful in the early days.\"",
      "Lineker built on that experience, writing all his own scripts and carving out a role for himself.",
      "Having watched ex-sports stars David Gower presenting the cricket and Sue Barker fronting the tennis, he questioned why it wasn't the same in football.",
      "\u201cI just thought, as a player who\u2019s played right at the top, if I could crack presenting it would give me a niche,\" he told BBC Radio 4 podcast Don't Tell Me the Score in 2019.",
      "\"It would give me an advantage over all the others.\"",
      "Meanwhile, his popularity as a footballer endured. In 1991, Arthur Smith and Chris England wrote a stage play called An Evening With Gary Lineker, about a couple trying to rekindle their marriage during the 1990 World Cup semi-final.",
      "Starring Caroline Quentin, Clive Owen, Paul Merton and Martin Clunes, it was filmed for TV in 1994 - with Lineker making a cameo appearance.",
      "He also began building his wider TV career, appearing as a team captain on BBC One's comedy panel show, They Think It's All Over, from 1995 to 2003.",
      "As a presenter, he got himself noticed when he stood in for Des Lynam on the Saturday afternoon sports show Grandstand, in 1997.",
      "By the mid-90s, Lineker was also appearing on Match of the Day as a pundit.",
      "This gave him a prime learning spot - right next to its experienced and slick host Lynam.",
      "\"Des was very helpful - I used to ask a lot of questions about the little things that he did, and picked up some of his nuances,\" the former footballer said.",
      "\"He told me to be brave occasionally with closing lines, and not to be afraid to try to be amusing.",
      "\"Again, the little pay-offs I sometimes make at the end of the show are something that came from him.\"",
      "By 1999, Lineker was hosting the show, and reaching audiences the BBC sometimes struggled to attract and retain.",
      "People would also tune in to see his chemistry with the show's pundits - including other former footballers such as Alan Shearer, Ian Wright, Micah Richards and Alan Hansen.",
      "Lineker's questions kept the analysis flowing, while he was always willing to share a joke and opinion of his own.",
      "He also memorably introduced the show in his pants in 2016, having pledged to \"do the first MOTD of next season in just my undies\" if his former club Leicester won the Premier League, which they did.",
      "Shearer and Wright couldn't keep straight faces.",
      "Their friendships often shone through. In June last year, Lineker and Shearer sent an emotional message of support to Hansen, after hearing the news that he was seriously ill in hospital.",
      "But despite his rapport with his colleagues, off-screen matters were not as straightforward.",
      "As one of the BBC's highest-paid presenters, regularly topping the list of the staff whose salaries are declared, he faced constant scrutiny.",
      "Lineker did not shy away from speaking out about his own views, particularly on social media, while simultaneously working for a broadcaster committed to impartiality.",
      "In March 2023, he posted on X about the government's asylum policy - resulting in the BBC briefly suspending him.",
      "Shearer, Wright and other BBC sport presenters refused to appear on air, in protest at his absence.",
      "Match of the Day was reduced to a 20-minute edition minus its host, pundits and commentary - and the story made headline news for several days, with politicians and media commentators all weighing in on the issue.",
      "Mr Davie subsequently apologised to licence fee payers for the disruption, calling it a \"difficult day\" for the corporation.",
      "Lineker was reinstated nine days later.",
      "The presenter later said the response to his tweet was \"silly - it shouldn't have been\".",
      "\"I love the BBC. I've been there for nearly 30 years but people make mistakes, they recognise that and they addressed it and in the end, thankfully, we're all back to work,\" he said.",
      "The incident prompted a review of BBC social media guidelines. Last September, new rules were published for BBC flagship presenters, saying they should be allowed to express views on issues and policies, but stop short of political campaigning.",
      "Lineker said the recommendations were \"all very sensible\".",
      "By February last year, he said he was using X less often, saying the platform had become \"increasingly toxic\" under its new owner, Elon Musk.",
      "In February 2025, Lineker made headlines when he was among 500 other high-profile figures who signed an open letter urging the BBC to reinstate a documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, to BBC iPlayer.",
      "The documentary was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "After concerns were raised, the BBC took down the film while it carried out further due diligence. The corporation has apologised and admitted \"serious flaws\" in the making of the film and the matter is still subject to an internal investigation.",
      "Last month, Lineker spoke to BBC presenter Amol Rajan, and was asked about the comments he posted on social media in March 2023.",
      "Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the \"damage\" it did to the BBC.",
      "However it appears that the latest round of headlines about the sports presenter made his position untenable.",
      "Despite his BBC career being cut even shorter, Lineker has plenty of outside business interests, including the successful podcast production company he co-founded, called Goalhanger.",
      "It produces shows including The Rest Is History, The Rest Is Entertainment and The Rest Is Politics, which won the Champion prize at last year's Podcast Awards.",
      "At the recent Arias radio awards, Goalhanger was named audio brand of the year.",
      "The Rest is Football podcast, featuring Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards, is also on BBC Sounds.",
      "Lineker will be replaced on Match of the Day by Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan for the start of the 2025-26 season.",
      "He indicated to Rajan his next career move \"won't be more telly\", adding: \"I think I'll step back from that now\" and \"I think I'll probably focus more on the podcast world\".",
      "It will be interesting to see if he takes up any potential offers from rival broadcast outlets, or if he really has stepped back from TV for good.",

    "summary": "The brothers' fate will now be in the hands of California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom.",
    "story": [
      "It was once unthinkable that Lyle and Erik Menendez, the men who murdered their wealthy parents by shooting them 16 times, would get the sympathy and forgiveness of the masses.",
      "Their claims of sexual abuse at the hands of their father were mocked by prosecutors and comedians alike, from late-night TV to jokes at the Academy Awards.",
      "But 35 years later - thanks in part to TikTok, Netflix and stars like Kim Kardashian - the Menendez brothers have a new generation of supporters - many who were not even born in 1989, the year the brothers ambushed their parents with shotguns in their Beverly Hills mansion.",
      "At the time of their trials, the brothers were portrayed as greedy, entitled monsters who went on a $700,000 (\u00a3526,0000) spending spree in the weeks after the murders. Now, with a growing understanding of trauma and sexual abuse, many are more sympathetic - and that might just give the brothers a chance at freedom.",
      "This week, a Los Angeles judge reduced the brothers' sentence to include the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month.",
      "Their fate will then be in the hands of California's Parole Board and, ultimately, Governor Gavin Newsom, who will be weighing the shifting public opinion about the divisive case with his own political ambitions.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "In 1989, Erik and Lyle Menendez burst into their Beverly Hills living room, both toting loaded shotguns, and opened fire on their parents, who were watching television. The crime would go unsolved for months.",
      "They got tickets for the James Bond film License to Kill as an alibi and told law enforcement and members of the news media, who were covering the execution of the wealthy, high-powered couple in their mansion, that perhaps the mafia was to blame.",
      "Meanwhile, they bought a new Porsche, Jeep, Rolex watches and other luxury items with cash from their parents' estate.",
      "They weren't caught until police got word of their admissions to a psychologist.",
      "Even at the time, their crime was divisive - the first trial ended un a mistrial after the jury couldn't reach a verdict. After the second, they were sentenced to life without parole.",
      "During both trials, the brothers were characterised as bad boys and spoiled children who were motivated to kill their parents out of hatred and hopes to acquire their $14 million estate.",
      "Saturday Night Live and other late-night shows mocked the pair's defence in court \u2013 including tearful testimony about their alleged sexual abuse, which prosecutors dubbed the \"abuse excuse\" - and documentary titles from that decade included phrases like \"the bad sons\" and \"American sons, American murderers\".",
      "Appeal after appeal was denied but last year, everything seemed to change. New evidence about the alleged sexual abuse had surfaced and Netflix released a drama that captured the attention of a whole new generation. Soon, documentaries about the case included titles with words like \"misjudged\" and \"boys betrayed\".",
      "TikTokers discussed the case with their followers. Reality star Kim Kardashian, a criminal justice advocate who has helped free imprisoned people, penned an opinion piece publicly backing their bid for freedom.",
      "\"Back then, there were limited resources for victims of sexual abuse, particularly for boys,\" Kardashian wrote in the NBC piece.",
      "In the 1990s, society did not have the same understanding we do today of trauma, sexual abuse and harassment, Whitney Phillips, a University of Oregon professor who studies true crime, told the BBC. That gap in understanding was especially pronounced for boys who were abused, she added.",
      "But after the MeToo movement, there was more cultural space created for people to speak about these experiences, she said.",
      "\"Not only does it create a permission structure,\" Prof Phillips said of people feeling encouraged to speak out about harassment and abuse, \"in some ways it creates an incentive structure to feature stories about trauma\".",
      "Adding to that is the change in how the public views criminal justice, with more emphasis on rehabilitation and reducing prison populations instead of the tough-on-crime mentality that dominated Los Angeles at the end of the 20th Century.",
      "\"The lock people up forever attitude of the 1990s is fortunately long gone,\" said Robert Rand, a journalist who met and interviewed the brothers before they were arrested and uncovered new evidence in 2018 - a letter Erik had written as a teenager to a cousin about his father's sexual abuse.",
      "In a documentary Mr Rand produced about the killings, released in 2023, a former member of the boy band called Menudo alleged that the brothers' father, Jose Menendez - who was an executive at RCA Records - had raped him when he was 14 years old. The accusation further bolstered the brothers' claims of abuse.",
      "The new testimonies helped give new life to the brothers' claims, and provided a catalyst for what Prof Phillips called a \"hurricane\" of interest and support, from the Netflix drama to Kardashian's op-ed.",
      "\"The things that get really big online are things that have lots of sources of energy,\" she said.",
      "Even Lyle Menendez noted the sea change.",
      "\"The followers who are younger that are on that sort of TikTok social media generation, they really have tremendous hope,\" Lyle Menendez said at a court hearing.",

      "The fate of the brothers \u2013 regardless of what social media,  the courts or California's parole board recommends \u2013 ultimately rests with one man: Governor Newsom, who has the power to accept or reject any parole recommendation.",
      "And many believe that man is considering a run for president in 2028.",
      "Since the last election, Newsom has been undergoing a political transformation, shifting from crusading liberal pushing universal healthcare to a more moderate, pragmatic approach, most recently proposing freezing healthcare for undocumented immigrants.",
      "Weighing in on such a divisive case could be \"risky\", said Pennsylvania-based Republican political strategist Sam Chen.",
      "\"Can you imagine a reality TV show of the Menendez brothers while Newsom is trying to run for president? Talk about free campaign airtime,\" he said. \"That would be the worst thing for him.\"",
      "Although no one knows which way he is leaning, Newsom has mentioned the case several times on social media and on his podcast.",
      "\"The question for the board is a rather simple one,\" Newsom said in February on TikTok.  \"Do they pose a current, what we call 'unreasonable' risk to public safety.\"",
      "Mr Rand acknowledged the case is \"risky\" politically for Newsom.",
      "\"You can't get around the elephant in the room: They brutally murdered their parents,\" Rand told the BBC. \"But if you do believe that they were abused and that they suffered from a lifetime of abuse - and there actually is evidence that supports their story - it's a very different situation.\"",
      "The brothers have not committed violent crimes while in prison, a fact the judge in their resentencing hearing considered, although they did have infractions for using cell phones smuggled into prison.",

      "Remarkably, every single surviving member of their family \u2013 from cousins to aunts and uncles - want the Menendez brothers released, including the surviving siblings of Jose and Kitty Menendez.",
      "\"They chose to live their lives with clarity and a purpose of service,\" their cousin Anamaria Baralt said outside the court after they were resentenced.",
      "If the board recommends parole in June, the governor has 30 days to accept or reject the recommendation. If they are paroled, the brothers will be released likely within five months, according to the California Department of Corrections.",

      "A year ago, Mr Rahmani never would have predicted the Menendez brothers could be released. Now he thinks they will be free within the next few months.",
      "But it wouldn't be unprecedented for Gov Newsom to reject a high-profile parole recommendation.",

      "In a trial that is undoing the legacy of one of music's biggest moguls of the 2000s, the focus of the opening week of proceedings was not Sean \"Diddy\" Combs  himself - but his ex-girlfriend.",
      "R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura took the witness stand for four days, describing in emotional details the years of beatings and drug-fuelled sex encounters with prostitutes that she alleges she endured at the hands of the rap superstar, who she dated for more than a decade.",
      "But while her story clearly left an impression on those in the courtroom, which one onlooker described as an \"aura of sadness\", it is just one piece in the puzzle that prosecutors must present to prove that Mr Combs was not just an abuser, but a mastermind of a criminal, sexual enterprise.",
      "On Tuesday, gasps erupted in a Manhattan overflow courtroom when prosecutors called Ms Ventura - their star witness - to the stand. All eyes were fixed on the eight-months pregnant singer, as she strolled past her ex-boyfriend, whom she had not seen in six years.",
      "Ms Ventura was there to testify in the federal sex trafficking, racketeering and prostitution case against Mr Combs, whom she accuses of abusing her and coercing her into unwanted sex acts - so-called \"freak-offs\" - during their 11-and-a-half year relationship.",

      "Who is the US rapper accused of sex trafficking?",
      "The parties that led to Diddy's downfall",
      "Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution - all of which he has vehemently denied.",
      "Surrounded by his children and dozens of family and friends, Mr Combs has watched Ms Ventura from his chair at the defence table just a few dozen feet away.",
      "All the while, US District Judge Arun Subramanian has pushed attorneys to stay on schedule, as prosecutors have expressed worry their star witness could go into labour with her third child as soon as this weekend.",
      "An aspiring musician falls in love with a 'larger-than-life' rapper",
      "On her first day on the stand, Ms Ventura began by taking prosecutors through the start of her tumultuous relationship with Mr Combs, whom she met when she was a 19-year-old aspiring musician. Mr Combs, 17 years her senior, signed her onto his record label.",
      "Their romantic relationship began soon after, when Ms Ventura fell in love with the \"larger-than-life\" musician and entrepreneur, she said. But it was not long before she noticed a \"different\" side to him, Ms Ventura testified, at times wiping the tears from her eyes.",
      "Mr Combs, she said, wanted to control every aspect of her life. He paid for her rent, her car, and her phone, sometimes taking the items away to \"punish\" her when he was upset, she said.",
      "Eventually, the relationship turned violent. She testified about the time when he attacked her because she was sleeping, slashing her eyebrow as he threw her onto the corner of her bed as her two friends tried to stop him. The court was shown a photo of the gash that Ms Ventura said Mr Combs hired a plastic surgeon to fix secretly. There was another time at a party where he kicked her head as she cowered behind a toilet in a bathroom stall, she said.",
      "While jurors remained concentrated on her testimony and the evidence, betraying little emotion, some in the courtroom wiped away tears or looked away from the graphic photos and videos - including the viral video of Mr Combs beating and dragging Ms Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Published by CNN last year, the video has been viewed by millions - including many of the jurors before they were seated in the trial - and Ms Ventura, who was forced to rewatch the incident of abuse several times this week.",
      "Freak-offs become 'a job'",
      "Ms Ventura testified that the hotel incident took place after she tried to leave a \"freak-off\", a sexual encounter in which the couple would hire male escorts to have sex with Ms Ventura while Mr Combs watched and recorded from the corner.",
      "Ms Ventura said the rapper introduced her to freak-offs around a year into their relationship, and at first, she did it to make him happy.",
      "But over time, the encounters humiliated her, she said. They would sometimes last as long as four days, and require Ms Ventura to take countless drugs to stay awake, she said. She endured injuries like painful urinary tract infections - and once even blacked out, waking up in the shower, she said.",
      "\"It made me feel worthless,\" she told the court. \"Freak-offs became a job where there was no space to do anything else but to recover and just try to feel normal again.\"",
      "The couple would go on to have \"hundreds\" of freak-offs, Ms Ventura estimated.",
      "After years of temporary break-ups - some fuelled by Mr Combs' affairs - Ms Ventura ended her relationship with Mr Combs for good in 2018, the same year she alleges the rapper raped her in her home as she cried.",
      "Ms Ventura went on to date and marry her personal trainer, Alex Fine, with whom she has two children, but the trauma of her relationship has stayed with her.",
      "Through tears, Ms Ventura told the court of a time two years ago when she considered taking her own life, when traumatic flashbacks of her time with Mr Combs became too much to handle. Her husband helped her seek therapy to recover, she said.",
      "Consent vs compliance: Prosecutors build their sex trafficking case",
      "Get all the latest trial updates on the BBC Sounds 'Diddy on Trial' podcast available wherever you get your BBC podcasts.",
      "Throughout Ms Ventura's harrowing story of domestic violence, prosecutors have tried to thread in elements of their larger sex trafficking and racketeering case against Mr Combs.",
      "Mr Combs's attorneys have already conceded that the rapper was abusive - and have argued they would not have fought a domestic violence case against him. But, \"domestic violence is not sex trafficking\", Mr Combs' attorney Teny Geragos argued this week.",
      "The federal government has charged Mr Combs with transportation to engage in prostitution and sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion.",
      "He is also charged with leading a racketeering conspiracy, or directing an illegal enterprise under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The statute was created to take on mob bosses, but has since been used in other cases, including sex trafficking, such as the case against disgraced R&B singer R Kelly.",
      "Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson used parts of Ms Ventura's story to boost this case, asking her about the guns the rapper had access to and the ways he allegedly blackmailed her.",
      "Ms Ventura told the court of a time when she said Mr Combs pulled up videos he recorded of their freak-offs on his laptop, in view of others on a commercial flight. She said he told her he would release them if she didn't behave.",
      "\"I felt trapped,\" Ms Ventura said.",
      "Arick Fudali, a lawyer who represents an unnamed victim in the government's case against Mr Combs, said \"the fear of what would happen if they didn't comply\" is a crucial element of the government's case.",
      "\"Someone can consent to a sexual act of course,\" Mr Fudali told the BBC. \"But someone can also be coerced into being compliant, and that's different.\"",
      "The government has also used Ms Ventura's testimony to try to build up their racketeering argument - the allegation that Mr Combs used his loyal network of associates to run a criminal enterprise and cover up his alleged crimes.",
      "Prosecutors have asked Ms Ventura about security guards who she said stood by while Mr Combs abused her. Ms Ventura has testified about Mr Combs' employees' involvement in setting up freak-offs with supplies like baby oil, and booking travel for the male escorts they hired.",
      "Mr Combs' team says jealousy and drugs fuelled violence",
      "After a day and a half on the stand, it was Mr Combs' attorneys turn to question Ms Ventura.",
      "The rapper's lawyer, Anna Estevao, relied on hundreds of pages of text messages between Mr Combs and Ms Ventura to help push her team's broader arguments: that Ms Ventura was a willing participant in freak-offs in a toxic relationship fuelled by drugs and jealousy.",
      "Mr Combs' legal team showed messages from Ms Ventura to Mr Combs in which she said she was \"always ready\" for a freak-off, and another time when she said she wished they could have had one.",
      "Ms Ventura acknowledged writing the messages while adding that those were \"just words at that point\".",
      "Ms Estevao also kept bringing Ms Ventura back to the couple's moments of infidelity, like when Mr Combs would spend holidays with his family and former girlfriend Kim Porter, or when Ms Ventura began dating rapper Kid Cudi while she and Mr Combs were on a break.",
      "She repeatedly asked Ms Ventura about her drug use and how both she and Mr Combs struggled with opioid addiction at times.",
      "In these moments, the defence was trying to show jurors that it was a toxic, violent and complicated relationship - but not a case of racketeering or sex trafficking, former federal prosecutor Sarah Krissoff told the BBC.",
      "The defence also made efforts to try to chip away at the government's racketeering case, asking Ms Ventura whether Mr Combs' employees had actually witnessed the freak-offs, to which Ms Ventura said she did not think so.",
      "Ultimately, Mr Fudali said, the prosecution's case will hinge on this question of compliance versus consent - whether Mr Combs' girlfriends were willing participants in his sexual fantasies or acted out of fear.",
      "\"Did Ms Ventura consent or was she coerced into complying?\" Mr Fudali said. \"That seems to be the question for the jury.\"",

    "story": [
      "Few names are as synonymous with video games as Doom.",
      "First launched in 1993, the first-person shooter (FPS) remains one of the most influential - and popular - series in the industry.",
      "But even it and its superhuman protagonist, The Doom Slayer, have to contend with the pressures of the games industry in 2025.",
      "Attracting new players, competing with the new titans on the scene and the rising cost of making - and selling - blockbuster titles.",
      "BBC Newsbeat spoke to the project leaders of the latest instalment, Doom: The Dark Ages, about navigating some of these challenges.",
      "'You know exactly what you're getting'",
      "While the Doom series is famous for pitting players against colossal enemies, there are other behemoths it has to face.",
      "\"There's so much stuff competing for our attention these days, whether it's games, movies, or whatever,\" says executive producer Marty Stratton.",
      "Free-to-play (F2P) games, such as Fortnite and Roblox, and annually updated series such as Call of Duty and EA FC regularly dominate most-played charts.",
      "There's evidence to suggest players, particularly younger ones, are spending most of their time on these titles - sometimes referred to as \"forever games\".",
      "In the latest Online Nation report by UK regulator Ofcom, five of the top ten games among UK players were F2P.",
      "Fortnite recorded about 2.65m active UK users in May 2024, and Roblox 1.22m, according to the report, and global figures are much higher.",
      "Drawing those players to premium titles can be a challenge but Marty argues games such as Doom, which can be completed in under 20 hours, can \"fit into those habits\".",
      "\"It doesn't have to become your obsession for the next two years,\" he says.",
      "The Doom series - developed by Dallas-based ID Software - has an advantage over others because it's so well-known and has a large, loyal fanbase.",
      "But, as industry expert Rhys Elliot, from Alinea Analytics, tells Newsbeat, it's getting harder to rely solely on your hardcore players.",
      "Overall, he says, the number of people playing premium titles isn't increasing, but the cost of making them is.",
      "\"The people who make games - they still need to make revenues each year because, you know, capitalism,\" he says.",
      "One way of doing this is by attracting new players.",
      "Doom's director Hugo Martin says the response to Doom: The Dark Age's previews were encouraging - something he puts down in part to its new \"Medieval sci-fi\" setting and altered gameplay style.",
      "\"We see it in the comments - a lot of people are saying 'I think this is going to be my first Doom', and that's exciting for us,\" he says.",
      "The games industry has also leaned into customisation in recent years, giving players the power to finely tweak different elements and aspects of difficulty - something that's been incorporated into The Dark Ages.",
      "\"In that regard I think it's going to be a great first-time experience for a lot of fans,\" says Hugo.",
      "But there's still the small matter of the cost of entry.",
      "The debate over prices has been a feature of gaming discourse for years.",
      "In 2010, a new game cost roughly \u00a340 in the UK - and players had plenty to say about it at the time.",
      "If you take into account inflation (using this Bank of England tool), that would be about \u00a360 in today's money.",
      "Doom: The Dark Ages itself costs \u00a369.99 for a standard edition or almost \u00a3100 for a limited Premium Edition with extras included.",
      "\"When you look at the history of game pricing... it really hasn't skyrocketed,\" says Marty.",
      "The issue has been thrown back into the spotlight thanks to worries over Donald Trump's tariff plans and price announcements from the three major console makers.",
      "That could make competitors such as Fortnite - which don't require new, specialised hardware to run - even more appealing for cash-strapped players.",
      "But Doom producer Marty argues that \"free\" games can end up costing players more in the long run, while there are \"no unknown expenses\" with a one-off purchase such as Doom.",
      "\"You're not going to be asked to pay anything else, two hours in,\" he says.",
      "F2P games generate cash with in-game purchases, ranging from \"microtransactions\" equivalent to a handful of change or, in some cases, hundreds of pounds.",
      "Those costs can mount up, and a recent poll of 2,001 gamers by British bank TSB suggested dedicated players can spend about \u00a322 a month on those transactions.",
      "That's still less than a tentpole new release, but Doom's director Hugo also believes people are happy to pay more for a \"curated experience\" with \"replay value\".",
      "\"Typically, if you just make a really good game then people will want to play it again,\" he says.",
      "Analyst Rhys believes we're going to see more \"fiddling with prices\" and surcharges \"to see what customers are willing to pay\" and a wider range of RRPs for new releases.",
      "\"Hopefully there'll be more competition there. It's good for consumers,\" he says.",
      "Doom is also available on PC and Xbox via Game Pass - Microsoft's Netflix-style subscription priced at \u00a314.99 a month.",
      "There's evidence more people are turning to this, as well as Sony's PlayStation Plus - raising questions over whether they put players off paying full price.",
      "Game Pass players could pay a \u00a334.99/$34.99 upgrade fee to access the game two days early and receive bonus content.",

    "story": [
      "Ozwald Boateng, celebrating four decades of making his indelible mark on the fashion industry, got his chance to stamp his style on the Met Gala in New York earlier this month.",
      "The esteemed British-Ghanaian designer for the first time dressed celebrities - including three of Africa's biggest musicians, Tems, Burna Boy and Arya Starr, as well as actors Ncuti Gatwa and Jaden Smith - at what is seen as his industry's biggest night of the year.",
      "The theme - Superfine: Tailoring Black Style - was \"completely in my wheelhouse\", he says, as it looked at the way that style formed black identities.",
      "Given that he already has a robust legacy in the design world, the 58-year-old saw the opportunity to find fresh adherents to the Boateng look.",
      "\"I think it's, in a way, communicating to a new audience,\" he tells the BBC a few days after the showcase.",
      "Throughout his 40 years in fashion, the designer has built a reputation for challenging the norms of men's tailoring. His eponymous brand sells form-fitting, stylish suits, often accented with bold colours and West African-inspired patterns.",
      "The son of Ghanaian immigrants, Boateng reimagined the country's iconic kente cloth to produce his signature \"tribal\" pattern.",
      "\"It's all about having a strong concept, having a thorough idea of what you want to achieve from the textiles,\" he says.",
      "The Met Gala perfectly matched his outlook. \"Being a theme about black culture and black cultural influence, I mean, how can you do that without Africa?\" he asks.",
      "Considering the link to Ghana, Boateng explains: \"When we were colonised by the Europeans or the Brits, we kept our traditional dress, but tailoring was a big part of how we dressed to look more... effectively more European.",
      "\"My father always wore tailored suits. You had to be smart at all times, that was something I was taught.\"",
      "As if producing outfits for 16 celebrities for fashion's premier event was not stressful enough, Boateng switched up Burna Boy's outfit less than 24 hours before the event.",
      "\"We did his fitting quite literally the night before the Met Gala,\" Boateng says, adding that everyone in the room got \"really excited\" when they saw the Grammy-award winning musician in the finished product.",
      "The look -  a red suit paired with a buttercup yellow shirt and eel-skin cape - was partly inspired by Burna Boy's Nigerian roots.",
      "The musician told Vogue: \"As a waterside pikin [Pidgin for \"child\"] from the Niger Delta, the eel and fish in general are the lifeblood of my people - they symbolise survival, spirit and the flow of tradition through generations.\"",
      "The Met Gala was \"not unusual\", Boateng says, explaining that Africa has been part of his \"message\" throughout his career.",
      "Back in 1995, Boateng was the first black designer to open a shop on Savile Row, a London street famed for fine tailoring.",
      "\"When I first started as a designer, Savile as a street was a dying street,\" Boateng recalls.",
      "\"The concept, it was dying. I effectively moved there in the early 90s and breathed new life into it.\"",
      "Boateng was dubbed the \"peacock of Savile Row\" - with his flamboyance, 6ft-something frame and modelesque facial features, he stood out among his neighbours.",
      "Colour and flair had long been part of Boateng's psyche. At five years old his favourite outfit was a purple, mohair suit made by his mother, who was a seamstress.",
      "Young Boateng commandeered his mother's sewing machine and although he initially chose to study computing at college, he switched to fashion after realising menswear was his future.",
      "As a teenager, Boateng was greatly inspired by tailoring titan Giorgio Armani - and decades later, Armani would praise the London designer for his \"elegance\" and \"cutting edge\" designs.",
      "Boateng opened his first studio in his early 20s, dressing the likes of Mick Jagger, Jimmy Page and Spike Lee.",
      "He then opened his Savile Row store - at the age of 28 he was the youngest to ever do so.",
      "The burgeoning designer captivated London's fashion scene initially, but in 1998 he went bankrupt when an economic downturn in east Asia scuppered a major order.",
      "Both his professional and personal life descended into disarray - in just 12 months an entire collection was stolen from his studio and his marriage broke down.",
      "But the peacock strutted his way back. Boateng gradually rebuilt his business and in 2002 moved into bigger premises on Savile Row.",
      "Since then, he has served as Givency's creative director for menswear, been awarded an OBE, designed staff uniforms for British Airways and branched out into womenswear.",
      "While racking up professional and charitable commitments, Boateng was raising two children.",
      "Now adults, Oscar and Emilia Boateng accompanied their father to the Met Gala, dressed in the suits that made their surname one of the most famous in contemporary British tailoring.",
      "They are not, however, keen to follow their father into fashion design.",
      "\"I'm trying to slowly but surely seduce them into the fashion business,\" Boateng jokes.",
      "\"It is ultimately their decision to decide what they want from their life. If they find something they're passionate about in a way I have, I am happy.\"",
      "And what is next for his own passion? Boateng might have a brain brimming with concepts, but he has a clear vision of where he wants his brand to go next.",
      "\"The future is expansion,\" he says, \"raising capital to really, really push the brand globally\".",
      "\"I think it's the moment in time - and it's the right moment.\"",

      "Most cases are treated with a single dose of antibiotics, but there is an 80-year history of the bacterium which causes gonorrhoea repeatedly evolving resistance to our antibiotics.",
      "It's happening to the current treatments too and is why some doctors are concerned gonorrhoea could one-day become untreatable.",
      "The best way to deal with a drug-resistant infection is to never catch it in the first place.",
      "Dr Amanda Doyle, from NHS England, said: \"The launch of a world-first routine vaccination for gonorrhoea is a huge step forward for sexual health and will be crucial in protecting individuals, helping to prevent the spread of\u202finfection and reduce the rising rates of antibiotic resistant strains of the bacteria.\"",

      "The vaccine \u2013 which costs around \u00a38 per dose \u2013 is value for money when primarily offered to gay and bisexual men, rather than all teenagers.",

      "Surgeons have described the \"ultra-rapid\" method of genetic testing as a \"game  changer\" and say it could improve care and treatment for thousands of patients.",
      "The method has been developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham in partnership with clinicians at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH).",
      "The research has attracted interest from across the UK, with other NHS hospitals setting up their own testing alongside their existing regimes to gather more evidence about its effectiveness.",
      "A study published on Wednesday reveals the method has already been used in 50 operations at NUH and has had a 100% success rate in diagnosing the exact type of tumour.",
      "There are currently more than 100 identified types of brain tumour, and clinicians need to identify which kind a patient has to determine the most effective way to treat them.",
      "Traditionally, samples of tumours are extracted during surgery to be taken away, tested, and examined under a microscope in a pathology lab.",
      "While the process is mostly accurate, it can take up to eight weeks to definitively diagnose the type of tumour.",
      "Stuart Smith, NUH consultant neurosurgeon, said: \"Sometimes once we do get the full diagnosis back from the laboratory, we realise it's a type of tumour that would really benefit from what we call more radical surgery to remove every last piece of tumour, if that hasn't been done at the first operation.",
      "\"Sadly, sometimes that does mean a patient has to undergo a second, or sometimes even a third operation, to ensure that all the tumour that can be surgically removed has been.\"",
      "However, the new technique has seen results returned in as little as 90 minutes, and Mr Smith said it was possible to get a diagnosis while a patient was still in the operating theatre for their original procedure.",
      "It means surgeons would be able to perform more radical surgery, if needed, at the time.",
      "Mr Smith also said faster classification could allow patients to get radiation treatment or chemotherapy, more quickly, and that the quicker diagnoses often reduced the anxiety patients felt while waiting for test results.",
      "\"It is a game changer,\" he added.",

      "He said: \"Sadly most brain tumours are incredibly aggressive and waiting six to eight weeks, or however long, for every subsequent test may be too long for that patient.",

      "He was told his tumour was the size of a golf ball.",
      "The 45-year-old, who has been treated by Mr Smith, said: \"To have knowledge is power and it could be the worst knowledge you have, but it gives you certainty, and having that certainty actually makes life a hell of a lot easier.",
      "\"The fact they've been able to get back data very quickly that allows an extensive team of people to conduct detailed reviews feels like an amazing blend of science and medicine.",
      "\"The pace is phenomenal, and it gives you that certainty and clarity, regardless of whether you like the information, I can't change the information, but what I can do, is take the information I've been given early - and absorb it, feel it and start to plan for the next stage.\"",

      "The inquiry has examined the complexity of the regulatory system overseeing NHS trusts.",

      "Away from the inquiry, in October 2024, the health secretary stated that the government intended to reform the regulatory system.",
      "This was in response to a review of the way the Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspected trusts, called the Penny Dash Review, which said the framework was too complicated.",
      "The Lampard Inquiry will consider the CQC's role in relation to events in Essex.",
      "Analysis",

      "Families are calling for detailed scrutiny of individual deaths, but the inquiry is more likely to use selected cases to illustrate broader systemic issues such as governance, and culture.",

    "summary": "Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting men in the US.",
    "story": [
      "Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones.",
      "Biden received the news on Friday after he saw a doctor last week for urinary symptoms.",
      "Here's what you need to know about prostate cancer and its treatment options.",
      "What is prostate cancer?",
      "Prostate cancer affects tissue of the prostate gland, the part of the male reproductive system that helps make semen. It is located between the penis and the bladder.",
      "According to the NHS, it usually develops slowly, meaning some live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment.",
      "In Biden's case, the cancer is aggressive, and his family are said to be reviewing options for treatment.",
      "Biden was diagnosed following urinary symptoms, one of the most common signs of prostate cancer. That's because it is often detected only when the prostate is big enough to have impacted the urethra, the tube that connects the bladder to the penis.",
      "Joe Biden diagnosed with 'aggressive' prostate cancerAnalysis: Another formidable challenge for Biden",
      "Joe Biden diagnosed with 'aggressive' prostate cancer",
      "Analysis: Another formidable challenge for Biden",
      "Those symptoms can include needing to urinate more frequently, as well as a slow or weak urinary stream.",
      "Screening for prostate cancer is part of routine presidential health inspections, according to Dr Jeffrey Kuhlman, former White House doctor under President Barack Obama.",
      "Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in American men, according to the American Cancer Society, behind lung cancer.",
      "There will be more than 300,000 new cases in the US this year, according to projections by the American Cancer Society. About one in 8 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime.",
      "While it is \"not uncommon\" for men in their 80s to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, the grade and stage of Biden's cancer are \"more advanced than most men would encounter\" at diagnosis, Dr Ryan Cleary, urologist at MedStar Health, told the BBC.",
      "What is the Gleason score?",
      "The former president's prostate cancer is \"characterised by a Gleason score of 9\", his office said in the statement announcing his diagnosis.",
      "In the US, the Gleason score is a common way of grading the capacity for cells from the primary tumour to spread round the body - also known as metastatic cancer.",
      "Specifically, it refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look in a sample under a microscope. The scale runs from six to 10, with a higher number indicating a more aggressive cancer.",
      "The scale starts at six because it is calculated by combining the two most common patterns of cancer cells found in a patient. The lowest score assigned to cancerous cells is three. That's why the lowest Gleason score for a cancer diagnosis is six.",
      "A Gleason score of nine, such as Biden's, means it is a \"high-grade cancer\". Cancer cells with a score of nine look very abnormal and are likely to grow quickly.",
      "What are Biden's treatment options?",
      "Biden's cancer is aggressive in nature and has already spread to his bones.",
      "According to Dr Jamin Vinod Brahmbhatt, a urologist at Orlando Health Medical Group, this level of spread does limit the treatment options.",
      "While there are medical based treatments such as chemotherapy, steroids and hormone therapy available, none of them are \"curative\", he said.",
      "\"There are more medical options to stabilise the patient and control the cancer, but it never gets rid of the cancer completely.\"",
      "Biden's cancer is also said to be hormone sensitive, which means the cancer uses hormones to grow or develop.",
      "These types of cancers can be managed by drugs that block or lower the amount of hormones in the body.",
      "Dr Brahmbhatt said while this \"opens up the toolkit\" of treatment options for Biden, it was going to take \"weeks or months\" to see how he responds.",
      "Dr Kuhlman said Biden could also have the option of entering \"clinical trials for advanced disease\" if he meets the inclusion criteria.",
      "Biden and his family are said to be reviewing treatment options.",
      "What is his prognosis?",
      "In Sunday's statement, Biden's office said since the cancer appeared to be hormone-sensitive, that \"allows for effective management\".",
      "The full details of Biden's case are not known. Dr Cleary said: \"Generally, about a third of patients will still be alive after five years of metastatic prostate cancer.\"",
      "However, advanced stages of prostate cancer can limit a person's lifespan and lead to symptoms that make daily life harder.",
      "Dr Kuhlman said it was important to consider treatments that maintain Biden's quality of life in the next few years.",
      "\"If there's any inspiration in this, it is to go and get yourself checked out whether you have symptoms or not,\" Dr Brahmbhatt said.",

    "summary": "With NHS mental health waitlists at record highs, are chatbots a possible solution?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "\"Whenever I was struggling, if it was going to be a really bad day, I could then start to chat to one of these bots, and it was like [having] a cheerleader, someone who's going to give you some good vibes for the day.",
      "\"I've got this encouraging external voice going \u2013 'right - what are we going to do [today]?' Like an imaginary friend, essentially.\"",
      "For months, Kelly spent up to three hours a day speaking to online \"chatbots\" created using artificial intelligence (AI), exchanging hundreds of messages.",
      "At the time, Kelly was on a waiting list for traditional NHS talking therapy to discuss issues with anxiety, low self-esteem and a relationship breakdown.",
      "She says interacting with chatbots on character.ai got her through a really dark period, as they gave her coping strategies and were available for 24 hours a day.",
      "\"I'm not from an openly emotional family - if you had a problem, you just got on with it.",
      "\"The fact that this is not a real person is so much easier to handle.\"",
      "People around the world have shared their private thoughts and experiences with AI chatbots, even though they are widely acknowledged as inferior to seeking professional advice. Character.ai itself tells its users: \"This is an AI chatbot and not a real person. Treat everything it says as fiction. What is said should not be relied upon as fact or advice.\"",
      "But in extreme examples chatbots have been accused of giving harmful advice.",
      "Character.ai is currently the subject of legal action from a mother whose 14-year-old son took his own life after reportedly becoming obsessed with one of its AI characters. According to transcripts of their chats in court filings he discussed ending his life with the chatbot. In a final conversation he told the chatbot he was \"coming home\" - and it allegedly encouraged him to do so \"as soon as possible\".",
      "Character.ai has denied the suit's allegations.",
      "And in 2023, the National Eating Disorder Association replaced its live helpline with a chatbot, but later had to suspend it over claims the bot was recommending calorie restriction.",
      "In April 2024 alone, nearly 426,000 mental health referrals were made in England - a rise of 40% in five years. An estimated one million people are also waiting to access mental health services, and private therapy can be prohibitively expensive (costs vary greatly, but the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy reports on average people spend \u00a340 to \u00a350 an hour).",
      "At the same time, AI has revolutionised healthcare in many ways, including helping to screen, diagnose and triage patients. There is a huge spectrum of chatbots, and about 30 local NHS services now use one called Wysa.",
      "Experts express concerns about chatbots around potential biases and limitations, lack of safeguarding and the security of users' information. But some believe that if specialist human help is not easily available, chatbots can be a help. So with NHS mental health waitlists at record highs, are chatbots a possible solution?",
      "An 'inexperienced therapist'",
      "Character.ai and other bots such as Chat GPT are based on \"large language models\" of artificial intelligence. These are trained on vast amounts of data \u2013 whether that's websites, articles, books or blog posts - to predict the next word in a sequence. From here, they predict and generate human-like text and interactions.",
      "The way mental health chatbots are created varies, but they can be trained in practices such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which helps users to explore how to reframe their thoughts and actions. They can also adapt to the end user's preferences and feedback.",
      "Hamed Haddadi, professor of human-centred systems at Imperial College London, likens these chatbots to an \"inexperienced therapist\", and points out that humans with decades of experience will be able to engage and \"read\" their patient based on many things, while bots are forced to go on text alone.",
      "\"They [therapists] look at various other clues from your clothes and your behaviour and your actions and the way you look and your body language and all of that. And it's very difficult to embed these things in chatbots.\"",
      "Another potential problem, says Prof Haddadi, is that chatbots can be trained to keep you engaged, and to be supportive, \"so even if you say harmful content, it will probably cooperate with you\". This is sometimes referred to as a 'Yes Man' issue, in that they are often very agreeable.",
      "And as with other forms of AI, biases can be inherent in the model because they reflect the prejudices of the data they are trained on.",
      "Prof Haddadi points out counsellors and psychologists don't tend to keep transcripts from their patient interactions, so chatbots don't have many \"real-life\" sessions to train from. Therefore, he says they are not likely to have enough training data, and what they do access may have biases built into it which are highly situational.",
      "\"Based on where you get your training data from, your situation will completely change.",
      "\"Even in the restricted geographic area of London, a psychiatrist who is used to dealing with patients in Chelsea might really struggle to open a new office in Peckham dealing with those issues, because he or she just doesn't have enough training data with those users,\" he says.",
      "Philosopher Dr Paula Boddington, who has written a textbook on AI Ethics, agrees that in-built biases are a problem.",
      "\"A big issue would be any biases or underlying assumptions built into the therapy model.\"",
      "\"Biases include general models of what constitutes mental health and good functioning in daily life, such as independence, autonomy, relationships with others,\" she says.",
      "Lack of cultural context is another issue \u2013 Dr Boddington cites an example of how she was living in Australia when Princess Diana died, and people did not understand why she was upset.",
      "\"These kinds of things really make me wonder about the human connection that is so often needed in counselling,\" she says.",
      "\"Sometimes just being there with someone is all that is needed, but that is of course only achieved by someone who is also an embodied, living, breathing human being.\"",
      "Kelly ultimately started to find responses the chatbot gave unsatisfying.",
      "\"Sometimes you get a bit frustrated. If they don't know how to deal with something, they'll just sort of say the same sentence, and you realise there's not really anywhere to go with it.\" At times \"it was like hitting a brick wall\".",
      "\"It would be relationship things that I'd probably previously gone into, but I guess I hadn't used the right phrasing [\u2026] and it just didn't want to get in depth.\"",
      "A Character.AI spokesperson said \"for any Characters created by users with the words 'psychologist', 'therapist,' 'doctor,' or other similar terms in their names, we have language making it clear that users should not rely on these Characters for any type of professional advice\".",
      "'It was so empathetic'",
      "For some users chatbots have been invaluable when they have been at their lowest.",
      "Nicholas has autism, anxiety, OCD, and says he has always experienced depression. He found face-to-face support dried up once he reached adulthood: \"When you turn 18, it's as if support pretty much stops, so I haven't seen an actual human therapist in years.\"",
      "He tried to take his own life last autumn, and since then he says he has been on a NHS waitlist.",
      "\"My partner and I have been up to the doctor's surgery a few times, to try to get it [talking therapy] quicker. The GP has put in a referral [to see a human counsellor] but I haven't even had a letter off the mental health service where I live.\"",
      "While Nicholas is chasing in-person support, he has found using Wysa has some benefits.",
      "\"As someone with autism, I'm not particularly great with interaction in person. [I find] speaking to a computer is much better.\"",
      "The app allows patients to self-refer for mental health support, and offers tools and coping strategies such as a chat function, breathing exercises and guided meditation while they wait to be seen by a human therapist, and can also be used as a standalone self-help tool.",
      "Wysa stresses that its service is designed for people experiencing low mood, stress or anxiety rather than abuse and severe mental health conditions. It has in-built crisis and escalation pathways whereby users are signposted to helplines or can send for help directly if they show signs of self-harm or suicidal ideation.",
      "For people with suicidal thoughts, human counsellors on the free Samaritans helpline are available 24/7.",
      "Nicholas also experiences sleep deprivation, so finds it helpful if support is available at times when friends and family are asleep.",
      "\"There was one time in the night when I was feeling really down. I messaged the app and said 'I don't know if I want to be here anymore.' It came back saying 'Nick, you are valued. People love you'.",
      "\"It was so empathetic, it gave a response that you'd think was from a human that you've known for years [\u2026] And it did make me feel valued.\"",
      "His experiences chime with a recent study by Dartmouth College researchers looking at the impact of chatbots on people diagnosed with anxiety, depression or an eating disorder, versus a control group with the same conditions.",
      "After four weeks, bot users showed significant reductions in their symptoms \u2013 including a 51% reduction in depressive symptoms - and reported a level of trust and collaboration akin to a human therapist.",
      "Despite this, the study's senior author commented there is no replacement for in-person care.",
      "'A stop gap to these huge waiting lists'",
      "Aside from the debate around the value of their advice, there are also wider concerns about security and privacy, and whether the technology could be monetised.",
      "\"There's that little niggle of doubt that says, 'oh, what if someone takes the things that you're saying in therapy and then tries to blackmail you with them?',\" says Kelly.",
      "Psychologist Ian MacRae specialises in emerging technologies, and warns \"some people are placing a lot of trust in these [bots] without it being necessarily earned\".",
      "\"Personally, I would never put any of my personal information, especially health, psychological information, into one of these large language models that's just hoovering up an absolute tonne of data, and you're not entirely sure how it's being used, what you're consenting to.\"",
      "\"It's not to say in the future, there couldn't be tools like this that are private, well tested [\u2026] but I just don't think we're in the place yet where we have any of that evidence to show that a general purpose chatbot can be a good therapist,\" Mr MacRae says.",
      "Wysa's managing director, John Tench, says Wysa does not collect any personally identifiable information, and users are not required to register or share personal data to use Wysa.",
      "\"Conversation data may occasionally be reviewed in anonymised form to help improve the quality of Wysa's AI responses, but no information that could identify a user is collected or stored. In addition, Wysa has data processing agreements in place with external AI providers to ensure that no user conversations are used to train third-party large language models.\"",
      "Kelly feels chatbots cannot currently fully replace a human therapist. \"It's a wild roulette out there in AI world, you don't really know what you're getting.\"",
      "\"AI support can be a helpful first step, but it's not a substitute for professional care,\" agrees Mr Tench.",
      "And the public are largely unconvinced. A YouGov survey found just 12% of the public think AI chatbots would make a good therapist.",

      "But with the right safeguards, some feel chatbots could be a useful stopgap in an overloaded mental health system.",
      "John, who has an anxiety disorder, says he has been on the waitlist for a human therapist for nine months. He has been using Wysa two or three times a week.",
      "\"There is not a lot of help out there at the moment, so you clutch at straws.\"",

      "Officials say the sheer scale of the humanitarian crisis after two months of blockade played a part in the latest announcements, as did growing pressure from MPs and the public.",
      "Ministers were also responding to the lack of any clear path towards a ceasefire and a sense of frustration from the White House, with President Donald Trump sidestepping the country on his Middle East tour last week and Vice-President JD Vance postponing a trip there this week.",
      "The Israeli government has already been warned it must end its \"egregious\" military expansion and \"immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza\" in a joint statement from the leaders of the UK, Canada and France on Monday.",
      "Israel said it had allowed five lorries carrying humanitarian aid into the territory but  the UN's humanitarian chief said this was a \"drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed\".",
      "Later on Tuesday, the UN confirmed that, although permission had now been given to send about 100 aid trucks into Gaza, no aid had yet been distributed.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the current situation \"intolerable\", saying \"humanitarian aid needs to get in at pace\".",
      "In the House of Commons, there were shouts of \"shame\" from MPs as Lammy set out how an Israeli minister had said their latest operations would be \"cleansing Gaza\", \"destroying what's left\" and relocating Palestinians \"to third countries\".",
      "\"We must call this what it is,\" he told MPs. \"It is extremism, it is dangerous, it is repellent, it is monstrous, and I condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\"",
      "Lammy said Israel had suffered \"a heinous attack\" on 7 October 2023 and the UK had always backed the country's right to defend itself.",
      "However, the foreign secretary said the Israeli government had set out on a \"morally unjustifiable\" and \"utterly counterproductive\" path that would not bring hostages safely home.",
      "Instead, he accused the government led by Benjamin Netanyahu of \"isolating Israel from its friends and partners around the world\", as he announced negotiations on a free trade deal had been suspended.",
      "The Middle East minister, Hamish Falconer, told Israeli Ambassador Tzipi Hotovely that the UK would not \"stand by\" as Israel increased military operations in Gaza.",
      "\"Today I summoned Israel's ambassador to the FCDO,\" Falconer said in a post on X.",
      "\"I made clear the UK's opposition to expanded military operations in Gaza and rising violence and intimidation by Israeli settlers against Palestinian communities in the West Bank.\"",
      "\"The UK will not stand by as this happens,\" he added.",
      "Condemning settler violence, Lammy also set out sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans, against three individuals and four companies who were \"carrying out heinous abuses of human rights\".",
      "Dame Priti said: \"Strong words will do little to resolve the real challenges that are taking place and the suffering we are seeing taking place day in, day out.\"",
      "She added that it \"should be the cause of concern\" that the UK government's actions had been \"supported by Hamas, a terrorist organisation\".",

      "Israel lets aid into Gaza after 11-week blockade but UN calls it 'drop in ocean'",
      "Following the statement there were calls for the foreign secretary to go further, including from Labour backbenchers, who raised the possibility of a breach of international law.",
      "Abtisam Mohamed, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central, said Netanyahu had made an \"explicit admission that Israeli officials intend to carry out ethnic cleansing\".",
      "Lammy said the suspension of some arms sales to Israel had ensured \"none of us are complicit in any acts that breach international humanitarian law\" but he had announced further measures because the war was still continuing.",
      "Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting, said the \"weaponisation of food\" was \"morally reprehensible\" and called for an arms embargo to be imposed, as well as sanctions on Israeli officials.",
      "Lammy gave an \"absolute commitment\" that the UK government would take further action \"if needed over the coming days and weeks\".",
      "He also responded to calls to officially recognise the state of Palestine by confirming he was \"in close dialogue\" with both France and Saudi Arabia about recognition.",
      "Diplomats told the BBC they would still prefer to use recognition of Palestine as a spur to further action, perhaps as part of a wider peace settlement, rather than a symbolic expression of anger against Israel and support for Palestinians.",
      "Israeli foreign spokesman Oren Marmorstein responded defiantly to Lammy's statement on X, saying the decisions on sanctions were \"unjustified\".",
      "\"External pressure will not divert Israel from its path in defending its existence and security against enemies who seek its destruction,\" he said.",
      "Marmorstein also suggested the UK government had not been advancing negotiations on a trade deal \"at all\" before the announcement in the Commons.",
      "\"If, due to anti-Israel obsession and domestic political considerations, the British government is willing to harm the British economy - that is its own prerogative,\" he added.",
      "Meanwhile, the EU - Israel's biggest trading partner - is to review its trade agreement with the country in light of its actions in Gaza.",

    "summary": "The decision has been condemned by trans rights advocates and by gender critical activists.",
    "story": [
      "The Labour Party has postponed its annual Women's Conference in the wake of advice following last month's ruling on the legal definition of a woman.",
      "Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex.",
      "Up until the ruling, Labour had allowed people to self-identify as a woman, so trans women could attend the event and also take part in \"positive action\" measures such as all-women shortlists.",
      "The decision has been condemned by trans rights advocates as an \"attempt to isolate trans people\" and by gender critical activists as \"a kneejerk reaction\".",
      "People could be asked to prove biological sex under new EHRC code",
      "Labour Women's Conference is traditionally held the day before the main conference and brings together hundreds of women from Labour's activist base, including MPs, councillors, and supporters for a day of discussion and policy-making.",
      "A leaked advice paper to Labour's governing body, the National Executive Committee (NEC), recommended delaying the conference because the \"only legally defensible alternative\" would be to restrict attendance to biological women.",
      "The paper set out how \"there is a significant risk of legal challenge to the event as it currently operates\" and \"there may be protests, direct action and heightened security risks\" if it goes ahead on 27 September.",
      "That could carry a \"political risk\" of overshadowing the party's showcase autumn conference which begins the following day on 28 September.",
      "On Tuesday night, the party's NEC voted to delay the conference, pending a wider review of positive action measures.",
      "The NEC also decided to postpone the elections to the National Labour Women's Committee, which are normally held at the conference, and to extend the terms of those currently serving.",
      "Labour moved away from using all-women shortlists at the last general election. The leaked paper also advised the party to issue guidance to make clear that all-women shortlists can only apply to \"applicants who were biologically female at birth\".",
      "A Labour Party spokesperson said the party must make sure all its procedures \"comply with the Supreme Court's clear ruling\".",
      "\"Labour is clear that everyone in our society deserves to be treated with dignity and respect,\" he said.",
      "\"The party will work closely with individuals and local parties to implement the necessary changes with sensitivity and care.\"",
      "'Knee-jerk reaction'",
      "Ministers will consider the Equality and Human Rights Commission's code of practice, which it has just put out for consultation.",
      "The decision was condemned by Georgia Meadows, who was speaking as LGBT+ Labour's trans officer.",
      "\"It is a blatant attack on trans rights and is seemingly an attempt to isolate trans people even further within the Labour Party and the Labour movement more widely,\" they said.",
      "The Labour Women's Declaration group, which backs \"sex-based rights\", said cancelling the conference would be a \"knee-jerk reaction\".",
      "A spokesperson told the LabourList website: \"We are shocked that hundreds of women in the Labour Party might be prevented from meeting at conference because the NEC would prefer to disadvantage all women rather than to exclude the very small number of trans-identified men who may wish to attend the women's conference.\"",

    "summary": "Options under discussion include changing eligibility, or restoring the payments to all pensioners.",
    "story": [
      "Senior government figures are discussing whether to reverse the controversial decision to cut winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners within weeks.",
      "More than nine million pensioners lost out on payments worth up to \u00a3300 after Chancellor Rachel Reeves restricted eligibility for the pension top-up last year.",
      "Discussions in government have included changing the threshold at which pensioners stop receiving the benefit, or restoring the payments to all pensioners.",
      "The talks are understood to be fluid, and have not yet reached a conclusion.",
      "The government may ultimately decide to stick with its existing policy.",
      "No 10 resists Labour calls for winter fuel rethink",
      "Winter fuel payments scrapped for millions",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "Any announcement could come as soon as the spending review on 11 June, when the chancellor will unveil government departments' budgets for the coming years.",
      "There have been reports that the government is considering whether to increase the \u00a311,500 income threshold over which pensioners are no longer eligible for the allowance.",
      "Some Labour MPs have blamed the winter fuel policy for the party's losses at last month's local elections, and the Runcorn and Helsby by-election.",
      "Simply abandoning the policy entirely is seen as a less likely outcome than adjusting the thresholds.",
      "However, the fact that this policy - one of the first decisions made by Labour upon entering office last last summer - is even under review shows the scale of concern in Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's team about its political impact.",
      "Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live whether the government was considering changing course, cabinet minister Pat McFadden replied: \"I can't say anything about that. When budgets are agreed, they're agreed in the round.\"",
      "\"I've not been involved in a recent cabinet discussion about this,\" he said.",
      "He added that winter fuel payments do \"come up on the doorstep\" and acknowledged \"some decisions are more popular than others\".",
      "In an interview with the BBC's Newscast podcast on Monday, Reeves failed to rule out changing course on winter fuel.",
      "Reeves said the government faced a \"tough inheritance\" and took some \"tough decisions\" to stabilise the public finances after winning last year's general election.",
      "But she added: \"I do understand the concerns that people have.\"",
      "She said she would \"continue to listen to understand the concerns that people have raised\".",
      "\"We are a government that listens,\" the chancellor said.",
      "\"But we would always need to show where the money is going to come from if we're going to make any policy changes. That would be part of the normal process.\"",
      "Her comments mark a change in tone since Reeves urged Labour MPs to back her plan to cut winter fuel payments in September last year.",
      "At a meeting of Labour MPs that month, Reeves told Labour backbenchers: \"It is the right thing to do, to target money at a time when finances are so stretched, at people who need them most.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman told reporters there \"will not be a change to the government's policy\" on the winter fuel payment, despite growing calls within Labour ranks for a rethink.",
      "Some MPs raised questions about the payment as they grilled Sir Keir at a meeting in Parliament on Monday.",
      "Speaking to the BBC ahead of that meeting, Labour MP Stella Creasy said it would be \"remiss\" of the government to dismiss concerns over the winter fuel payment.",
      "\"Those concerns are being heard across the party,\" Creasy said.",
      "\"Those of us who have been around a long time and among new MPs, there's a genuine concern to get this right and that's now what the government needs to respond to.\"",
      "The Liberal Democrats said it remained to be seen whether the chancellor had listened.",
      "\"This U-turn is taking so long it puts turning an oil tanker around to shame,\" Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said.",
      "\"The government should feel embarrassed that it has taken a dire set of a local election results to realise what everyone has known from the start: this policy was doomed to fail and punished some of the most vulnerable.\"",
      "The winter fuel payment is a lump-sum amount of \u00a3200 a year for pensioners under 80, increasing to \u00a3300 for over-80s, paid in November or December.",
      "Last year, the government restricted the payments to those who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits, in a bid to save \u00a31.4bn.",
      "The move did not feature in Labour's general election manifesto.",
      "It was seen as a key issue at this month's local elections, at which Labour lost 187 council seats and control of the only council it was defending.",
      "The winter fuel payment was introduced in 1997 by New Labour as a universal payment for all pensioners.",
      "It was billed as a way to guarantee they would be able to pay for increased heating costs over the winter - although in practice it is a pension top-up, which recipients can spend on whatever they want.",
      "This year state pensions are going up by 4.1% - a rise of \u00a3363 a year for those on the basic pension, or \u00a3472 for those on the new pension.",

      "The government said the regulator had launched 81 criminal probes since last July's election after hiring 400 more staff for the purpose and that it had initiated proceedings against seven companies.",
      "Water UK, which represents water companies, said in a statement that firms should be investigated and held to account when necessary.",
      "The announcement comes amid public anger over pollution in rivers and seas. The number of pollution incidents recorded by water companies in England is at a 10-year high, according to data released by campaigners last month.",
      "The increase in Environment Agency inspectors is partly due to a recruitment drive from the previous Conservative government.",
      "In February 2024 the Conservatives said they planned to quadruple water inspections and hire an additional 500 staff for inspections and enforcement.",
      "None of the 81 investigations have so far led to convictions, which often take years to work their way through the court systems. But the government said they could lead to water companies being fined hundreds of millions of pounds.",
      "\"This Labour Government is cleaning up the foul mess the Tories left behind with a record number of criminal investigations into law-breaking water companies - which could see bosses behind bars,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.",
      "The Conservative Party defended its record in response, with a spokesman saying that while it was in government it had begun the process of reforming water and sewage systems and taken action to ban bonuses for bosses of water companies that committed criminal breaches.",
      "\"The Labour Government made big promises on water, and we will continue to hold them to account to ensure they continue the work of the previous Conservative Government to improve our water and sewage systems for billpayers,\" the spokesman said.",
      "\"It's good to see the Government finally taking water pollution seriously,\" said CEO of campaigners River Action, James Wallace.",
      "But he pointed out that water bosses could only serve jail time for obstructing investigations, not for pollution itself.",
      "\"Jail time for water bosses remains highly unlikely,\" he said. \"The law only applies to cover-ups \u2014 and there's no need to hide what's already happening in plain sight, week in, week out.\"",
      "Southern Water was hit with a record \u00a3126m punishment in 2019 for spills of wastewater into the environment from its sewage plants and for deliberately misreporting its performance.",
      "Greenpeace UK head of politics Ami McCarthy said: \"Water firms have got away with flouting rules and pumping sewage into our rivers for far too long, so it's good to see ministers finally throwing the book at these serial polluters.\"",
      "She also urged the government to ensure that consumers did not foot the bill of any fines issued to water companies.",
      "\"It is right that water companies are investigated and held to account when things go wrong,\" Water UK said in a statement.",
      "\"Almost 99% of sewage and water treatment works meet their [pollution limit] permits and we are focused on getting to 100%.\""

      "\"This new deal appears to offer little more than expanded access to e-gates which are already in use at some destinations and only after the long-delayed digital border system (EES) is introduced, currently planned for an October launch.\"",
      "Currently, EU destinations which already allow UK passport holders to use e-gates often then require a secondary check and a passport stamp.",
      "The new deal and EES means UK passport holders will likely no longer require a stamp.",
      "The launch of EES has been in the pipeline for a while. It will see non-EU nationals needing to add their biometric data to a new EU database, which will be done at the point of departure to the EU, either at an airport, port or train station."

      "Peers had already backed an amendment calling for more copyright protections for the creative industries from artificial intelligence (AI) scrapers once.",
      "MPs rejected that amendment and sent the Bill back to the Lords, where Technology Minister Baroness Jones told peers it would lead to \"piecemeal\" legislation as it pre-empted consultation on AI and copyright.",
      "However, there was broad and vociferous support for Baroness Kidron, a film director and digital rights campaigner, who accused ministers of being swayed by the \"whisperings of Silicon Valley\" asking them to \"redefine theft\".",
      "The Lords rebellion follows condemnation from Sir Elton John, who called the government \"losers\" over the weekend and said ministers would be \"committing theft\" if they allowed AI firms to use artists' content without paying.",
      "He joins the ranks of high-profile musicians, including Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, and Kate Bush, who are outraged by plans they say would make it easier for AI models to be trained on copyrighted material.",
      "Kidron's amendment would force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes, and demand they get permission from copyright holders before they use any of their work.",
      "Highlighting the power differential between the big tech giants in the US and creatives in the UK, Kidron branded the government's plans \"extraordinary\".",
      "\"There's no industrial sector in the UK that government policy requires to give its property or labour to another sector - which is in direct competition with it - on a compulsory basis, in the name of balance,\" she said.",
      "\"The government has got it wrong.",

      "\"Silicon Valley has persuaded the government that it's easier for them to redefine theft than make them pay for what they have stolen.\"",
      "Defending her amendment, the crossbench peer said it was \"the minimum viable action from the government\" to signal that \"UK copyright law is indeed the law of the land\".",
      "Otherwise, Kidron said, the Bill was merely a \"political gesture\" ignoring \"widespread theft\" of UK copyright and \"starving\" the creative industry of \"the transparency they need to survive\".",
      "Sir Elton John angry at 'criminal' AI plans for artists",
      "Artists release silent album in protest against AI using their work",
      "She was backed by Labour's Lord Brennan, who said the government was trying to set up \"a double standard\" with AI companies, and abandoning its historical leadership over the importance of intellectual copyright.",
      "\"This country has shown leadership throughout history in relation to copyright and setting the highest standards in order to try and drag people up to our level rather than simply putting up the flag of surrender,\" he said.",
      "\"I fear there is a view that we have to allow AI companies to do anything they want because otherwise they'll just go and do it somewhere else.\"",
      "Lord Watson, former deputy leader of the Labour Party and clearly a fan of Sir Elton, reeled off a string of song lyrics urging ministers to heed \"the clarion cry of this country's creators\".",
      "A third Labour peer, Lord Knight, also called on his party colleagues to \"protect the livelihoods of artists from big tech\" and said he believed this could be done at the same time as \"taking advantage of the creative and economic opportunities of AI\".",
      "The strength of feeling around the urgency to protect artists was made clear by others, including crossbencher and composer Lord Berkeley, who labelled the current situation \"burglary\".",
      "\"The only way you will stop it is by acting now before the gate is trampled down by the horses,\" he said.",
      "\"If this door is left open we will destroy the future of our creative industries.\"",
      "Conservative Lord Dobbs agreed those who had \"slogged away, struggled and suffered\" for their art deserved the government's protection and Liberal Democrat Floella Benjamin said she saluted Kidron for her \"tenacity and dogged determination\" to ensure \"creativity will not be stolen\".",
      "Baroness Jones spoke again at the close of the debate to plead with peers not to overturn the will of MPs for a second time, insisting \"this isn't about Silicon Valley\", denying the government was being complacent, and pointing out that \"no other territory has cracked this either\".",
      "\"We all want to see a way forward that protects our creative industries while supporting everyone in the UK to develop and benefit from AI,\" she said.",
      "\"Kidron's amendment will not provide certainty of anything except for certainty of more uncertainty, of continuous regulations stacked one upon another in a pile of instruments...",
      "\"Jumping the gun on one issue will hamstring us in reaching the best outcome on all the others and especially because this is a global issue and we cannot ringfence the UK away from the rest of the world.\"",
      "However, Kidron said her amendment \"does not challenge the primacy of the Commons\" and pushed ahead.",
      "The result was a decisive defeat for the Government, with 287 votes in favour of Kidron's amendment and 118 against - a majority of 169 - and the Bill will now be sent back to the Commons.",

      "On the other side of the equation, the Liberal Democrats welcomed \"some positive first steps\" but urged the prime minister to \"be more ambitious\".",
      "Their position is that the UK should rejoin the EU's customs union - an agreement between member states not to charge tariffs on each other's goods.",
      "What will prove revealing over the coming days, weeks, and months is not just those opposition parties' positions but how much they campaign on them.",
      "If opposition to today's deal becomes a significant part of these parties' platforms, it will tell us that they believe there is in fact plenty of controversy yet in the decades-long debate over the UK's relationship with the EU.",
      "If that's right, then today's main significance may prove to have been thrusting questions about Brexit right back to the centre of political life.",
      "But if Sir Keir is right that the bulk of the public simply wants as little friction with the EU as possible, then he could prove to be our first truly post-Brexit prime minister.",

      "The UK and the European Union have agreed a major new deal covering areas including trade, defence, fishing and energy.",
      "However, negotiations are still taking place on a number of key issues - leaving some important questions unanswered.",
      "How much will the UK pay?",
      "The deal makes several references to a \"financial contribution\" from the UK to access certain benefits, notably an agreement to reduce checks on food exports to the EU.",
      "The prime minister's official spokesman said these were \"administrative costs\".",
      "He insisted they would not be \"big\" but refused to put a figure on how much the UK would pay.",
      "In other areas, terms are still being negotiated so the cost to the UK isn't known yet.",
      "For example, the two sides are working towards the UK rejoining the Erasmus+ exchange programme, which allows students to study or do work placements abroad.",

      "The government has said any such deal would be \"capped and time-limited\" but it has not specified how many visas could be issued annually and how long they would be valid for.",
      "These details will be the subject of future negotiations.",
      "The UK already has similar schemes with 11 countries including Australia, New Zealand and Japan, with people able to stay for up to three years depending on which country they are from.",
      "Last year, just over 24,000 youth mobility visas were issued by the UK.",
      "When can British travellers use e-gates?",
      "Since Brexit, British travellers at EU airports have generally been forced to have their passport stamped at manned desks, rather than use automatic gates with facial recognition technology.",
      "Some airports already allow British passport-holders to use e-gates - but for those that don't, the only alternative is often a lengthy queue.",
      "The deal states that there will be \"no legal barriers\" to Britons using e-gates when travelling to and from EU countries after the introduction of the European Union Entry/Exit System.",
      "The long-awaited digital border checks system is due to replace passport stamping for travellers from outside the EU in October.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he wants UK holidaymakers to be able to use e-gates \"as soon as possible\".",
      "But it is up to individual EU countries to decide whether British passport-holders can use e-gates at their airports.",

      "Will UK qualifications be recognised in the EU?",
      "Another promise in Labour's manifesto was to \"secure a mutual recognition agreement for professional qualifications to help open up markets for UK service exporters\".",

    "story": [
      "There was much fanfare  - and then lunch on the Thames - to mark the \"reset\" of the relationship between the UK and the EU with claims of a \"huge\" potential boost to growth.",
      "The deal does represent a  significant breakthrough in deepening ties in the UK's most important trading relationship and paves the way for more gains while still allowing scope for pursuing other trade deals.",
      "But ultimately what has been agreed so far only dismantles a fraction of the trade barriers erected post-Brexit.",
      "Those producing and selling foodstuffs between Britain and the EU, in particular, are celebrating a reduction in red tape and checks.",
      "The agreement on plant and animal health, or sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS), goes further than envisaged a few months ago. By agreeing to follow EU rules, the government has faced accusations of selling out on sovereignty. But it will smooth the path for over 1,500 products crossing borders.",
      "The new UK-EU deal at a glance",
      "Brexitcast: The EU-UK Deal (and our Rachel Reeves interview)",
      "For more than four years, those selling agricultural products from Britain to the EU have had to comply with extra certification and checks, intended to prevent the spread of disease and ensure food safety.",
      "Amid frequent complaints of forms stretching to dozens of pages and fish and other perishables rotting in transit, the Food & Drink Federation claims that exports of such items to the EU have dropped by a third since 2019.",
      "Small companies were particularly likely to conclude it wasn't worth the effort; the variety of products being exported was reduced as costs increased. Formalities on items coming into the UK, too, have been ramped up, albeit more gradually.",
      "By doing away with some of the paperwork and inspections, the government claims this agreement - and the one centred on energy - will be worth \u00a38.9bn to the UK by 2040.",
      "Those predictions are always uncertain but that's roughly equivalent to 0.3% of GDP - helpful but not quite the \"huge\" boost to growth it claims. And that would recoup only a small  fraction of the 4% of GDP the government's own independent forecasters reckon has been foregone as a result of  Brexit.",
      "What about prices?",
      "Some studies suggest that greater red tape has contributed to higher prices for foodstuffs imported from the EU in recent years.",
      "And while retailers are among those welcoming this deal, it's not guaranteed that any savings in costs will be passed on. Although the deal could limit the degree of future increases in prices, that depends on suppliers passing on savings.",
      "The key concession made by the UK was an extension to the agreement on fisheries by 12 years. That sector represents just 0.04% of GDP, but clearly this will be a big disappointment to some fishing communities, concerned by an encroachment of rights. However, exports of fish to the EU have fallen by 29% over the course of just a few  years - the SPS agreement is likely to help reverse that loss.",
      "What's been agreed in detail so far may not provide the \"huge\" boost to growth the government wants, but there is more that should be ahead.",
      "The youth mobility scheme could deliver significant gains, depending on the details that are hammered out, as could the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.",
      "But even those are unlikely to repair even the majority of the damage to growth some economists reckon Brexit has caused.",
      "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility, the official forecasters, had reckoned that as a result of Brexit GDP will be the equivalent of 4% lower than it could have been. That's the equivalent of costing the economy \u00a3100bn per year.",
      "Fully compensating for that, analysts reckon, would involve the UK rejoining the single market and customs union and allowing freedom of movement - all of which the government reiterated today are \"red lines\" it's not prepared to cross.",
      "But there is still a very significant triumph the government can claim. In a short period of time, it has tied up trade agreements with India and the US - and struck this improved deal with the EU.",
      "The latter, in particular, may have been given added impetus by President Trump's trade hostility.",
      "Knowing it perhaps could rely less on that traditional ally across the Atlantic may not have driven the EU and UK into each others arms, but it likely added a new focus on working to break down barriers previously thought insurmountable.",
      "Moreover, the UK has achieved something many commentators thought not possible in the early years of Brexit, securing a deal (albeit limited) with the US without lowering food standards and so managing to align with EU rules.",
      "This deal may not be a huge growth gamechanger. But it paves the way for reaching more common ground with the EU while allowing the UK to strengthen ties with the US on services, in particular financial services, and technology - areas of growing importance for British firms doing business with America.",

      "Some sections of Scotland's fishing industry have accused Sir Keir Starmer's government of \"capitulating\" to the EU over a deal on access to UK waters.",
      "Labour ministers have agreed a 12-year deal which extends existing access for EU boats in exchange for reduced checks and restrictions on food exports.",
      "The agreement was described as \"disastrous\" by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) while Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said it was a \"great betrayal of our fishing fleet\".",
      "But fish farming body Salmon Scotland welcomed the deal as a \"slashing of red tape\" which will allow Scottish products and people easier access to the EU.",
      "The prime minister officially announced the deal as part of the first UK-EU summit, describing it as a \"win-win\".",
      "He said it would \"tear down\" barriers to trade and end the \"needlessly difficult\" process of selling Scottish products in Europe.",
      "Starmer added the fishing agreement would protect UK access with no increase in EU vessels, while other measures meant shellfish could now be sold again in Europe.",
      "\"This agreement isn't about revisiting the stale old debates of the past,\" he said.",
      "\"It's time now for Britain to look forwards and outwards as a proud, sovereign nation on the world stage - to get the best deal for the people of Scotland and Britain. \"",
      "The new sanitary and phytosanitary agreement (SPS) would also benefit other agricultural exporters while holidaymakers will be able to use eGates at some airports to cut down on passport queue wait times, Starmer added.",
      "Forbes welcomed closer co-operation which \"unpicks a small part of the damage that  Brexit continues to inflict\".",
      "But she criticised the lack of consultation with the Scottish government over the fishing deal.",
      "\"Given the importance of fishing to Scotland it is also astonishing that the Scottish government was giving no warning of this great betrayal of our fishing fleet,\" she said.",
      "The previous post-Brexit deal saw the UK regain 25% of fishing rights from the EU, but it also gave European boats continuous access to UK waters.",
      "It was due to expire at the end of June 2026 but the new agreement will see that extended until the summer of 2038.",
      "The deal does not include any change to current access to fish for coastal communities. There is no reduction in the British quota or increase in the quota the EU is allowed to catch.",
      "But SFF chief executive Elspeth Macdonald said she was worried the agreement would end any \"leverage\" the UK has in future negotiations.",
      "She told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"This is not a roll over, it's a total capitulation to the EU and a disastrous outcome for the Scottish fishing fleet.",
      "\"The EU have clearly reneged on a deal that they signed up to in 2020 and have said that they require to have another multi-year deal.",
      "\"But in doing so the UK loses all its negotiating capital and all its leverage, so the EU continues to take a far bigger share of the resources in our waters than they are entitled to.",
      "\"We've always been in this position where fishing seems to be the expendable price for something else that the UK wants.\"",
      "Cutting 'red tape'",
      "While the deal has been criticised, it has also been welcomed in other parts of Scotland's fishing and food production industries.",
      "Tavish Scott, chief executive of Salmon Scotland, said the new agreement would help cut the time taken to get products into the EU market.",
      "The body said international sales of salmon from Scotland hit a record \u00a3844m in 2024, with France, where Scottish salmon is given the \"Label Rouge\" quality mark, the largest market at \u00a3462m.",
      "Mr Scott said the deal could open up new opportunities for Scottish producers in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, where demand is rising despite tough competition from Norway and Chile.",
      "\"This breakthrough will ease the burden on our farmers, processors and the communities they support,\" he said.",
      "\"Scottish salmon is the UK's largest food export, with strong demand in the EU, the US and beyond.\"",
      "The deal also benefits shellfish producers after the EU banned British fishermen from selling live mussels, oysters, clams, cockles and scallops to its member states in 2021.",
      "Under those rules, fishermen were previously not allowed to transport the animals to the EU unless they had already been treated in purification plants.",
      "'Sold down the river'",
      "Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Association, described the deal as an \"utter betrayal\".",
      "He said it was the \"third time\" the fishing industry had been \"sold down the river,\" citing decisions by former prime minister Ted Heath, who took the UK into the EU in 1973, and Boris Johnson, who negotiated its exit in the aftermath of Brexit in 2020.",
      "Mr Park said: \"We understand the free flow of food products, the EU benefit from that and the UK benefit from it.",
      "\"But here we have a massive fleet coming into UK waters and the UK fishing industry gets nothing out of it.\"",
      "Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon and Buchan, Harriet Cross, described the deal as a \"surrender\" and \"one of the biggest acts of betrayal that our fishing industry has seen in Scotland.\"",
      "She said: \"Our fishermen have been used as a pawn by Keir Starmer, which will result in catastrophic consequences for our coastal communities.\"",
      "The UK government also announced a \u00a3360m fund to invest in coastal communities as part of the agreement.",
      "It said that would go towards new technology and equipment to modernise the fleet, training to upskill workforces and help to \"revitalise\" coastal communities.",
      "About 4,000 people are employed in Scotland's commercial sea fishing industry, according to a Scottish government report published in 2023.",
      "In 2022, it brought \u00a3335m into the Scottish economy, more than half of which came from Aberdeenshire, including the UK's largest fishing port at Peterhead.",
      "The fish farming and aquaculture industries account for about 2,200 jobs and brought in \u00a3337m to the Scottish economy in 2022.",
      "Keir Starmer has described this UK-EU deal as a \"win-win\" but that is not necessarily how it is viewed by every part of the Scottish fishing industry.",
      "The sharply contrasting reactions of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation - which has accused the UK government of \"capitulation\" - and Salmon Scotland, which has welcomed an agreement it believes will \"slash red tape\", underlines the fact that any deal involves trade-offs.",

      "There are aspects of closer cooperation between the UK and EU that the Scottish government is happy to welcome.",
      "However, there was never going to be a package that would satisfy SNP ministers, as they favour a return to the EU.",
      "They argue the best way for that to be achieved is through Scottish independence. But that debate has lost much of its previous energy.",
      "An earlier \"reset\" in relations between the UK and devolved governments has improved how they work together.",

    "summary": "Former Tory MP Michael Gove reveals his change in position over a second vote.",
    "story": [
      "There could be a second Scottish independence referendum if the public show \"overwhelming support\" for one, according to Michael Gove.",
      "The former Conservative minister, who sat in the cabinet for most of the period between 2010 and 2024, told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show that he didn't think another referendum was necessary.",
      "But he conceded that the UK government may have to change approach if SNP popularity and support for another vote grows.",
      "Last week, First Minister John Swinney said that he wanted to achieve \"demonstrable support\" for independence.",
      "UK is a 'living thing'",
      "Gove, who held various cabinet positions under three Conservative prime ministers, was often tasked with overseeing relations between the UK and Scottish government.",
      "While he doesn't think Scottish independence is currently on the agenda, he is warning supporters of the union not to \"assume any degree of complacency.\"",
      "Gove described the UK as a \"living thing\" and added that politicians had to continually demonstrate that the union was working.",
      "The former minister said that he didn't think a second referendum was \"necessary at the moment\", but added that if there was \"an overwhelming desire on the part of the Scottish people for one then we'd have to review the decision.\"",
      "When pressed on what would trigger such a change in policy, Gove said that was for the Westminster government to decide.",
      "He added that he believed too much focus on the constitution was bad for all political parties and that governments should \"retain confidence\" by concentrating on the economy, health and transport.",
      "Gove was part of a government that rejected requests from the Scottish government for a second referendum.",
      "He denied that this was anti-democratic and insisted that Scotland had \"more important\" issues to deal with.",
      "Gove now suggests that the likelihood of a second independence vote was linked to the SNP's ability to improve public services.",
      "\"If, for the sake of argument, the SNP make all of those decisions in government in a way that gives people confidence in them then we might be in a different position [on a second referendum]\", he said.",
      "Michael Gove and SNP leader John Swinney do not have much in common politically, but they seem to be delivering a relatively similar message on this topic.",
      "Last week, the first minister talked about securing \"demonstrable support\" for independence.",
      "Swinney compared this to the 1997 referendum for a Scottish parliament, which was backed by around 74% of Scots.",
      "The message seemed to be that independence will move forward when public support demands it in greater numbers.",
      "But the first minister also told BBC Scotland News that it was \"completely unacceptable\" for the independence movement \"to be thwarted by a Westminster government that just folds its arms and says 'no'.\"",
      "Gove is no stranger to disagreements with Scottish government ministers.",
      "He insists that relations were broadly cordial and productive when he was in government. But it's fair to say there were times when relationships soured.",
      "Back in 2023, the UK government made the unprecedented decision to veto Holyrood's Gender Recognition Reform bill.",
      "This legislation would have made it easier for trans people to 'self-identify' and change their legally recognised sex, without a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.",
      "Gove chaired a committee of ministers who agreed to enact Section 35 of the Scotland Act.",
      "This allows a UK minister to veto a Holyrood bill if they think it would modify laws reserved to Westminster and have an \"adverse effect\" on how those laws apply.",
      "This power had never been used before and it has not been used since.",
      "Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the term 'woman' related to biological sex under the Equality Act.",
      "And Gove believes this proved that deploying the section 35 order was the correct call.",
      "\"I think it was absolutely the right decision, and I think it's been vindicated by subsequent events\", he added.",
      "Though Mr Gove stressed that the Section 35 provision must remain a \"fail safe power\" that is \"used sparingly\".",
      "At the time the Scottish government characterised the veto as a \"direct attack\" on the Scottish Parliament.",
      "Gove stood down as an MP last year and is now editor of the Spectator magazine. He is due to enter the House of Lords this week as Lord Gove of Torry.",
      "His chosen title is a tribute to the Aberdeen suburb where his family's fish processing business was based.",
      "So how concerned is the native Aberdonian about the state of the Scottish Conservatives?",
      "Some polls have suggested that the emergence of the Reform Party could see them drop from second to fourth place in next year's Holyrood election.",
      "Speaking from the leather couches of his editor's office at the Spectator's London HQ, he tells the Scottish wing of his party \"don't panic\".",
      "The former cabinet minister deploys an Aberdeen Football Club analogy to assess the situation.",
      "For those not following the twist and turns of Scottish football, the Dons have had an up and down season.",
      "But they still find themselves with a shot at silverware in the Scottish cup final next weekend.",
      "He says the important lesson is \"not to change the manager\" but to \"stick together as a team\".",
      "That reassurance may go down well with both UK party leader Kemi Badenoch and Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay, who must scale political mountains if they are to deliver success.",
      "But there may yet be a warning contained within Mr Gove's Aberdeen FC comparison.",

      "The broadcast this week setting out the strategy on Clews' own United News Network (UNN) channel was first identified by the campaign group Labour Against Antisemitism.",
      "Collett said Reform's success was helping to shift what was considered acceptable for political debate.",
      "He pointed to Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick's recent comments that in Dagenham the \"British population has reduced by 50% in the last 25 years\" as proof.",
      "\"We won't be dropping our policies, our anti-Zionism, our anti-Net Zero,\" Collett added.",

      "The plan could represent a challenge to Reform's vetting process.",

      "A local organiser for Reform in Staffordshire stood down earlier this year after details of his links to PA emerged and a candidate in Derbyshire was suspended by the party after sharing a post from a PA organiser.",

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has given his strongest signal yet that a youth mobility scheme could form part of a new deal with the EU.",
      "Speaking to the Times ahead of a summit on Monday between the bloc and the UK, he insisted such a scheme would not amount to a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement.",
      "While Sir Keir said it would be a \"reciprocal\" arrangement in which young people would be able to move abroad for up to two years, no specific details about the ages of those who could be eligible and whether there would be a cap on numbers were given.",
      "Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has described the possible scheme as \"free movement through the back door\".",
      "\"We're not against youth mobility schemes. We're against uncapped migration schemes,\" she wrote on X.",
      "Reform UK has echoed these sentiments. Its deputy leader, Richard Tice, said earlier this week such a scheme would be \"the thin end\" to EU free movement.",
      "Sir Keir has denied these accusations, saying that Labour has a \"red line in our manifesto about freedom of movement\" and that \"youth mobility is not freedom of movement\".",
      "An agreement is expected to be announced at Monday's summit, which is being held at London's Lancaster House.",
      "The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg has been told that it will only be an agreement in principle, not the final deal.",
      "She understands that the EU has been pushing for stays as long as four years, while the UK is not contemplating more than one or two.",
      "In fresh comments on Saturday evening ahead of the summit, Sir Keir said \"a strengthened partnership\" with the EU would \"be good for our jobs, good for our bills and good for our borders\".",

      "The prime minister has pointed to reciprocal youth mobility schemes (YMS) that the UK already has with the likes of Australia - where people between the ages of 18 and 35 are allowed to work in each other's countries.",
      "The UK currently offers visas allowing young people from 12 non-EU countries including Japan, South Korea and Uruguay to study or work in the UK for up to two years. Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year.",
      "These visas are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia, with ballots held where they are oversubscribed.",
      "The former Tory government last year rejected an EU offer that would have made it easier for people aged between 18 and 30 to study and work abroad in the wake of Brexit.",
      "Labour at the time said it had \"no plans for a youth mobility scheme\" if it won the general election.",
      "London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the BBC's Newsnight programme on Friday that the current government was giving \"mixed messages\" and that he wanted to hear it \"speaking in one voice and say they would like a youth mobility scheme\".",
      "He said such a scheme would \"put rocket boosters up businesses in London\", where there are gaps in sectors including hospitality, creative industries, health and social care.",
      "The Liberal Democrats have also welcomed the idea of a new form of youth mobility scheme, with Europe spokesperson James MacCleary calling it a \"welcome step in the right direction\".",
      "He added: \"This news is a glimmer of hope for young people who have been so badly let down by Brexit. The government now need to follow through.\"",
      "The UK's European relations minister, Nick Thomas-Symonds, publicly confirmed last week that the government was considering setting up a youth mobility scheme as part of a new partnership agreement with the EU.",
      "He told the Financial Times that \"a smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\" - provided the government's red lines are respected.",
      "Asked whether the UK might in the future consider re-joining the Erasmus student scheme, Thomas-Symonds said there were not currently plans to do so but added the government was \"always open to listening to sensible proposals from the EU\".",

      "For example, since August 2021, new students from the EU generally have had to pay international fees and do not qualify for tuition fee loans.",
      "As well as youth mobility, issues such as fishing rights are also expected to be discussed during Monday's meeting - the first since Brexit.",

    "story": [
      "No one would be forced to help with the process of assisted dying against their wishes, under changes approved by MPs.",
      "A bill which would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales, expected to die within six months, to seek help to end their own life is currently being considered by Parliament.",
      "The legislation passed its first stage in the House of Commons last November \u2013 but since then the details have been pored over and dozens of amendments added by both sides.",
      "On Friday MPs debated further potential changes, which also included preventing medical staff from raising the option of assisted dying with a patient first.",
      "However, MPs ran out of time to vote on more changes, so further debate and voting will take place on 13 June.",
      "That would be followed by a vote on whether to pass the bill as a whole to its next stage or reject it, either on the same day or a future date.",
      "The government is neutral on the bill and MPs have been given a free vote, meaning they can decide based on their conscience rather than having to follow a party line.",
      "The original bill stated that no registered medical practitioner or other health professional would be under any obligation to participate in the process of assisted dying and they could not be discriminated by their employer if they did not wish to do so.",
      "Under a change proposed by Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, and approved by MPs, this has been expanded say no one would have to take part in the process, giving protections to any staff who might be involved.",

      "Assisted dying law could take four years to implement",
      "MPs scrap judge sign-off in assisted dying bill",
      "During an emotionally charged - and at times ill-tempered - debate, supporters of the bill argued it had been strengthened by earlier changes.",
      "Opening the proceedings, Leadbeater said many people had \"lost loved ones in deeply difficult and traumatic circumstances\".",
      "The MP for Spen Valley added: \"Put simply, if we do not vote to change the law, we are essentially saying that the status quo is acceptable.\"",
      "But opponents said the bill had been rushed through and needed stronger protections for people who could be vulnerable to coercion.",
      "Conservative MP Rebecca Paul argued there should be a focus on improving end-of-life care, rather than assisted dying.",
      "\"[The bill] will harm far more people than it will help,\" Paul said.",
      "\"And those people who will be harmed are among the most vulnerable in our communities and I'm not willing to accept this collateral damage.\"",

      "However, Dame Esther's daughter, Rebecca Wilcox, told BBC Breakfast she was worried about the \"scaremongering\", \"blatant lies\" and \"myths\" circulating about the bill.",
      "She said that while she appreciated there were concerns over coercion and how the proposed legislation could affect vulnerable or disabled people, the bill was \"full of safeguards\".",
      "Labour former minister Anneliese Dodds was among those to raise fears people could feel under pressure to go through with an assisted death because they do not want to be a \"burden\".",
      "Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier argued doctors should not be allowed to raise the option of assisted dying with patients first.",
      "She told the Commons this \"presents a serious risk that terminally ill patients already highly vulnerable will feel pressured into ending their lives\".",
      "But Conservative MP Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, a former surgeon, said \"highly trained\" medical professionals must be trusted \"to have the difficult and complex conversations that they do every day\".",
      "Several MPs raised concerns people with anorexia could be considered terminally ill and eligible for assisted dying if they refuse to eat or drink.",
      "However, Leadbeater argued this risk was \"negligible\".",
      "\"Not only would someone with severe anorexia be highly unlikely to be assessed to have capacity to make a decision about assisted dying, the other tragic reality is that if a patient was so ill as a result of not eating and drinking for whatever reason, they would die before the process of assisted dying would be able to take place,\" she told MPs.",
      "A proposal from Labour MP Naz Shah would amend the bill so an individual would not meet the requirements for an assisted death \"solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking\".",
      "Leadbeater indicated she would support this but suggested further changes may be needed to make the proposal workable.",
      "Leadbeater's Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle by 330 to 275 votes back in November.",
      "Since then, the bill has gone through six months of intense scrutiny by a parliamentary committee and several changes, including removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off each request for an assisted death. Instead, a panel of experts - including a legal professional, psychiatrist and social worker - would oversee the process.",
      "The issue has split Parliament, with strong opinions on both sides.",
      "Those opposed to assisted dying say the mood has altered among MPs, but so far only a handful have said they have changed their minds since November and it would take dozens to block the bill.",
      "Labour MP Jonathan Hinder is the latest to reveal he will no longer support the bill, saying his concerns have \"deepened\" as it has progressed.",
      "He gave the example of removing the role of a High Court judge as one reason he had changed his mind, adding that more work was needed to make the bill \"practicable and safe\".",

    "story": [
      "Listen to Damian read this article",
      "On a warm morning earlier this month, a group of Metropolitan Police diplomatic protection officers sat in an anteroom off the ornate entrance hall in London's Lancaster House, sipping tea and nibbling chocolate biscuits, while upstairs a core group of European politicians discussed the future of European cooperation.",
      "It was an apt setting: everywhere you look in Lancaster House, there is evidence of the long, entangled histories of the UK and Europe. The double sweep of its grand staircase deliberately echoes the Palace of Versailles. Queen Victoria sat in these rooms listening to Frederic Chopin play the piano in 1848. Tony Blair hosted Russian President Putin here for an energy summit in 2003.",
      "The important issues on the agenda at the Lancaster House meeting, which was hosted by the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, included the latest developments in the war in Ukraine, Europe's response to ensure the continent's security, and \u2013 for the first time since Brexit \u2013 a summit between the UK and the European Union, which will take place on 19 May.",
      "The British government believes it's a significant moment.",
      "Before Brexit, British prime ministers would travel to Brussels four times a year or more for summits with the heads of the EU's institutions and its 27 member states. The haggling would go on late into the night. After Brexit those large summits stopped.",
      "Now, the Labour government, elected last year on a manifesto that promised \"an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners\", envisages new and regular interactions with the EU. Monday's marks the first.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer will host the most senior EU leaders to launch a new \"partnership\".",
      "Pedro Serrano, the EU ambassador to London, has described it as the \"culmination of enhanced contacts at the highest levels since the July 2024 [UK] elections\". But what will it amount to?",
      "Is what's coming a \"surrender summit\" as the Conservatives warn; \"the great British sellout\" undoing bits of Brexit that Reform UK fear; or \"a huge opportunity\" the UK may be about to squander, as Liberal Democrats say? Or could it be an example of how, in Sir Keir Starmer's words, \"serious pragmatism defeats performative politics\" by delivering practical things that will improve people's lives?",
      "Questions around a security pact",
      "In those long, drama-filled nights of 2020, when the then-prime minister Boris Johnson was negotiating Brexit, the possibility of a Security and Defence Partnership was discussed. But the UK's main priority was diverging from Brussels. So nothing was agreed \u2013 a notable omission, some think.",
      "Now a new UK-EU security pact has been worked on for months, the plan is for it to be the centrepiece of what's agreed.",
      "Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, who is overseeing negotiations, was at the early talks at Lancaster House. \"Our relationship has had some difficulties,\" she told me, but \"considering what is going on in the world [\u2026] we need to move forward with this partnership.\"",
      "Yet some think the UK should not seize this outstretched hand.",
      "\"The cornerstone of our defence is Nato,\" Alex Burghart, a Conservative frontbencher, told the Commons this week. \"We know of no reason why Nato is insufficient.\"",
      "Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has his own view. \"There's no value at all,\" he argues. \"We do not want to be constrained by a bungling top-down bureaucratic military structure. Our defence is guaranteed by Nato.\"",
      "The government fires back on that point, arguing that a partnership will in no way undermine Nato; rather it will complement it, they say, because it will stretch to areas beyond defence, like the security of our economies, infrastructure, energy supplies, even migration and transnational crime.",
      "Some industry experts also believe that a security pact could boost the UK economy. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS Group, a UK trade association that represents aerospace, defence and security firms, is among them.",
      "Take, for example, the SAFE (Security Action For Europe) programme that is being set up by the EU, aiming to provide up to \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) in loans for new projects. If the UK strikes a security partnership with the EU, then British weapons manufacturers could potentially access some of that cash.",
      "\"There is a huge amount of interest from European partners,\" says Mr Craven. \"One of the challenges for defence companies in the last couple of years, since the advent of Ukraine, is being able to scale up their own capacity to meet demand.\" He estimates the UK could boost the EU's defence output by a fifth.",
      "The Liberal Democrat's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Calum Miller, similarly believes that a security pact is a huge opportunity for the British defence industry - but, he adds, \"as importantly, it's a new strategic opportunity for the UK to be part of that ongoing conversation about how we arm as a continent\".",
      "Others point out that the UK has already been working with the EU on defence ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2013 at Nato, and most recently via the so-called Coalition of the Willing.",
      "So, in practice, does it make huge amounts of difference to the UK's place in Europe?",
      "No, argues Jill Rutter, a former senior civil servant who is now a senior fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. \"Because relations [on defence] have already been improving quite a long way.\"",
      "Some of those working on the partnership, however, argue that it will set in train new ways for the UK to engage and cooperate with its neighbours.",
      "Delays at the border",
      "More contentious is the UK's desire to sign what's called a 'veterinary' deal to remove some border checks on food and drink. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading these negotiations, told the Commons this week that the objective to lower food and drink costs is in the manifesto, so there is a mandate for it.",
      "Inside the food industry, calls for reform have been growing. Julianne Ponan, whose firm Creative Nature makes vegan snack bars, exports to 18 countries but only a small proportion goes to the EU. She says this is because of the paperwork and inspections since Brexit.",
      "One of her employees had to carry samples in her luggage on a passenger flight to Spain for a meeting to make sure the food wasn't held up at the border, she says.",
      "\"I think this will open up huge opportunities for businesses like mine.\"",
      "It would also make a big difference for Northern Ireland. After Brexit, special arrangements were put in place to keep the land border it shares with the Republic of Ireland free of new impediments. But at the same time, new paperwork and inspections were put in place on food, drink, animals and plants being transported from mainland Britain across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland. They're bitterly opposed by Unionist politicians and complicate life for many businesses.",
      "But a veterinary deal may carry political danger. It would require the UK to align some of its rules on food and drink with EU ones, and move in-step with Brussels over time. And those rules are subject to oversight by EU courts.",
      "\"I call it the surrender summit,\" says Andrew Griffith, the Conservative Shadow Business and Trade Secretary. Under this deal the UK would lose \"our freedom to set our own rules\", he adds.",
      "The Conservatives say they \"fought long and hard\" to \"take back control of our laws, our borders, our money\" \u2013 and that this should not now be reversed.",
      "Step change or 'sell out'?",
      "Reform UK has not held back in its language: \"We think prepare for the Great British sell out. That's the bottom line, and it will be dressed up as a reset,\" Richard Tice says.",
      "\"Why would you want to reset and get closer to a patently failing economic model? The EU is struggling even more than we are. We should be diverging as fast as we can away from that.\"",
      "But Labour's Thomas-Symonds dismisses these views as a \"rehash of the arguments of the past\".",
      "On the other end of the spectrum is the accusation that Sir Keir is far too cautious. Calum Miller of the Liberal Democrats says he knows of businesses \"gnashing their teeth in frustration that they just can't exploit opportunities to work with and trade with Europe\".",
      "His party wants the UK to explore a Customs Union with the EU. It would make moving goods easier, but mean we couldn't sign our own trade deals.",
      "David Henig, a former senior trade negotiator, has been talking to both sides \"hoping to help, to sort of navigate them in\".",
      "\"The summit is a step forward, not a step change,\" he says, \"A slight deepening of the trade ties, rather than something dramatically new.\"",
      "A deal on food and drink checks would deliver very little, he believes, because food and drink is such a limited part of trade. \"If you were, for example, aligning UK and EU rules on industrial products, you'd get a much bigger economic impact\".",
      "Jill Rutter thinks that a veterinary deal would not prove \"economically earth shattering\" \u2013 but if it goes well, she argues that it could provide \"early proof of concept\" for further UK-EU cooperation.",
      "'Tough it out' on fishing?",
      "After Brexit, many British fishermen were disappointed when Boris Johnson's government agreed to let EU boats continue much as before, taking significant catches from UK waters. Those arrangements expire next year. The EU wants them extended.",
      "David Davis who, as Brexit minister, led some of the original negotiations for the UK, told me fishing was \"totemic\" for Brussels. London conceded too easily, he thinks.",
      "\"Europeans got what they wanted first, and then we had a haggle from a weak position.\"",
      "So he adds, \"If I was giving advice to the government, I would say, tough it out\" and use fishing as a lever to seek concessions.",
      "But, as the UK found before, Brussels has cards to play. Much of the fish caught by British fishermen is sold to buyers on the Continent and the UK needs access to that market.",
      "Some EU coastal states, like France and Denmark, are prepared to drive a hard bargain, demanding that London concedes on fishing rights in return for things it wants. Early on, even signing the Security Partnership was being linked to agreement on a fishing deal. The haggling will be tough.",

      "And finally, there's an idea that has prompted much interest in recent months: a youth mobility deal, through which under-30s from the UK and EU could live and work in each other's countries.",
      "For a long time the government said there were \"no plans\" for such a deal \u2013 but earlier this month they changed course, with Labour's Thomas-Symonds saying that \"A smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\".",
      "It's likely that would mean very limited numbers allowed to enter the UK, and only with a visa, for a limited time.",

      "Paula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at Bristol University, argues that public views on immigration are more nuanced than many people think. \"Voters care most about what they perceive as illegal migration \u2013 small boat crossings and so on,\" she says, \"People coming here to study or to work, particularly young people, are not a particular cause for concern\" for most.",
      "\"There will definitely be a group of voters that are upset [about potential deals], but they were never going to vote Labour.\"",
      "Of those who backed Labour in 2024, she adds, about three quarters previously voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. The political risk to the government of signing pacts with the EU is \"smaller than it appears\", she adds.",
      "Conservative pollster Lord Hayward is more cautious \u2013 and is concerned that a deal may pose a \"bear trap\" for the government if it's seen as providing free movement to young Europeans. \"It will provide serious difficulties for them to come to an agreement on something which could easily be portrayed as EU membership 2.0.\"",
      "'Making Brexit work'",
      "Even before Sir Keir's upcoming summit on Monday, his opponents are raising that spectre.",
      "\"All of his muscle memory has been to get closer to the European political union,\" says Mr Griffith. \"I am worried about our prime minister, with that baggage, with those preconceived ideas, [\u2026] trying to negotiate a better deal with the EU.\"",
      "Richard Tice says his party could simply undo any deals with the EU. \"If I'm right about our fears, and we win the next general election, we will just reverse the lot. The whole lot.\"",
      "But Mr Thomas-Symonds is of the view that Monday will show the government is \"not returning to the Customs Union, Single Market, or Freedom of Movement\", all red lines it has pledged not to cross.",

      "The agreement covers a range of issues, including defence, fishing, the trade in food products and the ability of young people to move freely between the UK and the EU.",
      "BBC Verify has gone through the deal, picking out the potential winners and losers.",
      "Food",
      "Winner: UK food exporters to the EU who could see fewer checks",
      "Loser: People who don't want the UK to follow EU rules, as there are strings attached",
      "Since Brexit, UK goods travelling to the EU \u2013 including food products \u2013 have faced new checks and extra paperwork.",
      "Some items, such as UK exports of raw burgers and sausages, have been banned from entering the EU because they do not meet its strict import rules.",
      "UK food exports to the EU have fallen \u2013 with volumes in 2024 down 34% compared with 2019 \u2013 and the industry blames this partly on the added red tape.",
      "Now, both sides have agreed to work on a joint food safety agreement that could remove many of the current barriers.",
      "If signed and fully implemented, it would reduce paperwork, ease checks, and could even lift bans on products like raw meats.",
      "Food and drink exports to the EU in 2023 were worth \u00a314bn, accounting for 57% of all the sector's overseas sales.",
      "But the deal comes with conditions. The UK will need to follow future EU food standards \u2013 a system known as \"dynamic alignment\" \u2013 and accept that the European Court of Justice will have the final say in any disputes in this area.",
      "The UK will also have to make a financial contribution. However it is currently unknown how much this will be and when it will be required.",
      "Fishing",
      "Winner: The EU - fishing vessels get 12 more years of access to UK waters",
      "Loser: UK fishermen who wanted annual negotiations on fishing access",
      "Although fishing accounts for a very small part of the UK economy - just 0.04% of GDP in 2024 - it is politically sensitive.",
      "The \"reset\" document notes \"political agreements leading to full reciprocal access to waters to fish until 30 June 2038\" - a 12-year extension to the current deal negotiated by Boris Johnson's Conservative government - and much longer than expected.",
      "Under the existing agreement (due to expire in 2026), EU vessels get access to UK waters to fish - in return for transferring 25% of their fishing quota - the amount they are allowed to catch - to UK fleets.",
      "The new UK-EU deal at a glance",
      "UK-EU deal moves us on from Brexit rows, Starmer says",
      "Why youth mobility and fishing are key issues ahead of UK/EU summit",
      "Some UK fishing groups have criticised the existing deal and do not want to see it extended.",
      "Elspeth Macdonald, who represents 450 fishing boats as chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation says: \"This deal is a horror show for Scottish fishermen, far worse than Boris Johnson's botched Brexit agreement.\"",
      "She says the long-term deal takes away the industry's bargaining power in future talks and would prefer annual negotiations with the EU.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says there will be \"no increase in the amount that the EU vessels can catch in British waters\" and says it will now be easier for UK fishermen to export their products.",
      "In 2023, the UK exported \u00a31.2bn of fish to the EU, around 70% of all fish exports.",
      "Tavish Scott from Salmon Scotland, which represents salmon farming in Scotland, says the agreement to reduce checks would \"speed up the delivery of our premium salmon to market\".",
      "Youth mobility",
      "Winner: Young people in the UK and EU who should - if this is confirmed - be able to work and study more freely between the two",
      "Loser: Those who oppose an increase in net migration to the UK will point out that any mobility scheme could affect immigration figures, although this effect may be temporary",
      "The details here are still to be confirmed, but the winners would be those young people from both the UK and EU who would be able to work and study more easily across Europe and Great Britain. Other youth mobility schemes have focused on people aged 18 to 30.",
      "However, the impact of what is being called a \"youth experience scheme\" could be uneven.",
      "Before Brexit more young people from the EU came to the UK than went the other way.",
      "And, remember, Sir Keir has pledged to \"significantly\" reduce immigration levels in the coming years. So there's a  big question mark on what impact a UK-EU scheme could have on UK immigration levels.",
      "Madeleine Sumption from Oxford University's Migration Observatory told BBC Verify that a scheme would likely increase net migration in the short term, as new participants arrive.",
      "However, she adds that if everyone left the UK when their visa expired, the long-term impact on migration levels would be minimal.",
      "\"If the UK is worried about the impact, it could phase in the scheme, where it gradually increases the quota. So as people leave, the quota could be raised rather than a big bang all come at once,\" she said.",
      "eGates",
      "Winner: British tourists may be able to use eGates at EU airports but we do not know which ones and from when",
      "Loser: Those expecting to escape long queues this summer",
      "As part of the agreement, UK nationals will be able to use eGates at EU airports, rather than having their passport manually checked by a border officer.",
      "The government claims: \"British holidaymakers will be able to use more eGates in Europe, ending the dreaded queues at border control.\"",
      "However the text of the EU-UK agreement is less clear, only referring to the \"potential use of eGates where appropriate\".",
      "It is unlikely any change will be implemented by the summer, travel organisation Abta told BBC Verify.",
      "Abta believes the deal clarifies that the EU countries can offer eGates to UK nationals once a new Entry/Exit System (EES) comes into effect in October.",
      "EES is an automated IT system for registering all non-EU travellers for a short stay, each time they cross the EU's external borders.",
      "Whether UK passengers will avoid a border guard altogether will depend on the technology at each border crossing, Abta says.",
      "Defence",
      "Winner: UK defence firms may get contracts from new EU rearmament fund",
      "Loser: EU defence firms which hoped to get more of these revenues",
      "The EU has established a Security Action for Europe fund (SAFE) with \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) of loans, backed by the EU budget, to enable its member states to rearm.",
      "This was going to be spent on EU-based defence firms. The fund also allows for the involvement of a number of non-EU countries and could now be opened up to UK defence companies too. This would potentially allow EU firms to use the fund to buy kit from the UK.",
      "The UK has a large defence manufacturing industry relative to many EU states and this sector directly employs about164,00 people in the UK.",
      "Between 2020 and 2024, the UK was estimated by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute to have accounted for around 3.6% of total global annual arms exports, making the UK the seventh largest national exporter.",
      "Again, the detail is still being worked out here and we do not know when and exactly how the UK will participate in the fund.",

      "The two sides have now struck a deal that covers fishing, trade, defence, energy and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas that are still up for negotiation.",
      "For Brussels, this negotiation was a chance to bring Britain \u2013 a major defence power \u2013 closer in a time of geopolitical turbulence.",
      "And to address what some member states see as irritating hangovers from Brexit.",
      "For years, there was a \"don't touch it\" mentality when it came to taking a broad look at the Brexit settlement, according to one EU diplomat.",
      "It all involved \"too much politics\" with fears it could all \"go wrong.\"",
      "Remember, up until the 2023 Windsor Framework agreement, London and Brussels were bogged down in a protracted dispute over trade arrangements for Northern Ireland.",
      "Then, in 2024, a new government won power in the UK - the more EU-friendly Labour Party.",

      "When I checked with one diplomat about that detail, they initially replied with a smiley face emoji.",
      "Another said: \"The deal is balanced\u2014arguably with favourable terms for the EU\u2014and simply shows that splendid isolation is not an option in today's climate.\"",

      "It was, in the end I'm told, quid pro quo. The EU got its fishing deal. In return, it'll be easier for UK businesses to export agri-food products \u2013 although that element hasn't been finalised.",
      "Also yet to be ironed out are the plans for youth mobility \u2013 which would allow young people to study or work more easily between Britain and the EU.",
      "That was a particularly important goal for countries like Germany, anxious to win better access to an English-speaking country with prestigious universities.",
      "Another key point for Berlin was the new defence and security partnership.",
      "Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Donald Trump's unpredictable White House have ripped up the rules on European security.",
      "Time has been something of a healer \u2013 but the events of recent years have also created a sense of urgency.",
      "Better ties with Britain, which remains a major defence player, is a no-brainer \u2013 now more than ever \u2013 for mainland Europe as it tries to scale up investment and capabilities.",
      "Nations like Germany \u2013 which only recently hit the 2% Nato spending target \u2013 are acutely aware that they have been left exposed by the dramatic global developments of recent years.",
      "But, of course, most of this deal is an agreement in principle; a statement of intent on issues also ranging across cyber security, energy and migration.",
      "\"I think it's a good step,\" another EU diplomat told me. \"It's good to test the waters for practical cooperation and what can be done. Let's take it from there.\"",

    "story": [
      "The world's tropical forests, which provide a crucial buffer against climate change, disappeared faster than ever recorded last year, new satellite analysis suggests.",
      "Researchers estimate that 67,000 sq km (26,000 sq mi) of these pristine, old-growth forests were lost in 2024 \u2013 an area nearly as large as the Republic of Ireland, or 18 football pitches a minute.",
      "Fires were the main cause, overtaking land clearances from agriculture for the first time on record, with the Amazon faring particularly badly amid record drought.",
      "There was more positive news in South East Asia, however, with government policies helping to reduce forest loss.",
      "Tropical rainforests store hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon in soils and woody trunks. But this new global record raises further questions about their resilience on a warming planet.",
      "Many researchers are concerned some forests, such as parts of the Amazon, may be approaching a \"tipping point\", beyond which they could fall into irreversible decline.",
      "\"The tipping point idea is, I think, increasingly the right one,\" said Prof Matthew Hansen, co-director of GLAD laboratory at the University of Maryland, which produces the data.",
      "Prof Hansen described the new results as \"frightening\", and warned of the possible \"savannisation\" of the rainforest, where old-growth tropical forests die back and permanently switch to savanna.",
      "\"It's still a theory, but I think that that's more and more plausible looking at the data.\"",
      "A separate study, published last week, made a similar warning of possible significant dieback of the Amazon if global warming exceeds the international target of 1.5C.",
      "This would not only threaten the vibrant array of wildlife living in these most biodiverse habitats, but would also have serious ramifications for the global climate.",
      "Until recently, the Amazon had been doing humanity a favour, absorbing more planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) than it released.",
      "But the burning of these forests emits huge amounts of CO2 \u2013 adding to warming rather than limiting it.",
      "In 2023-24, the Amazon experienced its worst drought on record, fuelled by climate change and the natural warming El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Many fires are started deliberately to clear land for agriculture, making it difficult to disentangle the two.",
      "But the drought provided ideal conditions for fires to spread out of control, with Brazil and Bolivia most badly affected.",
      "While only a single year, it fits the expected pattern of more intense tropical fires in a warming world.",
      "\"I think we are in a new phase, where it's not just the clearing for agriculture that's the main driver,\" said Rod Taylor of the World Resources Institute (WRI), which is also behind the latest report.",
      "\"Now we have this new amplifying effect, which is a real climate change feedback loop, where fires are just much more intense and much more ferocious than they've ever been.\"",
      "In total, the record loss of the world's old-growth (primary) tropical forests released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases, the researchers estimate.",
      "That's roughly the same as the emissions of the European Union.",

      "Countries in South East Asia, however, bucked the global trend.",
      "The area of primary forest loss in Indonesia fell by 11% compared to 2023, for example, despite drought conditions.",
      "This was the result of a concerted effort by governments and communities working together to enforce \"no burning\" laws, according to Elizabeth Goldman, co-director of the Global Forest Watch project at WRI.",
      "\"Indonesia serves as a bright spot in the 2024 data,\" she said.",
      "\"Political will is a key factor of success - it's impossible otherwise,\" agreed Gabriel Labbate, head of climate change mitigation at the United Nations forests programme UNREDD, which was not involved in today's report.",
      "Other countries, including Brazil, have seen success in the past with similar approaches, but started to see losses increase again in 2014 following a change in government policies.",

      "\"The key we haven't seen yet is sustained success in reducing and maintaining low levels of conversion of these ecosystems and if you were interested in conserving the environment you have to win always and forever,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The researchers agree that this year's UN climate summit COP30 - which is being hosted in the Amazon - will be critical for sharing and promoting forest protection schemes.",

      "\"It has never been the Thames Water board's intention to be at odds with the government's ambition to reform the water industry,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Thames has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",

      "Inside a laboratory nestled above the mist of the forests of South Dakota, scientists are searching for the answer to one of science's biggest questions: why does our Universe exist?",
      "They are in a race for the answer with a separate team of Japanese scientists \u2013 who are several years ahead.",
      "The current theory of how the Universe came into being can't explain the existence of the planets, stars and galaxies we see around us. Both teams are building detectors that study a sub-atomic particle called a neutrino in the hope of finding answers.",
      "The US-led international collaboration is hoping the answer lies deep underground, in the aptly named Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune).",
      "The scientists will travel 1,500 metres below the surface into three vast underground caverns. Such is the scale that construction crews and their bulldozers seem like  small plastic toys by comparison.",
      "The science director of this facility, Dr Jaret Heise describes the giant caves as \"cathedrals to science\".",
      "Dr Heise has been involved the construction of these caverns at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (Surf) for nearly ten years. They seal Dune off from the noise and radiation from the world above. Now, Dune is now ready for the next stage.",
      "\"We are poised to build the detector that will change our understanding of the Universe with instruments that will be deployed by a collaboration of more than 1,400 scientists from 35 countries who are eager to answer the question of why we exist,\" he says.",
      "When the Universe was created two kinds of particles were created: matter \u2013 from which stars, planets and everything around us are made \u2013 and, in equal amounts, antimatter, matter's exact opposite.",
      "Theoretically the two should have cancelled each other out, leaving nothing but a big burst of energy. And yet, here we \u2013 as matter \u2013 are.",
      "Scientists believe that the answer to understanding why matter won \u2013\u00a0and we exist \u2013 lies in studying a particle called the neutrino and its antimatter opposite, the anti-neutrino.",
      "They will be firing beams of both kinds of particles from deep underground in Illinois to the detectors at South Dakota, 800 miles away.",
      "This is because as they travel, neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change ever so slightly.",
      "The scientists want to find out whether those changes are different for the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. If they are, it could lead them to the answer of why matter and anti-matter don't cancel each other out.",
      "Dune is an international collaboration, involving 1,400 scientists from thirty countries. Among them is Dr Kate Shaw from Sussex University, who told me that the discoveries in store will be \"transformative\" to our understanding of the Universe and humanity's view of itself.",
      "\"It is really exciting that we are here now with the technology, with the engineering, with the computer software skills to really be able to attack these big questions,\" she said.",
      "Half a world away, Japanese scientists are using shining golden globes to search for the same answers. Gleaming in all its splendour it is like a temple to science, mirroring the cathedral in South Dakota 6,000 miles (9,650 km) away. The scientists are building Hyper-K - which will be a bigger and better version of their existing neutrino detector, Super-K.",
      "The Japanese-led team will be ready to turn on their neutrino beam in less than three years, several years earlier than the American project. Just like Dune, Hyper-K is an international collaboration. Dr Mark Scott of Imperial College, London believes his team is in pole position to make one of the biggest ever discoveries about the origin of the Universe.",
      "\"We switch on earlier and we have a larger detector, so we should have more sensitivity sooner than Dune,\" he says.",
      "Having both experiments running together means that scientists will learn more than they would with just one, but, he says, \"I would like to get there first!\"",
      "But Dr Linda Cremonesi, of Queen Mary University of London, who works for the Dune project, says that getting there first may not give the Japanese-led team the full picture of what is really going on.",
      "\"There is an element of a race, but Hyper K does not have yet all of the ingredients that they need to understand if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos behave differently.\"",
      "The race may be on, but the first results are only expected in a few years' time. The question of just what happened at the beginning of time to bring us into existence remains a mystery \u2013 for now.",

      "Water UK, which represents water companies, said in a statement that firms should be investigated and held to account when necessary.",

      "Thousands of dinosaurs were buried here, killed in an instant on a day of utter devastation.",
      "Now, a group of palaeontologists have come to Pipestone Creek - appropriately nicknamed the \"River of Death\" - to help solve a 72-million-year-old enigma: how did they die?",
      "Trying to work out exactly what happened here starts with the hefty strike of a sledgehammer.",
      "Brute force is needed to crack open the thick layer of rock that covers what Professor Emily Bamforth, who's leading the dig, describes as \"palaeo gold\".",
      "As her team begins the more delicate job of removing the layers of dirt and dust, a jumble of fossilised bones slowly begins to emerge.",
      "\"That big blob of bone right there is, we think, part of a hip,\" Prof Bamforth says, watched on by her dog Aster - whose job today is to bark if she spots any nearby bears.",
      "\"Then here, we have all of these long, skinny bones. These are all ribs. And this is a neat one - it's part of a toe bone. This one here, we have no idea what it is - it's a great example of a Pipestone Creek mystery.\"",
      "BBC News has come to Pipestone Creek to witness the sheer scale of this prehistoric graveyard and see how researchers are piecing together the clues.",
      "Thousands of fossils have been collected from the site, and are constantly generating new discoveries.",
      "The bones all belong to a dinosaur called Pachyrhinosaurus. The species, and Prof Bamforth's excavation, feature in a new landmark BBC series - Walking With Dinosaurs - which uses visual effects and science to bring this prehistoric world to life.",
      "These animals, which lived during the Late Cretaceous period, were a relative of the Triceratops. Measuring about five metres long and weighing two tonnes, the four-legged beasts had large heads, adorned with a distinctive bony frill and three horns. Their defining feature was a big bump on the nose called a boss.",
      "The dig season has just started and lasts each year until autumn. The fossils in the small patch of ground that the team are working on are incredibly tightly packed; Prof Bamforth estimates there are up to 300 bones in every square metre.",
      "So far, her team has excavated an area the size of a tennis court, but the bed of bones extends for a kilometre into the hillside.",
      "\"It's jaw dropping in terms of its density,\" she tells us.",
      "\"It is, we believe, one of the largest bone beds in North America.",
      "\"More than half of the known dinosaur species in the world are described from a single specimen. We have thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus here.\"",
      "Palaeontologists believe the dinosaurs were migrating together in a colossal herd for hundreds of miles from the south - where they had spent the winter - to the north for the summer.",
      "The area, which had a much warmer climate than it does today, would have been covered in rich vegetation, providing abundant food for this enormous group of plant-eating animals.",
      "\"It is a single community of a single species of animal from a snapshot in time, and it's a huge sample size. That almost never happens in the fossil record,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "Bigger beasts offering clues",
      "And this patch of north-western Alberta wasn't just home to Pachyrhinosaurus. Even bigger dinosaurs roamed this land, and studying them is essential to try and understand this ancient ecosystem.",
      "Two hours drive away, we reach the Deadfall Hills. Getting there involves a hike through dense forest, wading - or doggy-paddling in the case of Aster - across a fast-running river, and clambering over slippery rocks.",
      "No digging is required here; super-sized bones lie next to the shoreline, washed out from the rock and cleaned by the flowing water, just waiting to be picked up.",
      "A huge vertebra is quickly spotted, as are bits of ribs and teeth scattered across the mud.",
      "Palaeontologist Jackson Sweder is particularly interested in what looks like a chunk of dinosaur skull. \"Most of what we find here is a duck-billed dinosaur called Edmontosaurus. If this is a skull bone, this is a dinosaur that's large - probably 30ft (10m) long,\" he says.",
      "The Edmontosaurus, another herbivore, roamed the forests like the Pachyrhinosaurus - and is helping palaeontologists build up a picture of this ancient land.",
      "Sweder is the collection manager at the Philip J Currie Dinosaur Museum in nearby Grande Prairie, where the bones from both of these giants are taken to be cleaned up and analysed. He is currently working on a huge Pachyrhinosaurus skull that's about 1.5m long and has been nicknamed \"Big Sam\".",
      "He points to where the three horns should be at the top of the frill, but the one in the middle is missing. \"All\u00a0the skulls that are decently complete have a spike in that spot,\" he says. \"But\u00a0its nice little unicorn spike doesn't seem to be there.\"",
      "Throughout years working at the extraordinary site, the museum team has collected 8,000 dinosaur bones, and the surfaces of the lab are covered in fossils; there are bones from Pachyrhinosaurus of every size, from young to old.",
      "Having material from so many animals allows researchers to learn about dinosaur biology, answering questions about how the species grows and the make-up of the community. They can also look at individual variations, to see how one Pachyrhinosaurus could stand out from the herd \u2013 as may be the case with Big Sam and his missing spike.",
      "A sudden devastating event",
      "All of this detailed research, in the museum and at the two sites, is helping the team to answer the vital question: how did so many animals in Pipestone Creek die at the same time?",
      "\"We believe that this was a herd on a seasonal migration that got tangled up in some catastrophic event that effectively wiped out, if not the entire herd, then a good proportion of it,\" Prof Bamforth says.",
      "All the evidence suggests that this catastrophic event was a flash flood - perhaps a storm over the mountains that sent an unstoppable torrent of water towards the herd, ripping trees from their roots and shifting boulders.",
      "Prof Bamforth says the Pachyrhinosaurus wouldn't have stood a chance. \"These animals are not able to move very fast because of their sheer numbers, and they're very top heavy - and really not very good at swimming at all.\"",
      "Rocks found at the site show the swirls of sediment from the fast-flowing water churning everything up. It's as if the destruction is frozen in time as a wave in the stone.",
      "But this nightmare day for the dinosaurs is now a dream for palaeontologists.",
      "\"We know, every time we come here, it's 100% guaranteed we'll find bones. And every year we discover something new about the species,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "\"That's why we keep coming back, because we're still finding new things.\"",
      "As the team packs up their tools ready to return another day, they know there's a lot of work ahead. They've only just scratched the surface of what's here - and there are many more prehistoric secrets just waiting to be revealed.",

    "story": [
      "Garfield, Puss in Boots,  Aristocats' Toulouse \u2013 cultural icons maybe, ginger most certainly.",
      "And now scientists across two continents have uncovered the DNA mystery that has given our furry friends, particularly males, their notable colour.",
      "They discovered that ginger cats are missing a section of their genetic code, which means the cells responsible for their skin, eye and fur tone produce lighter colours.",
      "The breakthrough has brought delight to the scientists but also the thousands of cat lovers that originally crowdfunded the research.",
      "The scientists hope solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange coloured cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions.",
      "It has been known for decades that it is genetics that gives orange tabby cats their distinctive colouring, but exactly where in the genetic code has evaded scientists till now.",
      "Two teams of scientists at Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have now revealed the mystery in simultaneous papers published on Thursday.",
      "What the teams found was that in the cells responsible for giving a cat its skin, hair follicles and eyes their colour - melanocytes - one gene, ARHGAP36, was much more active.",
      "Genes are made up of pieces of DNA which give instructions to a cat's cells, like other living creatures, on how to function.",
      "By comparing the DNA from dozens of cats with and without orange fur they found that those with ginger colouring had a section of DNA code missing within this ARHGAP36 gene.",
      "Without this DNA the activity of the ARHGAP36 is not suppressed i.e. it is more active. The scientists believe that the gene instructs those melanocytes to produce lighter pigment.",
      "Ginger cats mostly male",
      "For decades scientists have observed that cats with completely ginger colouring are far more likely to be male. This tallies with the fact that the gene is carried on the X chromosome.",
      "Chromosomes are larger sections of DNA, and male cats like other mammals have an X and a Y chromosome, which carry different number of genes.",
      "As it is a gene only on the X chromosome, in this case controlling the pigment production, then one missing piece of DNA is enough to turn a cat fully ginger.",
      "In comparison female cats have two X chromosomes so the DNA needs to be missing in both chromosomes to increase lighter pigment production to the same extent - it means a mixed colouring is more likely.",
      "\"These ginger and black patches form because, early in development, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly switched off,\" explains Prof Hiroyuki Sasaki, geneticist at Kyushu University.",
      "\"As cells divide, this creates areas with different active coat colour genes, resulting in distinct patches.\"",
      "Although couched in science, the study originally started off as a passion project for Professor Sasaki.",
      "He had retired from his university post, but as a cat lover said he wanted to continue working to uncover the orange cat gene in the hope it could \"contribute to the overcoming of cat diseases\".",
      "He and his team raised 10.6m yen (\u00a355,109) via crowdfunding for the research from thousands of fellow cat lovers across Japan and the world.",
      "One contributor wrote: \"We are siblings in the first and third grades of elementary school. We donated with our pocket money. Use it for research on calico cats.\"",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is also active in many other areas of the body including the brain and hormonal glands, and is considered important for development.",
      "The researchers think it is possible that the DNA mutation in the gene could cause other changes in these parts of the body linked to health conditions or temperament.",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is found in humans and has been linked to skin cancer and hair loss.",
      "\"Many cat owners swear by the idea that different coat colours and patterns are linked with different personalities,\" said Prof Sasaki.",

    "story": [
      "The world could see hugely damaging sea-level rise of several metres or more over the coming centuries even if the ambitious target of limiting global warming to 1.5C is met, scientists have warned.",
      "Nearly 200 countries have pledged to try to keep the planet's warming to 1.5C, but the researchers warn that this should not be considered \"safe\" for coastal populations.",
      "They drew their conclusion after reviewing the most recent studies of how the ice sheets are changing - and how they have changed in the past.",
      "But the scientists stress that every fraction of a degree of warming that can be avoided would still greatly limit the risks.",
      "The world's current trajectory puts the planet on course for nearly 3C of warming by the end of the century, compared with the late 1800s, before humans began burning large amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels. That's based on current government policies to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels and other polluting activities.",
      "But even keeping to 1.5C would still lead to continued melting of Greenland and Antarctica, as temperature changes can take centuries to have their full impact on such large masses of ice, the researchers say.",
      "\"Our key message is that limiting warming to 1.5C would be a major achievement - it should absolutely be our target - but in no sense will it slow or stop sea-level rise and melting ice sheets,\" said lead author Prof Chris Stokes, a glaciologist at Durham University.",
      "The 2015 Paris climate agreement saw the world's nations agree to keep global temperature rises \"well below\" 2C - and ideally 1.5C.",
      "That has often been oversimplified to mean 1.5C is \"safe\", something glaciologists have cautioned against for years.",
      "The authors of the new paper, published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment, draw together three main strands of evidence to underline this case.",
      "First, records of the Earth's distant past suggest significant melting \u2013 with sea levels several metres higher than present - during previous similarly warm periods, such as 125,000 years ago.",
      "And the last time there was as much planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as today - about 3 million years ago - sea levels were about 10-20m higher.",
      "Second, current observations already show an increasing rate of melting, albeit with variation from year to year.",
      "\"Pretty dramatic things [are] happening in both west Antarctica and Greenland,\" said co-author Prof Jonathan Bamber, director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre.",
      "East Antarctica appears, for now at least, more stable.",
      "\"We're starting to see some of those worst case scenarios play out almost in front of us,\" added Prof Stokes.",
      "Finally, scientists use computer models to simulate how ice sheets may respond to future climate. The picture they paint isn't good.",
      "\"Very, very few of the models actually show sea-level rise slowing down [if warming stabilises at 1.5C], and they certainly don't show sea-level rise stopping,\" said Prof Stokes.",
      "The major concern is that melting could accelerate further beyond \"tipping points\" due to warming caused by humans - though it's not clear exactly how these mechanisms work, and where these thresholds sit.",
      "\"The strength of this study is that they use multiple lines of evidence to show that our climate is in a similar state to when several metres of ice was melted in the past,\" said Prof Andy Shepherd, a glaciologist at Northumbria University, who was not involved in the new publication.",
      "\"This would have devastating impacts on coastal communities,\" he added.",
      "An estimated 230 million people live within one metre of current high tide lines.",
      "Defining a \"safe\" limit of warming is inherently challenging, because some populations are more vulnerable than others.",
      "But if sea-level rise reaches a centimetre a year or more by the end of the century - mainly because of ice melt and warming oceans - that could stretch even rich countries' abilities to cope, the researchers say.",
      "\"If you get to that level, then it becomes extremely challenging for any kind of adaptation strategies, and you're going to see massive land migration on scales that we've never witnessed [in modern civilisation],\" argued Prof Bamber.",
      "However, this bleak picture is not a reason to stop trying, they say.",
      "\"The more rapid the warming, you'll see more ice being lost [and] a higher rate of sea-level rise much more quickly,\" said Prof Stokes.",

      "Centrica - which owns British Gas - says the site is set to lose \u00a3100m this year, and it wants to invest \u00a32bn in the facility so it can use it to store more gas, including hydrogen.",
      "The government said the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica but it was open to discussing proposals.",
      "The Rough facility is off the coast of East Yorkshire, and accounts for about half of the capacity the UK has to store gas.",
      "It was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Earlier this month, Centrica said it was in \"constructive discussions\" with the government for a support mechanism that would allow investment in the Rough site to proceed.",
      "The company is seeking a \"cap and floor\" pricing mechanism. This means that if energy prices fall below a certain level its revenues will be topped up, but prices would be capped if they rise too high.",
      "\"What we're asking for is simply for the government to help create the conditions which will unlock \u00a32bn of investment,\" Mr O'Shea told the BBC.",
      "\"It will create thousands of jobs in the construction phase, and it will safeguard the jobs of very highly skilled colleagues that are offshore.\"",
      "Without this investment he said the site would be decommissioned \"and we'll lose this resilience\".",
      "He said the UK currently has 12 days of gas storage, of which Rough provides six.",
      "\"So if we don't have Rough anymore, then we go down to six days. Now, if we take Rough to full capacity, we will go up to about 25, or 30 days.\"",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said while the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica, \"we remain open to discussing proposals on gas storage sites, as long as it provides value for money for taxpayers\".",
      "UK has enough gas, says network after storage warning",
      "If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?",
      "Last week, Mr O'Shea said the way that the energy pricing mechanism worked meant that building of renewables would not \"materially\" reduce UK electricity prices from current levels.",
      "He told Laura Kuenssberg on a visit to the North Sea platform that decarbonisation was important and also a \"huge economic opportunity\".",
      "However he added that \"the price we see today for electricity is the same as the price that we're given to new renewable developments\".",
      "\"Therefore, that new renewable development will not bring down the price.\"",
      "He added that he thought the government's 2030 target for clean energy was \"very challenging, but I think it's right that the energy secretary has set a very stretching target\".",
      "\"It's not impossible, no, but it's not easy.\"",
      "The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \"As shown by the National Energy System Operator's independent report, our mission for clean power by 2030 is achievable and will deliver a more secure energy system, which could see a lower cost of electricity and lower bills.\"",
      "Pay row",
      "Last year, Mr O'Shea told the BBC that the \u00a34.5m pay he received the previous year was \"impossible to justify\".",
      "And earlier this month, nearly 40% of Centrica's shareholders voted against the company's latest pay plans.",
      "When asked about this by Laura Kuenssberg, Mr O'Shea said: \"I don't set my own pay.",
      "\"I think it's really difficult,\" he said. \"I am unbelievably fortunate. I have a job where the market rate is is more than ever thought I would have done.\""

    "story": [
      "Detectives investigating cyber attacks on UK retailers are focussing on a notorious cluster of cyber criminals known to be young English-speakers, some of them teenagers, police have revealed.",
      "For weeks speculation has mounted that disruptive attacks on M&S, Co-op, Harrods and some US retailers could be the work of a hacking community called Scattered Spider.",
      "Speaking about the hacks for the first time, the National Crime Agency (NCA) has told BBC News the group is a key part of its ongoing investigation to find the culprits.",
      "\"We are looking at the group that is publicly known as Scattered Spider, but we've got a range of different hypotheses and we'll follow the evidence to get to the offenders,\" Paul Foster, head of the NCA's national cyber crime unit, said in a new BBC documentary.",
      "\"In light of all the damage that we're seeing, catching whoever is behind these attacks is our top priority,\" he added.",
      "The wave of attacks, which began at Easter, have resulted in empty shelves in stores, the suspension of online ordering, and millions of people's private data being stolen.",
      "The hacks have been carried out using DragonForce, a platform that gives criminals the tools to carry out ransomware attacks. However, the hackers pulling the strings have still not been identified and no arrests have been made.",
      "Some cyber experts say the hackers display the traits of Scattered Spider, a loose community of often young individuals who organise across sites like Discord, Telegram and in forums, most likely located in the UK and US.",
      "Although the NCA says it is exploring all parts of the cyber crime ecosystem, it too is looking in the same direction.",
      "\"We know that Scattered Spider are largely English-speaking but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the UK - we know that they communicate online amongst themselves in a range of different platforms and channels, which is, I guess, key to their ability to then be able to operate as a collective,\" Mr Foster said.",
      "M&S has been hit with ransomware, which has scrambled the company's servers rendering computer systems useless. The high street giant is still struggling to keep shelves stocked and has halted online shopping for weeks. Hackers have also stolen customer and employee data from the company.",
      "At Co-op, staff took systems offline to prevent a ransomware infection but a huge amount of customer and staff data was stolen and is being held to ransom. Operations at the firm's supermarkets, insurance offices and funeral services have been badly affected.",
      "It is not known what is happening at Harrods but the company admitted it had to pull computer systems offline because of an attempted cyber attack.",
      "When the hackers behind the M&S and Co-op attacks anonymously contacted the BBC last week, they declined to say whether or not they were Scattered Spider.",
      "'Tools readily available'",
      "Cyber security researchers at CrowdStrike formed the name \"Scattered Spider\" because of the group's sporadic nature, but other cyber companies have given the cluster nicknames including Octo Tempest and Muddled Libra.",
      "The group was also linked to high-profile attacks including on two US casinos in 2023 and Transport for London last year.",
      "And in November, the US charged five British and American men and boys in their twenties and teens for alleged Scattered Spider activity. One is 23-year-old Scottish man Tyler Buchanan, who has not made a plea, and the rest are US based.",
      "NCA investigators will not say how the retail hackers have managed to breach victim organisations but earlier this month, the National Cyber Security Centre issued guidance to organisations urging them to review their IT help desk password reset processes.",
      "\"Calling up IT help desks is a tactic that Scattered Spider seems to favour and they use social engineering techniques to manipulate someone into doing something like clicking on a link or resetting someone's account to a password they can use,\" Lisa Forte, from cyber security firm Red Goat, explained.",
      "In the BBC documentary, a former teen hacker who was arrested nine years ago and now works in cyber security, said he was not surprised that teenagers could be behind the hacks.",
      "\"It wouldn't surprise me - quite [the] opposite. The tools are readily available and it's very easy to jump online and search straight away. You can feel a bit untouchable but for what end? You're gonna be arrested 99% of the time,\" he said.",

Character.ai itself tells its users: \"This is an AI chatbot and not a real person. Treat everything it says as fiction. What is said should not be relied upon as fact or advice.\"",
      "But in extreme examples chatbots have been accused of giving harmful advice.",
      "Character.ai is currently the subject of legal action from a mother whose 14-year-old son took his own life after reportedly becoming obsessed with one of its AI characters. According to transcripts of their chats in court filings he discussed ending his life with the chatbot.

An estimated one million people are also waiting to access mental health services, and private therapy can be prohibitively expensive (costs vary greatly, but the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy reports on average people spend \u00a340 to \u00a350 an hour).",
      "At the same time, AI has revolutionised healthcare in many ways, including helping to screen, diagnose and triage patients. There is a huge spectrum of chatbots, and about 30 local NHS services now use one called Wysa.",
      "Experts express concerns about chatbots around potential biases and limitations, lack of safeguarding and the security of users' information. But some believe that if specialist human help is not easily available, chatbots can be a help. So with NHS mental health waitlists at record highs, are chatbots a possible solution?",

These are trained on vast amounts of data \u2013 whether that's websites, articles, books or blog posts - to predict the next word in a sequence. From here, they predict and generate human-like text and interactions.",
      "The way mental health chatbots are created varies, but they can be trained in practices such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which helps users to explore how to reframe their thoughts and actions. They can also adapt to the end user's preferences and feedback.",
      "Hamed Haddadi, professor of human-centred systems at Imperial College London, likens these chatbots to an \"inexperienced therapist\", and points out that humans with decades of experience will be able to engage and \"read\" their patient based on many things, while bots are forced to go on text alone.",
      "\"They [therapists] look at various other clues from your clothes and your behaviour and your actions and the way you look and your body language and all of that. And it's very difficult to embed these things in chatbots.\"",
      "Another potential problem, says Prof Haddadi, is that chatbots can be trained to keep you engaged, and to be supportive, \"so even if you say harmful content, it will probably cooperate with you\". This is sometimes referred to as a 'Yes Man' issue, in that they are often very agreeable.",
      "And as with other forms of AI, biases can be inherent in the model because they reflect the prejudices of the data they are trained on.",
      "Prof Haddadi points out counsellors and psychologists don't tend to keep transcripts from their patient interactions, so chatbots don't have many \"real-life\" sessions to train from. Therefore, he says they are not likely to have enough training data, and what they do access may have biases built into it which are highly situational.",

      "\"These kinds of things really make me wonder about the human connection that is so often needed in counselling,\" she says.",
      "\"Sometimes just being there with someone is all that is needed, but that is of course only achieved by someone who is also an embodied, living, breathing human being.\"",
      "Kelly ultimately started to find responses the chatbot gave unsatisfying.",

      "While limited self-driving technology is already permitted on UK roads, a human driver must be at the wheel and responsible for the vehicle, even if automated technology is being used.",
      "With some companies trialling more advanced tech on British streets, I took an automated car ride across central London in a car using a system developed by UK AI firm Wayve.",
      "\"We're ready to launch robotaxis in the UK as soon as the regulatory environment is ready for us,\" said Andrew Macdonald, senior vice president of mobility at Uber, who joined me for the ride.",

      "Even though there is no driver to pay, Uber says the fare is currently the same as a ride with a human behind the wheel.",
      "The option to take one appears on the app if one is available, and customers can opt in or out.",
      "That's partly because, aside from the regulatory environment, another potential barrier to their uptake is the public's reticence about travelling in a self-driving vehicle.",
      "A poll by YouGov in 2024 suggested that 37% of Brits would feel \"very unsafe\" travelling in a car without a driver.",

    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 21:55:21 GMT",
    "summary": "An exclusive look inside the closely guarded factory the president wants to become a foundation stone for a US golden age.",
    "story": [
      "Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world.",
      "The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips.",
      "It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made on the island of Taiwan, which is 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC.",
      "Its Arizona facility \"Fab 21\" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing.",
      "They're hugely protective of the secrets that lie within. Important customers, such as Apple and Nvidia, trust this company to safeguard their designs for future products.",
      "But after months of asking, TSMC let the BBC in to look at the partial transfer of what some argue is the most critical, expensive, complex and important manufacturing in the world.",
      "The poster child for Trump's policy",
      "President Trump certainly seems to think so. He often mentions the factory in passing. \"TSMC is the biggest there is,\" he has said. \"We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us.\" This is one of the US president's regular refrains.",
      "TSMC's recent decision to expand its investments in the US by a further $100bn (\u00a375bn) is something Trump attributes to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan and on the global semiconductor business.",
      "The expansion of the Arizona facility, which was announced in March is, he believes, the poster child for his economic policies - in particular the encouragement of foreign companies to relocate factories to the US to avoid hefty tariffs.",
      "China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its \"Silicon Shield\", against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk.",
      "China claims the self-ruled Taiwan as its territory but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland.",
      "So, many currents of the world economy, frontier technology and geopolitics flow through this one site and within it lies the essential contradiction of Trump's economic and diplomatic policy.",
      "He sees this plant as the exemplar of America First, and the preservation of economic and military superiority over China. Yet the manufacture of these modern miniaturised miracles at the frontier of physics and chemistry inherently relies on a combination of the very best technologies from around the world.",
      "The cleanest environment on Earth",
      "Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. \"I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,\" he says.",
      "\"It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering.\"",
      "Inside the \"Gowning Building\", workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything.",
      "Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as \"4 nanometre chips\".",
      "\"This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,\" he explains. \"[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is 3,000 to 4,000 steps.\"",
      "If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers.",
      "Manufacturing manipulation of atoms",
      "TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips, manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful.",
      "Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence.",
      "It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of \"extreme ultraviolet (UV) light\". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called \"lithography\".",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "Trump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on Asia",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",
      "The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona.",
      "These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors.",
      "The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed.",
      "\"Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,\" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. \"The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms.\"",
      "Caution in Taiwan",
      "Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life.",
      "Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies.",
      "He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim.",
      "Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden's Chips Act.",
      "On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying \"a future Made in America\".",
      "\"The semiconductor supply chain is global,\" says TSMC Arizona President Rose Castanares. \"There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly.\"",
      "'Non-Red' supply chains to counter China",
      "As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges.",
      "That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products.",
      "The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs.",
      "There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China.",
      "Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try to limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban on exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop \"non-Red\" supply chains to counter China.",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology. And Bill Gates this week said that these policies \"have forced the Chinese in terms of chip manufacturing and everything to go full speed ahead\".",
      "Trump wants TSMC Arizona to become a foundation stone for his American golden age. But the company's story to date is perhaps the ultimate expression of the success of modern globalisation.",
      "So for now, it's a battle for global tech and economic supremacy, in which Taiwan's factory technology, some of which is now being moved to the Arizona desert, is the critical asset.",

    "summary": "The US-China trade \"reset\" could stall the manufacturing investment coming into India, say experts.",
    "story": [
      "Just as India showed flickers of progress toward its long-held dream of becoming the world's factory, Washington and Beijing announced a trade \"reset\" that could derail Delhi's ambitions to replace China as the global manufacturing hub.",
      "Last week, Trump's tariffs on China dropped overnight - from 145% to 30%, vs 27% for India - as the two sides thrashed out an agreement in Switzerland.",
      "As a result, there's a chance manufacturing investment that was moving from China to India could either \"stall\" or \"head back\", feels Ajay Srivastava of the Delhi-based think tank, Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI).",
      "\"India's low-cost assembly lines may survive, but value-added growth is in danger.\"",
      "The change in sentiment stands in sharp relief to the exuberance in Delhi last month when Apple indicated that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India.",
      "That may well still happen, even though US President Donald Trump revealed that he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook not to build in India because it was \"one of the highest tariff nations in the world\".",
      "\"India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,\" Shilan Shah, an economist with Capital Economics, wrote in an investor note before the deal was announced. He pointed out that 40% of India's exports to the US were \"similar to those exported by China\".",
      "There were early signs that Indian exporters were already stepping in to fill the gap left by Chinese producers. New export orders surged to a 14-year high, according to a recent survey of Indian manufacturers.",
      "Nomura, a Japanese broking house, also pointed to growing \"anecdotal evidence\" of India emerging as a winner from \"trade diversion and supply-chain shift in low and mid-tech manufacturing\" particularly in sectors like electronics, textiles and toys.",
      "Some analysts do believe that despite the so-called trade \"reset\" between Beijing and Washington, a larger strategic decoupling between China and the US will continue to benefit India in the long run.",
      "For one, there's greater willingness by Narendra Modi's government to open its doors to foreign companies after years of protectionist policies, which could provide tailwind.",
      "India and the US are also negotiating a trade deal that could put Asia's third-largest economy in a sweet spot to benefit from the so-called \"China exodus\" - as global firms shift operations to diversify supply chains.",
      "India has just signed a trade pact with the UK, sharply cutting duties in protected sectors like whiskey and automobiles. It offers a glimpse of the concessions Delhi might offer Trump in the ongoing India-US trade talks.",
      "But all of this optimism needs to be tempered for more reasons than one.",
      "Apart from the fact that China is now back in the running, companies are also \"not entirely writing off other Asian competitors, with countries like Vietnam still on their radars\", economists Sonal Verma and Aurodeep Nandi from Nomura said in a note earlier this month.",
      "\"Hence, for India to capitalise on this opportunity, it needs to complement any tariff arbitrage with serious ease-of-doing-business reforms.\"",
      "A tough business climate has long frustrated foreign investors and stalled India's manufacturing growth, with its share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stuck at around 15% for two decades.",
      "The Modi government's efforts, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, have delivered only limited success in boosting this figure.",
      "The government's think tank, Niti Aayog, has acknowledged India's \"limited success\" in attracting investment shifting from China. It noted that factors like cheaper labour, simpler tax laws, lower tariffs, and proactive Free Trade Agreements helped countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia expand exports - while India lagged behind.",
      "Another major concern, says Nomura, is India's ongoing reliance on China for raw materials and components used in electronics like iPhones, limiting Delhi's ability to fully capitalise on supply chain shifts.",
      "\"India's earnings from making iPhones will only rise if more of the phone is made locally,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.",
      "According to him, right now Apple earns over $450 per iPhone sold in the US while India keeps less than $25 - even though the full $1,000 is counted as an Indian export.",
      "\"Just assembling more iPhones in India won't help much unless Apple and its suppliers also start making components and doing high-value work here. Without that, India's share stays small, and the export numbers go up only on paper -possibly triggering more scrutiny from the US without real economic gain for India,\" Mr Srivastava said.",
      "The jobs created by such assembly lines aren't very high quality either, says GTRI.",
      "Quite unlike companies like Nokia which set up a factory in the southern city of Chennai in 2007 where suppliers moved in together, \"today's smartphone makers mostly import parts and push for lower tariffs instead of building supply chains in India\", explained Mr Srivastava. He noted that, in certain instances, the investment made could be lower than the subsidies received under India's PLI scheme.",
      "Finally there are concerns that Chinese exporters could try to use India to reroute products to the US.",
      "India doesn't seem averse to this idea despite the pitfalls. The country's top economic adviser said last year that the country should attract more Chinese businesses to set-up export oriented factories and boost its manufacturing industry \u2013 a tacit admission that its own industrial policy hadn't delivered.",
      "But experts caution, this could further curtail India's ability to build local know-how and grow its own industrial base.",
      "All of this shows that beyond the headline-grabbing announcements by the likes of Apple, India is still a long way from realising its factory ambitions.",
      "\"Slash production costs, fix logistics, and build regulatory certainty,\" Mr Srivastava urged policymakers in a social media post.",
      "\"Let's be clear. This US-China reset is damage control, not a long-term solution. India must play the long game, or risk getting side-lined.\"",

    "summary": "BBC's Joe Tidy spoke directly to those who claim they are responsible for hacking M&amp;S and Co-op.",
    "story": [
      "Almost daily, my phone pings with messages from hackers of all stripes.",
      "The good, the bad, the not-so-sure.",
      "I've been reporting on cyber security for more than a decade, so I know that many of them like to talk about their hacks, findings and escapades.",
      "About 99% of these conversations stay firmly locked in my chat logs and don't lead to news stories. But a recent ping was impossible to ignore.",
      "\"Hey. This is Joe Tidy from the BBC reporting on this Co-op news, correct?\" the hackers messaged me on Telegram.",
      "\"We have some news for you,\" they teased.",
      "When I cautiously asked what this was, the people behind the Telegram account - which had no name or profile picture - gave me the inside track on what they claimed to have done to M&S and the Co-op, in cyber attacks that caused mass disruption.",
      "Through messages back-and-forth over the next five hours, it became clear to me that these apparent hackers were fluent English speakers and although they claimed to be messengers, it was obvious they were closely linked to - if not intimately involved in - the M&S and Co-op hacks.",
      "They shared evidence proving that they had stolen a huge amount of private customer and employee information.",
      "I checked out a sample of the data they had given me - and then securely deleted it.",
      "Messages that confirmed suspicions",
      "They were clearly frustrated that Co-op wasn't giving in to their ransom demands but wouldn't say how much money in Bitcoin they were demanding of the retailer in exchange for the promise that they wouldn't sell or give away the stolen data.",
      "After a conversation with the BBC's Editorial Policy team, we decided that it was in the public interest to report that they had provided us with evidence proving that they were responsible for the hack.",
      "I quickly contacted the press team at the Co-op for comment, and within minutes the firm, who had initially downplayed the hack, admitted to employees, customers and the stock market about the significant data breach.",
      "Much later, the hackers sent me a long angry and offensive letter about Co-op's response to their hack and subsequent extortion, which revealed that the retailer narrowly dodged a more severe hack by intervening in the chaotic minutes after its computer systems were infiltrated. The letter and conversation with the hackers confirmed what experts in the cyber security world had been saying since this wave of attacks on retailers began \u2013 the hackers were from a cyber crime service called DragonForce.",
      "Who are DragonForce, you might be asking? Based on our conversations with the hackers and wider knowledge, we have some clues.",
      "DragonForce offers cyber criminal affiliates various services on their darknet site in exchange for a 20% cut of any ransoms collected. Anyone can sign up and use their malicious software to scramble a victim's data or use their darknet website for their public extortion.",
      "This has become the norm in organised cyber crime; it's known as ransomware-as-a-service.",
      "The most infamous of recent times has been a service called LockBit, but this is all but defunct now partly because it was cracked by the police last year.",
      "Following the dismantling of such groups, a power vacuum has emerged. Cue a tussle for dominance in this underground world, leading to some rival groups innovating their offerings.",
      "Power struggle ensues",
      "DragonForce recently rebranded itself as a cartel offering even more options to hackers including 24/7 customer support, for example.",
      "The group had been advertising its wider offering since at least early 2024 and has been actively targeting organisations since 2023, according to cyber experts like Hannah Baumgaertner, Head of Research at Silobreaker, a cyber risk protection company.",
      "\"DragonForce's latest model includes features such as administration and client panels, encryption and ransomware negotiation tools, and more,\" Ms Baumgaertner said.",
      "As a stark illustration of the power-struggle, DragonForce's darknet website was recently hacked and defaced by a rival gang called RansomHub, before re-emerging about a week ago.",
      "\"Behind the scenes of the ransomware ecosystem there seems to be some jostling - that might be for prime 'leader' position or just to disrupt other groups in order to take more of the victim share,\" said Aiden Sinnott, senior threat researcher from the cyber security company Sophos.",
      "Who is pulling the strings?",
      "DragonForce's prolific modus operandi is to post about its victims, as it has done 168 times since December 2024 - a London accountancy firm, an Illinois steel maker, an Egyptian investment firm are all included. Yet so far, DragonForce has remained silent about the retail attacks.",
      "Normally radio silence about attacks indicates that a victim organisation has paid the hackers to keep quiet. As neither DragonForce, Co-op nor M&S have commented on this point, we don't know what might be happening behind the scenes.",
      "Establishing who the people are behind DragonForce is tricky, and it's not known where they are located. When I asked their Telegram account about this, I didn't get an answer. Although the hackers didn't tell me explicitly that they were behind the recent hacks on M&S and Harrods, they confirmed a report in Bloomberg that spelt it out.",
      "Of course, they are criminals and could be lying.",
      "Some researchers say DragonForce are based in Malaysia, while others say Russia, where many of these groups are thought to be located.  We do know that DragonForce has no specific targets or agenda other than making money.",
      "And if DragonForce is just the service for other criminals to use \u2013 who is pulling the strings and choosing to attack UK retailers?",
      "In the early stages of the M&S hack, unknown sources told cyber news site Bleeping Computer that evidence is pointing to a loose collective of cyber criminals known as Scattered Spider - but this has yet to be confirmed by the police.",
      "Scattered Spider is not really a group in the normal sense of the word. It's more of a community which organises across sites like Discord, Telegram and forums \u2013 hence the description \"scattered\" which was given to them by cyber security researchers at CrowdStrike.",
      "They are known to be English-speaking and probably in the UK and the US and young \u2013 in some cases teenagers. We know this from researchers and previous arrests. In November the US charged five men and boys in their twenties and teens for alleged Scattered Spider activity. One of them is 22-year-old Scottish man Tyler Buchanan, who has not made a plea, and the rest are US based.",
      "Crackdowns by police seem to have had little effect on the hackers' determination, though. On Thursday, Google's cyber security division issued warnings that it was starting to see Scattered Spider-like attacks on US retailers now too.",
      "As for the hackers I spoke to on Telegram, they declined to answer whether or not they were Scattered Spider. \"We won't answer that question\" is all they said.",
      "Perhaps in a nod to the immaturity and attention-seeking nature of the hackers, two of them said they wanted to be known as \"Raymond Reddington\" and \"Dembe Zuma\" after characters from US crime thriller The Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a blacklist.",
      "In a message to me, they boasted: \"We're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist.\"",

      "For outdoor workers, even a 20-minute break from the heat and humidity, such as in well-designed cooling stations, can make a difference.",
      "But beyond this, active cooling will become increasingly critical as temperatures continue to rise due to climate change.",
      "Morgan Stanley is predicting that the annual growth rate of the cooling market, already worth $235bn (\u00a3180bn) a year, could more than double by 2030.",
      "Yet existing cooling devices have serious drawbacks. One issue the refrigerant - the fluid that transitions back and forth from liquid to gas, in a process that transfers heat.",
      "It's common for them to leak from standard systems, harming both efficiency and potentially health.",
      "The refrigerants typically used in cooling today are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a group of synthetic gases with high global warming potential. HFCs are much more potent than carbon dioxide.",
      "So one option is to replace the refrigerants with more climate-friendly versions. But the candidates with the lower global warming potential, also have problems.",
      "For instance, propane is highly flammable. Ammonia is toxic. Carbon dioxide works at high pressures, requiring specialised equipment.",

      "RMI has identified between 10 and 20 start-ups working on early versions of solid-state cooling devices.",
      "One of those startups is the German company Magnotherm, which uses magnets. Certain materials change temperature when exposed to magnetic fields.",
      "\"With our technology, it's inherently safe because it's not toxic, it's a metal, and we operate at very low pressures,\" according to Timur Sirman, the CEO and cofounder of Magnotherm.",
      "The idea of magnetocaloric cooling has been around for years, but commercialising it is relatively new. Magnotherm has built about 40 beverage coolers, and about five refrigerators, in what is so far a manual and in-house process.",
      "The permanent magnets are the most expensive part of the technology, Mr Sirman reports. \"But it never breaks, so we can always reuse this quite cost-intensive component.\"",
      "The company is seeking out alternative sources of magnetic fields, as well as optimising materials, as they aim to dramatically increase the cooling capacity of their devices.",
      "Mr Sirman believes that if you account for the efficiency and health issues of refrigerants, like leakages, Magnotherm products can compete on price. \"We are not targeting customers who are only looking at initial cost.\"",
      "He acknowledges that for now the company's beverage coolers are quite pricey. Their customers tend to be early adopters of new technologies.",
      "Another technology under development is thermoelectric cooling.",
      "This involves moving heat between two sides of a device. With the application of electrical energy, heat is transferred in the direction of the current.",
      "A notable thermoelectric start-up is Phononic, which is based in the US and has an additional manufacturing facility in Thailand.",
      "Millions of Phononic cooling devices are now in use, including in data centres, supermarkets and other buildings.",
      "Their cooling devices are built in a similar way to computer chips, using semiconducting materials to transfer the heat.",
      "\"Our chips are really thin, really small, but they get really cold. They consume a small amount of electricity in generating that coldness, but they pack one hell of a punch,\" says Tony Atti, the CEO of Phononic.",
      "He says that, to work at their best, traditional fridges need to be run all the time.",
      "But  thermoelectric devices can be easily switched on off. This helps to reduce the costs, energy use and space requirements.",
      "\"We like to present the coolness on demand where you need it,\" says Mr Atti.",
      "Another advantage is that thermoelectric cooling can operate silently. \"That's because there's zero moving parts,\" Ms Rasmussen explains. \"The heat is occurring because of the reaction in the material level.\"",
      "In contrast, standard vapour compression systems contain pumps, condensers and expanders for refrigerant, which all generate much of the noise.",
      "A different type of solid-state cooling is elastocaloric cooling. This achieves temperature changes through mechanical stress to elastocaloric materials, which can cool down or heat up with the application of stress.",
      "Researchers in four European countries are collaborating on SMACool, an elastocaloric air conditioner that uses metal tubes made from specific metallic alloys.",
      "At the moment, elastocaloric prototypes have much lower cooling capacity than commercial air conditioning. And the maximum possible efficiency of SMACool is still lower than that of conventional air conditioning, although the aim is to beat the energy efficiency of A/C.",
      "However, progress is continuing. A team led by Hong Kong researchers recently created an A/C alternative that achieved a cooling power of 1,284W\u2014the first time an elastocaloric device surpassed the 1,000W mark. One innovation was using graphene nanofluid rather than distilled water to transfer the heat.",
      "Overall, Ms Rasmussen says, solid-state devices are generally not yet as powerful as conventional vapour-compression air conditioning. But she expects performance improvements over time.",
      "She also expects improvements in affordability. So far solid-state cooling has mainly been deployed in wealthy countries.",
      "A key question, Ms Rasmussen says, is \"Can these technologies scale up to where they could be affordable for those who need it the most and where the greatest demand for cooling is coming from?\"",

    "summary": "Whole TV shows shot in one long take are made possible by new lightweight cameras.",
    "story": [
      "Three strong knocks from the police battering ram and the front door bursts open. There's a lot of shouting.",
      "We follow heavily-armed officers as they stream into the house, a woman drops to the floor as the camera turns left, and we head up a small, dimly lit staircase, passing a man with his back against the wall, hands raised, yelling to no avail.",
      "Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van.",
      "All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month.",
      "It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.",
      "Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.",
      "At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.",
      "You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator \u2013 there's a minuscule wobble \u2013 but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.",
      "It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.",
      "This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.",
      "The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.",
      "He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. \"As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take.\"",
      "Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.",
      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

      "Meanwhile, the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc would be reviewing its trade agreement with Israel in light of its actions in Gaza.",
      "Dujarric said the aid operation was made \"complex\" as Israel required the UN to \"offload supplies on the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing, and reload them separately once they secure our teams' access from inside the Gaza Strip\".",

      "The BBC later asked for clarification on the figure from the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), which said: \"We are pointing to the imperative of getting supplies in to save an estimated 14,000 babies suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza, as the IPC partnership has warned about. We need to get the supplies in as soon as possible, ideally within the next 48 hours.\"",
      "It highlighted a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) which stated 14,100 severe cases of acute malnutrition are expected to occur among children aged six to 59 months between April 2025 and March 2026.",
      "The IPC report says this could take place over the course of about a year - not 48 hours.",
      "When pressed on the figures at a news conference, UNOCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said: \"For now let me just say that we know for a fact that there are babies who are in urgent life-saving need of these supplements that need to come in because their mothers are unable to feed themselves.\"",
      "\"And if they do not get those, they will be in mortal danger,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The US has selected a design for the futuristic \"Golden Dome\" missile defence system, says US President Donald Trump, adding that it will be operational by the end of his time in office.",
      "Just days after returning to the White House in January, Trump unveiled his intentions for the system, aimed at countering \"next-generation\" aerial threats to the US, including ballistic and cruise missiles.",
      "An initial sum of $25bn (\u00a318.7bn) has been earmarked in a new budget bill - although the government has estimated it will end up costing much more than that over decades.",
      "Officials warn that existing systems have not kept pace with increasingly sophisticated weapons possessed by potential adversaries.",
      "President Trump also announced that Space Force General Michael Guetlein will oversee the project. Gen Guetlein is currently vice chief of space operations at Space Force.",
      "Seven days into his second administration, Trump ordered the defence department to submit plans for a system that would deter and defend against aerial attacks, which the White House said remain \"the most catastrophic threat\" facing the US.",
      "Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said the system would consist of \"next-generation\" technologies across land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors. He added that Canada had asked to be a part of the system.",
      "During a visit to Washington earlier this year, then-Canadian defence minister Bill Blair acknowledged that Canada was interested in participating in the dome project, arguing that it \"makes sense\" and was in the country's \"national interest\".",
      "He added that \"Canada has to know what's going on in the region\" and be aware of incoming threats, including in the Arctic.",
      "Trump added that the system would be \"capable even of intercepting missiles launched from the other side of the world, or launched from space\".",
      "The system is partly inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, which the country has used to intercept rockets and missiles since 2011.",
      "The Golden Dome, however, would  be many times larger and designed to combat a wider range of threats, including hypersonic weapons able to move faster than the speed of sound and fractional orbital bombardment systems - also called Fobs - that could deliver warheads from space.",
      "\"All of them will be knocked out of the air,\" Trump said. \"The success rate is very close to 100%.\"",
      "US officials had previously said that the Golden Dome will have the aim of allowing the US to stop missiles at various stages of their deployment, including before they launch and while they are still in the air.",
      "The many aspects of the system will fall under one centralised command, US defence officials have said.",
      "Trump said on Tuesday that the programme would require an initial investment of $25bn, with a total cost of $175bn over time. The initial $25bn has been identified within his One Big Beautiful Bill on tax, which has not yet been passed.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, however, has estimated that the government could ultimately spend more, up to $542bn over 20 years, on the space-based parts of the system alone.",
      "Pentagon officials have long-warned that existing systems have not kept pace with new missile technology designed by Russia and China.",
      "\"There really is no current system,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \"We have certain areas of missiles and certain missile defence, but there is no system... there has never been anything like this.\"",

      "At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he defended President Donald Trump's decision last week to lift sanctions on Syria before meeting President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda commander who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December.",
      "Trump's rationale was that other countries wanted to help Sharaa's administration and send aid but were afraid of the sanctions, Rubio explained.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Syrian officials.",
      "'I'm overjoyed to be back': Syrians face daunting rebuild after years of war",
      "Trump's meeting with Sharaa, unthinkable just months ago, boosts Syrians' hopes",
      "Syrian security forces monitored armed civilians who killed Alawites, accused man says",
      "The US imposed sanctions on Syria in response to atrocities committed by forces loyal to Assad during the country's devastating 13-year civil war, in which more than 600,000 people were killed and 12 million others were forced from their homes.",
      "The State Department had previously insisted on several conditions being met before they were lifted, including protecting religious and ethnic minorities.",
      "Although Sharaa has promised to do that, the country has been rocked by two waves of deadly sectarian violence in recent months.",
      "In March, almost 900 civilians, mainly members of Assad's Alawite sect, were killed by pro-government forces across the western coastal region during fighting between security forces and former regime loyalists, according to one monitoring group. The loyalists reportedly killed almost 450 civilians and 170 security personnel.",
      "And at the start of May, more than 100 people were reportedly killed in clashes between gunmen from the Druze religious minority, the new security forces and allied Sunni Islamist fighters in two suburbs of the capital Damascus and the southern province of Suweida.",
      "Even before the violence, many members of minority communities were worried about the new transitional authorities, which are dominated by Sharaa's Sunni Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). It is a former al-Qaeda affiliate still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU and the UK.",
      "Sharaa himself also continues to be listed by the US as a \"specially designated global terrorist\", although the Biden administration announced in December that the US would scrap the $10m (\u00a37.5m) bounty offered for his arrest.",
      "Despite Sharaa's past, Trump took the opportunity to meet him while attending a summit of Gulf leaders in Saudi Arabia last week.",
      "Afterwards, the US president told reporters that he was a \"young, attractive guy\", adding: \"Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.\"",
      "\"He's got a real shot at pulling it [Syria] together,\" he said, adding, \"it's a torn-up country\".",
      "Sharaa meanwhile said Trump's decision to lift the sanctions on Syria \"was a historic and courageous decision, which alleviates the suffering of the people, contributes to their rebirth and lays the foundations for stability in the region\".",
      "Speaking to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Washington DC on Tuesday, Rubio quipped that \"the bad news is that the transitional authority figures... didn't pass their background check with the FBI\".",
      "\"But on the flip side of it is, if we engage them, it may work out, it may not work out. If we did not engage them it was guaranteed to not work out,\" he added.",
      "\"In fact, it is our assessment that, frankly, the transitional authority, given the challenges they're facing, are maybe weeks, not many months, away from potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions, basically the country splitting up.\"",
      "He did not elaborate but said Syria's minorities were \"dealing with deep internal distrust... because Assad deliberately pitted these groups against each other\".",
      "He said the Trump decided to lift the sanctions quickly because \"nations in the region want to get aid in, want to start helping them. And they can't because they are afraid of our sanctions\".",
      "As Rubio spoke, European Union foreign ministers agreed to also lift economic sanctions on Syria.",
      "\"We want to help the Syrian people rebuild a new, inclusive and peaceful Syria,\" the bloc's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X.",
      "\"The EU has always stood by Syrians throughout the last 14 years - and will keep doing so.\"",
      "The Syrian foreign ministry said the decision marked \"the beginning of a new chapter in Syrian-European relations built on shared prosperity and mutual respect\"."

    "summary": "The Spanish government calls for the removal of almost 66,000 property listings saying they breach tourism rules.",
    "story": [
      "The Spanish government has called for the removal of the listings of nearly 66,000 properties on rental platform Airbnb on the grounds that they breach regulations for tourist accommodation.",
      "The clampdown comes as protests against over-tourism have begun ahead of the summer season. Demonstrations in the Canary Islands on Sunday attracted thousands of people.",
      "The minister for social rights, consumer affairs and the 2030 Agenda, Pablo Bustinduy, said the rental properties in question had \"violated various norms regarding housing for tourist use\".",
      "The announcement followed a Madrid court ruling that Airbnb must immediately withdraw from the market 4,984 of the properties cited by the ministry.",
      "The properties are in six regions: Madrid, Andalusia, Catalonia, Valencia, the Basque Country and the Balearic Islands.",
      "Bustinduy's ministry is now awaiting further judicial rulings on the other 60,000 or so properties whose listings it deems unlawful.",
      "According to the ministry, the properties it has identified either did not provide a licence number, provided an erroneous number, or did not specify the legal status of the owner to show whether they were renting on a professional basis or as a private individual.",
      "He described the court's decision as \"a clear victory for those who fight to protect the right to housing\".",
      "Bustinduy added that \"it can be possible to ensure that no economic interest has priority over housing and that no company, however big or powerful, is above the law\".",
      "Housing has emerged as Spaniards' biggest concern in recent months, due to spiralling rental costs, particularly in larger towns and cities.",
      "Read more: Spanish fightback against record tourism",
      "The cost of an average rental has doubled over the last decade, while salaries have failed to keep up.",
      "Tourist apartments have been identified by many as a major cause of the problem, depriving local residents of accommodation.",
      "Spain is the world's second most popular tourist destination after France, with 94 million foreign visitors in 2024, a 13% rise on the previous year.",
      "Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said earlier this year \"there are too many Airbnbs and not enough homes\", and he promised to prevent the \"uncontrolled\" expansion of the use of properties for tourism.",
      "Some local governments have also started to act against Airbnb.",
      "Barcelona City Hall has said it will eliminate its 10,000 short-term tourist apartments by the end of 2028.",
      "Others have taken a different approach. In recent months, Airbnb has reached agreements with local authorities in the Canary Islands, Ibiza and Murcia aimed at ensuring property owners comply with tourist rental rules.",
      "Airbnb responded to the court ruling and Bustinduy's announcement by insisting it would appeal against decisions linked to this case and that no evidence of rule-breaking by hosts had been provided.",
      "It also cited a 2022 ruling by the Spanish Supreme Court which found that the responsibility for listing information lay with the host of each property, not the company, which was a \"neutral intermediary\" and not a real estate provider.",
      "The firm also made a broader point about the Spanish housing problem.",
      "\"The root cause of the affordable housing crisis in Spain is a lack of supply to meet demand,\" said a spokesperson. \"Governments across the world are seeing that regulating Airbnb does not alleviate housing concerns or return homes to the market \u2013 it only hurts local families who rely on hosting to afford their homes and rising costs.\"",
      "Last summer, Spain saw a wave of protests against over-tourism in many popular destinations, with its impact on housing the biggest grievance.",
      "With the number of foreign visitors to Spain fast approaching 100 million per year, the unrest is expected to continue this summer.",
      "On Sunday, several thousand people took to the streets across the Canary Islands under the slogan \"Canaries have a limit\".",
      "In Majorca, a group called Menys Turisme, M\u00e9s Vida (Less tourism, more life) is preparing for similar actions, with a protest scheduled for 15 June."

    "summary": "Mushtaq won the prize for the short story collection Heart Lamp, translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi.",
    "story": [
      "Indian writer-lawyer-activist Banu Mushtaq has scripted history by winning the International Booker prize for the short story anthology, Heart Lamp.",
      "It is the first book written in the Kannada language, which is spoken in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, to win the prestigious prize.",
      "The stories in Heart Lamp were translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi.",
      "Featuring 12 short stories written by Mushtaq over three decades from 1990 to 2023, Heart Lamp poignantly captures the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India.",
      "Mushtaq's win comes off the back of Geetanjali Shree's Tomb of Sand - translated from Hindi by Daisy Rockwell - winning the prize in 2022.",
      "Her body of work is well-known among book lovers, but the Booker International win has shone a bigger spotlight on her life and literary oeuvre, which mirrors many of the challenges the women in her stories face, brought on by religious conservatism and a deeply patriarchal society.",
      "It is this self-awareness that has, perhaps, helped Mushtaq craft some of the most nuanced characters and plot-lines.",
      "\"In a literary culture that rewards spectacle, Heart Lamp insists on the value of attention - to lives lived at the edges, to unnoticed choices, to the strength it takes simply to persist. That is Banu Mushtaq's quiet power,\" a review in the Indian Express newspaper says about the book.",
      "Who is Banu Mushtaq?",
      "Mushtaq grew up in a small town in the southern state of Karnataka in a Muslim neighbourhood and like most girls around her, studied the Quran in the Urdu language at school.",
      "But her father, a government employee, wanted more for her and at the age of eight, enrolled her in a convent school where the medium of instruction was the state's official language - Kannada.",
      "Mushtaq worked hard to become fluent in Kannada, but this alien tongue would become the language she chose for her literary expression.",
      "She began writing while still in school and chose to go to college even as her peers were getting married and raising children.",
      "It would take several years before Mushtaq was published and it happened during a particularly challenging phase in her life.",
      "Her short story appeared in a local magazine a year after she had married a man of her choosing at the age of 26, but her early marital years were also marked by conflict and strife - something she openly spoke of, in several interviews.",
      "In an interview with Vogue magazine, she said, \"I had always wanted to write but had nothing to write (about) because suddenly, after a love marriage, I was told to wear a burqa and dedicate myself to domestic work. I became a mother suffering from postpartum depression at 29\".",
      "In the another interview to The Week magazine, she spoke of how she was forced to live a life confined within the four walls of her house.",
      "Then, a shocking act of defiance set her free.",
      "\"Once, in a fit of despair, I poured white petrol on myself, intending to set myself on fire. Thankfully, he [the husband] sensed it in time, hugged me, and took away the matchbox. He pleaded with me, placing our baby at my feet saying, 'Don't abandon us',\" she told the magazine.",
      "What does Banu Mushtaq write about?",
      "In Heart Lamp, her female characters mirror this spirit of resistance and resilience.",
      "\"In mainstream Indian literature, Muslim women are often flattened into metaphors \u2014 silent sufferers or tropes in someone else's moral argument. Mushtaq refuses both. Her characters endure, negotiate, and occasionally push back \u2014 not in ways that claim headlines, but in ways that matter to their lives,\" according to a review of the book in The Indian Express newspaper.",
      "Mushtaq went on to work as a reporter in a prominent local tabloid and also associated with the Bandaya movement - which focussed on addressing social and economic injustices through literature and activism.",
      "After leaving journalism a decade later, she took up work as a lawyer to support her family.",
      "In a storied career spanning several decades, she has published a copious amount of work; including six short story collections, an essay collection and a novel.",
      "But her incisive writing has also made her a target of hate.",
      "In an interview to The Hindu newspaper, she spoke about how in the year 2000, she received threatening phone calls after she expressed her opinion supporting women's right to offer prayer in mosques.",
      "A fatwa - a legal ruling as per Islamic law - was issued against her and a man tried to attack her with a knife before he was overpowered by her husband.",
      "But these incidents did not faze Mushtaq, who continued to write with fierce honesty.",
      "\"I have consistently challenged chauvinistic religious interpretations. These issues are central to my writing even now. Society has changed a lot, but the core issues remain the same. Even though the context evolves, the basic struggles of women and marginalised communities continue,\" she told The Week magazine.",
      "Over the years Mushtaq's writings have won numerous prestigious local and national awards including the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award and the Daana Chintamani Attimabbe Award.",
      "In 2024, the translated English compilation of Mushtaq's five short story collections published between 1990 and 2012 - Haseena and Other Stories - won the PEN Translation Prize.",

    "summary": "The foreign secretary said the move \"demonstrates our determination to hold extremist settlers to account\".",
    "story": [
      "The UK government has announced sanctions on Daniella Weiss, a far-right Israeli settler known as the \"godmother\" of the settler movement.",
      "Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the move \"demonstrates our determination to hold extremist settlers to account as Palestinian communities suffer violence and intimidation\".",
      "Weiss, 79, is the leader of a radical settler organisation called Nachala - or homeland - which has also been sanctioned.",
      "For decades, Weiss has been prominent in the founding of Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, on land captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) last year - although Israel disputes this.",
      "In the UK sanctions sheet, Weiss was described as having been involved in \"threatening, perpetrating, promoting and supporting, acts of aggression and violence against Palestinian individuals\".",
      "An Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson described the sanctions - which also target two other settlers, two illegal settler outposts, and two organisations - as \"unjustified, and regrettable\".",
      "Weiss was recently featured in Louis Theroux's documentary \"The Settlers\" - and has been active in the movement to rebuild settlements in Gaza.",
      "Speaking to BBC News last year, she said: \"Gaza Arabs will not stay in the Gaza Strip. Who will stay? Jews.\"",
      "\"The world is wide,\" she added. \"Africa is big. Canada is big. The world will absorb the people of Gaza. How we do it? We encourage it. Palestinians in Gaza, the good ones, will be enabled. I'm not saying forced, I say enabled because they want to go.\"",
      "In response to the sanctions, Weiss said hundreds of families \"are prepared and ready to implement settlement in Gaza - immediately\".",
      "Nachala called for \"conquest, immigration and settlement in Gaza\" and added that it wants Israel to \"continue the war until the enemy is destroyed\".",
      "The UK also announced sanctions on two other settlers - Zohar Sabah and Harel David Libi, as well as the outposts Coco's Farm and Neria's Farm, and the organisation Libi Construction and Infrastructure LTD.",
      "Outposts are settlements built without official Israeli authorisation.",
      "\"The Israeli government has a responsibility to intervene and halt these aggressive actions. Their consistent failure to act is putting Palestinian communities and the two-state solution in peril,\" Lammy added.",
      "Additionally, the UK government announced it would pause free trade negotiations with Israel with immediate effect, saying \"it is not possible to advance discussions\" with \"a Netanyahu government that is pursuing egregious policies in the West Bank and Gaza\".",
      "An Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson responded: \"If, due to anti-Israel obsession and domestic political considerations, the British government is willing to harm the British economy \u2014 that is its own prerogative.\"",
      "The move follows a strongly-worded joint-statement from the leaders of the UK, France and Canada on Monday which called on the Israeli government to \"stop its military operations\" and \"immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza\".",
      "Israel has said it will allow a \"basic amount of food\" into Gaza, ending an 11-week blockade of the territory, which it said was aimed at pressuring Hamas to release remaining hostages.",

    "story": [
      "This story contains distressing details from the start",
      "Joel Le Scouarnec, a former surgeon on trial in France who has admitted to sexually abusing hundreds of patients, mostly under age, said he considers himself \"responsible\" for the death of two of his victims.",
      "Over the last few weeks, the court was shown the photos of two people whose relatives say died by suicide, following the trauma of being sexually assaulted by Le Scouarnec when they were children.",
      "One is not being named; the other is Mathias Vinet, who died at in 2021 after struggling with addiction. His grandparents told the BBC they blame Le Scouarnec for his death.",
      "\"I keep the memory of those two photos, [shown] right towards the end, during the last examinations,\" the former surgeon said. \"They died, and I am responsible.\"",
      "Le Scouarnec, 74, was being questioned in court in Vannes, Brittany, during the penultimate week of a long and gruelling trial which began in late February.",
      "In March, during a session held behind closed doors, Le Scouarnec - once a respected small-town surgeon - admitted to sexually abusing all 299 victims, many while they were under anaesthesia or waking up after operations, between 1989 and 2014. More than 250 of them were under the age of 15.",
      "His lawyer Maxime Tessier said he had asked Le Scouarnec if he admitted that the numerous people mentioned in his diaries were \"all potential victims of his acts and he said: 'Yes'\".",
      "At the start of the trial Le Scouarnec also told the court he \"committed despicable acts\" and \"understood and shared the suffering\" caused to many of his patients.",
      "Police were able to identify hundreds of victims thanks to meticulously-compiled diaries in which Le Scouarnec logged assaults he carried out in graphic detail.",
      "Many had no recollection of the abuse they are said to have sustained, and had to be told by police that their names appeared in Le Scouarnec's diaries.",
      "For hundreds of hours over the course of the trial, Le Scouarnec has come face to face with dozens of his victims and their relatives.",
      "Many of them became emotional as they described how the abuse they endured shaped their lives; several said they have suffered from eating disorders, anxiety, depression or addiction.",
      "\"You got into my head, it's destroyed me, I became a whole other person I don't recognise anymore,\" Le Monde newspaper reported one victim as saying.",
      "One of the few victims who had memories of the abuse sustained at the hands of Le Scouarnec said that she was relieved when police contacted her to say her name appeared in the former surgeon's diaries.",
      "\"I have been waiting for your call for 30 years,\" she said, according to Le Monde.",
      "The newspaper also told the story of another victim who had no recollection of the abuse but said she nonetheless was \"convinced\" she had been raped. \"I wanted to die without even knowing why. He stole my youth,\" she told the court.",
      "Throughout the trial Le Scouarnec has apologised to his victims, often acknowledging that his acts had been \"revolting\".",
      "Romane Codou, a lawyer representing several victims, told French media that his admission of guilt had \"appeased\" the victims and \"allowed them to shut the door on an awful debate in which we were at the mercy of Joel Le Scouarnec\".",
      "A section of the trial was devoted to the cross-examination of medical professionals who worked in the same establishments as Le Scouarnec.",
      "Victims' lawyers and child protection advocacy groups have said \"institutional failings\" allowed the surgeon to continue working with children even after an FBI alert - issued in the early 2000s - warned French authorities that Le Scouarnec had been accessing child abuse websites.",
      "The National Order of Doctors (Cnom), which has also filed a lawsuit against Le Scouranec, said in March that it \"expressed its deep regrets\" as he should have been \"prevented from practicing\".",
      "\"This situation has highlighted poor communication between the different entities of the Order of Doctors, and we deeply regret this,\" they said in a statement.",
      "Despite being the largest child abuse trial in French history, many victims have felt the proceedings have garnered relatively little attention in France.",
      "The Victims of Joel Le Scouarnec Collective group said it was \"stunned\" to see how the trial had failed to capture the attention of politicians and society at large.",
      "\"No lesson has been drawn from this, neither from the medical world nor from politicians,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "Le Scouarnec is already in prison after being sentenced in December 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children, including two of his nieces. Now, he faces an additional 20-year sentence.",

    "story": [
      "Joe Biden's announcement that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer has revived questions about what health issues the former US president was dealing with while he was in the White House.",
      "In a statement on Sunday, Biden's office said the 82-year-old had received the diagnosis on Friday after seeing a doctor for urinary symptoms.",
      "Some doctors have expressed surprise that the aggressive form of cancer, which has spread to his bones, was not detected earlier.",
      "Others pointed out that cancers can grow fast without the patient displaying symptoms - and that men over 70 are not routinely screened.",
      "President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday his predecessor should have been more transparent with the public, seeming to imply that the cancer diagnosis had been covered up - a suggestion rejected by a Biden aide.",
      "\"I think it is very sad actually. I am surprised that the public wasn't notified a long time ago,\" Trump said at an event at the White House.",
      "\"It could take years to get to this level of danger. So, look, it's a very, very sad situation. I feel very badly about it, and I think people should try and find out what happened.\"",
      "A Biden aide said the former president's prior medical check for prostate cancer was more than a decade ago.",
      "He had a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test in 2014, the aide told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "\"Prior to Friday, President Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer,\" the aide added.",

      "Republicans argue that Biden, who ran for re-election as the oldest president in history at 81, was mentally and physically unfit for office. He dropped out of the race last summer after a disastrous debate performance against Trump.",
      "According to Original Sin, a new book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, Biden was unable to recognise Hollywood actor and Democratic donor George Clooney or to recall the names of key aides in his final year in office.",
      "The authors write: \"Biden's physical deterioration - most apparent in his halting walk - had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election.\"",
      "The publicity generated by the book has forced senior Democrats to field questions on why they did not do more to respond to Americans' concerns about Biden's health as he campaigned for re-election.",
      "\"It was a mistake for Democrats to not listen to the voters earlier,\" Senator Chris Murphy said on Sunday.",
      "After the news of Biden's diagnosis, Vice-President JD Vance wished him well, but asked whether Biden's doctors or staff members had sought to keep the public from knowing about the true state of his health.",
      "\"This is not child's play, and we can pray for good health, but also recognise that if you're not in good enough health to do the job, you shouldn't be doing the job,\" he added.",
      "Dr Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist who worked as a Covid adviser to the Biden White House, was among those claiming that Biden probably had been ill with cancer for some time, without necessarily knowing it.",
      "\"He did not develop in the last 100, 200 days. He had it while he was president,\" he told MSNBC's Morning Joe show. \"He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. Yes, I don't think there's any disagreement about that.\"",
      "US medical guidelines do not recommend routine blood screenings for men over 70 because prostate cancers can be very slow-growing, and the difficulty of testing and treatment may outweigh the risk from the cancer.",
      "Biden had previously been diagnosed with benign enlargement of the prostate. In 2019, before he was elected, his campaign released the report from his medical screening, saying he had been treated with medication and surgery, \"and has never had prostate cancer\".",
      "That's led to questions about whether Biden was tested at any point during his four-year presidency - and why the diagnosis came so late.",
      "\"I would assume the former president gets a very thorough physical every year,\" Dr Chris George of the Northwestern Health Network told Reuters. \"It's sort of hard for me to believe that he's had a (blood test) within the past year that was normal.\"",
      "However, Dr Robert Figlin, interim director of Cedars-Sinai Cancer, told the BBC that the aggressive way Biden's cancer had presented was not that unusual. And he warned critics against \"assuming that somehow something was missed along the way\".",

      "The model aims to replace existing humanitarian agencies, including the UN, with civilian contractors, backed by the Israeli military.",
      "The UN and its donors say the new model is poorly conceived and politically motivated, incapable of replacing the decades-long tried and tested international humanitarian ecosystem in Gaza.",
      "A representative of one of the aid agencies operating in Gaza told me the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation scheme was \"totally premature,\" adding that Israel had never provided evidence to back up its assertion that Hamas was responsible for the widespread diversion of aid.",

      "Now it seems that Israel's credit has gone, at least as far as France, the United Kingdom and Canada are concerned. They have issued their strongest condemnation yet of the way Israel is fighting the war in Gaza.",

      "Their statement dismisses Netanyahu's arguments and calls for a ceasefire. Together, the three governments say that they \"strongly oppose the expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza\" adding: \"The level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable.\"",
      "They call for the release of the remaining hostages and recall that after the \"heinous attack\" on 7 October they believed that the Israeli state \"had a right to defend Israelis against terrorism. But this escalation is wholly disproportionate\".",
      "Netanyahu's decision to allow what he called \"minimal\" food into Gaza was they said \"wholly inadequate\".",
      "Netanyahu has hit back, saying the \"leaders in London, Ottawa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities\".",
      "He insisted the war could end if Hamas returned hostages, laid down its arms, agreed for its leaders to go into exile and Gaza was demilitarised. \"No nation can be expected to accept anything less and Israel certainly won't,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu - who is sought under an International criminal Court warrant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, which he has dismissed as \"antisemitic\" - had been under heavy international pressure to end the blockade of Gaza after a respected international survey warned of imminent famine.",
      "At the London summit between the EU and the UK the President of the European Council, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, called the humanitarian crisis in Gaza \"a tragedy where international law is being systematically violated, and an entire population is being subjected to disproportionate military force\".",
      "\"There must be safe, swift and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu's reluctant decision to allow in limited supplies was condemned by his ultra nationalist coalition partners.",
      "The Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, convicted in 2007 for incitement to racism and supporting an extremist Jewish group that Israel classifies as a terrorist organisation, complained that Netanyahu's decision would \"fuel Hamas and give it oxygen while our hostages languish in tunnels\".",
      "Only five trucks made it into Gaza on Monday, as Israeli troops advanced and air and artillery strikes killed more Palestinian civilians including many young children.",
      "Opponents of Israel's destruction of Gaza and the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians will say the governments of France, the UK and Canada are speaking out far too late.",
      "Many of them have held months of demonstrations protesting about the death and destruction in Gaza \u2013 and more killing of Palestinian civilians and confiscation of land in the West Bank, the other side of the Palestinian territories, during military operations and raids by armed Jewish settlers.",
      "But sometimes in the politics of war, a single incident carries symbolic power that clarifies and crystallises so sharply that it can force governments to action. This time it was the killing on 23 March by Israeli forces in Gaza of 15 paramedics and aid workers.",
      "It came after Israel, on 18 March, had broken a ceasefire that had held for two months with a series of massive air strikes.",
      "Five days into the renewed war an Israeli unit attacked the medical convoy, and covered the men they had killed and their bullet ridden vehicles with the sand. The Israeli account of what happened was shown to be untrue when a mobile phone was recovered from a body in the mass grave.",
      "Its owner had filmed the incident before he was killed. Far from proving Israel's claim that the emergency workers were a potential threat to the Israeli combat soldiers, the video from the grave showed that clearly marked and well-lit ambulances and emergency vehicles were attacked systematically until almost everyone inside them was killed.",
      "Alarm has been growing fast since then, not just among Israel's usual opponents. Its European allies, with President Macron of France leading the way, have been toughening their language. The statement calling for an end to Israel's offensive is their harshest criticism of Israel so far.",
      "A senior European diplomatic source involved in their discussions told me that the tough language reflected a \"real sense of growing political anger at the humanitarian situation, of a line being crossed, and of this Israeli government appearing to act with impunity\".",
      "More ominously for Israel, the statement says that \"we will not stand by while the Netanyahu government pursues these egregious actions. If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete steps in response\".",
      "They do not specify what those might be. Sanctions could be one possibility. A bigger step would be to recognise Palestine as an independent state.",
      "France has been considering joining the 148 other states that have done so at a conference it is co-chairing with Saudi Arabia in New York in early June. The UK has also talked about Palestinian recognition with the French.",
      "Israel, pushing back hard, has told them they would be presenting Hamas with a victory. But the tone of the statement made by the French, the Canadians and the British suggests that Israel is losing its ability to pressurise them."

    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 21:58:05 GMT",
    "summary": "Pakistan's Chinese-made fighter jets were battle tested for the first time during hostilities with India.",
    "story": [
      "The four-day conflict between arch-rivals India and Pakistan this month ended with a ceasefire and both claiming victory \u2013 but it now appears that China's defence industry might also be an unlikely winner.",
      "The latest flare-up began on 7 May when India launched attacks on what it called \"terrorist infrastructure\" inside Pakistan in response to the brutal killing of 26 people, mostly tourists by militants in Pahalgam on 22 April.",
      "Many of them were killed in the scenic valley in Indian-administered Kashmir in front of their wives and family members. Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the carnage, a charge Pakistan denied.",
      "After India's response - which it called Operation Sindoor - to the militant attack, tit-for-tat military manoeuvres from both sides followed, involving drones, missiles and fighter jets.",
      "India reportedly used its French and Russian-made jets, while Pakistan deployed its J-10 and J-17 aircraft, which Islamabad co-produces with Beijing. Both sides say their jets did not cross the border and they were firing missiles at each other from a distance.",
      "Islamabad claims that its fighter aircraft shot down at least six Indian planes, including the newly-acquired French-made Rafale fighter jets. Delhi hasn't responded to these claims.",
      "\"Losses are a part of combat,\" Air Marshal AK Bharti of the Indian Air Force (IAF) said last week when a reporter asked him about these claims. Air Marshal Bharti declined to comment on the specific claim of Pakistan downing Indian jets.",
      "\"We have achieved the objectives that we selected, and all our pilots are back home,\" he added.",
      "India said it had killed at least \"100 terrorists\" while targeting the headquarters of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed militant outfits based in Pakistan.",
      "A definitive account of what really happened in the aerial battle is yet to emerge. Some media outlets reported plane crashes in the state of Punjab and Indian-administered Kashmir around the same time but the Indian government has not responded to the reports.",
      "A Reuters report quoting American officials said Pakistan possibly had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets. Pakistan claiming victory after hugely relying on Chinese weapons systems in an active combat situation is being seen by some experts as a boost for Beijing's defence industry but some also disagree with the claim.",
      "Some of the experts have called this a \"DeepSeek moment\" for the Chinese weapons industry, referring to January this year when the Chinese AI start-up shook US giants with its cost-effective technology.",
      "\"The aerial fight was a big advertisement for the Chinese weapons industry. Until now, China had no opportunity to test its platforms in a combat situation,\" Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, told the BBC.",
      "The Beijing-based analyst said the outcome of the air duel showed \"China has some systems that are next to none\". Shares in the Chinese Avic Chengdu Aircraft company, that manufactures fighter jets like the J-10, surged by up to 40% last week after the reported performance of the fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict.",
      "Other experts, however, feel it's too early to declare the superiority of Chinese weapons systems.",
      "Professor Walter Ladwig from the King's College in London said it was yet to be determined whether the Chinese jets had actually outmanoeuvred the Indian Air Force (IAF) planes, particularly the Rafale.",
      "\"In a standard military doctrine, you would suppress the enemy's air defences and get air superiority before you struck ground targets. Instead, it appears the IAF's mission was clearly not to provoke any Pakistani military retaliation,\" he said.",
      "Mr Ladwig thought that the Indian pilots were given instructions to fly despite the fact that the entire Pakistani air defence was on high alert and their jets were already in the sky. The IAF hasn't given details of the mission or about its air operations strategy.",
      "Beijing also hasn't made any comment on reports of the J-10 taking down Indian fighter jets, including the Rafale. But unconfirmed reports of the J-10 bringing down a Western weapon system has triggered jubilation and triumphalism on Chinese social media.",
      "Carlotta Rinaudo, a China researcher at the International Team for the Study of Security in Verona, said Chinese social media was flooded with nationalistic messages even though it's difficult to reach a conclusion with the available information.",
      "\"At the moment perception matters way more than reality. If we see it in that way, the main winner is really China,\" she said.",
      "For China, Pakistan is a strategic and economic ally. It is investing more than $50bn (\u00a337bn) to build infrastructure in Pakistan as part of its China-Pakistan Economic corridor.",
      "So, a weak Pakistan is not in China's interest.",
      "China made a critical difference in the latest India-Pakistan conflict, says Imtiaz Gul, a Pakistani security analyst. \"It took the Indian planners by sheer surprise. They didn't probably envision the depth of co-operation in the modern warfare between Pakistan and China,\" he said.",
      "Experts say the performance of the Chinese jets in a real combat situation was keenly analysed in Western capitals as this will have cascading impact on global arms trade. The US is the world's largest arms exporter, while China is the fourth.",
      "China sells weapons mostly to developing countries like Myanmar and Pakistan. Previously the Chinese weapon systems were criticised for their poor quality and technical problems.",
      "Reports said the Burmese military grounded several of its JF-17 fighter jets \u2013 jointly manufactured by China and Pakistan in 2022 \u2013 due to technical malfunctions.",
      "The Nigerian military reported several technical problems with the Chinese made F-7 fighter jets.",
      "Another point to be noted is that this was not the first time that India lost an aircraft to Pakistan.",
      "In 2019, during a brief air battle between the two sides following similar Indian air strikes on suspected terrorist targets in Pakistan, a Russian-made MiG-21 jet was shot down inside Pakistani territory and the pilot was captured. He was released a few days later.",
      "India, however, said that the pilot had ejected after successfully shooting down Pakistani fighter jets, including a US-made F-16. Pakistan has denied the claim.",
      "Despite reports of the downing of Indian jets last week, experts like Mr Ladwig argue that India was able to hit an \"impressive breadth of targets\" inside Pakistan early in the morning of 10 May and this fact has gone largely unnoticed by the international media.",
      "The Indian military said in a co-ordinated attack, it launched missiles on 11 Pakistani air bases across the country, including the strategic Nur Khan air base outside Rawalpindi, not far from the Pakistani military headquarters. It's a sensitive target that took Islamabad by surprise.",
      "One of the furthest targets was in Bholari, 140km (86 miles) from the southern city of Karachi.",
      "Mr Ladwig says this time the IAF operated with standard procedures - first attacking Pakistani air defence and radar systems and then focusing on ground targets.",
      "The Indian jets used an array of missiles, loitering munitions and drones despite the Pakistanis operating the Chinese-provided HQ 9 air defence system.",
      "\"It seems the attacks were relatively precise and targeted. The craters were in the middle of runways, exactly the ideal spot. If it were a longer conflict, how long would it take the Pakistani Air Force to get these facilities up and running again, I can't say,\" Mr Ladwig pointed out.",
      "Nevertheless, he said, by refusing to get into the details of the mission briefing, India's military \"lost control of the narrative thread\".",
      "In response to the Indian strikes, Pakistan said it launched missile and air strikes on several Indian forward air bases, but Delhi said the attacks caused no damage to equipment and personnel.",
      "Realising that the situation was getting out of control, the US and its allies intervened and put pressure on both countries to stop the fighting.",
      "But for India, experts say, the whole episode is a wake-up call.",
      "Beijing may not comment on the details of the recent India-Pakistan conflict, but it's keen to show that its weapon systems are fast catching up with the West.",
      "Delhi is aware that the jets China has supplied to Pakistan are some of the earlier models. Beijing has already inducted the more advanced J-20 stealth fighter jets, that can evade radars.",
      "India and China have a long-standing border dispute along the Himalayas and fought a brief border war in 1962 that resulted in a defeat for India. A brief border clash took place in Ladakh in June 2020.",
      "Experts say India is acutely aware that it needs to accelerate investments in its homegrown defence manufacturing industry and speed up international buying.",
      "For now, China's defence industry seems to be enjoying the limelight following the claims of success of one of its aircraft in the India-Pakistan conflict.",

      "On Monday, hours after claiming victory in the elections, the new president picked up his daughter from school as usual. He's promised his children nothing will change.",
      "But for Romania things looked very different this morning.",
      "A vote for change",
      "Nicusor Dan has been mayor of Bucharest since 2020 but until now he was little known beyond the capital. That's why his election is widely seen as an act of protest against the old political guard who have governed Romania for over three decades.",
      "But it was also the least extreme option for change.",
      "Dan's opponent in the second-round vote was George Simion, a hard-right nationalist and Eurosceptic who regularly dishes out public insults.",
      "He's also banned from two neighbouring countries because he claims part of Ukraine and all of Moldova belong to Romania.",
      "Simion won the first round with 41% of the vote but Dan caught up in the second, and then took over.",
      "\"This time, fear managed to defeat fury,\" is how political analyst Radu Magdin explains the shift, and points to a significant increase in turnout.",
      "\"Clearly a lot of people are angry in Romania and want to see radical change. But at the same time, we saw massive mobilization of the urban middle class who feared that the country could be taken backwards.",
      "\"It was a fear of what may happen if Simion and friends came to power.\"",
      "'Romania first' rhetoric fell short",
      "I've met plenty of Simion supporters in recent days.",
      "When he turned up to vote on Sunday, a colourful crowd were there at the polling station to greet him. Some were in embroidered national dress and others had brought Romanian flags.",
      "They tended to talk about God and the \"traditional values\" they think Simion represents. Two men told me their priority was to prevent the EU \"imposing\" same-sex marriage on Romania.",
      "Other voters are drawn to Simion's \"Romania first\" rhetoric and promises of a better life.",
      "\"Nothing has been done for us, the working people, and I'm fed up,\" Liliana told me this week from behind a Bucharest market stall piled with apples.",
      "She and her husband voted for Simion thinking he wouldn't be \"so corrupt\".",
      "So when the results came in she was disappointed.",
      "\"I don't think Dan is capable of running a country. But what can we do if people don't want change and progress?\" Liliana shrugged.",
      "\"I think children came back to the villages and persuaded their parents against Simion. They scared them into voting for Dan.\"",
      "Costly mistakes",
      "George Simion himself told me he was a patriot and a \"man of my people\". But as the campaign advanced, he made mistakes.",
      "Outside the market, feeding pigeons with her children, Diana said she'd been planning to vote for Simion until she saw a video from Paris just before the elections.",
      "Attempting to speak French, Simion had described President Macron as having \"dictatorial tendencies\" and said the country was run by \"the ayatollahs\".",
      "\"It wasn't okay to do that, to go there and talk so rudely to the French people,\" Diana thinks. \"It made me change my vote.\"",
      "Analyst Radu Magdin spots other errors, including aggressive blog posts and the moment when Simion insulted his rival, Dan, calling him \"autistic, poor guy\".",
      "\"Other than that, he seemed to flee the public debate and went shaking hands in the pan-European radical right instead,\" Mr Magdin mentions, referring to meetings in Poland, France and Italy right before the vote.",
      "\"I would say there were many people who did not really appreciate that.\"",
      "Defiance of Russia",
      "For many Romanians, choosing Dan was also a strike against Moscow's meddling.",
      "At the election street celebrations last night, as well as yelling the new president's name and cheering, people chanted their defiance: \"Russia, don't forget! Romania is not yours!\"",
      "They were referring to allegations that Russia interfered in their election back in November to boost the chances of far-right conspiracy theorist, Calin Georgescu.",
      "When he came from nowhere to win the first round, the vote was annulled.",
      "This weekend was a re-run, with Georgescu banned and Simion in his place. The two were often seen side-by-side, even on voting day.",
      "But Georgescu's open sympathy for Russia \u2013 he once told me he admired Vladimir Putin \u2013 was a turn-off for many voters.",
      "European choice",
      "Nicusor Dan didn't only win because he was not Simion.",
      "His voters liked what he stood for, including a future firmly within Europe.",
      "When thousands surrounded his campaign headquarters last night to wait for him to claim victory, many brought EU flags. There was relief as well as excitement.",
      "Before the election, young voters had told me they planned radical action if Simion won.",
      "\"So many friends say that they will leave Romania because our values do not align with him at all,\" politics graduate Sergiana told me in central Bucharest. \"I feel like in a year or two he would completely mess up our chances to stay in the EU.\"",
      "By contrast, Dan put relations with Europe at the heart of his campaign.",
      "\"It's better for the European way, for younger people and for Romania \u2013 because we get more EU funds, more development,\" another young voter, Catalin Petrosanu, approved.",

      "The \"reset\" document notes \"political agreements leading to full reciprocal access to waters to fish until 30 June 2038\" - a 12-year extension to the current deal negotiated by Boris Johnson's Conservative government - and much longer than expected.",
      "Under the existing agreement (due to expire in 2026), EU vessels get access to UK waters to fish - in return for transferring 25% of their fishing quota - the amount they are allowed to catch - to UK fleets.",

      "UK-EU deal moves us on from Brexit rows, Starmer says",

      "Elspeth Macdonald, who represents 450 fishing boats as chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation says: \"This deal is a horror show for Scottish fishermen, far worse than Boris Johnson's botched Brexit agreement.\"",
      "She says the long-term deal takes away the industry's bargaining power in future talks and would prefer annual negotiations with the EU.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says there will be \"no increase in the amount that the EU vessels can catch in British waters\" and says it will now be easier for UK fishermen to export their products.",

      "Before Brexit more young people from the EU came to the UK than went the other way.",

      "However, she adds that if everyone left the UK when their visa expired, the long-term impact on migration levels would be minimal.",

      "The government claims: \"British holidaymakers will be able to use more eGates in Europe, ending the dreaded queues at border control.\"",
      "However the text of the EU-UK agreement is less clear, only referring to the \"potential use of eGates where appropriate\".",
      "It is unlikely any change will be implemented by the summer, travel organisation Abta told BBC Verify.",

    "story": [
      "Hidden beneath the slopes of a lush forest in Alberta, Canada, is a mass grave on a monumental scale.",
      "Thousands of dinosaurs were buried here, killed in an instant on a day of utter devastation.",
      "Now, a group of palaeontologists have come to Pipestone Creek - appropriately nicknamed the \"River of Death\" - to help solve a 72-million-year-old enigma: how did they die?",
      "Trying to work out exactly what happened here starts with the hefty strike of a sledgehammer.",
      "Brute force is needed to crack open the thick layer of rock that covers what Professor Emily Bamforth, who's leading the dig, describes as \"palaeo gold\".",
      "As her team begins the more delicate job of removing the layers of dirt and dust, a jumble of fossilised bones slowly begins to emerge.",
      "\"That big blob of bone right there is, we think, part of a hip,\" Prof Bamforth says, watched on by her dog Aster - whose job today is to bark if she spots any nearby bears.",
      "\"Then here, we have all of these long, skinny bones. These are all ribs. And this is a neat one - it's part of a toe bone. This one here, we have no idea what it is - it's a great example of a Pipestone Creek mystery.\"",
      "BBC News has come to Pipestone Creek to witness the sheer scale of this prehistoric graveyard and see how researchers are piecing together the clues.",
      "Thousands of fossils have been collected from the site, and are constantly generating new discoveries.",
      "The bones all belong to a dinosaur called Pachyrhinosaurus. The species, and Prof Bamforth's excavation, feature in a new landmark BBC series - Walking With Dinosaurs - which uses visual effects and science to bring this prehistoric world to life.",
      "These animals, which lived during the Late Cretaceous period, were a relative of the Triceratops. Measuring about five metres long and weighing two tonnes, the four-legged beasts had large heads, adorned with a distinctive bony frill and three horns. Their defining feature was a big bump on the nose called a boss.",
      "The dig season has just started and lasts each year until autumn. The fossils in the small patch of ground that the team are working on are incredibly tightly packed; Prof Bamforth estimates there are up to 300 bones in every square metre.",
      "So far, her team has excavated an area the size of a tennis court, but the bed of bones extends for a kilometre into the hillside.",
      "\"It's jaw dropping in terms of its density,\" she tells us.",
      "\"It is, we believe, one of the largest bone beds in North America.",
      "\"More than half of the known dinosaur species in the world are described from a single specimen. We have thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus here.\"",
      "Palaeontologists believe the dinosaurs were migrating together in a colossal herd for hundreds of miles from the south - where they had spent the winter - to the north for the summer.",
      "The area, which had a much warmer climate than it does today, would have been covered in rich vegetation, providing abundant food for this enormous group of plant-eating animals.",
      "\"It is a single community of a single species of animal from a snapshot in time, and it's a huge sample size. That almost never happens in the fossil record,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "Bigger beasts offering clues",
      "And this patch of north-western Alberta wasn't just home to Pachyrhinosaurus. Even bigger dinosaurs roamed this land, and studying them is essential to try and understand this ancient ecosystem.",
      "Two hours drive away, we reach the Deadfall Hills. Getting there involves a hike through dense forest, wading - or doggy-paddling in the case of Aster - across a fast-running river, and clambering over slippery rocks.",
      "No digging is required here; super-sized bones lie next to the shoreline, washed out from the rock and cleaned by the flowing water, just waiting to be picked up.",
      "A huge vertebra is quickly spotted, as are bits of ribs and teeth scattered across the mud.",
      "Palaeontologist Jackson Sweder is particularly interested in what looks like a chunk of dinosaur skull. \"Most of what we find here is a duck-billed dinosaur called Edmontosaurus. If this is a skull bone, this is a dinosaur that's large - probably 30ft (10m) long,\" he says.",
      "The Edmontosaurus, another herbivore, roamed the forests like the Pachyrhinosaurus - and is helping palaeontologists build up a picture of this ancient land.",
      "Sweder is the collection manager at the Philip J Currie Dinosaur Museum in nearby Grande Prairie, where the bones from both of these giants are taken to be cleaned up and analysed. He is currently working on a huge Pachyrhinosaurus skull that's about 1.5m long and has been nicknamed \"Big Sam\".",
      "He points to where the three horns should be at the top of the frill, but the one in the middle is missing. \"All\u00a0the skulls that are decently complete have a spike in that spot,\" he says. \"But\u00a0its nice little unicorn spike doesn't seem to be there.\"",
      "Throughout years working at the extraordinary site, the museum team has collected 8,000 dinosaur bones, and the surfaces of the lab are covered in fossils; there are bones from Pachyrhinosaurus of every size, from young to old.",
      "Having material from so many animals allows researchers to learn about dinosaur biology, answering questions about how the species grows and the make-up of the community. They can also look at individual variations, to see how one Pachyrhinosaurus could stand out from the herd \u2013 as may be the case with Big Sam and his missing spike.",
      "A sudden devastating event",
      "All of this detailed research, in the museum and at the two sites, is helping the team to answer the vital question: how did so many animals in Pipestone Creek die at the same time?",
      "\"We believe that this was a herd on a seasonal migration that got tangled up in some catastrophic event that effectively wiped out, if not the entire herd, then a good proportion of it,\" Prof Bamforth says.",
      "All the evidence suggests that this catastrophic event was a flash flood - perhaps a storm over the mountains that sent an unstoppable torrent of water towards the herd, ripping trees from their roots and shifting boulders.",
      "Prof Bamforth says the Pachyrhinosaurus wouldn't have stood a chance. \"These animals are not able to move very fast because of their sheer numbers, and they're very top heavy - and really not very good at swimming at all.\"",
      "Rocks found at the site show the swirls of sediment from the fast-flowing water churning everything up. It's as if the destruction is frozen in time as a wave in the stone.",
      "But this nightmare day for the dinosaurs is now a dream for palaeontologists.",
      "\"We know, every time we come here, it's 100% guaranteed we'll find bones. And every year we discover something new about the species,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "\"That's why we keep coming back, because we're still finding new things.\"",
      "As the team packs up their tools ready to return another day, they know there's a lot of work ahead. They've only just scratched the surface of what's here - and there are many more prehistoric secrets just waiting to be revealed.",

      "\"Their passports are confiscated when they get to South Africa\u2026 It is common knowledge that these young boys are being abused,\" Mr Sefuli says.",
      "The BBC has spoken to miners who worked in at least two other illegal mines who told us they saw children being abused in the shafts where they were working.",
      "Tshepo, not his real name, says he saw older men forcing young boys to have sex with them underground.",

    "summary": "Matthew Radalj tells the BBC of his time in a Beijing prison, revealing what goes on behind bars.",
    "story": [
      "Sharing a dirty cell with a dozen others, constant sleep deprivation, cells with lights on 24-hours a day; poor hygiene and forced labour. These are some of what prisoners in Chinese jails are subjected to, according to Australian citizen Matthew Radalj, who spent five years at the Beijing No 2 prison \u2013 a facility used for international inmates.",
      "Radalj, who is now living outside China, has decided to go public about his experience, and described undergoing and witnessing severe physical punishment, forced labour, food deprivation and psychological torture.",
      "The BBC has been able to corroborate Radalj's testimony with several former prisoners who were behind bars at the same time he was.",
      "Many requested anonymity, because they feared retribution on loved ones still living inside the country. Others said they just wanted to try to forget the experience and move on.",
      "The Chinese government has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "A harsh introduction",
      "\"I was in really bad shape when I arrived. They beat me for two days straight in the first police station that I was in. I hadn't slept or eaten or had water for 48 hours and then I was forced to sign a big stack of documents,\" said Radalj of his introduction to imprisonment in China, which began with his arrest on 2 January, 2020.",
      "The former Beijing resident claims he was wrongfully convicted after a fight with shopkeepers at an electronics market, following a dispute over the agreed price to fix a mobile phone screen.",
      "He claims he ended up signing a false confession to robbery, after being told it would be pointless to try to defend his innocence in a system with an almost 100% criminal conviction rate and in the hope that this would reduce the time of his incarceration.",
      "Court documents indicate that this worked at least to some extent, earning him a four-year sentence.",
      "Once in prison, he said he first had to spend many months in a separate detention centre where he was subjected to a more brutal \"transition phase\".",
      "During this time prisoners must follow extremely harsh rules in what he described as horrific conditions.",
      "\"We were banned from showering or cleaning ourselves, sometimes for months at a time. Even the toilet could be used only at specific allotted times, and they were filthy - waste from the toilets above would constantly drip down on to us.\"",
      "Eventually he was admitted to the \"normal\" prison where inmates had to bunk together in crowded cells and where the lights were never turned off.",
      "You also ate in the same room, he said.",
      "According to Radalj, African and Pakistani prisoners made up the largest groups in the facility, but there were also men being held from Afghanistan, Britain, the US, Latin America, North Korea and Taiwan. Most of them had been convicted for acting as drug mules.",
      "The 'good behaviour' points system",
      "Radalj said that prisoners were regularly subjected to forms of what he described as psychological torture.",
      "One of these was the \"good behaviour points system\" which was a way \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 to reduce your sentence.",
      "Prisoners could obtain a maximum of 100 good behaviour points per month for doing things like studying Communist Party literature, working in the prison factory or snitching on other prisoners. Once 4,200 points were accumulated, they could in theory be used to reduce prison time.",
      "If you do the maths, that would mean a prisoner would have to get maximum points every single month for three-and-half years before this could start to work.",
      "Radalj said that in reality it was used as a means of psychological torture and manipulation.",
      "He claims the guards would deliberately wait till an inmate had almost reached this goal and then penalise them on any one of a huge list of possible infractions which would cancel out points at the crucial time.",
      "These infractions included - but were not limited to - hoarding or sharing food with other prisoners, walking \"incorrectly\" in the hallway by straying from a line painted on the ground, hanging socks on a bed incorrectly, or even standing too close to the window.",
      "Other prisoners who spoke about the points system to the BBC described it as a mind game designed to crush spirits.",
      "Former British prisoner Peter Humphrey, who spent two years in detention in Shanghai, said his facility had a similar points calculation and reduction system which was manipulated to control prisoners and block sentence reductions.",
      "\"There were cameras everywhere, even three to a cell,\" he said. \"If you crossed a line marked on the ground and were caught by a guard or on camera, you would be punished. The same if you didn't make your bed properly to military standard or didn't place your toothbrush in the right place in the cell.",
      "\"There was also group pressure on prisoners with entire cell groups punished if one prisoner did any of these things.\"",
      "One ex-inmate told the BBC that in his five years in prison, he never once saw the points actually used to mitigate a sentence.",
      "Radalj said that there were a number of prisoners - including himself - who didn't bother with the points system.",
      "So authorities resorted to other means of applying psychological pressure.",
      "These included cutting time off monthly family phone calls or the reduction of other perceived benefits.",
      "Food As Control",
      "But the most common daily punishment involved the reduction of food.",
      "The BBC has been told by numerous former inmates that the meals at Beijing's No 2 prison were mostly made up of cabbage in dirty water which sometimes also had bits of carrot and, if they were lucky, small slivers of meat.",
      "They were also given mantou - a plain northern Chinese bread. Most of the prisoners were malnourished, Radalj added.",
      "Another prisoner described how inmates ate a lot of mantou, as they were always hungry. He said that their diets were so low in nutrition \u2013 and they could only exercise outside for half an hour each week \u2013 that they developed flimsy upper bodies but retained bloated looking stomachs from consuming so much of the mantou.",
      "Prisoners were given the opportunity to supplement their diet by buying meagre extra rations, if money from relatives had been put into what were called their \"accounts\": essentially a prison record of funds delivered to purchase provisions like soap or toothpaste.",
      "They could also use this to purchase items like instant noodles or soy milk powder. But even this \"privilege\" could be taken away.",
      "Radalj said he was blocked from making any extra purchases for 14 months because he refused to work in the prison factory, where inmates were expected to assemble basic goods for companies or compile propaganda leaflets for the ruling Communist Party.",
      "To make things worse, they were made to work on a \"farm\", where they did manage to grow a lot of vegetables, but were never allowed to eat them.",
      "Radalj said the farm was displayed to a visiting justice minister as an example of how impressive prison life was.",
      "But, he said, it was all for show.",
      "\"We would be growing tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages and okra and then \u2013 at the end of the season \u2013 they would push it all into a big hole and bury it,\" he added.",
      "\"And if you were caught with a chilli or a cucumber in general population you would go straight to solitary confinement for eight months.\"",
      "Another prisoner said they would occasionally suddenly receive protein, like a chicken leg, to make their diet look better when officials visited the prison.",
      "Humphrey said there were similar food restrictions in his Shanghai prison, adding that this led to power struggles among the inmates: \"The kitchen was run by prison labour. Those who worked there stole the best stuff and it could then be distributed.\"",
      "Radalj described a battle between African and Taiwanese groups in Beijing's Prison No 2 over this issue.",
      "The Nigerian inmates were working in the kitchen and \"were getting small benefits, like a bag of apples once a month or some yogurt or a couple of bananas\", he said.",
      "Then the Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese inmates were able to convince the guards to let them take over, giving them control of precious extra food items.",
      "This led to a large brawl, and Radalj said he was caught in the middle of it. He was sent to solitary confinement for 194 days after hitting another prisoner.",
      "Inside solitary, he finally had the lights turned off only to realise he'd be with very little light nearly all of the time, giving him the opposite sensory problem.",
      "His small food ration was also cut in half. There were no reading materials and there was nobody to talk to while he was held in a bare room of 1.2 by 1.8 metres (4ft by 6ft) for half a year.",
      "\"You start to go crazy, whether you like it or not, and that's what solitary is designed to do\u2026 So you've got to decide very quickly whether your room is really, really small, or really, really big.",
      "\"After four months, you just start talking to yourself all the time. The guards would come by and ask 'Hey, are you okay?'. And you're like, 'why?'. They replied, 'because you're laughing'.\"",
      "Then, Radalj said, he would respond, in his own mind: \"It's none of your business.\"",
      "'I've had 100 operations and will never stop' - inside China's cosmetic surgery boom",
      "Aboard the 'silver trains', China's retirees do their bit to offset Trump's tariffs",
      "The small-town mayor accused of trafficking and spying for China",
      "Another feature of Chinese prison life, according to Radalji, was the fake \"propaganda\" moments officials would stage for Chinese media or visiting officials to paint a rosy picture of conditions there.",
      "He said, at one point, a \"computer suite\" was set up. \"They got everyone together and told us that we'd get our own email address and that we would be able to send emails. They then filmed three Nigerian guys using these computers.\"",
      "The three prisoners apparently looked confused because the computers were not actually connected to the internet - but the guards had told them to just \"pretend\".",
      "\"Everything was filmed to present a fake image of prisoners with access to computers,\" Radalj said.",
      "But, he claims, soon after the photo opportunity, the computers were wrapped up in plastic and never touched again.",
      "The memoirs",
      "Throughout much of the ordeal, Radalj had been secretly keeping a journal by peeling open Covid masks and writing tiny sentences inside, with the help of some North Korean prisoners, who have also since been released.",
      "\"I would be writing, and the Koreans would say: 'No smaller\u2026 smaller!'.\"",
      "Radalj said many of the prisoners had no way of letting their families know they were in jail.",
      "Some had not made phone calls to their relatives because no money had been placed in their accounts for phone calls. For others, their embassies had not registered family telephone numbers for the prison phone system. Only calls to officially approved numbers worked.",
      "So, after word got round that the Australian was planning to try to smuggle his notes out, they passed on details to connect with their families.",
      "\"I had 60 or 70 people hoping I could contact their loved ones after I got out to tell them what was happening.\"",
      "He wrapped the pieces of Covid mask as tight as he could with sticky tape hoarded from the factory and tried to swallow the egg-sized bundle without the guards seeing.",
      "But he couldn't keep it down.",
      "The guards saw what was happening on camera and started asking, \"Why are you vomiting? Why do you keep gagging? What's wrong?\"",
      "So, he gave up and hid the bundle instead.",
      "When he was about to leave on 5 October 2024, he was given his old clothes which had been ripped five years earlier in the struggle over his initial arrest.",
      "There was a tear in the lining of his jacket and he quickly dropped the notes inside before a guard could see him.",
      "Radalj said he thinks someone told the prison officers of his plan because they searched his room and questioned him before he left.",
      "\"Did you forget something?\" the guards asked.",
      "\"They trashed all my belongings. I was thinking they're gonna take me back to solitary confinement. There will be new charges.\"",
      "But the guard holding his clothes never knew the secret journal had been slipped inside.",
      "\"They were like, 'Get out of here!'. And it wasn't until I was on the plane, and we had already left, and the seat belt sign was switched off, that I reached into my jacket to check.\"",
      "The notes were still there.",
      "Life After Prison",
      "Just before he had boarded the plane in Beijing a policeman who had escorted him to the gate had used Radalj's boarding pass to buy duty free cigarettes for his mates.",
      "\"He said don't come back to China. You're banned for 10 years. And I said 'yeah cool. Don't smoke. It's bad for your health'\".",
      "The officer laughed.",
      "He arrived back in Australia and hugged his father at Perth airport. The tears were flowing.",
      "Then he got married to his long-time girlfriend and now they spend their days making candles and other products.",
      "Radalj says he is still angry about his experience and has a long way to go to recover properly.",
      "But he is making his way through the contact list of his former inmate friends \u2013 \"I have spent the best part of six months contacting their families, lobbying their embassies so they might try to do a better job of helping them during their incarceration.\"",
      "Some of them, he said, haven't spoken to people back home for nearly a decade. And helping them has also helped with the transition back to his old life.",
      "\"With freedom comes a great sense of gratitude,\" Radalj says. \"You have a deeper appreciation for the very simplest things in life. But I also have a great sense of responsibility to the people I left behind in prison.\""

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvr4r5d2qo",
    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 00:08:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC visits families in Kashmir devastated by the deadliest clashes in years, and speaks to military insiders.",
    "story": [
      "Sixteen-year-old Nimra stood outside, rooted to the spot, as the Indian missiles that had woken her a moment ago rained down on the mosque a few metres from her house in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. She watched one tear the minaret off the top of the building. But she failed to realise she, too, had been struck - in the chest.",
      "When the family reached the relative safety of her aunt's house nearby, someone turned on a phone torch. \"My aunt gasped. There was blood on my frock. It was pink and white but now soaked in red. I hadn't seen it before.\" Again they ran. \"I was running but my hand was pressed on my chest the whole time. I didn't want to take it off. I thought if I let go, everything inside me would come out.\" A piece of shrapnel was lodged near her heart, she later discovered.",
      "A few hours later, in Poonch, Indian-administered Kashmir, a different family was dodging shelling which Pakistan had launched in response to India's missile strikes.",
      "\"When the firing began, everyone ran for their lives - children clinging to their parents in fear,\" said MN Sudhan, 72. \"Some families managed to leave for Jammu in their vehicles. We also decided to escape. But barely 10 minutes into our journey, a shell landed near our vehicle. The shrapnel tore through the car. My grandson died on the spot.\"",
      "\"Our future was shattered at that [very] moment,\" Mr Sudhan said of 13-year-old Vihaan's death. \"Now we're left with nothing but grief. I have witnessed two wars between India and Pakistan, but never in my life have I seen shelling as intense as this.\"",
      "Nimra and Vihaan were among many of the villagers caught up in the deadliest attacks for several years in a decades-long conflict between two of the world's nuclear powers - India and Pakistan. Both sides administer the Himalayan region in part but claim it in full. Both governments deny targeting civilians, but BBC journalists in the region have spoken to families caught up in the violence.",
      "The strike that injured Nimra was part of India's armed response after a militant attack killed 26 people - mostly Indian tourists - last month at a beauty spot in India-administered Kashmir. Police there claimed militants included at least two Pakistan nationals. Pakistan has asked India for evidence of this, and has called for an independent inquiry into who was behind the attack.",
      "What followed was four days of tit-for-tat shelling and drone attacks, intensifying each day and culminating in missile strikes on military bases, which threatened to tip over into full-blown conflict. Then, suddenly, a ceasefire brokered by the US and other international players on 10 May brought the two nuclear powers back from the brink.",
      "Families on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border in Kashmir - told us they had had loved ones killed and property destroyed. At least 16 people are reported to have been killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling. We also heard from Indian and Pakistani government insiders about the mood in their respective administrations as the conflict escalated.",
      "In Delhi's corridors of power, the atmosphere was initially jubilant, an Indian government source told the BBC. Its missile attacks on targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in Pakistan itself - including the Bilal Mosque in Muzaff arabad, which India claims is a militant camp, though Pakistan denies this - were deemed a success.",
      "\"The strikes\u2026 were not limited to Pakistani-administered Kashmir or along the Line of Control,\" an Indian government source told the BBC. \"We went deep - even into the Pakistani side of Punjab, which has always been Pakistan's red line.\"",
      "But the Pakistani military had been prepared, a source from the Pakistan Air Force told the BBC. Days earlier, the Pakistani government said it was expecting an attack.",
      "\"We knew something was coming, and we were absolutely ready,\" one officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said Indian fighter jets approached Pakistani territory and the air force was under instructions to shoot down any that crossed into its airspace or dropped a payload.",
      "Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian jets that night, something India has remained silent on.",
      "\"We were well prepared, and honestly, we were also lucky,\" the source said - his account repeated by two other sources.",
      "But Mr Sudhan, Vihaan's grandfather, said there had been no warning to stay indoors or evacuate. \"Why didn't they inform us? We, the people, are caught in the middle.\"",
      "It is likely that no evacuation orders had been issued because the Indian government needed to keep the military strikes confidential, though the local administration had, following the April militant attack, directed locals to clean out community bunkers as a precautionary measure.",
      "A day after the initial missile strikes, Thursday, both sides launched drone attacks, though they each accused the other of making the first move.",
      "India began to evacuate thousands of villagers along the Indian side of the LoC. Just after 21:00 that evening, the Khan family in India-administered Kashmir decided they must flee their home in Uri, 270km (168 miles) to the north of Poonch. Most of their neighbours had already left.",
      "But after travelling for just 10 minutes, their vehicle was struck by shrapnel from a shell, fatally injuring 47-year-old Nargis. Her sister-in-law Hafeeza was seriously injured. They headed to the nearest hospital, only to find the gates locked.",
      "\"I somehow climbed the hospital wall and called out for help, telling them we had injured people with us. Only then did the staff come out and open the gate. As soon as they did, I collapsed. The doctors were terrified by the ongoing shelling and had closed everything out of fear,\" Hafeeza said.",
      "Hafeeza's sister-in-law Nargis is survived by six children. The youngest daughter Sanam, 20, said the first hospital they went to was not equipped to help, and as they headed to another, her mother died of her injuries.",
      "\"A piece of shrapnel had torn through her face. My clothes were soaked in her blood\u2026 We kept talking to her, urging her to stay with us. But she passed away on the way.\"",
      "Since a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in 2021 there had been relative peace in the region, locals told the BBC. For the first time in years, they had been able to live normal lives, they said, and now this sense of security was destroyed.",
      "Sanam, who lost her mother, said: \"I appeal to both governments - if you're heading into war, at least secure your civilians. Prepare... Those who sit in comfort and demand war - they should be sent to the borders. Let them witness what it really means. Let them lose someone before their eyes.\"",
      "Sajjad Shafi, the representative for Uri in the regional government, said he had acted as promptly as possible.",
      "\"The moment I got the news that India has attacked, I got in touch with people and started moving them out.\"",
      "After two days of attacks and counter attacks, the Indian government source said there was now a \"clear sense in\u2026 power corridors that things were escalating but we were ready.",
      "\"We were ready because India had spent the last 10 years acquiring and building strategic military assets - missiles, warheads and defence systems.\"",
      "On the international stage, there had been consternation that the tensions would not be de-escalated by the US, despite its diplomatic overtures during India and Pakistan's previous Kashmir clashes.",
      "US Vice President JD Vance said a potential war would be \"none of our business\".",
      "This statement came as no surprise, the Indian government source told the BBC. At that stage, \"it was clear the US didn't want to get involved\".",
      "By the following day, Friday, shelling had become more intense.",
      "Muhammed Shafi was at home with his wife in Shahkot village in the Neelum Valley, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, on the LoC.",
      "The 30-year-old was standing in the doorway, just a few steps away from where his son was playing; his wife standing in their courtyard.",
      "\"I remember looking up and seeing a mortar shell coming from a distance. In the blink of an eye, it struck her. She didn't even have time to scream. One second she was there, and the next, she was gone. Her face... her head... there was nothing left. Just a cloud of smoke and dust. My ears went numb. Everything went silent. I didn't even realise I was screaming.",
      "\"That night, her body lay there, right in our home. The entire village was hiding in bunkers. The shelling continued all night, and I stayed beside her, weeping. I held her hand for as long as I could.\"",
      "One of those in a bunker was his niece, 18-year-old Umaima. She and her family were holed up in the shelter for four days, on and off, in brutal conditions.",
      "\"There were six or seven of us packed into it,\" she said. \"The other bunker was already full. There's no place to lie down in there - some people stood, others sat. There was no drinking water, no food,\" with people shouting, crying and reciting prayers in the pitch black.",
      "Also in a bunker, in the Leepa Valley, Pakistan-Administered Kashmir - one of the most militarised and vulnerable valleys in the region - was Shams Ur Rehman and family. It is Shams's own bunker, but that night he shared it with 36 other people, he said.",
      "Leepa is surrounded on three sides by the LoC and Indian-administered territory, so Shams was used to living with cross-border tensions. But he was not prepared for the complete destruction of his house.",
      "He left the bunker at three in the morning to survey the scene.",
      "\"Everything was gone. Wooden beams and debris from the house were scattered everywhere. The blast was so powerful, the shockwave pushed in the main wall. The metal sheets on the roof were shredded. The entire structure shifted - by at least two inches.",
      "\"A house is a person's life's work. You're always trying to improve it - but in the end, it's all gone in seconds.\"",
      "Four hours later, back in the Neelum Valley, Umaima and her family also emerged on Saturday 10 May to a transformed landscape.",
      "\"We came out of the bunker at seven in the morning. That's when we saw - nothing was left.\"",
      "As Umaima surveyed the ruins of her village, India and Pakistan's forces that day were trading ever more destructive blows - firing missiles at each other's military installations, which both sides accused the other of instigating.",
      "India had targeted three Pakistani air bases, including one in Rawalpindi - the garrison city that houses the Pakistan Army's General Headquarters.",
      "\"This was a red line crossed,\" said one Pakistani officer. \"The prime minister gave the go-ahead to the army chief. We already had a plan, and our forces were desperately ready to execute it\u2026 For anyone in uniform, it was one of those unforgettable days.\"",
      "Pakistan hit back at Indian military installations. On the diplomatic front, this was seen as a moment to highlight the issue of Kashmir on the international stage, an official in the Pakistan foreign office told the BBC.",
      "\"It was non-stop. Endless meetings, coordination, and back-to-back calls to and from other countries for both foreign minister and then the prime minister. We welcomed mediation offers from the US, the Saudis, the Iranians, or anyone who could help de-escalate.\"",
      "On the Indian side, the Pahalgam attack on 22 April had already prompted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to speak to at least 17 world leaders or diplomats, including UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In most of these conversations, he has tweeted, the emphasis had been on the \"cross-border terrorist attack\" and focused on building a case to hold the perpetrators accountable for the attack.",
      "Then, on Saturday afternoon local time, in the aftermath of the latest missile exchanges, came a diplomatic breakthrough out of nowhere. US President Donald Trump took to social media to reveal that a ceasefire had been agreed.",
      "\"After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.",
      "\"Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,\" he wrote on social media platform Truth Social.",
      "India has since downplayed Washington's role in the ceasefire and it has rejected that trade was used as a lever to achieve this.",
      "Behind the scenes, US mediators, diplomatic backchannels and regional players, including the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia, had proved critical in negotiating the climbdown, experts say.",
      "\"We hit Pakistani strategic bases deep inside their territory and that must have worried the US,\" the Indian government source believes.",
      "In Pahalgam, the site of the militant gun attack that sparked the crisis, the search is still on for the perpetrators.",
      "Vinay Narwal, a 26-year-old Indian Navy officer, was on his honeymoon in Pahalgam when he was killed. He had got married just a week before the attack.",
      "A photo of Vinay's wife Himanshi, sitting near her husband's body following the attack, has been widely shared on social media.",
      "His grandfather Hawa Singh Narwal wants \"exemplary punishment\" for the killers.",
      "\"This terrorism should end. Today, I lost my grandson. Tomorrow, someone else will lose their loved one,\" he said.",
      "A witness to the attack's aftermath, Rayees Ahmad Bhat, who used to lead pony treks to the beauty spot where the shootings took place, said his industry was now in ruins.",
      "\"The attackers may have killed tourists that day, but we - the people of Pahalgam - are dying every day since. They've stained the name of this peaceful town\u2026 Pahalgam is terrorised, and its people broken.\"",
      "The attack was a huge shock for a government which had begun to actively promote tourism in stunningly picturesque Kashmir, famed for its lush valleys, lakes and snow-capped mountains.",
      "The source in the Indian administration said this might have lulled Delhi into a false sense of security.",
      "\"Perhaps we got carried away by the response to tourism in Kashmir. We thought we were over a hump but we were not.\"",
      "The four-day conflict has once again shown how fragile peace can be between the two nations.",

      "The hip-hop mogul is accused of running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004 that manipulated women into participating in commercial sex acts with him, and sometimes male sex workers, during what prosecutors described as drug-fueled parties called \"freak offs.\"",
      "Combs has been jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn since his arrest last September. He\u00a0faces five counts from four different women, including Ventura.",
      "So far, jurors heard from a former security manager at the Los Angeles hotel where Combs was seen on a now infamous video attacking Ventura in 2016, along with a man who says he was hired to have sex with Ventura while Combs watched, and Ventura herself.",
      "On Friday, they also heard from a special agent who photographed the hotel where Combs was arrested last year, and from Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard, who testified about seeing Combs assault Ventura.",
      "Here's what to know about the charges and key names in the case.",
      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "In her testimony, she said she signed with Bad Boy Records when she was 19, and Combs first kissed her on her 21st birthday. She and Combs dated off-and-on for more than 10 years, from about 2007 to 2018.",
      "She said she recorded hundreds of songs as part of a 10-album deal, but most were never released. She testified Combs became controlling and violent, and the \"freak offs\" became her job.",
      "Ventura spoke about years of alleged psychological and physical abuse. She also said Wednesday that he raped her after they had broken up in 2018.",
      "\"This week has been extremely challenging, but also remarkably empowering and healing for me,\" Ventura said in a statement after her testimony. \"I hope that my testimony has given strength and a voice to other survivors, and can help others who have suffered to speak up and also heal from abuse and fear.\"",
      "The security video of Combs attacking Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental hotel is a key piece of evidence in his trial. The video,\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0by CNN last year, shows Combs throw her onto the floor before kicking and dragging her.",
      "Prosecutors allege the hotel assault happened during a \"freak off,\" but Combs' lawyers, who\u00a0sought to have the video excluded from trial, argue it was a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship.\"",
      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",
      "One day after the suit was filed, a settlement was announced. While the details were not disclosed, Ventura said in a statement, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\"",
      "Combs' defense attorneys said in their opening statements that he and Ventura hadn't seen each other since his ex, Kim Porter's, funeral in 2018.",
      "Ventura is now married and pregnant with her third child. Her husband, trainer Alex Fine, and her brother were both seen in court for support.",
      "\"Over the past five days, the world has gotten to witness the strength and bravery of my wife freeing herself of her past,\" Fine said in a statement, going on to say, \"I did not 'save Cassie' as some have said. To say that is an insult to the years of painful work my wife has done to save herself. Cassie saved Cassie.\"",
      "Who are Diddy's other accusers?",
      "Since 2023, dozens of women and men have filed lawsuits against Combs alleging sexual and physical abuse.",
      "Many of the accusers said they were drugged and then abused while incapacitated, and some claimed other celebrities were present or participated in the abuse.",
      "However, the majority of those allegations are not part of the criminal case. Prosecutors have chosen to focus on allegations where there is physical evidence or witness corroboration.",
      "The other three women involved in the trial have not been publicly named and they are expected to testify using pseudonyms. The indictment refers to them as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Jurors are expected to hear from one woman who the defense says had a three-year relationship with Combs that also turned jealous and violent, as well as former employees and an assistant.",

      "Prospective jurors were asked if they were familiar with a list of some 190 celebrities, including Michael B. Jordan, Kanye West and Mike Myers, though it wasn't clear how those people are related to the trial, if at all. Ventura testified about dating Jordan, as well as Kid Cudi.",
      "The judge overseeing the case is U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, a Columbia Law School graduate and former clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Joe Biden appointed Subramanian as a federal judge in 2022.",
      "The prosecution team is made up of eight assistant U.S. attorneys, seven of them women. They include Maurene Ryan Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was one of the prosecutors in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of conspiring Jeffrey Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse teenage girls.",

    "summary": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' ex-girlfriend, the singer Cassie Ventura, took the stand this week at his sex trafficking trial in New York City.",
    "story": [
      "At the\u00a0sex trafficking trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, his ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie Ventura, testified for multiple days. Her testimony was completed on Friday.",
      "Ventura is a critical witness in the prosecution's case against Combs, who has been accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and exploiting women for decades until his\u00a0arrest\u00a0on multiple charges last September. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The music mogul could receive a lifetime prison sentence if convicted on all of them.",
      "Here are some key takeaways from Ventrua's testimony.",
      "Violence occurred \"frequently\"",
      "In her initial statements before the court, Ventura, now pregnant with her third child and married to personal trainer Alex Fine, recalled her and Combs' early interactions and how she started to see a different side of him over time. She said she met Combs when she was a newly signed singer at 19, and their burgeoning friendship became romantic two years later.",
      "She also described his alleged violence throughout their 10-year on-off relationship, recounting instances where he knocked her over, kicked and dragged her, and stomped on her head, causing black eyes and bruises on her body. When asked, Ventura said the abuse she endured happened \"frequently.\"",
      "Combs is seen attacking Ventura in video footage CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0last year, which shows him throwing her to the floor, kicking and dragging her in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel.",
      "\"Control was everything\"",
      "Ventura characterized Combs as physically and psychologically abusive throughout the first hours of her testimony.",
      "\"Control was everything \u2014 from the way that I looked, to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,\" she said. \"Control was an all-around thing to a certain point.\"",
      "Combs allegedly introduced Ventura to \"freak offs,\" drug-fueled events where he is accused of forcing women to perform sex acts with hired sex workers, which were a focus of the indictment outlining his alleged crimes.",
      "Ventura said Combs broached the idea of sexual encounters involving voyeurism during the first year of their relationship, and he would hire an escort or dancer with whom he would watch her engage while he directed them. The singer testified she felt confused and nervous, \"but I also loved him very much and wanted to make him happy.\"",
      "She testified she worried about making Combs angry because of how much control he had over her life and career, and the possibility that he could blackmail her by releasing images of the \"freak offs.\" Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Combs often recorded these performances with or without participants' consent.",
      "A shift in the relationship",
      "Ventura recalled Combs looking out for her when she first met him. They fell in love, she said, while spending time together in the studio or traveling elsewhere.",
      "\"I think I was just enamored by him. We were just having a good time. It was really fun at this point,\" she told the court. But as her appearance, transportation, rent and overall lifestyle came under Combs' control, Ventura said her music career \u2014 and record deal \u2014 eventually took a backseat to the alleged \"freak offs,\" which left her feeling humiliated.",
      "She testified that despite recording hundreds of songs and nine albums while she was with Combs, the work was never released because \"freak offs\" became her job. They took up too much time and energy to leave room for other pursuits, Ventura said, adding that she would stay up for several days at a time to party, drink and have sex with strangers.",
      "The \"freak offs\" could last from 36 to 72 hours at a time, she said, with the longest continuing for four days. She recalled them happening almost weekly for years.",
      "Ventura felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by \"freak offs\"",
      "Ventura began to cry during her testimony when asked whether she wanted to participate in every \"freak off.\" She said she didn't and that she felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by them, but she also didn't want to disappoint Combs.",
      "Ventura told the court Combs dismissed her when she expressed how she felt about them, calling her predictable for not wanting to engage.",
      "Testifying at length about the \"freak offs,\" Ventura said Combs provided ecstasy and cocaine, which she took to stay awake during the incidents.",
      "2016 hotel incident",
      "Ventura recalled the 2016 hotel altercation seen on video footage. After being shown a clip from the incident during the second day of her testimony, she recounted that Combs was yelling and threw something at her during the attack.",
      "She said she told Combs via text message she had a black eye from the incident and reminded him of a premiere she was supposed to attend.",
      "\"You are sick for thinking it's OK to do what you've done,\" she wrote in a text to Combs. \"Please stay far away from me.\"",
      "Ventura told the court she wore sunglasses to cover her eyes and used makeup to hide bruises on other parts of her body when she attended the premiere.",
      "Prosecutors showed several photos of Ventura at the premiere event and after party, where the injuries could be seen.",
      "Drug use",
      "Combs allegedly provided stimulant drugs, like cocaine, to keep participants awake for the length of his \"freak offs,\" Ventura said. She also testified about a time when she requested ketamine, an anesthetic that has been used recreationally for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects.",
      "Prosecutors allege Combs' \"freak offs\" involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and accuse him of using substances in part to exercise control over the people he targeted.",
      "She said Combs didn't like the drug and argued a successful \"freak off\" can be remembered, but explained ketamine was her preference because it allowed her to be less present in the moment.",
      "Rape allegation",
      "Ventura told the jury that Combs raped her in her living room in 2018. They were not together at the time and Ventura was seeing the man who is now her husband, she testified. Ventura said she remembered crying and saying no, but Combs did not stop. After, he got up and left, Ventura testified.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape in a lawsuit she filed in 2023. The lawsuit was settled the day after she filed it. Combs denied the allegation.",
      "Text messages",
      "During cross-examination Thursday and Friday, the defense asked Ventura about numerous text messages she and Combs exchanged over the course of their relationship.",
      "They included affectionate messages where Ventura told Combs she loved him and saw a future with him, potentially one that involved starting a family.",
      "Other messages related to the alleged \"freak offs,\" including one exchange allegedly coordinating one of them.",
      "\"You told him you wanted to do freak offs?\" they asked Ventura at one point, to which she replied, \"No, there's a lot more to that.\"",
      "During redirect on Friday, Ventura told prosecutors there were times Combs was kind and loving, but they didn't last.",
      "She said Combs' moods affected her life, career and how she felt about herself, and if Combs wanted a \"freak off,\" then her work would take a backseat.",
      "\"I had to do freak offs,\" she said.",

      "Bruce Springsteen gave his latest stinging criticism of President Trump and his administration, calling them \"treasonous\" and \"incompetent\" to kick off the first show of his British tour this week. The president responded in a Truth Social post that included criticism of the rocker's skin and telling him to \"keep his mouth shut\" until returning to the U.S.",
      "Springsteen, a long and prominent supporter of Democratic presidential candidates, made his remarks at a concert in Manchester, England, on Wednesday during the first of his \"Land of Hope and Dreams\" tour.",
      "\"The mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock 'n' roll in dangerous times,\" he said. \"In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\"",
      "The 75-year-old rocker, who later shared a transcript and video of his remarks on his website and YouTube channel, asked supporters of democracy to \"raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!\"",
      "Throughout the concert, Springsteen accused Mr. Trump and his administration of authoritarianism, rolling back civil rights, blocking free speech and \"taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on loyal American workers.\"",
      "\"They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society,\" Springsteen said. \"They're abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom.\"",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump responded on his social media platform, saying that the rocker is \"just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.\"",
      "He added: \"Springsteen is 'dumb as a rock,' and couldn't see what was going on, or could he (which is even worse!)? This dried out 'prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that's just 'standard fare.' Then we'll all see how it goes for him!\"",
      "This is not the first time Springsteen has aimed at Mr. Trump and his policies.",
      "When he endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election, Springsteen called Mr. Trump \"the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.\"",
      "\"Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually and emotionally divided as it does than at this moment. It doesn't have to be this way,\" the rock star said in\u00a0a short video\u00a0shared on social media.",
      "In a\u00a02016 interview\u00a0with Rolling Stone, Springsteen called Mr. Trump a \"moron.\" When Mr. Trump was running for reelection in 2020, Springsteen\u00a0told\u00a0The Atlantic he didn't know \"if our democracy could stand another four years of his custodianship.\"",

Diaw told the Sun that Brown allegedly hit him over the head with a bottle before punching and kicking him as he lay on the floor.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration says it has decided to continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and others at higher risk of severe disease, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.",
      "\"I think we have to admit to ourselves that America is deeply divided on the policy issue of repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses or boosters,\"\u00a0Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's new top vaccines official, said in a video posted by the agency announcing the change.",
      "Details of the new rules for COVID-19 vaccine approvals were also outlined in\u00a0an article\u00a0published by The New England Journal of Medicine, authored by Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct \"randomized, placebo-controlled trials\" before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to \"all healthy persons\" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old, they wrote.",
      "Otherwise, companies will only be able to get their routine COVID-19 vaccine updates approved for seniors as well as people with an underlying medical condition, like pregnancy or diabetes, that increases the risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The range of diseases in the CDC definition of high risk of severe disease is vast, including obesity and even mental health conditions such as depression. Estimates suggest that 100 million to 200 million Americans will have access to vaccines in this manner,\" they wrote.",
      "Vaccine makers are being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. Prasad said they are also encouraging new trials in children under 5.",
      "\"I think we have a really good balance between vulnerable people, that people still at high risk will still have a rapid path to access, but people at average risk and low risk, they need evidence,\" said Prasad.",
      "Makary and Prasad criticized the U.S. for adopting \"a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework\" to grant broad authorization for past COVID-19 vaccine boosters in the past, and cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "They also pointed to other developed countries that have already limited annual COVID-19 vaccine boosters to only older adults and those with underlying conditions that increase their risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view,\" they wrote.",
      "The new \"regulatory framework for COVID-19 vaccination\" laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes ahead of a key meeting of the agency's outside vaccine advisers this Thursday, to decide on how to update the strain used in next season's shots.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has greenlighted those updates in a process similar to the annual flu shots, based largely on laboratory data showing the vaccines can trigger antibody levels similar to previously approved shots.",
      "That is a lower bar than requiring brand new randomized trials of the vaccines tested against a placebo to show it prevents symptomatic disease \u2014 a process which is usually only required for new shots when there is no currently approved immunization available.",
      "But Makary and Prasad said COVID-19 shots should be held to a different standard, citing differences in how the virus mutates and the immunity offered by vaccines and previous infection.",
      "\"Ultimately, these studies alone can provide reassurance that the American repeat-boosters-in-perpetuity strategy is evidence-based,\" they wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether and when vaccine makers would be able to conduct these kinds of trials, if they wanted to try again for a broader approval from the FDA. Makary and Prasad floated the possibility of trials as soon as the coming months.",
      "\"Covid-19 has summer transmission that can facilitate the conduct of randomized studies that continue to apply in future time periods,\" they wrote.",
      "Prasad said interim results from some of the studies could be ready \"by next calendar year.\"",
      "Pfizer said it is \"evaluating the details shared today\" and is in ongoing talks with the FDA. The company said its shots had been administered to over a billion people, including kids, showing favorable safety data.",
      "\"We stand by the science behind the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and continue to believe that broad vaccination programs are an essential tool for helping to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and severe disease, including death,\" Pfizer spokesperson Steven Danehy said in a statement.",
      "Moderna spokesperson Chris Ridley said they \"appreciate the FDA's clear guidance and remain committed to working with the Agency to provide the data they need to ensure access for Americans.\"",
      "A Novavax spokesperson declined to comment. Novavax earned a narrow FDA approval over the weekend for its COVID-19 vaccine, which was limited to seniors as well as adults and adolescents with at least one underlying condition.",
      "While U.S. health care providers are usually allowed to administer vaccines with FDA approval \"off-label\" outside the limits laid out by the agency, a narrower approval can affect access and limit insurance coverage for the vaccinations.",

      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought Tuesday to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals like glyphosate that he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S.",
      "\"I have said repeatedly throughout this process, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\"",
      "The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a \"Make America Healthy Again Commission,\" which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.",
      "Targets include the \"potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures\" in children. Kennedy said their report was due to be released Thursday.",
      "\"Your information about the report is just simply wrong,\" Kennedy told Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi in response to a question about the report. \"The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\"",

      "\"We all know what confirmation bias is. It's no secret that you were involved with pesticide litigation, prior to becoming secretary,\" Hyde-Smith told Kennedy.",
      "What has RFK Jr. said about pesticides like glyphosate?",

      "\"If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luther. I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value,\" Kennedy wrote in a 2020 Facebook post.",
      "During his longshot independent presidential campaign, Kennedy pledged to get toxins out of the food supply, warning that \"toxic chemicals like glyphosate\" were widely contaminating what Americans were eating.",
      "He continued that criticism in the months ahead of the 2024 election as he stumped in support of President Trump, recalling how his son resolved his \"really agonizing\" eczema by switching to eating pasta made in Europe.",
      "\"As soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema,\" he told Donald Trump Jr. on a podcast in September of last year. \"And you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do, that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food.\"",
      "What will be in RFK Jr.'s \"MAHA Commission\" report?",
      "One of Kennedy's top HHS advisers, Calley Means \u2014 whose sister Dr. Casey Means was nominated by President Trump earlier this month for the surgeon general post \u2014 said that the report is aimed at outlining \"obvious\" ways that children are \"being poisoned through areas that there's not even that much scientific disagreement on.\"",
      "\"Obviously, it's because of environmental toxins,\" Means said, speaking at a May 15 event hosted by the Kennedy-aligned MAHA Institute. \"We produce and ingest 25% of the world's pesticides. The leading herbicides and pesticides that we use in the United States, many of them are phased out or banned in every other country in the world.\"",
      "Means said that the report was not intended to result in \"a European nanny state system\" to crack down on pesticides, pledging instead to come up with \"pro-innovation policies to solve this issue\" under Kennedy. He blasted lobbyists for opposing the report's release.",
      "Beyond \"environmental toxins\" like pesticides, Means listed a number of other issues he alleges are making American children sick, including ultra-processed foods, added sugars, seed oils, sedentary behavior, lack of sleep, overprescriptions and vaccines.",
      "\"They're saying it's going to scare the American people to get facts out. They're putting so much pressure on President Trump, so much pressure on Secretary Kennedy to not release facts,\" Means said last week.",
      "What power does RFK Jr. have over pesticides?",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services does not directly set the limits on how glyphosate and other pesticides are used. That is left up to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, HHS does oversee the major research that underpins how the EPA regulates chemicals.",
      "Studies into pesticides like glyphosate to inform the EPA's limits often come from the federal health agencies within HHS.",
      "For example, the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program published results in 2023 suggesting that glyphosate is \"unlikely\" to be genotoxic, which had been one of the main ways international experts previously suspected it might cause cancer.",
      "Results from a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in 2022 found that diet was likely a factor in how much glyphosate people were being exposed to, based on urine samples taken in adults and children.",
      "Through the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy also has authority over how glyphosate levels in food are tracked and the EPA's limits are enforced.",
      "The last round of published sampling by the FDA in 2022 found that 54 samples of human food had detectable amounts of glyphosate out of 731 analyzed. Corn and beans were among the most frequent detections.",

      "While the researchers were asked to continue working for a few more weeks in the labs they run at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, multiple sources familiar with the situation say their layoff notices have not been revoked.",
      "\"Most people believe we were reinstated because we got back to the office,\" one of the scientists, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News in a message.",
      "This means they still face termination from the federal government on June 2, alongside the thousands of other workers who were put on leave after Kennedy's layoffs were announced last month.",
      "\"These 11 labs have about 100 staff, mainly young trainees whose careers will be severely disrupted,\" one scientist familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "News of the Neurological Disorders and Stroke scientists losing their jobs was previously reported by The Transmitter.",
      "The laid-off scientists include Richard Youle. Youle, who has served at the NIH since 1978, carries the title of distinguished investigator, a designation reserved for the agency's most preeminent researchers. He was the winner\u00a0of the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2021 for his research into Parkinson's disease.",
      "A scientist familiar with Youle's work, who spoke anonymously fearing retaliation, praised his research as a \"fundamentally important\" breakthrough for the field. Youle's results had paved the way for researchers to find new treatments for Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, the NIH said in its news release.",
      "One source at the NIH said Youle had received four job offers after news of the layoffs broke last month. Three were for positions outside the United States. While Youle has told others that he has no interest in leaving the U.S. for now, the source said it shows that \"the world is ready to pounce and take our top scientists if we don't fix this.\"",
      "Ten other senior investigators \u2013 Miguel Holmgren, Steve Jacobson, Dorian McGavern, Joseph Mindell, Katherine Roche, Zu-Hang Sheng, David R. Sibley, Kenton Swartz, Susan Wray and Ling-Gang Wu \u2013 were also laid off at NINDS, according to records shared with CBS News. A senior associate scientist at NINDS, Silvina Horowitz, got a layoff notice as well, the records show.",
      "Among the scientists who have received major recognition for their work in recent years include Wu, who was selected for a prestigious award in February from the Biophysical Society for his ongoing research on how neurons communicate and function. Sibley was recognized in 2023 by a pharmacology society for \"seminal contributions\" to understanding dopamine receptors in the brain.",
      "Kennedy had told a Senate health committee at a\u00a0hearing on May 14 that the only cuts they had made to date were \"administrative cuts.\"",
      "\"As far as I know, we have not fired any working scientists, the working scientists, the people who are actually doing science. There are some people who were scientists that were doing IT or administration, who did lose their jobs. But in terms of working scientists, our policy was to make sure none of them were lost and that that research continues,\" Kennedy said.",
      "NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and senior leaders within the department were made aware weeks ago about the layoffs, multiple sources told CBS News. Bhattacharya and others previously said that they were mistakes and would be reversed soon.",
      "Weeks have passed since those assurances were made to the scientists. Multiple sources said the scientists have yet to receive any letters revoking their \"reduction in force\" or \"RIF\" notices, or an explanation for why moves to reverse their layoffs never occurred.",
      "That is unlike similar layoffs that were revoked weeks ago at the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the department, which officials completed in the days ahead of Kennedy's testimony to Capitol Hill.",
      "When asked about the employment status of NIH and NIOSH scientists who received reduction in forces notices, a spokesperson for the department pointed back to Kennedy's remarks at the Senate hearing about the layoffs.",
      "Kennedy's claim that no working scientists were fired has drawn disdain in recent days from other laid-off scientists at multiple health agencies beyond the NIH.",
      "For example, while some of the laid-off employees at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were restored ahead of Kennedy's hearing, researchers in the agency's Health Effects Laboratory Division remain off the job. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also lost many scientists in its National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for an array of work ranging from lead poisonings to illness outbreaks on cruise ships. CDC labs investigating outbreaks of viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases were also eliminated, after all the scientists were laid off.",
      "\"Perhaps he is unaware that his RIFs have gutted scientists and front-line public health workers at CDC, the very people he vowed to protect,\" one laid-off CDC official told CBS News.",
      "Some within the NIH said they believed that the scientists would be reinstated after the research agency faced a second round of layoffs, which employees had been told were to compensate for scientists that needed to be reinstated to their positions.",
      "Around 200 employees at the NIH were laid off, including staff at the National Cancer Institute and Office of Research Facilities. Officials said the cuts wiped out multiple teams responsible for contracting work to conduct emergency maintenance around the NIH's campuses and oversee laboratory safety.",
      "The NIH's acquisitions office was also gutted by those layoffs, according to an email to lab managers shared with CBS News, leaving the agency's supply center with \"little to no capacity for new work\" to obtain supplies for researchers.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-medicaid-glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-obesity-states/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 20:19:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Late last year, South Carolina Medicaid approved GLP-1s to treat obesity, placing it among the few state programs covering the drugs. But access remains limited.",
    "story": [
      "CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 When Page Campbell's doctor recommended that she try an injectable prescription drug called Wegovy to lose weight before scheduling bariatric surgery, she readily agreed.",
      "\"I've struggled with my weight for so long,\" said Campbell, 40, a single mother of two. \"I'm not opposed to trying anything.\"",
      "In early April, about four weeks after she'd started taking Wegovy, Campbell said she hadn't experienced any side effects, such as nausea or bowel irritation. But she doesn't use a scale at home, so she said she didn't know whether she'd lost any weight since her most recent medical appointment earlier this year, when she weighed 314 pounds. Still, she was confident about achieving weight loss.",
      "\"It's going to work because I'm putting in the work. I'm changing my eating habits. I'm exercising,\" said Campbell, a shipping manager at a Michaels store. \"I'm not going to second-guess myself.\"",
      "Wegovy belongs to a pricey class of drugs called GLP-1s (short for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists) that have upended the treatment of obesity in recent years, offering hope to patients who have tried and failed to lose weight in myriad other ways.",
      "Campbell gained access to Wegovy through South Carolina Medicaid's decision in late 2024 to cover these weight loss drugs. But the medications remain out of reach for millions of patients across the country who could benefit from them, because many public and private health insurers have deemed the drugs too expensive.",
      "A report published in November by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, found only 13 states were covering GLP-1s for the treatment of obesity for Medicaid beneficiaries as of August 2024. South Carolina became the 14th in November.",
      "Liz Williams, one of the report's authors and a senior policy manager for the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, said she was not aware of any other state Medicaid programs joining the list since then. Looking ahead, the remaining states may be reluctant to add a new, expensive drug benefit while they brace for potential federal cuts coming from Congress, she said.",
      "\"As the budget debate, federally, is developing, that may impact how states are thinking about this,\" Williams said.",
      "The federal government won't be helping anytime soon, either. Medicare covers GLP-1s to treat diabetes and some other health conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, but not obesity. In early April, the Trump administration announced it will not finalize a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would have allowed an estimated 7.4 million people covered by Medicare and Medicaid to access GLP-1s for weight loss. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is poised to force less expensive, compounded versions of these drugs off the market.",
      "And the barrier to entry remains high, even for Medicaid patients in those few states that have agreed to cover the drugs without a federal mandate.",
      "Case in point: In South Carolina, where more than one-third of all adults, and nearly half of the African American population, qualify as obese, the state Medicaid agency estimates only 1,300 beneficiaries will meet the stringent prerequisites for GLP-1 coverage.",
      "Under one of those requirements, Medicaid beneficiaries who wish to access these drugs to lose weight must attest to \"increased exercise activity,\" said Jeff Leieritz, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Campbell, who is insured by Medicaid, was granted coverage for Wegovy based on her body mass index. First, though, she was required to submit six months' worth of documentation proving that she'd tried and failed to lose weight after receiving nutrition counseling and going on a 1,200-calorie-a day diet, said Kenneth Mitchell, one of Campbell's doctors and the medical director for bariatric surgery and obesity medicine at Roper St. Francis Healthcare.",
      "Campbell's Wegovy prescription was approved for six months, Mitchell said. When that authorization expires, Campbell and her health care team will need to submit more documentation, including proof that she has lost at least 5% of her body weight and has kept up with nutrition counseling.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Send a prescription in and they cover it.' It's rather arduous,\" Mitchell said. \"Not a lot of folks are going to do this.\"",
      "Mitchell said South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover these drugs was met with excitement among those working in his medical specialty. But he wasn't surprised that the state anticipates relatively few people will access this benefit annually, since the approval process is so rigorous and the cost high. \"The problem is the medicines are so expensive,\" Mitchell said.",
      "Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Wegovy, announced in March that it was cutting the monthly price for the drug from $650 to $499 for cash-paying customers. The price that health insurance plans and beneficiaries pay for these drugs varies, but some GLP-1s cost more than $1,000 per patient per month, Mitchell said, and many people will need to take them for the rest of their lives to maintain weight loss.",
      "\"That is a tremendous price tag that someone has to foot the bill for,\" Mitchell said.",
      "That's the reason the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees voted last year to end coverage of GLP-1s for state employees, after then-North Carolina Treasurer Dale Folwell's office estimated in 2023 that the drugs were projected to cost the State Health Plan $1 billion over the next six years. The decision came only a few months after a separate North Carolina agency announced it would start covering these drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. North Carolina Medicaid has estimated it will spend $16 million a year on GLP-1s.",
      "South Carolina Medicaid, which insures fewer than half the number of people enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid, anticipates spending less. Leieritz estimated GLP-1s and nutrition counseling offered to Medicaid beneficiaries in South Carolina will cost $10 million a year. State funding will cover $3.3 million of the expense; the remainder will be paid for by matching Medicaid funds from the federal government.",
      "In a recent interview, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn't rule out the possibility that Medicare and Medicaid might cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment in the future as costs come down.",
      "They're \"extraordinary drugs\" and \"we're going to reduce the cost,\" Kennedy told CBS News in early April. He said he would like GLP-1s to eventually be made available to Medicare and Medicaid patients who are seeking obesity treatment after they have tried other ways to lose weight. \"That is the framework that we're now debating.\"",
      "Meanwhile, public health experts have applauded South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover GLP-1s. Yet the new benefit won't help the vast majority of the 1.5 million adults in South Carolina who are classified as obese, according to data published by the South Carolina Department of Public Health.",
      "\"We still have some work to do,\" acknowledged Brannon Traxler, the public health department's chief medical officer.",
      "But the state's new \"Action Plan for Healthy Eating and Active Living,\" written by a coalition of groups in South Carolina, including the Department of Public Health, makes no mention of GLP-1s or the role they might play in lowering obesity rates in the state.",
      "The action plan, underwritten by a $1.5 million federal grant, isn't meant to lay out an overarching approach for lowering obesity in South Carolina, Traxler said. Instead, it promotes physical activity in schools, nutrition, and the expansion of outdoor walking trails, among other strategies. A more comprehensive obesity plan might address the benefits of surgical intervention and GLP-1s, but those also carry risk, expense, and side effects, Traxler said.",
      "\"Certainly, I think, there is a need to bring it all together,\" she said.",
      "Campbell, for one, is taking the comprehensive approach. On top of injecting Wegovy once weekly, she said, she is prioritizing protein intake and moving her body. She also underwent weight loss surgery in late April.",
      "\"Weight loss is my biggest goal,\" said Campbell, who expressed appreciation for Medicaid's coverage of Wegovy. \"It's one more thing that's going to help me get to my goal.\"",

    "story": [
      "The largest holder of President Trump's cryptocurrency token is entrepreneur Justin Sun, the billionaire revealed Tuesday \u2014 earning him an invite to a controversial dinner this week hosted by Mr. Trump for his meme coin's biggest backers.",
      "Sun announced he will attend Thursday evening's dinner at Mr. Trump's D.C.-area golf club \u2014 which is open to the 220 largest holders of the $TRUMP meme coin \u2014 in a post on X, describing himself as the president's \"TOP fan.\"",
      "\"As the top holder of $TRUMP, I'm excited to connect with everyone, talk crypto, and discuss the future of our industry,\" wrote Sun, who founded the Tron blockchain and faced a securities lawsuit from Biden-era federal regulators.",
      "The meme coin's website lists the largest holder of $TRUMP as somebody with the username \"Sun\" who owns about 1.4 million tokens \u2014 worth around $19 million at Tuesday's trading price.",
      "In addition to the dinner for the top 220 holders of $TRUMP, the president is also hosting an \"Exclusive Reception\" at his club in Northern Virginia for the token's top 25 holders. Sun did not immediately respond when asked by CBS News if he would attend the smaller reception.",
      "What is the $TRUMP meme coin \u2014 and why is it controversial?",
      "The meme coin was launched in January, days before Mr. Trump's inauguration. An affiliate of the Trump organization and a firm called Fight Fight Fight LLC control 80% of the coin's total supply.",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is driven mostly by online buzz, especially on social media. They typically do not have intrinsic value and are not used for transactions. Like many meme coins, $TRUMP is known for erratic price shifts: Its price peaked at around $75 shortly after its launch, but plummeted to under $8 by early April.",
      "But late last month, the price surged after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced. Buyers spent more than $140 million to buy the $TRUMP coins in hopes of securing an invitation to the event, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.",
      "Mr. Trump previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" The president and his two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are backing the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and crypto makes up some $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth according to a recent report.",
      "Eric Trump in January called the $TRUMP coin \"the hottest digital meme on earth.\"",
      "The $TRUMP private dinner marketing promotion \u2014 and the president's links to World Liberty \u2014 have raised concerns among government watchdogs and Democratic lawmakers about potential conflicts of interest.",
      "The Senate on Monday advanced a bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, that would regulate so-called stablecoins \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. The bill faced some pushback from Democrats who pushed for anti-corruption rules, often citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings.",
      "\"How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun \u2014 a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture \u2014 announces he's getting a private dinner as the President's top crypto buyer,\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement.",
      "The White House has dismissed criticism that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest, noting his assets are held in a trust managed by his children.",
      "\"The President is working to secure GOOD deals for the American people, not for himself. President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public \u2013 which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Who is Justin Sun?",
      "Sun has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to Forbes. He's best known for the Tron blockchain \u2014 and for paying $6.2 million at auction for a banana that artist Maurizio Cattelan duct-taped to a wall, which Sun promptly ate as part of a \"unique artistic experience.\"",
      "Sun says his firm has also invested tens of millions in the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial.",
      "He was sued by the Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly \"fraudulently manipulating the secondary market\" for a crypto token created by his company. The suit also accused his firm of paying celebrities like Lindsey Lohan and Jake Paul to promote the token \"without disclosing their compensation.\" Sun's attorneys have pushed back on the suit.",
      "But earlier this year, the SEC and Sun agreed to pause the lawsuit to \"explore a potential resolution.\" The halt was part of a broader shift by the Trump administration to ease cryptocurrency enforcement.",

    "summary": "High temperatures and rising electricity costs could boost home energy bills by 6% this summer, a new report says.",
    "story": [
      "High temperatures projected across the U.S. summer could take a toll on Americans' budgets by driving up the price of keeping homes cool.",
      "Home electricity bills are expected to rise to an average of $784 for the summer period, up more than 6% from $737 in 2024 and marking a 12-year record, according a new analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).",
      "The growing expense comes on the heels of a cold winter that drove up heating costs for many Americans, and as consumers continue to grapple with higher prices on everyday goods. Consumers are also increasingly expressing concerns about how tariffs\u00a0could affect their day-to-day costs, Gallup polling has found.",
      "\"We found that it's going to be another expensive summer for air conditioning because temperatures will stay high, and electricity prices have been rising faster than inflation,\" energy economist Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The anticipated spike in residential electricity costs from June through September is due to the combination of rising cost of electricity, which is outpacing inflation, with higher temperatures, NEADA said. Those trends mean that households are not only expected to pay higher prices for electricity, but will likely consume more of it than they did last summer because of the need for more cooling.",
      "\"It's not just temperatures that are going up, but the cost of cooling is going up,\" Wolfe said. \"And when electricity prices go up, they tend to stay high. So even if temperatures moderate, your bill might go up because of the cost of electricity.\"",
      "Unpaid bills",
      "Energy costs eat up a larger share of low-income families' budgets compared to higher-earners. Low-income households spend roughly 8.6% of their incomes on energy costs, compared to 3% for those that are higher up the income ladder, according to NEADA.",
      "Worryingly, the lowest earners could struggle to afford to keep their homes cool, Wolfe noted. The most recent Census Household Pulse Survey found that 37% of low- and moderate-income households could not afford their energy bills for at least one month between April 2023 and April 2024.",
      "If those households find themselves in a financial crunch this summer, they may opt to turn off their air conditioning, which could pose serious health risks, noted Wolfe.",
      "\"Last winter was cold, so they're just getting over paying their heating bills, and are now facing higher summer cooling costs,\" Wolfe explained. \"And while people understand that if you don't use heat in the winter, your pipes will freeze, that won't happen in the summer.\"",
      "Reluctance to turn on one's air conditioning can have adverse health effects like heat stroke. \"While this won't do damage to your building, it will do damage to you,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Extreme heat and health",
      "Public assistance programs haven't kept pace with the evolving climate, according to Wolfe. \"We're having heat waves that are lasting longer, and the systems in place to protect families have not kept up,\" he said.",
      "This summer's cooling cost forecast should be taken as a sign that state and federal assistance programs require modernization, according to Wolfe. Only 26 states offer summer cooling assistance to help Americans pay their bills. Thirty-three states have no protections in place to prevent utilities company from shutting off customers' access to electricity when they're behind on payments.",
      "Extreme heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Wolfe says that taking steps to modernize your home can actually help households save money. For example, adding insulation to your house can help control energy bills.",

      "The U.S. credit rating was downgraded by Moody's Ratings on Friday, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "The downgrade from the top rating of Aaa to Aa1 \"reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,\" the credit rating firm said in a statement on Friday.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" Moody's added.",
      "Moody's also highlighted the environment of heightened policy uncertainty driven by Mr. Trump's evolving trade priorities.",
      "Moody's is the last of the three major credit rating agencies to downgrade U.S. government debt. In August 2011, Standard and Poor's downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+, and in August 2023\u00a0Fitch Ratings cut the credit rating a notch from AAA to AA+.",
      "Moody's said it expects federal deficits to grow from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% of GDP by 2035, driven by \"increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending and relatively low revenue generation.''",
      "\"Even Obama economists warned the Biden administration and congressional Democrats against recklessly wasting trillions on COVID 'stimulus' bills \u2013 spending that piled on our national debt, fueled runaway inflation, and forced the Fed to raise interest rates for everyday Americans,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement Friday to CBS News in response to the downgrade. \"The Trump administration and Republicans are focused on fixing Biden's mess by slashing the waste, fraud, and abuse in government and passing The One, Big, Beautiful Bill to get our house back in order. If Moody's had any credibility, they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded.\"",
      "The credit downgrade came as the House Budget Committee on Friday rejected\u00a0President Trump's domestic policy bill, which would extend tax cuts from his first term.",
      "If the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act is extended, it would add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit (excluding interest payments) over the next decade, Moody's said Friday.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-tax-bill-reconcilation-deficit-moodys-debt-spending/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 06:48:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Republican tax bill could cost $3.8 trillion over 10 years as its tax cuts surpass spending reductions, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican-backed tax and spending bill that's now moving forward in the House is getting a reality check from Wall Street. That's because the proposed tax breaks are projected to far outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to mounting U.S. debt and a worsening fiscal outlook, according to economists and policy experts.",
      "If the bill moves forward without significant changes, the U.S. would likely find its debt levels spiraling higher in order to finance the tax cuts, according to several analyses. Over the next decade, the GOP bill could cost the U.S. $3.8 trillion, according to a report\u00a0earlier this month by the Joint Committee on Taxation that examined the impact of the the tax measures versus spending cuts.",
      "Those risks are rattling Wall Street. Moody's Ratings on Friday\u00a0downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the new bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, over the next decade.",
      "The bill also faces detractors within the Republican party, with the House Freedom Caucus saying in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Sunday that the bill \"fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget.\"",
      "The concern, according to both Wall Street economists and policy experts, is that adding billions in debt to the U.S. ledger could eventually squeeze federal spending because the nation would likely face higher interest payments. That, in turn, could make it more difficult to fund programs like Social Security, which is already facing a financial drawdown as baby boomers hit retirement age, or to invest in initiatives like infrastructure that can spur economic growth.",
      "\"It's time for policymakers to hit pause, go back to the drawing board and put forward a plan that actually takes steps toward putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal trajectory,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy think tank, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Our federal interest payments are skyrocketing, already surpassing what we spend annually on defense or Medicare.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it disagreed both with the Moody's analysis and forecasts that the legislation could widen the nation's deficit, which is the gap between federal spending and revenue.",
      "\"This bill does not add to the deficit,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Monday in a press conference. \"In fact, according to the Council of Economic Advisers, there's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill \u2014 that's the largest saving for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.\"",
      "Savings versus spending",
      "At the heart of the proposed GOP bill is President Trump's vow to renew his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which introduced lower tax brackets for many Americans. Because those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, about 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026 without an extension of the law,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "The Council of Economic Advisers, a White House agency that advises the president on economic issues,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May study that the new bill would \"avert a $4 trillion tax hike\" by extending the TCJA's provisions.",
      "Renewing the law's cuts alone would cost $2.2 trillion over the next decade, estimates Joint Committee on Taxation, which assesses the impact of policy for Congress. The GOP bill also includes other new tax breaks that would add to the bill's long-term costs, the group's analysis found.",
      "For instance, the bill's proposal to provide taxpayers with a more generous standard deduction would result in $1.3 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, the Joint Committee found. Eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, as well as giving a bigger deduction to senior citizens, would cost an additional $234 billion over the same period, its analysis finds.",
      "The bill does include spending cuts, but they aren't large enough to offset the tax breaks, several recent analyses conclude. The nonpartisan Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0estimated\u00a0in a May 14 analysis that the tax cuts would cost $7.7 trillion over the next decade, while the spending cuts would offset $3.9 trillion over the same period. The result is a gap of $3.8 trillion, it said.",
      "That's the arithmetic that prompted Moody's to cut its rating on U.S. debt, from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1. In its assessment, the credit rating agency noted that the U.S. deficit has spiraled higher as previous administrations and Congress have \"failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend.\"",
      "\"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat,\" Moody's said on Friday when it became the third major rating agency to cut the nation's credit rating. \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "It added, \"The U.S.' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly rated sovereigns.\"",
      "The Trump administration says that the proposed tax bill will spur economic growth by lowering taxes on consumers and businesses. In an interview on Monday with Fox Business, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the economy is \"going to continue to take off once those policies are actually in place, once we actually have the tax cuts passed.\"",
      "Who wins and loses",
      "The GOP tax bill remains in flux and is likely to change as it winds through the House.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged there are still details to \"iron out\" as conservative Republicans seek to quickly enact work requirements for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those rules would take effect in 2029 under the bill passed last week by the Ways and Means Committee. Some House Republicans also want to more quickly end tax breaks for green energy projects being used nationwide.",
      "If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republicans are also eyeing changes.",
      "Democrats have decried the cuts Republicans are proposing to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs of the tax breaks, pointing out that the reductions in social safety net programs comes as many wealthy taxpayers would get a big tax break.",
      "\"This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, told CNN's \"State of the Union\u2033 on Sunday. \"There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that's what is happening here.\"",
      "The lowest-income Americans would end up paying more under the proposed GOP bill, according to a May 19\u00a0analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania group that studies the fiscal impact of public policies. Even including savings from tax cuts, the bottom 20%, who earn up to $17,000 per year, would take a $1,035 hit in 2026 after the reductions in Medicaid and other programs are factored in.",
      "\"[H]ouseholds most affected by the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP \u2014 those in the bottom income quintile \u2014 experience the largest losses under this bill, averaging $28,000 in lifetime value for the working-age population,\" the Penn Wharton Budget model calculated. \"In contrast, working-age households in the top income quintile generally benefit from lower taxes, gaining an average of $30,000.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate advanced a crypto regulation bill on Monday night after Democratic opposition\u00a0tanked an initial attempt to advance the measure earlier this month amid concern over ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family.",
      "The first-of-its-kind legislation, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. After the measure advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support in March, Senate GOP leadership first brought the measure to the floor earlier this month. But the measure had lost Democratic support in the intervening weeks amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "The measure moved forward in a 66-32 vote after gaining the support of some Democratic holdouts.",
      "Monday's vote was to limit debate on the bill, allowing the Senate to move forward to final passage.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune criticized Democrats for blocking the measure from advancing earlier this month, saying Monday, \"this bill reflects the bipartisan consensus on this issue, and it's had an open and bipartisan process since the very beginning.\"",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, argued that Senate Democrats \"inexplicably chose to block this legislation\" earlier this month.",
      "Since the failed vote earlier this month, negotiators returned to the table. And ahead of the procedural vote Monday, the measure saw backing from at least one Democrat as Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia advocated for the measure, calling it a \"meaningful step forward,\" though he added that it's \"not perfect.\"",
      "\"The stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can't afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\" Warner said in a statement. \"We need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\"",
      "Still, Warner pointed to concerns he said are shared among many senators about the Trump family's \"use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,\" after it was announced earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.",
      "Warner said senators \"have a duty to shine a light on these abuses,\" but he argued \"we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has been among the leading voices advocating for adding anti-corruption reforms to the legislation. Warren has outlined a handful of issues with the bill, saying that it puts consumers at risk and enables corruption. In a speech Monday on the Senate floor, Warren said her concerns have not been addressed and urged her colleagues to vote against the updated version.",
      "\"While a strong stablecoin bill is the best possible outcome, this weak bill is worse than no bill at all,\" Warren said. \"A bill that meaningfully strengthens oversight of the stablecoin market is worth enacting. A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the president's corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.\"",
      "The measure fell short of the 60 votes necessary to move forward earlier this month, with all Senate Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 opposing. Paul has reservations about overregulation, while Hawley voted against the bill in part because it doesn't prohibit big tech companies from creating their own stablecoins.",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who sponsored the legislation, defended the measure on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Monday. He outlined that a lack of regulatory framework, which the bill would provide, makes for uncertainty \u2014 and results in innovative technology moving offshore. The Tennessee Republicans urged that \"this will fix it,\" while arguing that the bill has strong bipartisan support.",
      "\"We have broad policy agreement, Democrats and Republicans,\" Hagerty said. \"The question is can we get past the partisan politics and allow us to actually have a victory.\"",

Fractures in the GOP conference appeared to persist, despite the legislation's movement out of committee, throwing its passage into question. President Trump is expected to make a personal visit to House Republicans Tuesday to urge them to back the bill, a source familiar with the planning confirmed.",
      "\"There's a lot more work to do,\" House Speaker Mike Johson told reporters late Sunday. \"But I'm looking forward to very thoughtful discussions, very productive discussions, over the next few days \u2014 and I'm absolutely convinced we're going to get this in final form and pass it.\"",
      "After the final three committees advanced their portions of the massive legislative package last week, a handful of conservative hardliners on the House Budget Committee blocked the package from moving forward Friday. The setback prompted work through the weekend to negotiate with the holdouts, who ultimately allowed the legislation to advance late Sunday.",
      "House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington called it a \"critical step,\" while acknowledging that deliberations are continuing, with disagreements remaining on a cap on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and on when Medicaid work requirements would take effect. But Arrington said the vote to advance the legislation Sunday \"is a sign that people are confident that these things will be resolved.\"",
      "Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Ralph Norman of South Carolina, two of the conservative holdouts, celebrated a change they said would be made to remove delays from the Medicaid work requirements, since conservatives opposed the original plan, which would have delayed until 2029 work requirements for childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities. But Roy noted in a post on social media that \"the bill does not yet meet the moment,\" pointing to remaining sticking points on cutting clean energy subsidies implemented under the Biden administration and cuts to the federal share of payments for Medicaid.",
      "Johnson suggested that he and the conservatives had agreed to \"minor modifications\" over the weekend. The speaker is walking a tightrope between the hardliners demanding more cuts and moderates who are reluctant to slash Medicaid, while a number of Republicans who represent blue states have also threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands are met on SALT, among other divisions.",
      "On Monday, Johnson told reporters that there have been \"lots of discussions\" with the various members of different GOP caucuses, adding that nothing has been \"ultimately and finally decided\" as Republican leaders look to build consensus around the ideas.",
      "\"I told all the members on a conference call this morning that this is a consensus-building operation, it's been a bottom-up process,\" Johnson said. \"And we're almost there.\"",
      "The legislation is set to go before the House Rules Committee on Wednesday at 1 a.m., where any changes to the legislation would be made. But Roy and Norman also sit on the Rules Committee and could raise a final hurdle there ahead of the full House vote. Should the package advance out of the Rules Committee, it would tee up a vote on the package on Thursday, before lawmakers are set to leave town for the Memorial Day recess.",
      "As Republican leadership irons out the remaining issues, President Trump is expected to continue to pressure Republicans to get the bill passed this week, as he did on Friday on social media. And on Tuesday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, the legislation is expected to face some resistance in the Senate, where a number of Republicans have warned that should the House pass the bill, the upper chamber will try to make changes.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, told reporters late last week that the House bill \"would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it.\" And Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters that \"we've assumed all along that the Senate would have its input on this.\"",
      "Johnson said on Fox News Sunday that \"the package that we send over there will be one that was very carefully negotiated and delicately balanced, and we hope that they don't make many modifications to it because that will ensure its passage quickly.\"",
      "Beyond the self-imposed deadlines, the inclusion of a debt limit increase in the package has added urgency to getting the legislation to the president's desk. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged Congress earlier this month to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. And top administration and congressional leaders have circled July 4 as the deadline to get the package to the president desk.",

    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 15:57:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Extreme weather linked to climate change will likely lead to more Americans losing their homes as foreclosure rates rise, researchers predict.",
    "story": [
      "Extreme weather linked to climate change could spell financial ruin for many American homeowners and lead to billions in losses for lenders, a new study finds.",
      "First Street, a research firm that studies the impact of climate change, projects in an analysis\u00a0released Monday that foreclosures across the U.S. caused by flooding, wind and other weather-related incidents could soar 380% over the next 10 years. By 2035, climate-driven events could account for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, up from roughly 7% this year.",
      "Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable to the effect of severe weather on their homes, First Street noted. Much of Americans' wealth is tied up in the value of their properties.",
      "A cascade of foreclosures, driven by the mounting costs of repairs and rising insurance premiums stemming from extreme weather, \u00a0wouldn't only hurt homeowners. First Street estimates lenders will lose $1.2 billion a year in 2025 \u2014 and up to $5.4 billion in 10 years \u2014 as they are forced to absorb the cost of mortgage defaults.",
      "Such losses represent the \"hidden risks\" of climate change that lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders consider factors including a borrower's income, debt and credit score in issuing mortgages, but not the potential impact of extreme weather on a property or how it could raise premiums.",
      "First Street also looked at how indirect factors, like rising insurance premiums, are already shaping foreclosure trends. For every 1% increase in insurance costs, the firm projects a roughly 1% increase in the foreclosure rate nationwide.",
      "The findings comes as insurers are jacking up the cost of homeowners policies and in some cases exiting markets around the U.S. altogether, leading to spottier coverage in disaster-prone areas like California. That could leave more individual homeowners on the hook for damage from extreme weather.",
      "First Street said integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders \u2013 and homeowners \u2013 be better prepared for weather-related disasters. But it could also tighten lending conditions, Porter said, putting potential homebuyers at a disadvantage.",
      "\"It's going to increase the price of homes. It's going to increase interest rates,\" he said.",
      "Where climate foreclosures could rise",
      "According to First Street, the communities around the U.S. at greatest risk for climate-related foreclosures in the years to come are densely populated areas with high property values and large numbers of underinsured homeowners. That includes coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and hurricane winds.",
      "For example, Florida's Duval County in the northeastern corner of the state, home to the city of Jacksonville, could see up to $60 million in credit losses resulting from 900 foreclosures in a \"severe weather\" year, according to CBS MoneyWatch's analysis of First Street's data\u00a0 Florida is home to 8 of the top 10 counties with the highest projected credit losses due to extreme weather, the data shows.",
      "Louisiana, California and swaths of the northeast are also projected to see high climate-related mortgage losses this year. But the impact won't just be felt in coastal areas: First Street also expects extreme rainfall and riverine flooding to drive up foreclosures in inland states.",
      "\"We do expect foreclosures to rise in those areas because the predominant driver is a lack of insurance,\" Porter said.",
      "According to First Street, flooding events in particular is likely to drive up foreclosure rates, as gaps in insurance coverage put more people at risk of defaulting on their mortgages.",
      "Unlike homeowners insurance, flood insurance is only required for people who have federally-backed mortgages in FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas. As of August 2023, that amounted to roughly 3.1 million policies, according to National Flood Insurance Program data. But far more people could be at risk.",
      "FEMA's 100-year flood zone maps include just under 8 million properties. But First Street estimates that nearly 18 million homes are at risk of flooding. That's because while the agency takes flooding from major river channels and coastal storm surge into account for its maps, it does not consider extreme precipitation, Porter said.",
      "\"We already know that about half the people with significant flood risk aren't mapped into [FEMA's] Special Flood Hazard Area,\" he said. \"So it leads to a state where we have a lot of underinsurance across the country, in particular from flooding.\"",
      "Meanwhile, whether or not you live in an official FEMA flood zone can make a difference when it comes to the likelihood of foreclosure, First Street found. That's because people outside flood zones often lack insurance.",
      "\"If you don't protect yourselves, then when the event does occur it's completely on you. You end up having to pay out of pocket and you may go into foreclosure,\" Porter said.",
      "In an analysis of 29 historical flood events from 2002-2019, First Street found that damaged properties outside of those FEMA-designated zones experienced foreclosure increases at an average of 52% higher than properties inside the zones.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on if and how it plans to update its flood maps. According to one estimate by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, it could take up to $11.8 billion to complete updated flood mapping in the U.S.",

      "About 321,000 homes in Spain had holiday rental licenses as of November last year, which was 15% more than in 2020, Reuters reported, citing official data. Many others operate without having official licenses.",
      "Airbnb said that it would appeal the decision. Through a spokesperson, the company said it did not think the ministry was authorized to rule on short-term rentals \u2014 and that it had utilized \"an indiscriminate methodology\" to include Airbnb rentals that do not need a license to operate.",

      "The ministry said it had notified Airbnb of the noncompliant listings months ago, but that the company had appealed the move in court.",
      "Spain's government said Madrid's high court had backed the order sent to Airbnb. Bustinduy said it involved the immediate removal of 5,800 rental listings from the site. Two subsequent orders would be issued until the nearly 66,000 removals are reached, he said.",

    "summary": "About half of states have broadened Medicaid, the state-federal low-income health care program, to pay for social services such as housing and nutritional support.",
    "story": [
      "During his first administration, President Trump's top health officials gave North Carolina permission to use Medicaid money for social services not traditionally covered by health insurance. It was a first-in-the-nation experiment to funnel health care money into housing, nutrition, and other social services.",
      "Some poor and disabled Medicaid patients became eligible for benefits, including security deposits and first month's rent for housing, rides to medical appointments, wheelchair ramps, and even prescriptions for fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Such experimental initiatives to improve the health of vulnerable Americans while saving taxpayers on costly medical procedures and expensive emergency room care are booming nationally. Without homes or healthy food, people risk getting sicker, becoming homeless, and experiencing even more trouble controlling chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.",
      "Former President Joe Biden encouraged states to go big on new benefits, and the availability of social services exploded in states red and blue. Since North Carolina's launch, at least 24 other states have followed by expanding social service benefits covered by Medicaid, the health care program for low-income and disabled Americans \u2014 a national shift that's turning a system focused on sick care into one that prioritizes prevention. And though Mr. Trump was pivotal to the expansion, he's now reversing course regardless of whether evidence shows it works.",
      "In Mr. Trump's second term, his administration is throwing participating states from California to Arkansas into disarray, arguing that social services should not be paid for by government health insurance. Officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which grants states permission to experiment, have rescinded its previous broad directive, arguing that the Biden administration went too far.",
      "\"This administration believes that the health-related social needs guidance distracted the Medicaid program from its core mission: providing excellent health outcomes for vulnerable Americans,\" CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said in a statement.",
      "\"This decision prevents the draining of resources from Medicaid for potentially duplicative services that are already provided by other well-established federal programs, including those that have historically focused on food insecurity and affordable housing,\" Howden added, referring to food stamps and low-income housing vouchers provided through other government agencies.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, has also proposed axing funding for low-income housing and food programs administered by agencies including the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture \u2014 on top of Republican proposals for broader Medicaid cuts.",
      "The pullback has led to chaos and confusion in states that have expanded their Medicaid programs, with both liberal and conservative leaders worried that the shift will upend multibillion-dollar investments already underway. Social problems such as homelessness and food insecurity can cause \u2014 or worsen \u2014 physical and behavioral health conditions, leading to sky-high health care spending. Medical care delivered in hospitals and clinics, for instance, accounts for only roughly 15% of a person's overall health, while a staggering 85% is influenced by social factors such as access to healthy food and shelter for sleep, said Anthony Iton, a policy expert on social determinants of health.",
      "Health care experts warn the disinvestment will come at a price.",
      "\"It will just lead to more death, more suffering, and higher health care costs,\" said Margot Kushel, a primary care doctor in San Francisco and a leading researcher on homelessness and health care.",
      "The Trump administration announced in a March 4 memo that it was rescinding Biden-era guidance dramatically expanding experimental benefits known as health-related social needs. Federal waivers are required for states to use Medicaid funds for most nontraditional social services outside of hospitals and clinics.",
      "Last month, the administration told states that these services, which can also include high-speed internet and storage units, should not be part of Medicaid.",
      "Future waiver requests allowing Medicaid to provide social services \u2014 a liberal philosophy \u2014 will be considered on a \"case-by-case basis,\" the administration said. Rather, it has signaled a conservative shift toward requiring most Medicaid beneficiaries to prove that they're working or trying to find jobs, which puts an estimated 36 million Americans at risk of losing their health coverage.",
      "\"What they're arguing is Medicaid has been expanded far beyond basic health care and it needs to be cut back to provide only basic coverage to those most desperately in need,\" said Mark Peterson, a health policy expert at UCLA. \"They're making the case, which is not widely shared by specialists in the health care field, that it's not the job of taxpayers and Medicaid to pay for all this stuff outside the traditional heath care system.\"",
      "Although states have not received formal guidance to end their social experiments, Peterson and other health policy researchers expect the administration not to renew waivers, which typically run in five-year intervals. Worse, legal experts say programs underway could be halted early.",
      "Evidence supporting social investments by Medicaid is still nascent. An expansion in Massachusetts that provided food benefits reduced ER visits and hospitalizations, for instance. But often, it's a mixed bag.",
      "California is going the biggest, investing $12 billion over five years to provide a slew of new services, from intensive case management to help people with severe behavioral health conditions to housing and food assistance through a pair of federal waivers. The most popular benefits provided by health insurers are those that help homeless people on Medicaid by placing them in apartments or securing beds in recovery homes, covering up to $5,000 for security deposits, and preventing eviction.",
      "Since the CalAIM program launched in 2022, it has served only a small fraction of the state's nearly 15 million Medicaid beneficiaries, with roughly 577,000 referrals for benefits. Yet it has improved and even saved the lives of some of those lucky enough to get help, including Eric Jones, a 65-year-old Los Angeles resident.",
      "\"When I got diabetes, I didn't know what to do and I had a hard time getting to my medical appointments,\" said Jones, who lost his housing this year when his mom died but received services through his Medi-Cal insurer, L.A. Care. \"My case manager got me rides to my appointments and also helped me get into an apartment.\"",
      "California is considering making some of its social services permanent after the CalAIM waivers expire at the end of 2026. Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration is adding more housing services, including up to six months of free rent under a third waiver approved by the Biden administration. Medi-Cal officials contended early evidence shows CalAIM has led to better care coordination and fewer hospital and ER visits.",
      "\"We are fully committed,\" said Susan Philip, a deputy director for the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers the program. \"We have invested so much.\"",
      "Health insurers, which deliver Medicaid coverage and receive greater funding to cover these additional benefits, say they're worried the Trump administration will end or curtail the programs. \"If we do things the same old way, we're just going to generate the same old results \u2014 people getting sicker and health care costs continuing to rise,\" said Charles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers.",
      "Industry leaders say the expansion is already changing lives.",
      "\"We believe wholeheartedly that housing is health, food is health, so seeing these programs disappear would be devastating,\" said Kelly Bruno-Nelson, executive director of Medi-Cal for CalOptima Health, a health insurance provider in Orange County.",
      "Oregon is also providing low-income Medicaid patients with a range of new services, including home-delivered healthy meals and rental payment assistance. Residents can even qualify for air conditioners, heaters, air filters, power generators, and mini fridges. State Medicaid officials say they remain committed to providing the benefits but worry about federal cuts.",
      "\"Climate change and housing instability are huge indicators of poor health,\" said Josh Balloch, vice president of health policy and communications at AllCare Health, a Medicaid insurer in Oregon. \"We hope to prove to the federal government that this is a good return on their investment.\"",
      "But even as the Trump administration curtails waivers, it is retaining discretion to provide social services in Medicaid, just on a smaller scale. Supporters say it's fair to scrutinize where to draw the line on taxpayer spending, arguing that there isn't always a direct health connection.",
      "\"We're seeing these things increase, with the free rent, and we're seeing some states pay for free internet, paying for furniture,\" said Kody Kinsley, who previously served as North Carolina's top health official. \"We know there's evidence for food and housing, but with all of these new benefits, we need to look closely at the evidence and the linkage to what actually drives health.\"",
      "Current North Carolina officials say they're confident the new social services Medicaid provides in their state have resulted in better health and lower overall spending on expensive and acute care. Medicaid recipients there can even use the program to buy farm-fresh produce.",
      "While it's too soon to know whether these experiments have been effective elsewhere in the United States, early evidence in North Carolina shows promise: The state had saved $1,020 per participant a year into its experiment \u2014 operating in mostly rural counties \u2014 by reducing ER trips and hospitalizations.",
      "State health officials also touted the economic benefits of driving business to family farms, home improvement contractors, and community-based organizations providing housing and social services.",
      "\"I welcome the challenge of demonstrating the effectiveness of our programs. It's making for healthier people and healthier budgets,\" said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina's Medicaid program. \"Family farms that were on the verge of collapse after Hurricane Helene are now benefiting from a steady income while they also serve their community.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"Sneakerheads\" continue to line up for Nike's Air Jordans, the most successful basketball shoe in history. The first Air Jordan shoe \u2013 the iconic black and red with a Nike swoosh \u2013 was released to the public 40 years ago for $65.",
      "The shoe revolutionized the sneaker industry, but it almost didn't happen.",
      "Michael Jordan's game-changing sneaker",
      "Howard White, a Nike veteran and founding father of the Jordan Brand now serving as its senior vice president, was in the room in 1984 with untested NBA rookie Michael Jordan to meet with Nike at its headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. Jordan was practically dragged into the meeting by his parents, Deloris and James Jordan.",
      "The stakes were high for Nike, then a relatively small sneaker company.",
      "\"This was bigger than anything that we'd done. You know, typically a great player would get like a hundred thousand dollars. But this was so unique in terms of just doing it, I mean, just having the guts to make something like this happen,\" White explained to \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" while wearing Christian Dior Jordans, which retail up to $17,000 dollars.",
      "The offer: $2.5 million for Jordan to wear their shoes. That was triple what anyone else in the league was making at the time.",
      "Jordan ended up taking the deal \u2013 and the rest is sneaker history. He went on to lead the Chicago Bulls to six championships, while sporting his shoe brand.",
      "Nike hoped the Air Jordan would net them $3 million over four years. Instead, they sold $126 million in year one.",
      "Much of that success is thanks to Jordan's ability to seemingly defy gravity with his \"hang time,\" soaring across the paint for legendary dunks. He solidified his nickname \"Air Jordan\" when he\u00a0got a perfect score with his free throw line dunk in the 1987 NBA All-Star Slam Dunk Contest.",
      "Jordan still \"very integral to the operation\"",
      "Nike's marketing approach for the Air Jordan was groundbreaking, joining the cultural conversation in ways few ads had before.",
      "\"In order to translate what he did as a man into what we do as a brand, you have to start with the series of principles we call them ethos,\" Jason Mayden, chief design officer for the Jordan Brand, told \"CBS Sunday Morning.\"",
      "\"So you first start with connectivity, why this product has relevance and reverence. Then you put that into a very strict process that we call visionary. And so what's interesting is we have a playbook. I can't show you what's in it but you can see by the outside,\" he joked.",
      "The Jordan Brand, a standalone division within Nike, generates some $7 billion for Nike annually. They've released a new design every year for the past four decades. Next up: the top secret \"Jordan 40.\"",
      "Forty years later, Mayden says Jordan is still involved with the Air Jordan brand.",
      "\"He's very integral to the operation. He sees everything. He trusts us a lot. He has opinions on things that are near and dear to him,\" he said.",
      "Bigger than basketball",
      "Sean Williams runs the SOLEcial Studies CommUNITY Academy, a Brooklyn-based program dedicated to studying, promoting and collecting shoes \u2013 some 40,000 pairs, he says, since the first Air Jordans came out. He says it has given him his life's purpose.",
      "\"Sneakers are wearable art. So if you take the artistic approach to interpreting a story through certain features on the shoes, certain colorways going behind the design often, and talking to the people who actually design and make these shoes, you're giving the sneakers a level of depth in AKA storytelling that convinces them, that they're making the right purchase when they buy these secrets,\" Williams explained.",
      "For the Jordan Brand, Air Jordans are bigger than basketball. It's about empowering people to believe more in themselves.",
      "White, who still talks to Jordan, says he often reminds the basketball legend that Air Jordan's success is because it's not actually the story of a shoe.",
      "\"If this simple article of footwear can make people interpret themselves in a way that gives them just the power to believe more in themselves. That's what the Jordan brand is about,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump ripped into Walmart, saying on social media Saturday that the retail giant should \"eat the tariffs\" instead of blaming the duties on imported goods imposed by his administration for its increased prices.",
      "Walmart on Thursday warned that everything from bananas to children's car seats could increase in price despite the softer tariffs on China.",
      "\"We can control what we can control,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on the company's first quarter earnings call Thursday. \"Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,\" he added.",
      "The price hikes are expected to go into effect later this month.",
      "As Mr. Trump has jacked up import taxes, he has tried to assure a skeptical public that foreign producers would pay for those taxes and that retailers and automakers would absorb the additional expenses.",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday, the president lashed out at Walmart \u2013 which employs some 1.6 million people in the United States \u2013 and said the company should sacrifice its profits for the sake of his economic agenda. Mr. Trump says his economic plan will eventually lead to more domestic jobs in manufacturing.",
      "\"Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,\" Trump posted. \"Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, \"EAT THE TARIFFS,\" and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I'll be watching, and so will your customers!!!\"",
      "A spokesperson for Walmart told CBS News on Saturday that it has always worked to keep prices as low as possible and \"we won't stop.\"",
      "\"We'll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The threat by the Republican president reflected the increasingly awkward series of choices that many major American companies face as a result of his tariffs, from deteriorating sales to the possibility of incurring Mr. Trump's wrath. Mr. Trump has similarly warned domestic automakers not to raise their prices, even though outside analyses say his tariffs would raise production costs.",
      "In April, McMillon was among the retail executives who met with Mr. Trump at the White House to discuss tariffs and potential negative outcomes. But the Trump administration went forward despite warnings and has attacked other companies, such as Amazon and Apple, that are struggling with the disruptions to their supply chains.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 18:37:44 -0400",
    "summary": "The greatest benefits would go to high-income households, while low-income families would see a much more modest boost, analyses show.",
    "story": [
      "The White House on Friday touted a Republican-backed tax bill as delivering \"PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks.\" Yet experts say the legislation would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering far more modest gains to Americans lower down the ladder.",
      "If the bill is passed, households with more than $1 million in annual income would see their after-tax earnings rise by 4.3%, according to a new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a public policy think tank. The lowest-earning 20% of Americans would receive the smallest boost \u2014 their after-tax incomes would rise 0.6%, or an average of $90 annually, CBPP found.",
      "Other analyses have reached similar conclusions. The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution,\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the bottom 20% of Americans would see a 0.6% increase in after-tax income under the House tax bill, compared with a 3.7% increase for the top 20%.",
      "The fate of the GOP tax bill is unclear after five Republican members of the House Budget Committee on Friday voted against advancing the measure, dubbed the \"one big, beautiful, bill,\" saying the legislation does not do enough to slash federal spending.",
      "Such projections don't include the impact of cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which support many low- and middle-income households. Under the GOP bill, those services could face steep cuts, potentially bumping millions off Medicaid by adding work requirements and cutting federal funding provided to states to support the health care program.",
      "Those cuts could leave many low-income households worse off even after accounting for lower taxes, according to another analysis released Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania research group that analyzes the fiscal impact of public policies.",
      "The bottom 20% of households, who earn up to about $17,000 annually, would see their after-tax incomes drop by $1,035 in 2026, including a reduction in government benefits, the nonpartisan group found. The top 0.1%, who earn at least $4.3 million per year, would get an annual after-tax boost of about $389,000, Penn Wharton said.",
      "The White House took issue with the CBPP and Penn Wharton analyses.",
      "\"Once again, the experts are wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have yielded trillions in investments, record job growth, and no inflation,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These experts should be embarrassed to share their 'expertise,' considering the egg still on their faces. MAGAnomics transcends conventional wisdom, and the President's One, Big, Beautiful Bill will continue to prove the haters wrong.\"",
      "The White House pointed to an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation that estimated the average tax bill would decline 11.1% in 2027 under the GOP legislation. The nonpartisan panel, which assess the impact of legislation for Congress, found that the biggest tax decrease would go to people earning $15,000 to $30,000, with a decline of 21.1%, while those earning more than $1 million would decline 8.6%",
      "Tariff impact",
      "Because low-income households spend a bigger share of their income on basics like food and clothing than wealthier Americans, they are likely to take a bigger financial hit from tariffs, experts including the nonpartisan\u00a0Yale Budget Lab have said. That could effectively wipe out the benefits from the tax cuts, according to some analysts.",
      "If inflation rises as a result of higher tariffs and tax cuts, the bottom 20% of U.S. households would lose $100 per year, largely due to paying higher costs for consumer goods that are imported from other countries, the CBPP found. Because tariffs are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, they typically pass on the cost of such duties to consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"If we add just the effects of the tariffs the Trump Administration has put in place, the plan would still boost the rich while leaving the lowest-income people worse off because their tax cuts are so small,\" Brendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the CBPP, said in a post.",
      "Counting the impact of tariffs, the top 1% of households would still see their after-tax incomes increase by 3%, or almost $45,000, the think tank estimated. That analysis doesn't include the impact of cuts to services like Medicaid or food stamps.",
      "On Thursday, Walmart said it plans to hike prices this month to offset the cost of new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration.",
      "Extending the 2017 tax cuts",
      "As well as calling for deeper cuts in federal spending, the Republican lawmakers blocking the tax bill also want to move up\u00a0work requirements\u00a0for some Medicaid recipients, which under the current bill wouldn't kick in until 2029.",
      "Other Republicans want a bigger deduction cap on state and local taxes, known as SALT, that can be applied on people's\u00a0federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000.",
      "But the bill's basic outline for cutting taxes isn't a focus of debate among Republicans, who are seeking to extend Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill would also add a host of other cuts, such as eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, while also providing a more generous standard deduction.",

      "The investigation found that expired sales labels led to overcharges on more than 150 grocery items, with an average overcharge of $1.70 per item, or 18.4%. For instance, a bag of Mission Flour Tortillas at a Harris Teeter in Alexandria, Virginia, was advertised as on sale for $2.99, while customers were charged $4.99.",
      "Although pricing mistakes were not found at all the Kroger stores in the investigation, the probe found issues at over half of the 26 locations it examined.",

      "\"Even if the incidents are careless rather than calculated, it creates a perception that Kroger is ripping people off,\" said Neil Saunders, an analyst with retail industry research firm GlobalData in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not what any grocery retailer wants or needs when the consumer is looking to maximize value for money.\"",
      "Kroger not alone in overcharging claims",

One is that in states in the Midwest and the South, where the retailer has a strong foothold, Kroger is often one of just a few places to choose from for grocery shopping.",
      "Kravitz also pointed to the persistent flow of complaints from Kroger customers over out-of-date sales prices, dating back to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Ohio, for example, the attorney general's office has received nearly 60 complaints of price tag and overcharge issues at Kroger since 2021.",
      "\"Almost every single time I go in the store, the listed price of an item is NOT what rings up at the register,\" Belpre resident Allison Hadfield noted in one of three complaints she and her husband, Derek, filed against their local Kroger store, according to Consumer Reports.",

      "The House Republican bill to enact President Trump's domestic policy agenda contains a provision that has prompted opposition from the Mexican government \u2014 a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries.",
      "The payments, known as remittances, would be subject to a 5% excise tax that would encompass more than 40 million people, including green card holders and nonimmigrant visa holders, such as people on H-1B, H-2A and H-2B visas. U.S. citizens would be exempt.",
      "In a May 13 letter to the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, Esteban Moctezuma Barrag\u00e1n, Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., urged Chairman Jason Smith and Ranking Member Richard Neal to reconsider the proposal.",
      "\"We respectfully urge you to reconsider this section of the legislative proposal, and we remain available to continue dialogue on the matter,\" wrote Barrag\u00e1n and Robert Velasco Alvarez, Mexico's chief officer for North America.",
      "Spokespeople for both Smith and Neal did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In April, President Trump hinted at a crackdown on remittances, announcing in a Truth Social Post\u00a0that the administration was \"finalizing a presidential memorandum to shut down remittances sent by illegal aliens outside of the United States.\" But details on the presidential proposal were unclear.",
      "The remittance tax provisions in the bill have become an international flashpoint. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has also criticized the plan and urged Republican lawmakers to reconsider it.",
      "At a press briefing this week, Sheinbaum warned that the proposal \"would damage the economy of both nations and is also contrary to the spirit of economic freedom that the U.S. government claims to defend.\"",
      "\"Remittances are the fruit of the efforts of those who, through their honest work, strengthen not only the Mexican economy but also the United States', which is why we consider this measure to be arbitrary and unjust,\" she said.",
      "An estimate by the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies, which is cited in the letter, found that Mexican migrant workers sent on average 16.7% of their labor income as remittances.",
      "\"In other words, more than 80% of the income generated by this community remains in the U.S. economy,\" the letter says.",
      "The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, however, that the proposal would generate a little more than $1 billion in tax revenue in fiscal year 2026, and rise to about $3 billion by 2034.",
      "In the letter to lawmakers, Barrag\u00e1n said the proposal would amount to double taxation, \"since migrants already pay taxes in the country where they work.\"",
      "\"Imposing a tax on these transfers would disproportionately affect those with the least, without accounting for their ability to pay,\" he added and also warned of other unintended consequences.",
      "\"Many migrants might seek informal or unregulated means to do so, complicating oversight and control of these financial flows. This would not only reduce the expected revenue but also increase risks related to financial security, tax evasion and money laundering,\" he wrote.",
      "Barrag\u00e1n has been meeting with lawmakers in recent days and discussing the matter with them. On Tuesday, he hosted a dinner for members of Congress, including Texas Rep. Tony Gonzalez, whose district spans the length of much of the state's border with Mexico and is home to many migrant workers. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast and Florida Rep Maria Elvira Salazar attended the dinner.",
      "Salazar said, when asked about the proposal, she was still assessing the legislation and who exactly it will affect, noting that banks already charge fees for such transactions.",
      "\"I just want what's fair, what's just and what's Christian,\" she said.",
      "Separately, Barragan met with Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick and also discussed the remittance measure.",
      "Representatives for the electronic payment transfer industry also expressed concern that this proposal would harm vulnerable communities.",
      "\"Such a measure would harm the most financially vulnerable consumers, undermine small businesses, disrupt critical financial regulations, and weaken law enforcement's ability to combat illicit activity,\" the Electronic Transactions Association wrote to Smith and Neal.",

      "The new dress code, which went into effect on Monday, requires employees at company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada to wear a solid black shirt and khaki, black or blue denim bottoms under their green apron.",
      "Under the previous dress code, baristas could wear a broader range of dark colors and patterned shirts. Starbucks said the new rules would make its green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers as it tries to establish a warmer, more welcoming feeling in its stores.",
      "The new dress code comes as the company works on its\u00a0\"Back to Starbucks\"\u00a0mission, aimed at revitalizing its cafes and boosting sales. CEO Brian Niccol, who was brought on from Chipotle to lead the coffee chain\u00a0last year, has said \"there's a shared sense that we have drifted from our core.\"",
      "But Starbucks Workers United, the union that represents workers at 570 of Starbucks' 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores, said the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining.",

Instead of listening to baristas who make the Starbucks experience what it is, they are focused on all the wrong things, like implementing a restrictive new dress code,\" said Paige Summers, a Starbucks shift supervisor from Hanover, Maryland. \"Customers don't care what color our clothes are when they're waiting 30 minutes for a latte.\"",
      "Most stores remain open",

Earlier this year, Rubio said 83% of programs funded by the federal agency were being canceled after it became a target for the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Van Hollen also said that Rubio has \"made a mockery of our country's refugee process, turning it into a system of global apartheid where political ideology and race more than truth or need matter.\" The criticism was in reference to the Trump administration granting refugee status to White South Africans over claims that they have faced discrimination by the country's post-apartheid government.",

      "According to the notice sent May 9 by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's civil fines department and provided to CBS News, the 41-year-old Florida woman and mother of three, who CBS News has chosen not to name, was charged $500 for every day she has remained in the U.S. since the removal order was issued in April 2005, running up a total of $1,821,350.",
      "In a May 20 statement provided to CBS News in response to the fine, an ICE spokesperson said that undocumented immigrants \"who violate the nation's immigration laws and fail to comply with a removal order issued by a Department of Justice Immigration Judge will face legal consequences, such as fines or imprisonment. The best option is to comply with the law and leave the United States.\"",
      "The DHS spokesperson also encouraged undocumented immigrants \"to use the CBP Home app to self-deport.\"",
      "This case represents an enforcement of the civil fines listed under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which also requires undocumented immigrants to register with the U.S. government, according to Michelle Sanchez, the Florida-based immigration attorney representing the Honduran immigrant.",
      "In February, the Trump administration announced its plans to penalize those living in the U.S. illegally under that immigration act. It encompasses a range of regulations but has historically rarely been enforced since its implementation.",
      "According to Sanchez, the removal order was issued after the woman failed to show up to a court hearing in 2005.",
      "In 2024, Sanchez filed a motion to reopen her client's case and have the removal order lifted, arguing the Honduran woman was eligible to apply for U.S. residency because she had resided in the U.S. for more than 10 years with no criminal record.",
      "Sanchez said her client is also a mother of three U.S. citizen children who would be qualifying relatives as they would suffer extreme and exceptionally unusual hardships if she were deported.",
      "Under the Biden administration, ICE attorneys were given discretion to reopen cases to lift removal orders. Hundreds of thousands of these requests were left pending, however, according to Sanchez. In March, ICE notified the Florida immigration lawyer they could not reopen her client's case because the Trump administration did not offer guidance on such prosecutorial discretion.",
      "Sanchez told CBS News she has seen an uptick in ICE issuing fines to her clients who remain in the country illegally, but the million dollar civil fine marks a first.",
      "\"ICE is terrorizing individuals without even having to go pick them up,\" Sanchez said. \"They are terrorizing them by sending these notices where they are fining individuals an exorbitant amount of money that a person sometimes doesn't even make that amount in their lifetime.\"",
      "The notice sent to the Florida mother of three indicates that the fine can be contested, and that requesting a personal interview to do so is an option.",
      "\"They're going into the lion's den,\" Sanchez said, adding that anyone who receives such a notice should first reach out to their immigration lawyer before showing up in person to contest fines.",

    "summary": "The Navy is disciplining at least two members of SEAL Team 4 after racist memes were shared in a Signal chat to a Black fellow SEAL, two sources familiar told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The Navy is disciplining at least two members of SEAL Team 4 after racist memes, including one depicting slavery, were shared in a Signal chat to a Black fellow SEAL, two sources familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "The memes were initially shared several years ago, but resurfaced recently after the Black sailor who was targeted reported them. The SEAL who reported the memes, citing racism and bullying, previously had his Trident \u2014 which is given to SEALs \u2014 revoked, but the Navy has since reinstated it, the sources said.",
      "The memes were developed by two enlisted SEALs based in Virginia who now face non-judicial punishment and punitive letters in their files, The Associated Press reported. Both actions can be career-ending, or can result in demotions or loss of pay.",
      "Platoon and team leaders are also facing administrative actions, including disciplinary letters in their files, after a probe found they did not adequately address the sailor's concerns about racist behavior and that the decision to revoke his qualifications was flawed, according to The AP.",
      "\"This was a very shocking case of explicit and repeated racist memes directed at our client in a platoon-wide text thread,\" the sailor's lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, told The AP. \"They modified his face in photos to look like a monkey and portrayed him as a chained slave on a slave ship, among others.\"",
      "Parlatore praised Rear Adm. Jamie Sands, head of Naval Special Warfare, and his staff for taking swift action to \"investigate, reverse the negative repercussions that our client received, and move to hold people accountable.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Naval Special Warfare Command told CBS News on Tuesday that the Navy \"investigated serious allegations of unprofessional conduct within one of our commands\" and \"accountability actions are ongoing.\"",
      "\"We are dedicated to fostering a climate of dignity and respect, and after conducting a thorough and fair investigation, we will hold anyone found responsible of misconduct accountable,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "A defense official told The AP that the sailor filed more than a dozen specific complaints about racist behavior and about half were substantiated. As leaders began to look into the complaints, a second sailor \u2014 who is White \u2014 also complained about bullying by other platoon members. That amplified the broader concerns about the command climate and the later findings of leadership failures.",
      "This is the latest significant investigation into behavior issues and command failures at Naval Special Warfare Command. And it underscores racial concerns that are not new to the special warfare leaders.",
      "Commando forces across the services \u2014 particularly the officers \u2014 tend to be far less diverse than the military as a whole. Leaders in recent years have tried to attract a wider array of recruits in order to develop a more diverse force.",
      "Those efforts, however, could be threatened now, as the Trump administration and Defense Department leaders have made it a priority to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the military and the government as a whole.",
      "As of March 2021, a full 95% of all SEAL and combatant-craft crew officers were White and just 2% were Black, according to Naval Special Warfare statistics provided to The AP. The enlisted ranks were only slightly more diverse.",
      "Those numbers are starkly different from the overall Navy population, where about 40% of the enlisted force and 24% of its officers are non-White.",
      "Acting Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson told CBS News: \"Secretary [Pete] Hegseth's work to rid the Department of Defense from the previous administration's divisive DEI agenda is vital to ensuring that racism has no place in our Armed Forces. Giving our service members preferential treatment on the basis of race \u2014in violation of federal law \u2014is the very definition of racism. Secretary Hegseth is refocusing our military on merit and putting ability before immutable characteristics again.\"",
      "Other recent investigations also found training and command problems.",
      "Last October, a highly critical review by the Navy found that two Navy SEALs drowned as they tried to climb aboard a ship carrying illicit Iranian-made weapons to Yemen because of glaring training failures and a lack of understanding about what to do after falling into deep, turbulent waters.",
      "And in 2023, a Navy investigation into the death of a SEAL candidate a year earlier concluded that the training program was plagued by widespread failures in medical care, poor oversight and the use of performance-enhancing drugs that have increased the risk of injury and death to those seeking to become elite commandos.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-medicaid-glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-obesity-states/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 20:19:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Late last year, South Carolina Medicaid approved GLP-1s to treat obesity, placing it among the few state programs covering the drugs. But access remains limited.",
    "story": [
      "CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 When Page Campbell's doctor recommended that she try an injectable prescription drug called Wegovy to lose weight before scheduling bariatric surgery, she readily agreed.",
      "\"I've struggled with my weight for so long,\" said Campbell, 40, a single mother of two. \"I'm not opposed to trying anything.\"",
      "In early April, about four weeks after she'd started taking Wegovy, Campbell said she hadn't experienced any side effects, such as nausea or bowel irritation. But she doesn't use a scale at home, so she said she didn't know whether she'd lost any weight since her most recent medical appointment earlier this year, when she weighed 314 pounds. Still, she was confident about achieving weight loss.",
      "\"It's going to work because I'm putting in the work. I'm changing my eating habits. I'm exercising,\" said Campbell, a shipping manager at a Michaels store. \"I'm not going to second-guess myself.\"",
      "Wegovy belongs to a pricey class of drugs called GLP-1s (short for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists) that have upended the treatment of obesity in recent years, offering hope to patients who have tried and failed to lose weight in myriad other ways.",
      "Campbell gained access to Wegovy through South Carolina Medicaid's decision in late 2024 to cover these weight loss drugs. But the medications remain out of reach for millions of patients across the country who could benefit from them, because many public and private health insurers have deemed the drugs too expensive.",
      "A report published in November by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, found only 13 states were covering GLP-1s for the treatment of obesity for Medicaid beneficiaries as of August 2024. South Carolina became the 14th in November.",
      "Liz Williams, one of the report's authors and a senior policy manager for the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, said she was not aware of any other state Medicaid programs joining the list since then. Looking ahead, the remaining states may be reluctant to add a new, expensive drug benefit while they brace for potential federal cuts coming from Congress, she said.",
      "\"As the budget debate, federally, is developing, that may impact how states are thinking about this,\" Williams said.",
      "The federal government won't be helping anytime soon, either. Medicare covers GLP-1s to treat diabetes and some other health conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, but not obesity. In early April, the Trump administration announced it will not finalize a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would have allowed an estimated 7.4 million people covered by Medicare and Medicaid to access GLP-1s for weight loss. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is poised to force less expensive, compounded versions of these drugs off the market.",
      "And the barrier to entry remains high, even for Medicaid patients in those few states that have agreed to cover the drugs without a federal mandate.",
      "Case in point: In South Carolina, where more than one-third of all adults, and nearly half of the African American population, qualify as obese, the state Medicaid agency estimates only 1,300 beneficiaries will meet the stringent prerequisites for GLP-1 coverage.",
      "Under one of those requirements, Medicaid beneficiaries who wish to access these drugs to lose weight must attest to \"increased exercise activity,\" said Jeff Leieritz, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Campbell, who is insured by Medicaid, was granted coverage for Wegovy based on her body mass index. First, though, she was required to submit six months' worth of documentation proving that she'd tried and failed to lose weight after receiving nutrition counseling and going on a 1,200-calorie-a day diet, said Kenneth Mitchell, one of Campbell's doctors and the medical director for bariatric surgery and obesity medicine at Roper St. Francis Healthcare.",
      "Campbell's Wegovy prescription was approved for six months, Mitchell said. When that authorization expires, Campbell and her health care team will need to submit more documentation, including proof that she has lost at least 5% of her body weight and has kept up with nutrition counseling.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Send a prescription in and they cover it.' It's rather arduous,\" Mitchell said. \"Not a lot of folks are going to do this.\"",
      "Mitchell said South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover these drugs was met with excitement among those working in his medical specialty. But he wasn't surprised that the state anticipates relatively few people will access this benefit annually, since the approval process is so rigorous and the cost high. \"The problem is the medicines are so expensive,\" Mitchell said.",
      "Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Wegovy, announced in March that it was cutting the monthly price for the drug from $650 to $499 for cash-paying customers. The price that health insurance plans and beneficiaries pay for these drugs varies, but some GLP-1s cost more than $1,000 per patient per month, Mitchell said, and many people will need to take them for the rest of their lives to maintain weight loss.",
      "\"That is a tremendous price tag that someone has to foot the bill for,\" Mitchell said.",
      "That's the reason the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees voted last year to end coverage of GLP-1s for state employees, after then-North Carolina Treasurer Dale Folwell's office estimated in 2023 that the drugs were projected to cost the State Health Plan $1 billion over the next six years. The decision came only a few months after a separate North Carolina agency announced it would start covering these drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. North Carolina Medicaid has estimated it will spend $16 million a year on GLP-1s.",
      "South Carolina Medicaid, which insures fewer than half the number of people enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid, anticipates spending less. Leieritz estimated GLP-1s and nutrition counseling offered to Medicaid beneficiaries in South Carolina will cost $10 million a year. State funding will cover $3.3 million of the expense; the remainder will be paid for by matching Medicaid funds from the federal government.",
      "In a recent interview, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn't rule out the possibility that Medicare and Medicaid might cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment in the future as costs come down.",
      "They're \"extraordinary drugs\" and \"we're going to reduce the cost,\" Kennedy told CBS News in early April. He said he would like GLP-1s to eventually be made available to Medicare and Medicaid patients who are seeking obesity treatment after they have tried other ways to lose weight. \"That is the framework that we're now debating.\"",
      "Meanwhile, public health experts have applauded South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover GLP-1s. Yet the new benefit won't help the vast majority of the 1.5 million adults in South Carolina who are classified as obese, according to data published by the South Carolina Department of Public Health.",
      "\"We still have some work to do,\" acknowledged Brannon Traxler, the public health department's chief medical officer.",
      "But the state's new \"Action Plan for Healthy Eating and Active Living,\" written by a coalition of groups in South Carolina, including the Department of Public Health, makes no mention of GLP-1s or the role they might play in lowering obesity rates in the state.",
      "The action plan, underwritten by a $1.5 million federal grant, isn't meant to lay out an overarching approach for lowering obesity in South Carolina, Traxler said. Instead, it promotes physical activity in schools, nutrition, and the expansion of outdoor walking trails, among other strategies. A more comprehensive obesity plan might address the benefits of surgical intervention and GLP-1s, but those also carry risk, expense, and side effects, Traxler said.",
      "\"Certainly, I think, there is a need to bring it all together,\" she said.",
      "Campbell, for one, is taking the comprehensive approach. On top of injecting Wegovy once weekly, she said, she is prioritizing protein intake and moving her body. She also underwent weight loss surgery in late April.",
      "\"Weight loss is my biggest goal,\" said Campbell, who expressed appreciation for Medicaid's coverage of Wegovy. \"It's one more thing that's going to help me get to my goal.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump met Tuesday with House Republicans as leaders try to push a massive budget package containing the president's legislative priorities over its last hurdle before it can get to the floor.",
      "The president put pressure on members to fall in line as the party's dueling factions have threatened to upend the plan as they set down apparent red lines that don't align with the demands made from other members. Upon arriving on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump suggested that any Republican who doesn't back what he refers to as the \"big, beautiful bill\" would be \"knocked out so fast,\" citing a handful of \"grandstanders.\"",
      "\"It's the biggest bill ever passed, and we've got to get it done,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, can only afford three defections in a floor vote, if all members are present and voting, given his slim majority. All Democrats are expected to oppose it.",
      "\"I would say that if the vote were held right now, it dies a painful death,\" said Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee, who said he would vote \"no\" on the package in its current form.",
      "But first, the legislation will go before the Rules Committee, which is set to meet at 1 a.m. It's the last stop for most legislation before the full House votes on a measure.",
      "In a promising sign, Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, one of the conservative holdouts who stalled the bill\u00a0in the Budget Committee, said he would allow it to advance out of the Rules Committee, where he is also a member.",
      "\"I'm not going to kill it in Rules,\" Norman told reporters Monday night. \"It needs to go to the floor.\"",
      "When asked after the meeting with Mr. Trump on Tuesday whether he would support the bill on the House floor, Norman said \"we'll see.\"",
      "The committee's rare late-night meeting comes as Republican leadership races to pass the budget package before their self-imposed Memorial Day deadline.",
      "Johnson has been meeting with the different factions in recent days to hear the demands and build a consensus around a modified version of the legislation that was produced by nearly a dozen House committees.",
      "Conservatives, who are upset that that bill does not make steep enough spending cuts to significantly bring down the deficit, have pushed for Medicaid work requirements to kick in much sooner than a 2029 deadline. They also want to eliminate all the clean energy subsidies that were implemented under the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"It is unfortunately front-loaded in deficits and backloaded in savings, which I do not like,\" Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, another conservative holdout, said Monday. \"None of my votes are guaranteed at this point.\"",
      "The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the original version of the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.",
      "Conservatives have also been pushing to change the rate by which the federal government pays states for Medicaid, a point of contention with moderates, who have warned against larger cuts to the program.",
      "Johnson reiterated Monday that the change has \"been off the table for quite some time.\" And Mr. Trump said ahead of the meeting Tuesday morning that \"we're not doing anything cutting of anything meaningful,\" adding that on Medicaid, \"the only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "A provision on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, is facing pushback from a group of Republicans from blue states, who have threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands are met. And after a meeting with Johnson Monday night, an agreement appeared to remain out of reach.",
      "GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York outlined ahead of the meeting that the group of moderates had no plans to cave. And on his message to conservatives, Lawler told reporters, \"if they think we're going to throw our constituents under the bus to appease them, it's not happening.\"",
      "\"The fact is, we wouldn't even be in this position right now if you didn't have members in seats like mine who won,\" Lawler said.",
      "Mr. Trump also weighed in on the SALT issue, suggesting that he opposes raising the cap because he claimed Democratic governors from states like New York, Illinois and California would benefit, calling them the \"biggest\" beneficiaries.",
      "According to a senior White House official, Mr. Trump told the House GOP conference during the meeting that they should not let division over the SALT cap get in the way of the bill, and said they should not touch Medicaid, except for addressing waste, fraud and abuse, along with cutting benefits for noncitizens and imposing work requirements. The official said Mr. Trump also made clear he wants every Republican to vote \"yes\" on the bill, while saying he's losing patience with the remaining holdouts.",
      "Johnson said at a news conference following the meeting that leadership would now work to \"gather up the small subgroups in the House Republican conference and tie up the remaining loose ends.\"",
      "\"We are going to get this done,\" the speaker added.",
      "Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican, said Mr. Trump was \"emphatic we need to quit screwing around\" on the budget package. He said 98% of the conference is \"ready to go,\" and was \"pumped up\" by the president, while noting that \"he did move\" the holdouts.",
      "\"I don't know that we are there yet, but that was a hugely impactful meeting,\" Johnson said.",
      "When the meeting let out after nearly two hours Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters \"that was a meeting of love.\"",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to release a report Thursday on how pesticides and other issues may be linked to childhood chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought Tuesday to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals like glyphosate that he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S.",
      "\"I have said repeatedly throughout this process, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\"",
      "The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a \"Make America Healthy Again Commission,\" which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.",
      "Targets include the \"potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures\" in children. Kennedy said their report was due to be released Thursday.",
      "\"Your information about the report is just simply wrong,\" Kennedy told Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi in response to a question about the report. \"The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\"",
      "Hyde-Smith had told Kennedy that she was \"deeply concerned\" that the report will \"unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools\" that U.S. farmers use.",
      "\"We all know what confirmation bias is. It's no secret that you were involved with pesticide litigation, prior to becoming secretary,\" Hyde-Smith told Kennedy.",
      "What has RFK Jr. said about pesticides like glyphosate?",
      "Kennedy has criticized the use of several pesticides in the U.S. food supply, including as an environmental attorney during court battles with chemical manufacturer Monsanto over accusations that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup \u2014 made from the chemical glyphosate \u2014 was causing cancer.",
      "\"If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luther. I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value,\" Kennedy wrote in a 2020 Facebook post.",
      "During his longshot independent presidential campaign, Kennedy pledged to get toxins out of the food supply, warning that \"toxic chemicals like glyphosate\" were widely contaminating what Americans were eating.",
      "He continued that criticism in the months ahead of the 2024 election as he stumped in support of President Trump, recalling how his son resolved his \"really agonizing\" eczema by switching to eating pasta made in Europe.",
      "\"As soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema,\" he told Donald Trump Jr. on a podcast in September of last year. \"And you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do, that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food.\"",
      "What will be in RFK Jr.'s \"MAHA Commission\" report?",
      "One of Kennedy's top HHS advisers, Calley Means \u2014 whose sister Dr. Casey Means was nominated by President Trump earlier this month for the surgeon general post \u2014 said that the report is aimed at outlining \"obvious\" ways that children are \"being poisoned through areas that there's not even that much scientific disagreement on.\"",
      "\"Obviously, it's because of environmental toxins,\" Means said, speaking at a May 15 event hosted by the Kennedy-aligned MAHA Institute. \"We produce and ingest 25% of the world's pesticides.

      "Sun announced he will attend Thursday evening's dinner at Mr. Trump's D.C.-area golf club \u2014 which is open to the 220 largest holders of the $TRUMP meme coin \u2014 in a post on X, describing himself as the president's \"TOP fan.\"",

      "What is the $TRUMP meme coin \u2014 and why is it controversial?",
      "The meme coin was launched in January, days before Mr. Trump's inauguration. An affiliate of the Trump organization and a firm called Fight Fight Fight LLC control 80% of the coin's total supply.",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is driven mostly by online buzz, especially on social media. They typically do not have intrinsic value and are not used for transactions. Like many meme coins, $TRUMP is known for erratic price shifts: Its price peaked at around $75 shortly after its launch, but plummeted to under $8 by early April.",

      "\"The President is working to secure GOOD deals for the American people, not for himself. President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public \u2013 which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement Tuesday.",

    "summary": "Former President Joe Biden\u200b has been diagnosed with an advanced stage of prostate cancer\u200b that has metastasized, or spread, to his bones.",
    "story": [
      "Former President Joe Biden's diagnosis\u00a0with an advanced stage of prostate cancer that has metastasized, or spread, to his bones prompted an outpouring of concern and questions about his condition. Those questions include how long the cancer may have taken to develop and whether he was screened for it during earlier checkups.",
      "A spokesperson said Biden first learned of his diagnosis late last week. \"Prior to Friday, President Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "While it's unclear exactly how long the cancer may have been growing, its rapid spread is attributed to it being an aggressive form of the disease. His cancer was categorized as having a Gleason score of 9, which places him in Grade Group 5, the most severe category. The Gleason score is a system for grading the severity of prostate cancer based on analysis of cell samples under a microscope.",
      "When prostate cancer is more advanced and spreads, the bones are among the areas most likely to be affected. It\u00a0can also commonly spread to the lymph nodes, liver or lungs, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Unfortunately, late-stage cancer diagnoses are not uncommon. A 2014 analysis from Cancer Research UK, for example, found that 46% of all cancers\u00a0in that country were diagnosed at an advanced stage. A\u00a02023 study published in the journal Lancet Oncology found disruptions in care amid the pandemic also led to an increase in late-stage diagnoses across nearly all cancer types, including prostate.",
      "Slower-growing cancers can take years to develop and be detected, while more aggressive ones can become apparent more rapidly and also spread to other parts of the body quicker.",
      "Biden, who is now 82, did not undergo prostate cancer screening during his last medical checkup while in office, in February 2024, according to records released at the time. His spokesperson said Tuesday that Biden's last known prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test \u2014 a blood test which is used to screen for prostate cancer \u2014 was in 2014.",
      "Experts say this is likely due to that fact that these screenings are\u00a0not routinely recommended\u00a0for men 70 years or older.",
      "\"Doctors will stop screening for prostate cancer at 75 or so, because after that, the prostate cancers you typically pick up are very slow growing, and so the harms of all of the testing and treatment for something that may not kill you \u2014 you're talking about risk versus benefit. It may not be worth the risk,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, explained on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Instead, Biden's diagnosis came after he recently saw a doctor due to urinary symptoms. A small nodule was found in the prostate, which necessitated further evaluation, his office said last week.",
      "\"Urinary symptoms are quite common in older men and are usually due to benign conditions like having an enlarged prostate,\" Gounder said. In this case, however, the testing discovered cancer.",
      "Gounder said the situation underscores the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual.",
      "\"He had new symptoms and is functionally active, which justified a closer look,\" she said.",
      "There have been advancements in treating advanced prostate cancer, and Gounder said the treatment goal in a case like this would be to control the cancer, slowing its progression and preserving quality of life. Biden's type of cancer is hormone-sensitive, which means it should respond to a testosterone-blocking treatment, Gounder said, adding that this might be combined with other medications or chemotherapy, depending on the specific case.",
      "Back in 2019, Biden was diagnosed with benign enlargement of the prostate, or BPH. That December, his campaign released his medical evaluation, which noted: \"This patient has been treated for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). This was initially treated with medication and was then definitively treated with surgery. He has never had prostate cancer.\"",
      "BPH is very common in older men, with around 80% of men over 70 having it, according to Yale Medicine.",
      "How do doctors screen for prostate cancer?",
      "Prostate cancer testing typically involves two methods: a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test and a digital rectal exam, or DRE. A PSA test is a type of blood test that can indicate a higher chance of prostate cancer but is not a definitive diagnosis. A DRE involves a doctor using a gloved finger to feel for any bumps on the prostate via the rectum.",
      "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of national experts, say the decision on screening for prostate cancer among men aged 55 to 69 years should be an individual one \u2014 and it recommends against PSA screening for men 70 and older.",
      "\"Many men will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction,\" the task force's recommendation summary notes. \"Clinicians should not screen men who do not express a preference for screening.\"",
      "Prostate cancer is common, second only to skin cancer as the most common cancer affecting males, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. According to the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for every 100 males, 13 will develop prostate cancer at some point in their lives.",

      "The president also said the budget package Republicans are currently ironing out on Capitol Hill will include an initial $25 billion to begin construction on the missile defense system. Mr. Trump said the project's total cost will be about $175 billion, although it could be much more. Congress hasn't yet funded any of the project, although Mr. Trump told reporters he thinks it'll be easy to fund on Capitol Hill.",
      "\"Today, I'm pleased to announce that we have officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system that will deploy next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors,\" the president announced in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "Mr. Trump said the project should be \"fully operational before the end of my term,\" which would be before January 2029. The president said the system will be built in states including Alaska, Florida, Georgia and Indiana, and involve multiple, yet-to-be-selected American defense and technology companies.",
      "Canada wants to be involved in the project, the president said, adding that the U.S. wants to help Canada as it can.",
      "\"Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" he said. \"And we will have the best system ever built.\"",
      "The president told reporters that he suggested a comprehensive new missile defense system to U.S. military leaders, and they agreed, not the other way around.",
      "\"I suggested it and they all said, 'We love the idea, sir.' That's the way it's gotta be, right? But they want it. And they wanted it badly once it was suggested.\"",
      "The president has for months expressed a desire for a defense system like Israel's. In his March joint address to Congress, the president requested funding for the system.",
      "\"I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome shield to protect our homeland,\" the president said in his address to Congress. \"All made in the USA. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. And other places have it. Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too.\"",
      "A new, unclassified assessment from the Pentagon's intelligence agency shows what threats the U.S. needs to defend itself from in the next decade.",
      "The Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, expects that missile threats to the U.S. will expand both in scale and sophistication, as the U.S. faces threats from foreign actors in the shape of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, two types of hypersonic weapons, land attack cruise missiles, and fractional orbital bombardment systems.",
      "Mr. Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" in the vein of Israel's Iron Dome, the country's mobile all-weather air defense system that has intercepted projectiles since its installation in 2011. However, Israel's Iron Dome largely defends against shorter-range threats, like rockets, while it has two other air defense systems to defend against missiles, which are increasingly being used in conflict.",
      "\"Missile threats to the U.S. homeland will expand in scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" the assessment says. \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses, but traditional ballistic missiles \u2014 which are guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight \u2014 will remain the primary threat to the homeland. North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.\"",
      "The assessment warns that China, Iran and North Korea will have significantly more intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\" Although Iran doesn't currently have known ICBMs, the DIA assessment suggests it will have 60 by 2035. Keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear power has been a key goal of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The assessment also warns that China's submarine-launched ballistic missiles will increase in number by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing adversary SLBMs.\" Russia, too, has submarine-launched ballistic missiles.",
      "Further, the assessment warns that both China and Russia will increase their boosted hypersonic weapons multiple times over by 2035. The report says that Russia and China can reach parts of the U.S. with these systems. The report also says China and Russia's land attack cruise missile capacity will significantly increase by 2035, and both countries have the potential to reach parts of the U.S.",
      "Finally, the report says both Russia and China are expected to have what's known as fractional orbital bombardment systems by 2035. These will be able to orbit the globe, traveling over the South Pole to avoid early detection.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday restored for now a Maine state lawmaker's\u00a0right to vote in the state House of Representatives after she was punished for a social media post that identified a transgender student athlete.",
      "The high court granted the request for emergency relief sought by Laurel Libby, who represents House District 90 and was censured by her colleagues for a social media post that criticized the state for allowing transgender athletes at public high schools to compete in girls sports. The online posting from Libby called out a transgender athlete who competed in the state's track-and-field championship.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from Supreme Court's decision to grant an injunction.",
      "Libby shared the post that sparked her punishment to Facebook in February and included photos and the name of the athlete, who placed first in the girls' pole vault. Maine allows transgender students to participate in athletics in accordance with their gender identity. The Justice Department has sued the state's Department of Education over its policy, which the Trump administration says discriminates against women in violation of Title IX. The suit came after President Trump signed an executive order in February barring transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that align with their gender identity.",
      "In response to Libby's social media post, the Maine House voted to censure her. The resolution stated that Libby refused to remove her post after she was warned it might endanger the athlete and said \"it is a basic tenet of politics and good moral character that children should not be targeted by adult politicians, especially when that targeting could result in serious harm.\"",
      "The censure measure directed Libby to \"accept full responsibility for the incident and publicly apologize to the House and to the people of the state of Maine.\" Libby, it concluded, \"must comport herself in a manner that pursues the highest standards of legislative conduct.",
      "After the resolution was approved by the state House, Libby was brought to the well of the chamber and instructed to apologize. When she refused to do so, the House speaker found her in violation of a centuries-old Maine House rule that bars a member who is in breach of the body's rules from participating in debates or voting on matters before it until the member has \"made satisfaction.\"",
      "Libby and six of her constituents sued in federal court to have her right to vote in the Maine House restored. A federal district court declined to provide them with preliminary relief, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit rejected a request to intervene.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Libby said her constituents do not have equal representation in the chamber. The punishment leaves them \"without a voice or vote for every bill coming to the House floor for the rest of [Libby's] elected term.\" Libby was first elected to the state legislature in 2020, and her current term runs through 2026.",
      "But Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey argued that Libby is seeking the Supreme Court's intervention in an \"intra-parliamentary dispute\" that, if granted, would pierce legislative immunity for core legislative acts.",
      "\"The power of a legislative body to punish its members has been recognized in the common law since ancient times and has been enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and many state constitutions, including Maine's, since the birth of our republic,\" he wrote. \"Likewise, the act of tallying a floor vote to determine whether a measure succeeds or fails is an integral act in the legislative process. An injunction directing how such processes may unfold would be contrary to the policy of insulating legislative activity from 'outside interference' that undergirds this court's immunity jurisprudence.\"",
      "Writing in dissent, Jackson criticized the Supreme Court's decision to grant Libby emergency relief at this stage in the proceedings and said it has in recent years been too quick to intervene.",
      "\"The watering down of our court's standards for granting emergency relief is, to me, an unfortunate development,\" Jackson wrote, adding that the manner in which the Supreme Court handles emergency appeals \u2014 quickly without full briefing and holding oral argument \u2014 is \"hardly a model for sound decisionmaking.\"",
      "She continued: \"At the very least, by lowering the bar for granting emergency relief, the Court itself will bear responsibility for the resulting systemic disruption, as a surge in requests for our 'extraordinary' intervention \u2014 at earlier and earlier stages of ongoing lower court proceedings, and with greater and greater frequency \u2014 will undoubtedly follow.\"",

Baraka was charged with one count of misdemeanor trespassing, which, if convicted, could have resulted in a maximum of 30 days in jail.",
      "A special agent with the Newark, New Jersey, division of Homeland Security's investigation team alleged in a sworn affidavit that after McIver and others attempted to block Baraka's arrest by creating a human shield, she \"slammed her forearm into the body\" of a uniformed Homeland Security Investigations agent and \"reached out and tried to restrain\" that agent from grabbing the mayor. He also alleged that after Baraka was in custody, the congresswoman \"pushed an ICE officer,\" and \"used each of her forearms to forcibly strike\" them.",
      "In a statement after the charges were announced, McIver said that the charges are \"purely political\" and \"mischaracterize and distort\" what happened outside Delaney Hall. Paul J. Fishman, an attorney for McIver, said it was \"spectacularly inappropriate\" to charge her over the Delaney Hall incident, and said that \"ICE agents chose to escalate what should have been a peaceful situation into chaos.\"",
      "She added that the charges are \"meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight\" of ICE detention centers and said she looks forward to \"the truth being laid out clearly in court.\"",
      "McIver told reporters Tuesday on Capitol Hill that she was not made aware of the charges before Habba's X post, and said that she found out about the decision to charge her on the social media site. Habba's post announcing the charges before they were filed and unsealed was a break from traditional Justice Department precedent. For years, charges would be filed and unsealed before the Justice Department commented on the case.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey has not responded to comment on why the charges were publicly announced before being unsealed.",
      "In footage posted online by the Department of Homeland Security, McIver, wearing a red jacket, can be seen along the Delaney Hall fence as Baraka is being arrested. As the group of protestors and law enforcement groups together and starts to brush up against each other, McIver is spotted using her elbows to move herself past an officer.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's cuts to medical research grants have disrupted awards once backed by former President Joe Biden's \"Cancer Moonshot\" initiative\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Steep cuts to federal medical research grants this year have now disrupted millions in awards once backed by former President Joe Biden's \"Cancer Moonshot\" initiative, after the Trump administration froze funding to Columbia University and Harvard University over their handling of campus protests about the war in Gaza.",
      "Biden revealed Sunday he has been diagnosed with an \"aggressive form\" of prostate cancer. His \"Moonshot\" initiative was already personal because his son Beau died of brain cancer.",
      "Multiple cancer scientists at Harvard University say they have seen their National Institutes of Health funding evaporate in recent weeks due to the funding freeze.",
      "\"We are not allowed to charge anything on these grants and I understand that Harvard hasn't been reimbursed for any charges to these grants for at least 30 days,\" Joan Brugge, professor of cell biology at Harvard Medical School, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Brugge said the university had informed her that her research into mutations linked to breast cancer, as well as studying the recurrence of ovarian cancer, was among some 350 federal grants terminated at Harvard Medical School.",
      "Harvard bioengineering professor David Mooney said all cancer research funding from NIH's National Cancer Institute for his team had also been cut off, including multiple grants to post-doctoral research fellows.",
      "The Trump administration also terminated millions awarded for developing anti-cancer immunity at the university's immuno-engineering center, which was launched in 2020 as part of the \"Cancer Moonshot\" initiative. Mooney's lab was the first to engineer an \"implantable biomaterial cancer vaccine\" to retrain the immune system to destroy cancer cells, the university says.",
      "\"This will dramatically diminish our ability to make progress in developing cancer immunotherapies,\" Mooney said in an email.",
      "Under versions of the cancer initiative launched by Biden first as vice president in 2016\u00a0\u2014 and later rebooted in 2022 after he was elected president \u2014 the federal government poured more than $1 billion into a broad array of research, prevention and treatment projects.",
      "That money came largely from the 21st Century Cures Act passed by Congress in 2016, which went to more than 100 different institutions. It included millions awarded to support the work of cancer centers around the country.",
      "That also included a long-running award to support the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Now federal records show the award to support Columbia's cancer center has also been terminated.",
      "\"Anti-Semitism \u2014 like racism \u2014 is a spiritual and moral malady that sickens societies and kills people with lethalities comparable to history's most deadly plagues,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0said in a March statement, announcing plans to look for cuts to Columbia's funding.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted universities for their handling of pro-Palestinian protests on campus, alleging they let antisemitism go unchecked, which the universities dispute.",
      "NIH records show the money at Columbia's cancer center had gone to a broad array of projects, ranging from clinical studies to administrative costs.",
      "Beyond the Trump administration's cuts to Columbia and Harvard, one other award directly linked to the Biden cancer initiative is also listed as terminated: a project funded at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute to \"address cancer disparities among Indigenous sexual and gender minority populations\" with films, outreach and illustrations.",
      "Other projects funded by NIH's National Cancer Institute have also had their funding canceled after officials deemed they ran afoul of other White House executive orders that took aim at topics like \"gender ideology extremism\" and \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" programs.",
      "Support and communications staff at the cancer institute were also not spared in Kennedy and DOGE's layoffs earlier this year.",
      "Senate Democrats have criticized Kennedy and President Trump for cuts to NIH's grants this year, which they said in a report amounts to at least $15.1 million in cancer funding lost.",
      "\"Trump's war on science is an attack against anyone who has ever loved someone with cancer,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders said earlier this month.",

      "Outgoing U.S. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger confirmed to CBS News he was informed that the Justice Department has agreed to make the payment to Babbitt's family to settle its wrongful death claim.",
      "Manger told CBS News he learned of the settlement amount \"a few weeks ago\" and the same day sent a message to the entire force expressing his dismay.",

      "Metropolitan Police Department Officer Dan Hodges, who was also on duty at the Capitol on Jan. 6, said in a statement that Babbitt was \"a conspiracy theorist armed with a lethal weapon and combat training, breaking into a secure area of the Capitol who did not heed orders to cease from law enforcement.\"",

In the civil lawsuit, Babbitt's estate alleged U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd was negligent in the issue of force and his firearm. The suit also argued Byrd was not in uniform and was wearing a COVID mask when he opened fire against Babbitt. The suit accused Byrd of failing to \"de-escalate.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-tax-bill-reconcilation-deficit-moodys-debt-spending/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 06:48:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Republican tax bill could cost $3.8 trillion over 10 years as its tax cuts surpass spending reductions, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican-backed tax and spending bill that's now moving forward in the House is getting a reality check from Wall Street. That's because the proposed tax breaks are projected to far outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to mounting U.S. debt and a worsening fiscal outlook, according to economists and policy experts.",
      "If the bill moves forward without significant changes, the U.S. would likely find its debt levels spiraling higher in order to finance the tax cuts, according to several analyses. Over the next decade, the GOP bill could cost the U.S. $3.8 trillion, according to a report\u00a0earlier this month by the Joint Committee on Taxation that examined the impact of the the tax measures versus spending cuts.",
      "Those risks are rattling Wall Street. Moody's Ratings on Friday\u00a0downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the new bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, over the next decade.",
      "The bill also faces detractors within the Republican party, with the House Freedom Caucus saying in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Sunday that the bill \"fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget.\"",
      "The concern, according to both Wall Street economists and policy experts, is that adding billions in debt to the U.S. ledger could eventually squeeze federal spending because the nation would likely face higher interest payments. That, in turn, could make it more difficult to fund programs like Social Security, which is already facing a financial drawdown as baby boomers hit retirement age, or to invest in initiatives like infrastructure that can spur economic growth.",
      "\"It's time for policymakers to hit pause, go back to the drawing board and put forward a plan that actually takes steps toward putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal trajectory,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy think tank, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Our federal interest payments are skyrocketing, already surpassing what we spend annually on defense or Medicare.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it disagreed both with the Moody's analysis and forecasts that the legislation could widen the nation's deficit, which is the gap between federal spending and revenue.",
      "\"This bill does not add to the deficit,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Monday in a press conference. \"In fact, according to the Council of Economic Advisers, there's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill \u2014 that's the largest saving for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.\"",
      "Savings versus spending",
      "At the heart of the proposed GOP bill is President Trump's vow to renew his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which introduced lower tax brackets for many Americans. Because those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, about 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026 without an extension of the law,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "The Council of Economic Advisers, a White House agency that advises the president on economic issues,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May study that the new bill would \"avert a $4 trillion tax hike\" by extending the TCJA's provisions.",
      "Renewing the law's cuts alone would cost $2.2 trillion over the next decade, estimates Joint Committee on Taxation, which assesses the impact of policy for Congress. The GOP bill also includes other new tax breaks that would add to the bill's long-term costs, the group's analysis found.",
      "For instance, the bill's proposal to provide taxpayers with a more generous standard deduction would result in $1.3 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, the Joint Committee found. Eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, as well as giving a bigger deduction to senior citizens, would cost an additional $234 billion over the same period, its analysis finds.",
      "The bill does include spending cuts, but they aren't large enough to offset the tax breaks, several recent analyses conclude. The nonpartisan Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0estimated\u00a0in a May 14 analysis that the tax cuts would cost $7.7 trillion over the next decade, while the spending cuts would offset $3.9 trillion over the same period. The result is a gap of $3.8 trillion, it said.",
      "That's the arithmetic that prompted Moody's to cut its rating on U.S. debt, from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1. In its assessment, the credit rating agency noted that the U.S. deficit has spiraled higher as previous administrations and Congress have \"failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend.\"",
      "\"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat,\" Moody's said on Friday when it became the third major rating agency to cut the nation's credit rating. \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "It added, \"The U.S.' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly rated sovereigns.\"",
      "The Trump administration says that the proposed tax bill will spur economic growth by lowering taxes on consumers and businesses. In an interview on Monday with Fox Business, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the economy is \"going to continue to take off once those policies are actually in place, once we actually have the tax cuts passed.\"",
      "Who wins and loses",
      "The GOP tax bill remains in flux and is likely to change as it winds through the House.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged there are still details to \"iron out\" as conservative Republicans seek to quickly enact work requirements for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those rules would take effect in 2029 under the bill passed last week by the Ways and Means Committee. Some House Republicans also want to more quickly end tax breaks for green energy projects being used nationwide.",
      "If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republicans are also eyeing changes.",
      "Democrats have decried the cuts Republicans are proposing to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs of the tax breaks, pointing out that the reductions in social safety net programs comes as many wealthy taxpayers would get a big tax break.",
      "\"This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, told CNN's \"State of the Union\u2033 on Sunday. \"There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that's what is happening here.\"",
      "The lowest-income Americans would end up paying more under the proposed GOP bill, according to a May 19\u00a0analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania group that studies the fiscal impact of public policies. Even including savings from tax cuts, the bottom 20%, who earn up to $17,000 per year, would take a $1,035 hit in 2026 after the reductions in Medicaid and other programs are factored in.",
      "\"[H]ouseholds most affected by the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP \u2014 those in the bottom income quintile \u2014 experience the largest losses under this bill, averaging $28,000 in lifetime value for the working-age population,\" the Penn Wharton Budget model calculated. \"In contrast, working-age households in the top income quintile generally benefit from lower taxes, gaining an average of $30,000.\"",

      "Since the 1970s, scientists have studied dark streaks seen on Mars' cliff sides and crater walls. The streaks tend to be hundreds of meters long. Some can last for a long time, while others are more short-lived.

      "\"You and I served together in Congress for 15 years,\" Van Hollen said. \"We didn't always agree, but I believe we shared some common values \u2014 a belief in defending democracy and human rights abroad and honoring the Constitution at home. That's why I voted to confirm you. I believed you would stand up for those principles. You haven't. You've done the opposite.\"",
      "Van Hollen continued, \"You used to speak with conviction about the importance of foreign aid as a tool to advance American values and interests. Then you stood by while Elon Musk took a chainsaw to USAID and other assistance programs.\"",
      "The senator said people have died as a result of the gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. Earlier this year, Rubio said 83% of programs funded by the federal agency were being canceled after it became a target for the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Van Hollen also said that Rubio has \"made a mockery of our country's refugee process, turning it into a system of global apartheid where political ideology and race more than truth or need matter.\" The criticism was in reference to the Trump administration granting refugee status to White South Africans over claims that they have faced discrimination by the country's post-apartheid government.",

      "\"We have never been informed of any such matter, so why would someone leak it now?\" Azzopardi said. \"The answer is obvious: This is lawfare and election interference plain and simple\u2014something President Trump and his top Department of Justice officials say they are against.\"",

      "In a criminal referral last year, a House panel on the COVID-19 pandemic alleged Cuomo was involved in drafting and editing a 2020 state report on nursing home deaths, but he testified to the committee in June 2024 that he was not involved. The referral claims Cuomo violated a law against making false statements to Congress.",
      "The Biden-era Justice Department did not act on the referral. But after President Trump returned to office, Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the House Oversight Committee, urged federal prosecutors to look into the case, alleging Cuomo was \"caught red-handed lying to Congress.\"",
      "\"Governor Cuomo testified truthfully to the best of his recollection about events from four years earlier, and he offered to address any follow-up questions from the Subcommittee \u2014 but from the beginning this was all transparently political,\" Azzopardi told CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump's Justice Department has faced scrutiny for its handling of criminal cases involving Democrats.",
      "Months before the Cuomo investigation became public, the Justice Department drew criticism for ending a criminal prosecution of Adams \u2014 one of Cuomo's rivals in the mayoral race \u2014 for alleged bribery and campaign finance offenses. One of the department's top leaders said the charges had impeded Adams' ability to run for reelection or govern the city, and had made it harder for Adams to cooperate with the federal government on crime.",
      "Several members of the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office resigned in protest and accused the administration of a quid pro quo, effectively letting Adams off in exchange for his cooperation with the Trump administration's immigration enforcement. The Trump administration and Adams have denied any quid pro quo.",
      "This week, federal prosecutors charged Rep. LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat, with felony assault during a clash at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Newark. Prosecutors claim she assaulted a federal law enforcement officer, but she called the charges \"purely political.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James \u2014 whose office sued Mr. Trump for fraud \u2014 was referred for criminal prosecution by the Trump-nominated head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency last month.

      "Immigration lawyers told a federal judge on Tuesday that they received information indicating the U.S. government may have put migrants from countries like Myanmar and Vietnam on a deportation flight to South Sudan, an eastern African nation plagued by conflict and political instability.",
      "In an emergency filing to the federal district court in Massachusetts, the attorneys said the reported deportation flight to South Sudan would directly violate a ruling issued by U.S. District Court Judge Brian Murphy that barred the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without affording them certain due process rights.",
      "The lawyers said any migrant deported to South Sudan \"faces a strong likelihood of irreparable harm,\" citing reports documenting widespread violence, human rights violations and conflict in the landlocked African country, the world's youngest nation.",
      "Soon after its independence in 2011, South Sudan endured a bloody civil war \u2014 and fears of a new conflict have recently surfaced. The U.S. State Department has a Level 4 travel advisory for South Sudan, warning Americans not to travel there due to \"crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict.\"",
      "The emergency motion asked Murphy to prohibit deportations of third-country deportees to South Sudan, and to order the return of those deported there, if the removals had already occurred.",
      "Late on Tuesday, Murphy ordered the Trump administration to \"maintain custody and control\" of the migrants reportedly being sent to South Sudan or another third country, to ensure they can return to the U.S. if he finds their deportation to be unlawful. He instructed government lawyers to be ready to provide certain information during a hearing scheduled for Wednesday, including the names of the deportees and details on what level of due process they received.",
      "The U.S. government has not publicly confirmed an arrangement to deport migrants who are not from South Sudan to that country. Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Trump administration has been mounting an aggressive diplomatic campaign to convince nations around the world to accept migrants who are not their own citizens, approaching far-flung nations like Libya and Rwanda to take in third-country deportees. It has already deported African and Asian migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, and Venezuelan deportees to El Salvador.",
      "Earlier this month, CBS News and other outlets reported the administration had made plans to send migrants to Libya, but that flight never materialized once those reports surfaced.",
      "In April, Murphy, the federal judge in Massachusetts, barred the government from deporting migrants to third countries, unless it first provided them and their lawyers notice of the destination and a chance to contest their deportation.",
      "In their filing on Tuesday, the group of immigration lawyers said the government appeared to have violated that order in the case of two migrants from Myanmar and Vietnam.",
      "Emails submitted by the lawyers show that an attorney for the man from Myanmar was sent a notice on Monday indicating that his client had been told he would be deported to South Africa. The attorney was then sent another email, indicating that his client was actually facing deportation to South Sudan, the emails show.",
      "On Tuesday morning, another lawyer helping the man from Myanmar emailed the immigration detention center in Los Fresnos, Texas, where he was being held, asking about his whereabouts. She was told her client had been deported in the morning. When she asked where, she received an email saying, \"South Sudan.\"",

    "summary": "The Florida woman and mother of three was charged $500 for every day she has remained in the U.S. since the removal order was issued in April 2005.",
    "story": [
      "An undocumented immigrant who resides in Florida is facing a more than $1.82 million fine for failing to leave the country after receiving a removal order 20 years ago, CBS News has learned.",
      "According to the notice sent May 9 by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's civil fines department and provided to CBS News, the 41-year-old Florida woman and mother of three, who CBS News has chosen not to name, was charged $500 for every day she has remained in the U.S. since the removal order was issued in April 2005, running up a total of $1,821,350.",
      "In a May 20 statement provided to CBS News in response to the fine, an ICE spokesperson said that undocumented immigrants \"who violate the nation's immigration laws and fail to comply with a removal order issued by a Department of Justice Immigration Judge will face legal consequences, such as fines or imprisonment. The best option is to comply with the law and leave the United States.\"",
      "The DHS spokesperson also encouraged undocumented immigrants \"to use the CBP Home app to self-deport.\"",
      "This case represents an enforcement of the civil fines listed under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which also requires undocumented immigrants to register with the U.S. government, according to Michelle Sanchez, the Florida-based immigration attorney representing the Honduran immigrant.",
      "In February, the Trump administration announced its plans to penalize those living in the U.S. illegally under that immigration act. It encompasses a range of regulations but has historically rarely been enforced since its implementation.",
      "According to Sanchez, the removal order was issued after the woman failed to show up to a court hearing in 2005.",
      "In 2024, Sanchez filed a motion to reopen her client's case and have the removal order lifted, arguing the Honduran woman was eligible to apply for U.S. residency because she had resided in the U.S. for more than 10 years with no criminal record.",
      "Sanchez said her client is also a mother of three U.S. citizen children who would be qualifying relatives as they would suffer extreme and exceptionally unusual hardships if she were deported.",
      "Under the Biden administration, ICE attorneys were given discretion to reopen cases to lift removal orders. Hundreds of thousands of these requests were left pending, however, according to Sanchez. In March, ICE notified the Florida immigration lawyer they could not reopen her client's case because the Trump administration did not offer guidance on such prosecutorial discretion.",
      "Sanchez told CBS News she has seen an uptick in ICE issuing fines to her clients who remain in the country illegally, but the million dollar civil fine marks a first.",
      "\"ICE is terrorizing individuals without even having to go pick them up,\" Sanchez said. \"They are terrorizing them by sending these notices where they are fining individuals an exorbitant amount of money that a person sometimes doesn't even make that amount in their lifetime.\"",
      "The notice sent to the Florida mother of three indicates that the fine can be contested, and that requesting a personal interview to do so is an option.",
      "\"They're going into the lion's den,\" Sanchez said, adding that anyone who receives such a notice should first reach out to their immigration lawyer before showing up in person to contest fines.",
      "Sanchez indicates she will be appealing her client's fine as the Honduran mother was never advised of the consequences of failing to depart the U.S. once the removal order was issued.",
      "\"I welcome the orderly application of immigration law and I welcome CBP protecting us,\" Sanchez said, \"but the laws have to be respected and if rights are trampled, there has to be consequences.\"",

      "Niamh Winright's worst nightmare began with a loud bang. Then came the sound of shattering glass and the piercing echoes of gunfire. Reality set in. She was caught in the middle of a school shooting.",
      "On the morning of Oct. 24, 2022, panic swept through the joint campus of the Central Visual and Performing Arts High School and the Collegiate School of Medicine and Bioscience in St. Louis, Missouri. The 911 calls began pouring in as a gunman entered the building.",
      "\"I saw a gentleman with a rifle shoot at the door and go in,\" one caller told dispatchers.",

      "\"Everyone just ran out of the classroom,\" she said. \"It was really chaotic.\"",
      "She was the last person to exit the room. In the hallway, things escalated again.",

      "Two people were killed, and several others were injured during the shooting. Winright survived, but her experience has raised serious questions about how public school prepare \u2014 or don't \u2014 for the needs of students with disabilities during life-threatening emergencies.",
      "More than 7.5 million U.S. public school students live with a disability, according to a federal Department of Education data. A CBS News analysis found nearly 6.3 million of them live in states that do not require schools to make specific emergency plans for students with disabilities.",

She has epileptic seizures that could be triggered by the flashing lights from fire alarms. She's not only concerned about real-world emergencies, but even fire drills back at her Northern Virginia high school.",
      "\"I knew at any moment that alarm could go off and I didn't know what was going to happen,\" she said.",
      "Tiller pushed for six years for accommodations, but it wasn't until her junior year that her school made a plan to provide her with blacked-out glasses and someone to escort her outside of the building during evacuations.",
      "The struggle motivated her to become an advocate. She had conversations with other disabled students, and realized she wasn't the only one impacted by the lack of emergency plans.",
      "\"It really hit me that disabled student safety is an afterthought,\" she said.",
      "Tiller created the advocacy organization called Disabled Disrupters, which includes disabled students and their allies across the country. She also brought the issue to a Virginia lawmaker, Delegate Laura Jane Cohen.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 20:33:02 -0400",
    "summary": "FDA advisers are set to meet Thursday to decide on updates for this fall's COVID shots.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration says it has decided to continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and others at higher risk of severe disease, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.",
      "\"I think we have to admit to ourselves that America is deeply divided on the policy issue of repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses or boosters,\"\u00a0Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's new top vaccines official, said in a video posted by the agency announcing the change.",
      "Details of the new rules for COVID-19 vaccine approvals were also outlined in\u00a0an article\u00a0published by The New England Journal of Medicine, authored by Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct \"randomized, placebo-controlled trials\" before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to \"all healthy persons\" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old, they wrote.",
      "Otherwise, companies will only be able to get their routine COVID-19 vaccine updates approved for seniors as well as people with an underlying medical condition, like pregnancy or diabetes, that increases the risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The range of diseases in the CDC definition of high risk of severe disease is vast, including obesity and even mental health conditions such as depression. Estimates suggest that 100 million to 200 million Americans will have access to vaccines in this manner,\" they wrote.",
      "Vaccine makers are being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. Prasad said they are also encouraging new trials in children under 5.",
      "\"I think we have a really good balance between vulnerable people, that people still at high risk will still have a rapid path to access, but people at average risk and low risk, they need evidence,\" said Prasad.",
      "Makary and Prasad criticized the U.S. for adopting \"a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework\" to grant broad authorization for past COVID-19 vaccine boosters in the past, and cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "They also pointed to other developed countries that have already limited annual COVID-19 vaccine boosters to only older adults and those with underlying conditions that increase their risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view,\" they wrote.",
      "The new \"regulatory framework for COVID-19 vaccination\" laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes ahead of a key meeting of the agency's outside vaccine advisers this Thursday, to decide on how to update the strain used in next season's shots.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has greenlighted those updates in a process similar to the annual flu shots, based largely on laboratory data showing the vaccines can trigger antibody levels similar to previously approved shots.",
      "That is a lower bar than requiring brand new randomized trials of the vaccines tested against a placebo to show it prevents symptomatic disease \u2014 a process which is usually only required for new shots when there is no currently approved immunization available.",
      "But Makary and Prasad said COVID-19 shots should be held to a different standard, citing differences in how the virus mutates and the immunity offered by vaccines and previous infection.",
      "\"Ultimately, these studies alone can provide reassurance that the American repeat-boosters-in-perpetuity strategy is evidence-based,\" they wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether and when vaccine makers would be able to conduct these kinds of trials, if they wanted to try again for a broader approval from the FDA. Makary and Prasad floated the possibility of trials as soon as the coming months.",
      "\"Covid-19 has summer transmission that can facilitate the conduct of randomized studies that continue to apply in future time periods,\" they wrote.",
      "Prasad said interim results from some of the studies could be ready \"by next calendar year.\"",
      "Pfizer said it is \"evaluating the details shared today\" and is in ongoing talks with the FDA. The company said its shots had been administered to over a billion people, including kids, showing favorable safety data.",
      "\"We stand by the science behind the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and continue to believe that broad vaccination programs are an essential tool for helping to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and severe disease, including death,\" Pfizer spokesperson Steven Danehy said in a statement.",
      "Moderna spokesperson Chris Ridley said they \"appreciate the FDA's clear guidance and remain committed to working with the Agency to provide the data they need to ensure access for Americans.\"",
      "A Novavax spokesperson declined to comment. Novavax earned a narrow FDA approval over the weekend for its COVID-19 vaccine, which was limited to seniors as well as adults and adolescents with at least one underlying condition.",
      "While U.S. health care providers are usually allowed to administer vaccines with FDA approval \"off-label\" outside the limits laid out by the agency, a narrower approval can affect access and limit insurance coverage for the vaccinations.",
      "It comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also been weighing narrowed recommendations for the shots.",

      "The president put pressure on members to fall in line as the party's dueling factions have threatened to upend the plan as they set down apparent red lines that don't align with the demands made from other members. Upon arriving on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump suggested that any Republican who doesn't back what he refers to as the \"big, beautiful bill\" would be \"knocked out so fast,\" citing a handful of \"grandstanders.\"",
      "\"It's the biggest bill ever passed, and we've got to get it done,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, can only afford three defections in a floor vote, if all members are present and voting, given his slim majority. All Democrats are expected to oppose it.",
      "\"I would say that if the vote were held right now, it dies a painful death,\" said Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee, who said he would vote \"no\" on the package in its current form.",
      "But first, the legislation will go before the Rules Committee, which is set to meet at 1 a.m. It's the last stop for most legislation before the full House votes on a measure.",
      "In a promising sign, Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, one of the conservative holdouts who stalled the bill\u00a0in the Budget Committee, said he would allow it to advance out of the Rules Committee, where he is also a member.",
      "\"I'm not going to kill it in Rules,\" Norman told reporters Monday night. \"It needs to go to the floor.\"",
      "When asked after the meeting with Mr. Trump on Tuesday whether he would support the bill on the House floor, Norman said \"we'll see.\"",
      "The committee's rare late-night meeting comes as Republican leadership races to pass the budget package before their self-imposed Memorial Day deadline.",
      "Johnson has been meeting with the different factions in recent days to hear the demands and build a consensus around a modified version of the legislation that was produced by nearly a dozen House committees.",
      "Conservatives, who are upset that that bill does not make steep enough spending cuts to significantly bring down the deficit, have pushed for Medicaid work requirements to kick in much sooner than a 2029 deadline. They also want to eliminate all the clean energy subsidies that were implemented under the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"It is unfortunately front-loaded in deficits and backloaded in savings, which I do not like,\" Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, another conservative holdout, said Monday. \"None of my votes are guaranteed at this point.\"",
      "The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the original version of the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.",
      "Conservatives have also been pushing to change the rate by which the federal government pays states for Medicaid, a point of contention with moderates, who have warned against larger cuts to the program.",
      "Johnson reiterated Monday that the change has \"been off the table for quite some time.\" And Mr. Trump said ahead of the meeting Tuesday morning that \"we're not doing anything cutting of anything meaningful,\" adding that on Medicaid, \"the only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "A provision on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, is facing pushback from a group of Republicans from blue states, who have threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands are met. And after a meeting with Johnson Monday night, an agreement appeared to remain out of reach.",
      "GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York outlined ahead of the meeting that the group of moderates had no plans to cave. And on his message to conservatives, Lawler told reporters, \"if they think we're going to throw our constituents under the bus to appease them, it's not happening.\"",
      "\"The fact is, we wouldn't even be in this position right now if you didn't have members in seats like mine who won,\" Lawler said.",
      "Mr. Trump also weighed in on the SALT issue, suggesting that he opposes raising the cap because he claimed Democratic governors from states like New York, Illinois and California would benefit, calling them the \"biggest\" beneficiaries.",
      "According to a senior White House official, Mr. Trump told the House GOP conference during the meeting that they should not let division over the SALT cap get in the way of the bill, and said they should not touch Medicaid, except for addressing waste, fraud and abuse, along with cutting benefits for noncitizens and imposing work requirements. The official said Mr. Trump also made clear he wants every Republican to vote \"yes\" on the bill, while saying he's losing patience with the remaining holdouts.",
      "Johnson said at a news conference following the meeting that leadership would now work to \"gather up the small subgroups in the House Republican conference and tie up the remaining loose ends.\"",
      "\"We are going to get this done,\" the speaker added.",
      "Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican, said Mr. Trump was \"emphatic we need to quit screwing around\" on the budget package. He said 98% of the conference is \"ready to go,\" and was \"pumped up\" by the president, while noting that \"he did move\" the holdouts.",
      "\"I don't know that we are there yet, but that was a hugely impactful meeting,\" Johnson said.",

Sterling Williams, a 33-year-old maintenance worker at the jail run by the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, told investigators he was threatened by one of the inmates who took part in the jailbreak, according to court documents.",
      "Williams was arrested Monday night, the office of Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill confirmed to CBS News. Murrill said in a statement Tuesday that Williams allegedly told investigators an inmate \"advised him\" to turn the water off in the cell that would be used for the escape, which involved removing a toilet from the wall.",
      "According to an affidavit for an arrest warrant, Williams told investigators with the Louisiana Bureau of Investigation that he was threatened by one of the inmates who later escaped, Antoine Massey. Williams said that Massey allegedly threatened to shank him if he didn't shut off the water, according to the affidavit. Massey is one of the six inmates who is still on the run.",
      "Williams was also seen on surveillance video speaking with Massey and another escaped inmate, Derrick Groves, according to the affidavit. Williams told investigators that Groves allegedly tried to take Williams' phone and wanted Williams to bring a book with Cash App information to Groves' cousin in another part of the jail, according to the affidavit. Groves is also still on the run.",
      "According to Murrill, Williams allegedly turned off the water, which allowed the escape to proceed.",
      "Williams has been charged with principal to simple escape and malfeasance in office, both felonies.",
      "\"We will uncover all the facts eventually and anyone who aided and abetted will be prosecuted to the full extent the law allows,\" Murrill said in the statement. \"I encourage anyone who knows anything and even those who may have provided assistance to come forward now to obtain the best possible outcome in their particular case.\"",
      "The inmates broke out of the jail on Friday, according to the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office. Three of the inmates were captured later that day. A fourth was captured Monday, officials said.",
      "The escape started in the early predawn hours of Friday morning. Several inmates were caught on surveillance video forcing open a cell door at about 12:22 a.m. CDT, according to the sheriff's office. Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson told reporters the inmates then breached a wall behind the cell's toilet.",
      "According to the affidavit, the inmates somehow sawed through the steel bars behind the toilet and then bent them. If the water wasn't turned off, investigators said in the affidavit the cell could have flooded, potentially drawing attention to the escape and preventing it from being as successful as it was.",
      "At around 1 a.m., the inmates were seen on video fleeing the building through a nearby loading dock, according to the sheriff's office. At about 1:19 a.m., the group climbed over a fence, using blankets to cover barbed wire, and fled across Interstate 10 into a neighborhood.",
      "The escape went unnoticed by the sheriff's office until approximately 8:30 a.m. Friday, according to the office. At the time of the escape, no sheriff's deputy was assigned to the area where the inmates initiated the jailbreak, and a civilian monitor stationed in the area had stepped away for food.",
      "The sheriff's office had said three workers were suspended without pay as the office conducts an internal investigation. It wasn't immediately clear if Williams  was one of the three workers.",
      "Hutson had told reporters the inmates may have received help from at least one person inside the sheriff's office. She also said the office has spent years asking local officials for more than $5 million in funds to upgrade faulty locks on cell doors.",

      "Groves, 27, was arrested for the shooting deaths of Jamar Robinson and Byron Jackson on Mardi Gras in 2018,\u00a0CBS affiliate WWL-TV\u00a0reported. At least two members of Robinson's family told WWL-TV that they went into hiding following Groves' escape.",
      "\"We didn't know what was going to happen, we didn't know how Derrick Groves felt ... whether he was coming for us, we didn't know,\" one of the family members told the news station.",
      "They also said the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office did not contact them, as of Saturday.",
      "How did the New Orleans inmates escape?",
      "Hutson\u00a0said the men were able to get\u00a0out of the Orleans Justice Center because of \"defective locks.\" She said she has continuously raised concerns about the locks to officials and, as recently as last week, advocated for money to fix the aged infrastructure.",
      "Hutson said Friday that \"there's no way\" for inmates to escape the facility where 1,400 people are being held \"without help from the outside.\"",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Tuesday that Sterling Williams, a 33-year-old maintenance worker at the jail, was\u00a0arrested. Murrill said in a statement Tuesday that Williams allegedly told investigators an inmate \"advised him\" to turn the water off in the cell that would be used for the escape, which involved removing a toilet from the wall.",
      "According to an affidavit for an arrest warrant, Williams told investigators with the Louisiana Bureau of Investigation that he was threatened by Massey, one of the inmates who later escaped. Williams said that Massey allegedly threatened to shank him if he didn't shut off the water, according to the affidavit.",
      "The inmates were discovered missing during a routine head count conducted at 8:30 a.m. local time at the Orleans Parish Jail, according to the sheriff's office. They are believed to have escaped sometime just after midnight.",
      "The sheriff said that around 12:23 a.m., the inmates yanked the sliding jail cell door off the track and at 1:01 a.m., they exited the jail after breaching a wall behind a toilet.",
      "Photos provided by authorities showed what they said were clean cuts on metal bars behind the toilet inside the jail cells.",
      "If the water wasn't turned off, investigators said in the affidavit the cell could have flooded, potentially drawing attention to the escape and preventing it from being as successful as it was.",
      "The toilet and bolts were removed using toiletry items, the sheriff said, but didn't specify what the items were. The inmates then scaled down a wall and ran across the interstate.",
      "The Orleans County Sheriff's Office on Friday night released security video of the extraordinary escape, which shows the inmates sprinting out of the prison and then traversing the freeway.",
      "The escaped inmates also scrawled obscene messages for the guards. One, which was misspelled, read \"to easy, LOL.\"",
      "At a news conference on Sunday, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said the escape was the worst in recent state history and said he is ordering an audit of the sheriff's office as well as the Orleans Parish Prison.",
      "\"This massive jailbreak could be the largest jailbreak in the history of the state, and it never should have happened. The public deserves to know who, what and how this happened,\" Landry said.",
      "Three jail staff members were suspended without pay pending the outcome of an internal investigation, the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office said Sunday. It wasn't immediately clear if Williams was one of the three suspended employees.",
      "Landry said an audit of the jail by the Department of Corrections will be done by the end of the week. He said everyone in the criminal justice system needs to be held accountable, \"except for the police, who seem to be doing their job.\"",
      "Landry cited delays in bringing charges, prosecutions and sentencing as factors he said contribute to jail populations.",
      "He blamed Friday's escape on what he called a \"progressive justice system,\" saying that \"there is also no excuse for the way these cases are currently being mismanaged in our criminal justice system.\"",
      "The governor said that nine of the 10 escapees had been in the pretrial stages for years, and he wants the district attorney to explain the slow progress in prosecuting criminal cases in the city.",
      "Rewards increased for capture of inmates",
      "At least one of the escaped inmates was captured based on a tip from the public, according to a statement from the FBI on the social media platform X.",
      "Authorities said Monday that a total reward of $20,000 was being offered for information leading to the arrest of each inmate, with $10,000 coming from the FBI, another $5,000 from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and $5,000 more from CrimeStoppers. The FBI and CrimeStoppers had increased their rewards from $5,000 and $2,000, respectively.",
      "FBI Special Agent Jonathan Trapp said at the news conference Sunday that he believes members of the public may be aiding the men, and authorities will arrest anyone found aiding or abetting them.",
      "The escape is drawing intense scrutiny. It took hours for sheriff's officials to learn of the escape and then more time still to alert New Orleans police, even though some of the missing inmates are accused of violent offenses and they escaped into a neighborhood less than 2 miles from\u00a0the city's famous French Quarter.",
      "Louisiana State Police Superintendent Colonel Robert Hodges said authorities in neighboring states have been notified but officials do not believe the men have left the state yet. Leads for the men have not panned out, he said.",

Khalil has not been accused of any crimes, but the Trump administration has argued he should be deported on the grounds that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has determined his presence in the U.S. and protest activities pose \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" The administration has also accused Khalil of immigration fraud. His lawyers dispute both claims.",
      "An immigration judge in Louisiana ruled last month that the administration could\u00a0continue its effort to deport Khalil, saying she did not have the authority to dispute Rubio's determination, which cites a rarely used law.

      "Khalil is among several college students who have been detained or had their visas revoked amid the Trump administration's crackdown on what it says are antisemitic or pro-Hamas activities.

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 19:23:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to release a report Thursday on how pesticides and other issues may be linked to childhood chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought Tuesday to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals like glyphosate that he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S.",
      "\"I have said repeatedly throughout this process, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\"",
      "The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a \"Make America Healthy Again Commission,\" which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.",
      "Targets include the \"potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures\" in children. Kennedy said their report was due to be released Thursday.",
      "\"Your information about the report is just simply wrong,\" Kennedy told Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi in response to a question about the report. \"The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\"",
      "Hyde-Smith had told Kennedy that she was \"deeply concerned\" that the report will \"unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools\" that U.S. farmers use.",
      "\"We all know what confirmation bias is. It's no secret that you were involved with pesticide litigation, prior to becoming secretary,\" Hyde-Smith told Kennedy.",
      "What has RFK Jr. said about pesticides like glyphosate?",
      "Kennedy has criticized the use of several pesticides in the U.S. food supply, including as an environmental attorney during court battles with chemical manufacturer Monsanto over accusations that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup \u2014 made from the chemical glyphosate \u2014 was causing cancer.",
      "\"If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luther. I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value,\" Kennedy wrote in a 2020 Facebook post.",
      "During his longshot independent presidential campaign, Kennedy pledged to get toxins out of the food supply, warning that \"toxic chemicals like glyphosate\" were widely contaminating what Americans were eating.",
      "He continued that criticism in the months ahead of the 2024 election as he stumped in support of President Trump, recalling how his son resolved his \"really agonizing\" eczema by switching to eating pasta made in Europe.",
      "\"As soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema,\" he told Donald Trump Jr. on a podcast in September of last year. \"And you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do, that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food.\"",
      "What will be in RFK Jr.'s \"MAHA Commission\" report?",
      "One of Kennedy's top HHS advisers, Calley Means \u2014 whose sister Dr. Casey Means was nominated by President Trump earlier this month for the surgeon general post \u2014 said that the report is aimed at outlining \"obvious\" ways that children are \"being poisoned through areas that there's not even that much scientific disagreement on.\"",
      "\"Obviously, it's because of environmental toxins,\" Means said, speaking at a May 15 event hosted by the Kennedy-aligned MAHA Institute. \"We produce and ingest 25% of the world's pesticides. The leading herbicides and pesticides that we use in the United States, many of them are phased out or banned in every other country in the world.\"",
      "Means said that the report was not intended to result in \"a European nanny state system\" to crack down on pesticides, pledging instead to come up with \"pro-innovation policies to solve this issue\" under Kennedy. He blasted lobbyists for opposing the report's release.",
      "Beyond \"environmental toxins\" like pesticides, Means listed a number of other issues he alleges are making American children sick, including ultra-processed foods, added sugars, seed oils, sedentary behavior, lack of sleep, overprescriptions and vaccines.",
      "\"They're saying it's going to scare the American people to get facts out. They're putting so much pressure on President Trump, so much pressure on Secretary Kennedy to not release facts,\" Means said last week.",
      "What power does RFK Jr. have over pesticides?",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services does not directly set the limits on how glyphosate and other pesticides are used. That is left up to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, HHS does oversee the major research that underpins how the EPA regulates chemicals.",
      "Studies into pesticides like glyphosate to inform the EPA's limits often come from the federal health agencies within HHS.",
      "For example, the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program published results in 2023 suggesting that glyphosate is \"unlikely\" to be genotoxic, which had been one of the main ways international experts previously suspected it might cause cancer.",
      "Results from a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in 2022 found that diet was likely a factor in how much glyphosate people were being exposed to, based on urine samples taken in adults and children.",
      "Through the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy also has authority over how glyphosate levels in food are tracked and the EPA's limits are enforced.",
      "The last round of published sampling by the FDA in 2022 found that 54 samples of human food had detectable amounts of glyphosate out of 731 analyzed. Corn and beans were among the most frequent detections.",

      "\"Today, I'm pleased to announce that we have officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system that will deploy next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors,\" the president announced in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "Mr. Trump said the project should be \"fully operational before the end of my term,\" which would be before January 2029. The president said the system will be built in states including Alaska, Florida, Georgia and Indiana, and involve multiple, yet-to-be-selected American defense and technology companies.",
      "Canada wants to be involved in the project, the president said, adding that the U.S. wants to help Canada as it can.",
      "\"Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" he said. \"And we will have the best system ever built.\"",
      "The president told reporters that he suggested a comprehensive new missile defense system to U.S. military leaders, and they agreed, not the other way around.",
      "\"I suggested it and they all said, 'We love the idea, sir.' That's the way it's gotta be, right? But they want it. And they wanted it badly once it was suggested.\"",
      "The president has for months expressed a desire for a defense system like Israel's. In his March joint address to Congress, the president requested funding for the system.",
      "\"I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome shield to protect our homeland,\" the president said in his address to Congress. \"All made in the USA. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. And other places have it. Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too.\"",
      "A new, unclassified assessment from the Pentagon's intelligence agency shows what threats the U.S. needs to defend itself from in the next decade.",
      "The Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, expects that missile threats to the U.S. will expand both in scale and sophistication, as the U.S. faces threats from foreign actors in the shape of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, two types of hypersonic weapons, land attack cruise missiles, and fractional orbital bombardment systems.",
      "Mr. Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" in the vein of Israel's Iron Dome, the country's mobile all-weather air defense system that has intercepted projectiles since its installation in 2011. However, Israel's Iron Dome largely defends against shorter-range threats, like rockets, while it has two other air defense systems to defend against missiles, which are increasingly being used in conflict.",
      "\"Missile threats to the U.S. homeland will expand in scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" the assessment says. \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses, but traditional ballistic missiles \u2014 which are guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight \u2014 will remain the primary threat to the homeland. North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.\"",
      "The assessment warns that China, Iran and North Korea will have significantly more intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\" Although Iran doesn't currently have known ICBMs, the DIA assessment suggests it will have 60 by 2035. Keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear power has been a key goal of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The assessment also warns that China's submarine-launched ballistic missiles will increase in number by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing adversary SLBMs.\" Russia, too, has submarine-launched ballistic missiles.",
      "Further, the assessment warns that both China and Russia will increase their boosted hypersonic weapons multiple times over by 2035. The report says that Russia and China can reach parts of the U.S. with these systems. The report also says China and Russia's land attack cruise missile capacity will significantly increase by 2035, and both countries have the potential to reach parts of the U.S.",
      "Finally, the report says both Russia and China are expected to have what's known as fractional orbital bombardment systems by 2035. These will be able to orbit the globe, traveling over the South Pole to avoid early detection.",

      "Steep cuts to federal medical research grants this year have now disrupted millions in awards once backed by former President Joe Biden's \"Cancer Moonshot\" initiative, after the Trump administration froze funding to Columbia University and Harvard University over their handling of campus protests about the war in Gaza.",
      "Biden revealed Sunday he has been diagnosed with an \"aggressive form\" of prostate cancer. His \"Moonshot\" initiative was already personal because his son Beau died of brain cancer.",
      "Multiple cancer scientists at Harvard University say they have seen their National Institutes of Health funding evaporate in recent weeks due to the funding freeze.",
      "\"We are not allowed to charge anything on these grants and I understand that Harvard hasn't been reimbursed for any charges to these grants for at least 30 days,\" Joan Brugge, professor of cell biology at Harvard Medical School, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Brugge said the university had informed her that her research into mutations linked to breast cancer, as well as studying the recurrence of ovarian cancer, was among some 350 federal grants terminated at Harvard Medical School.",
      "Harvard bioengineering professor David Mooney said all cancer research funding from NIH's National Cancer Institute for his team had also been cut off, including multiple grants to post-doctoral research fellows.",
      "The Trump administration also terminated millions awarded for developing anti-cancer immunity at the university's immuno-engineering center, which was launched in 2020 as part of the \"Cancer Moonshot\" initiative. Mooney's lab was the first to engineer an \"implantable biomaterial cancer vaccine\" to retrain the immune system to destroy cancer cells, the university says.",
      "\"This will dramatically diminish our ability to make progress in developing cancer immunotherapies,\" Mooney said in an email.",
      "Under versions of the cancer initiative launched by Biden first as vice president in 2016\u00a0\u2014 and later rebooted in 2022 after he was elected president \u2014 the federal government poured more than $1 billion into a broad array of research, prevention and treatment projects.",
      "That money came largely from the 21st Century Cures Act passed by Congress in 2016, which went to more than 100 different institutions. It included millions awarded to support the work of cancer centers around the country.",
      "That also included a long-running award to support the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Now federal records show the award to support Columbia's cancer center has also been terminated.",
      "\"Anti-Semitism \u2014 like racism \u2014 is a spiritual and moral malady that sickens societies and kills people with lethalities comparable to history's most deadly plagues,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0said in a March statement, announcing plans to look for cuts to Columbia's funding.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted universities for their handling of pro-Palestinian protests on campus, alleging they let antisemitism go unchecked, which the universities dispute.",
      "NIH records show the money at Columbia's cancer center had gone to a broad array of projects, ranging from clinical studies to administrative costs.",
      "Beyond the Trump administration's cuts to Columbia and Harvard, one other award directly linked to the Biden cancer initiative is also listed as terminated: a project funded at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute to \"address cancer disparities among Indigenous sexual and gender minority populations\" with films, outreach and illustrations.",
      "Other projects funded by NIH's National Cancer Institute have also had their funding canceled after officials deemed they ran afoul of other White House executive orders that took aim at topics like \"gender ideology extremism\" and \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" programs.",
      "Support and communications staff at the cancer institute were also not spared in Kennedy and DOGE's layoffs earlier this year.",
      "Senate Democrats have criticized Kennedy and President Trump for cuts to NIH's grants this year, which they said in a report amounts to at least $15.1 million in cancer funding lost.",

      "A soaring death toll in the Gaza Strip and an increasingly vocal outcry over near-famine conditions in the Palestinian territory are piling pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a negotiated ceasefire with Hamas and drop his country's near-total blockade of the enclave. Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry said Tuesday that at least 87 people were killed by Israeli military strikes over the last 24 hours alone.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces have ramped up operations in Gaza over the last week, killing hundreds of people, many of them women and children, in what Netanyahu's government insists is legitimate self-defense and aimed entirely at securing the return of 58 hostages still held by Hamas and its allies in Gaza, and destroying the group. Israel blames Hamas \u2014 long designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and the European Union \u2014 for all casualties in Gaza, accusing the group of operating in and around civilian infrastructure.",
      "On Monday, for the first time in two and a half months, Netanyahu permitted a handful of trucks carrying aid to enter Gaza. He said he had been pressured into easing the total blockade by allies who could not tolerate \"images of mass famine.\"",
      "There were unconfirmed reports on Tuesday that as many as 100 trucks had been allowed to cross the Gaza border. But the United Nations' World Food Program said this week that a few trucks would be just a drop in the bucket given the vast and urgent need for food in Gaza, where more than 2 million Palestinians have been trapped for more than two years of blistering war.",
      "Thousands of trucks have been lined up for weeks just across the Gaza border, waiting to cross in. No food, fresh water or medicine had entered the territory for nearly 80 days under the Israeli blockade. Hunger is so rife that full-blown famine is once again stalking Gaza's population, according to the WFP's director for the Palestinian territories, Antoine Renard, who's just returned from the enclave.",
      "\"You have around an estimated 14,000 children that I know are facing what we call severe acute malnutrition,\" he told CBS News on Monday, meaning those children could die without rapid intervention. \"We always wait for when 'famine' is on. But when famine is on, it's already too late. That will be a failure of all the international community.\"",
      "Until this week, Israel's government had insisted there were no food shortages in Gaza. But for the first time, in a message posted Monday on social media, Netanyahu acknowledged that Gaza is nearing a hunger crisis.",
      "\"Our best friends in the world, senators that I know as enthusiastic Israel supporters, who I know for many years, are come to me and telling me, 'we give you all the support for a final victory \u2014 arms, support on your maneuvers to destroy Hamas, support at the U.N. Security Council. There is one thing we cannot endure \u2014 pictures of mass famine. This is something we are unable to witness. We will not be able to support you.'\"",
      "As a result of that pressure, he's allowing the limited amount of aid into Gaza.",
      "Renard said the WFP had sufficient food on standby, ready to enter, to feed the entire population of Gaza for a month.",
      "\"It must stop,\" he said of the Israeli blockade. \"The civilian population shouldn't be trapped. There's no reason, actually, to hold them accountable for what they are not part of.\"",
      "Netanyahu did not name any of the nations exerting pressure on his government to ease the blockade, and while Israel's closest and most vital ally the U.S. was almost certainly the country he referred to when mentioning long-friendly senators, it's not just the U.S. calling for a resolution to the crisis \u2014 and other countries have been doing so more assertively.",
      "In a strongly worded statement published Monday, the leaders of the U.K., France and Canada called the level of human suffering in Gaza intolerable, and they threatened to take action.",
      "\"The Israeli Government's denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law,\" the countries said in a joint statement. \"We oppose any attempt to expand settlements in the West Bank ... We will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions.\"",
      "Netanyahu decried the threat, saying in a statement that by \"asking Israel to end a defensive war for our survival before Hamas terrorists on our border are destroyed and by demanding a Palestinian state, the leaders in London, Ottowa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities.\"",
      "\"The war can end tomorrow if the remaining hostages are released, Hamas lays down its arms, its murderous leaders are exiled and Gaza is demilitarized,\" said the Israeli leader. \"No nation can be expected to accept anything less and Israel certainly won't. This is a war of civilization over barbarism. Israel will continue to defend itself by just means until total victory is achieved.\"",
      "Israel has escalated its war with a new offensive that has killed nearly 600 people over the last week, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health.",
      "Doctors are running out of supplies \u2014 barely able to treat malnourished children, let alone the hundreds of people injured by the Israeli strikes who stream in day after day.",
      "The war in Gaza was sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and left 251 others as hostages in Gaza. Israel's retaliatory war has destroyed large swaths of Gaza, displaced 90% of its population \u2014 most of them multiple times \u2014 and killed more than 53,500 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",

      "Violence in the city exploded eight months ago when two rival Sinaloa Cartel factions began warring for territory after the dramatic kidnapping of Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the leader of one of the groups, by a son of notorious capo Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n who then delivered him to U.S. authorities via a private plane.",
      "Zambada and \"El Chapo's\" son Joaquin Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez were arrested when they landed in Texas.",
      "Since then, intense fighting between the heavily armed factions has become the new normal for civilians in Culiacan, a city that for years avoided the worst of Mexico's violence in large part because the Sinaloa Cartel maintained such complete control.",
      "\"With the escalating war between the two factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, they have begun to extort, kidnap and rob cars because they need funds to finance their war,\" said security analyst David Saucedo. \"And the civilians in Culiacan are the ones that suffer.\"",
      "Animals scared by cartel fighting",
      "Zazueta, the sanctuary director, said their flight from the city is another sign of just how far the warfare has seeped into daily life.",
      "This week, refuge staff loaded up roaring animals onto a convoy as some trainers attempted to sooth the animals. One murmured in a soft voice as he fed a bag of carrots to an elephant in a shipping container, \"I'm going to be right here, no one will do anything to you.\"",
      "Veterinarians and animals, accompanied by the Mexican National Guard, began traveling along the freeway to seaside Mazatlan, where they planned to release the animals into another wildlife reserve.",
      "The relocation came after months of planning and training the animals, a move made by the organization in an act of desperation. They said the sanctuary was caught in the crossfire of the warfare because of its proximity to the town of Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, a stronghold of Los Chapitos, one of the warring factions.",
      "During intense periods of violence, staff at the sanctuary can hear gunshots echoing nearby, the roar of cars and helicopters overhead, something they say scares the animals. Cartel fighting regularly blocks staff off from reaching the sanctuary, and some animals have gone days without eating. Many have started to lose fur and at least two animals have died due to the situation, Zazueta said.",
      "Complicating matters is the fact that an increasing number of the animals they rescue are former narco pets left abandoned in rural swathes of the state. In one case, a Bengal tiger was discovered chained in a plaza, caught in the center of shootouts. Urban legends circulate in Sinaloa that capos feed their enemies to pet lions. The U.S. Justice Department alleged in an indictment released in 2023 that the sons of \"El Chapo\" and their cartel associates fed some of their victims \"dead or alive to tigers.\"",
      "Diego Garc\u00eda, a refuge staff member, is among those who travel out to rescue those animals. He said he regularly receives anonymous threats, with callers claiming to know his address and how to find him. He worries he'll be targeted for taking away the former pets of capos. Zazueta said the refuge also receives calls threatening to burn the sanctuary to the ground and kill the animals if payment isn't made.",
      "\"There's no safe place left in this city these days,\" said Garc\u00eda.",
      "That's the feeling for many in the city of 1 million. When the sun rises, parents check for news of shootouts as if it were the weather, to determine if it's safe to send their kids to school. Burned houses sit riddled with bullets and occasionally bodies appear hanging from bridges outside the city. By night, Culiacan turns into a ghost town, leaving bars and clubs shuttered and many without work.",
      "\"My son, my son, I'm here. I'm not going to leave you alone,\" screamed one mother, sobbing on the side of the road and cursing officials as they inspected her son's dead body, splayed out and surrounded by bullet casings late Monday night. \"Why do the police do nothing?\" she cried out.",
      "\"What are we doing here?\"",
      "In February, while driving a refuge vehicle used for animal transport, Garc\u00eda said he was forced from the car by an armed, masked man in an SUV. At gunpoint, they stole the truck, animal medicine and tools used by the group for rescues and left him trembling on the side of the road.",
      "The breaking point for the Ostok Sanctuary came in March, when one of the two elephants in their care, Bireki, injured her foot. Veterinarians scrambled to find a specialist to treat her in Mexico, the United States and beyond. No one would brave the trip to Culiacan.",
      "\"We asked ourselves, 'what are we doing here?'\" Zazueta said. \"We can't risk this happening again. If we don't leave, who will treat them?\"",
      "The concern by many is that Mexico's crackdown on the cartels will be met with even more violent power moves by criminal organizations, as has happened in the past, said Saucedo, the security analyst.",
      "Zazueta blames local government and security forces for not doing more, and said their pleas for help in the past eight months have gone unanswered.",
      "Sinaloa's governor's office did not immediately respond to a request comment.",
      "The sanctuary made the move without any public announcement, worried that they might face repercussions from local officials or the same cartels forcing them to flee, but they hope the animals will find some relief in Mazatlan after years of conflict.",
      "Garc\u00eda, the sanctuary staff member, is not so sure. While he hopes for the best, he said he's also watched cartel violence spread like a cancer across the Latin American country. Mazatlan, too, is also facing bursts of violence, though nothing compared to the Sinaloan capital.",
      "\"It's at least more stable,\" he said. \"Because here, today, it's just suffocating.\"",
      "Cartel violence is also frequent in the central state of Guanajuato, Mexico's most deadly state. This week, gunmen opened fire and killed seven people, including some minors, in a plaza in the city of San Felipe, police said. The violent crime is believed to be linked to conflict between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of the most powerful in Mexico.",

    "summary": "President Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system like Israel's Iron Dome.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday announced his administration has selected the architectural design for a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the United States from foreign threats.",
      "The president also said the budget package Republicans are currently ironing out on Capitol Hill will include an initial $25 billion to begin construction on the missile defense system. Mr. Trump said the project's total cost will be about $175 billion, although it could be much more. Congress hasn't yet funded any of the project, although Mr. Trump told reporters he thinks it'll be easy to fund on Capitol Hill.",
      "\"Today, I'm pleased to announce that we have officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system that will deploy next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors,\" the president announced in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "Mr. Trump said the project should be \"fully operational before the end of my term,\" which would be before January 2029. The president said the system will be built in states including Alaska, Florida, Georgia and Indiana, and involve multiple, yet-to-be-selected American defense and technology companies.",
      "Canada wants to be involved in the project, the president said, adding that the U.S. wants to help Canada as it can.",
      "\"Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" he said. \"And we will have the best system ever built.\"",
      "The president told reporters that he suggested a comprehensive new missile defense system to U.S. military leaders, and they agreed, not the other way around.",
      "\"I suggested it and they all said, 'We love the idea, sir.' That's the way it's gotta be, right? But they want it. And they wanted it badly once it was suggested.\"",
      "The president has for months expressed a desire for a defense system like Israel's. In his March joint address to Congress, the president requested funding for the system.",
      "\"I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome shield to protect our homeland,\" the president said in his address to Congress. \"All made in the USA. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. And other places have it. Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too.\"",
      "A new, unclassified assessment from the Pentagon's intelligence agency shows what threats the U.S. needs to defend itself from in the next decade.",
      "The Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, expects that missile threats to the U.S. will expand both in scale and sophistication, as the U.S. faces threats from foreign actors in the shape of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, two types of hypersonic weapons, land attack cruise missiles, and fractional orbital bombardment systems.",
      "Mr. Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" in the vein of Israel's Iron Dome, the country's mobile all-weather air defense system that has intercepted projectiles since its installation in 2011. However, Israel's Iron Dome largely defends against shorter-range threats, like rockets, while it has two other air defense systems to defend against missiles, which are increasingly being used in conflict.",
      "\"Missile threats to the U.S. homeland will expand in scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" the assessment says. \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses, but traditional ballistic missiles \u2014 which are guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight \u2014 will remain the primary threat to the homeland. North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.\"",
      "The assessment warns that China, Iran and North Korea will have significantly more intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\" Although Iran doesn't currently have known ICBMs, the DIA assessment suggests it will have 60 by 2035. Keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear power has been a key goal of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The assessment also warns that China's submarine-launched ballistic missiles will increase in number by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing adversary SLBMs.\" Russia, too, has submarine-launched ballistic missiles.",
      "Further, the assessment warns that both China and Russia will increase their boosted hypersonic weapons multiple times over by 2035. The report says that Russia and China can reach parts of the U.S. with these systems. The report also says China and Russia's land attack cruise missile capacity will significantly increase by 2035, and both countries have the potential to reach parts of the U.S.",
      "Finally, the report says both Russia and China are expected to have what's known as fractional orbital bombardment systems by 2035. These will be able to orbit the globe, traveling over the South Pole to avoid early detection.",

      "On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shared some of the 2,500 items from the Syrian archive relating to Eli Cohen, an Israeli spy who infiltrated the political echelon in Syria, with Cohen's widow. Sunday marked 60 years since Cohen was hanged in a square in Damascus.",
      "The items recently spirited into Israel include documents, recordings, photos, and items collected by Syrian intelligence after his capture in January 1965, letters in his own handwriting to his family in Israel, photographs of his activity during his operational mission in Syria and personal objects that were taken from his home after his capture.",
      "Among the items recovered was a handwritten will penned by Cohen hours before his execution, Agence France-Presse reported.",

      "A Syrian government spokesperson did not immediately respond to a Reuters news agency request for comment on how the items had been retrieved from Syria.",
      "Cohen, who was born in Egypt to a Jewish family, was sent by Mossad to Syria, where he posed as a Syrian businessman named Kamal Amin Taabet, the BBC reported.\u00a0 After befriending influential political, business and military figures, he was able to obtain secret information, which he passed back to Israel.",
      "Cohen's success in Syria was one of the Mossad spy agency's first major achievements, and the top-secret intelligence he obtained is widely credited with helping Israel prepare for its swift victory in the 1967 Middle East War.",

One week ago, he was reunited with his family in a deal brokered by the Trump administration and led by the White House's Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "Alexander and his family have credited the Trump team with saving his life, and in a sit-down interview with CBS News, the young soldier's parents told senior foreign correspondent Debora Patta about the remarkable moment they learned Edan would be released, and the moments they've cherished since.",
      "Edan Alexander spent 584 days in Hamas captivity. After a number of false starts and false hope for his release, when the call finally did come from the highest levels of the U.S. government, his father missed it \u2014 eight times.",
      "\"So, we were all at home in Jersey after the Mother's Day brunch that we had,\" recalled his mother, Yael.",
      "\"I was blowing out some leaves,\" said his father, Adi. When he put down the leaf blower, he realized he had \"missed eight phone calls from Steve Witkoff.\"",
      "When Adi finally got in touch with the senior White House envoy, \"he told us in 10 minutes from now, Hamas will be announcing about your son's release tomorrow.\"",
      "\"I thanked him. Non-stop; 'Thank you, Steve! Thank you so much,'\" Yael recalled saying down the phone line. \"It's the happiest Mother's Day ever!\"",
      "\"We were like, yelling, like crazy with the kids,\" she said. As Yael, Adi and their two other children watched the television, the announcement came that Edan would be released the following day, just as Witkoff had promised. \"And we were like, okay, we need to pack! We need to... Get to Israel!\"",
      "Finally, the reunion they'd dreamt of for more than a year and a half was taking shape.",

      "Neither of the parents got much rest on their flights to Israel.",
      "\"I couldn't sleep the whole flight,\" Yael told CBS News. \"Like, you're alert ... I couldn't sit even, you know? I was like in full adrenaline, like, ready, to be there and to get Edan back, you know?\"",
      "As soon as they touched down, they were whisked away to an Israeli military base, where Edan soon arrived after being handed over by Hamas.",
      "\"Definitely I gave him like, the biggest hug ever,\" said his mother. \"When I came to him, I came in full power! We almost fell, because he was weak, and he was very excited, like he was standing, like shivering, you know, because, wow, it's unbelievable \u2014 and I'm screaming, and I am like, you know, holding him. It was \u2014 wow.\"",
      "The parents said Edan remains weak, but doctors cleared him for release from the hospital where he's been treated. He's still getting medical attention for some minor injuries sustained during the Oct. 7 terrorist attack, which his mom and dad said, \"nobody took care of in those tunnels.\"",
      "Even getting his freedom back was a harrowing ordeal.",
      "\"The day of release was a very busy day for him,\" father Adi told CBS News. \"It took forever. They moved around and crawled under, and it was a very tough day on him. He didn't sleep the whole night before that, because he was excited, he didn't sleep. He was like, super, super tired, so it took like, almost two days after for him to decompress from the day of the release.\"",
      "Since then, Edan has given them some details about his captivity, but they aren't pushing him.",
      "\"He talks a lot about it, but no rush. We're not asking. If you want to say something, you say, and we're not pushing,\" said his father. \"He went through a lot of stuff.\"",
      "\"He's just happy to be home, you know, just to sit with Mika and Roy [his siblings] and just to hang out and just be with us and watch TV yesterday,\" his parents said.",
      "During his long captivity, Edan saw his parents on the news, pleading for his release.",
      "\"I think the fact that he saw us, saw us running and fighting and knocking on every door, kept him hopeful,\" said his father, along with \"the fact that he was held with other hostages all together, and not by himself, kept him hopeful. And he's just a strong kid, you know, strong mentally and physically.\"",
      "Hamas has held many of its hostages in tunnels under the Gaza Strip, with many, including Alexander, saying they never saw daylight at all.",

      "\"Edan told us, so when they heard the bombing, it was very, very concerning, scary,\" said Adi. \"And at some point, one of the tunnels collapsed.\"",
      "\"He told us sometimes he was afraid to go to sleep. Because maybe they are going to bomb this place that he is specifically inside,\" added the father. \"It was very scary.\"",
      "Now back together as a family, their thoughts are still very much with the other hostages.",
      "\"We are still continuing to speak for all the 58 hostages that are still there,\" Yael told CBS News. \"Whatever Edan told me about hostages [who were] with him, you know, during any time of the captivity, I'm calling their moms and dads, and I'm telling them from the hospital \u2014 I've done it already \u2014 and I am telling them whatever Edan told me. You know, to give them a little bit hope that their story could end also soon, and with a good ending.\"",
      "She knows better than most how much power that hope can provide.",
      "\"It's very important, you know. For me, every hostage that got released, it was like, 'Oh my God, maybe he saw Edan. Maybe he can tell me something, and I don't care if it's not from two days, you know. Maybe a year ago he was with Edan, but still, to hear something about my boy, you know, it was very crucial to us.\"",
      "At least one of those previously released hostages came to visit Edan in the hospital last week. Fellow U.S.-Israeli dual national Sagui Dekel-Chen, who was released after 498 days in captivity, said in a statement released Monday by the Hostage Families Forum that he and Edan were together for a while in captivity.",
      "\"Our fates became intertwined in the most complex situation one could imagine,\" Dekel-Chen said in the statement. \"It was important for me to come and welcome Edan upon his return. I know what he went through and what he still has ahead of him. I am very happy for him and his family. I hope that soon I will be able to embrace all the other hostages who remain behind as well.\"",
      "Yael Alexander said \"it was unbelievable to see\" the two men reunited in freedom. \"It was a miracle. This is the victory \u2014 to see the hostages together.\"",
      "\u00adAsked what their family wanted the world to know now, as rumors swirl once again of potential progress in ceasefire talks despite the ramped-up Israeli military operations, Adi said the message was simple: Act now.",
      "\"The urgency,\" he told CBS News. \"Just the urgency. Our son, he was lucky to get out \u2026 Listen, you can't treat agony with more agony. This war needs to end.\"",
      "For the time being, however, there is no end in sight. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Monday that Israel intends to keep pushing its offensive in Gaza, to seize complete control of the Palestinian territory.",
      "\"We're grateful for Steve [Witkoff], for President Trump, and for Adam Boehler,\" said the relieved father. \"Great job. But the job is not done. We still have more to do.\"",

      "Coral reefs \u2014 which are essential for maintaining marine life and biodiversity, as well as helping protect coastal communities from storms \u2014 are losing their colors and transforming in the warming waters fueled by changing climate.",
      "\"It's sad and disheartening,\" Taylor said. \"It was really colorful probably two years ago. And now it's all bleached white.\"",
      "According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 84% of coral reefs are now under heat stress that can cause bleaching. When the ocean warms, the algae that give corals their vibrant hues are pushed out, leaving them as white skeletons.",
      "Marine scientist Greg Asner leads Allen Coral Atlas, a program that maps the world's coral bleaching with the goal of conservation.",
      "\"There are some heat waves where you and I might swim around for a while and actually start sweating in the water. Corals and other species that live on the seafloor are much more sensitive than we are,\" said Asner, who's also the director of the Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science at Arizona State University.",
      "On both land and sea, 2024 was the\u00a0earth's hottest year on record, according to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.",
      "With the average ocean surface temperature hitting 70 degrees, the rising heat is speeding up coral deaths. It used to take years to kill a reef. Now, it can take weeks \u2014 sometimes days.",
      "Compared to Hawaii, the decline of coral reefs is worse in the Great Barrier Reef and the Galapagos Islands, according to Asner. The problem is most severe in the Caribbean and the state of Florida.",
      "\"It's heart wrenching to see these huge areas, expanses of amazing biological diversity, just go. It's like pulling the plug on a TV, and it's just static, just goes blank ... And the recovery is extraordinarily slow to zero,\" Asner said.",
      "Without healthy and thriving reefs, aquatic creatures lose their habitats and coastlines lose a natural seawall that can protect communities from storms \u2014 preventing billions of dollars in flood damage, according to the NOAA.",
      "While the situation is dire, not all hope is lost.",
      "There's a push to educate tourists to use sunscreens that don't contain\u00a0chemicals that are harmful to corals, and solutions like underwater nurseries are allowing corals to repair and regrow, but it's going to take time.",
      "\"The next gen, the folks that I'm training now, they could be the ones who could see the recovery phase. If we get fossil fuels under control,\" Asner said.",

    "story": [
      "A Lufthansa plane flew for about 10 minutes without a pilot when the co-pilot became incapacitated while the captain was outside the cockpit during a flight last February,\u00a0according to Spain's Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility.",
      "The flight on Feb. 17, 2024, from Frankfurt, Germany, to Seville, Spain \u2014 an Airbus A321 carrying 199 passengers and six crew members \u2014  was over the Iberian Peninsula when the captain left the flight deck to go to the bathroom. Shortly afterward, the 38-year-old co-pilot \"suffered a sudden and severe incapacitation,\" a report from the Ministry of Transport said.",
      "The report ultimately concluded that the plane \"flew for about 10 minutes in the cruise phase with the autopilot engaged but without additional supervision by either pilot.\"",
      "When the captain was finished in the bathroom, he could not get back into the cockpit, according to the report. The door to the cockpit can only be opened from the inside, so to get back in, the captain would have to enter a code that would then alert the person inside the cockpit to open the door for them.",
      "The captain entered the code several times but still couldn't get into the flight deck. When a crew member tried to contact the co-pilot from the intercom, there was no response. The captain then used the emergency code \u2014 which would have unlocked the door after a short delay \u2014  to try to get into the flight deck, but before the delay expired, the co-pilot opened the door from the inside to let him in.",
      "The captain noticed the co-pilot was \"pale, sweating and moving strangely,\" according to the report, so he was given first aid by a crew member and a doctor who happened to be traveling on the flight as a passenger. That doctor diagnosed the co-pilot with a possible heart condition, the report said.",
      "The investigation into the incident concluded the co-pilot's incapacitation was \"the symptom of a neurological condition that had not been detected either by the affected person himself or in the previous aeronautical medical examinations.\"",
      "The report found that the co-pilot lost consciousness so suddenly, he didn't have time to warn other crew members.",
      "While the co-pilot was incapacitated, he inadvertently hit several switches in the cockpit, including increasing pressure on one of the foot pedals, according to the report. This caused a 2-degree roll and a 5-degree heading change, both of which were fixed by the plane's autopilot, which remained on the whole time.",
      "About two minutes elapsed from the time the captain first tried to get back into the cockpit to when the door was finally opened, according to the report.",
      "The captain diverted the plane to the nearest airport, which was Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid Barajas Airport, where the flight landed safely about 20 minutes later. The co-pilot did not return to the cockpit for the rest of the flight.",
      "The co-pilot's condition would not have been found during medical screenings unless he was actively experiencing symptoms at the time or had previously experienced them, the report said. The co-pilot's medical certificate was suspended after the flight, with the report noting: \"This illness is disqualifying for obtaining or maintaining medical fitness to fly.\"",

      "New York City's congestion pricing program essentially assesses drivers a toll for driving on some streets in Manhattan, with the price varying depending on the time of day.",
      "Late in the night of April 23, SDNY attorneys representing Duffy and the Department of Transportation published an 11-page confidential memo in federal court in Manhattan, explaining that the Trump administration's argument to end the NYC driver's tax was weak and included \"considerable litigation risk.\" The next day, the memo was taken down from the public case docket, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District said the filing was a mistake.",
      "In response, officials at the Transportation Department said they would be transferring the case to the DOJ's civil division, according to the New York Times. Fox News Digital reached out to the DOT to confirm the attorneys involved in the mistaken filing were off the case, but did not immediately receive a response.",

      "\"It's imperative to know whether this filing was inadvertent, and incompetent, or something worse,\" Houston Keene, the director of Democracy Restored said. \"The memo contains confidential legal advice that just happens to criticize the secretary and department's legal strategy \u2014 quite an inconvenient document to have made public for lawyers doing their best for their client.\"",
      "Democracy Restored said in its letter that more fact-finding must take place, but indicated there are \"a variety\" of potential ethical and legal violations associated with the mistaken filing, particularly if the act was done on purpose.",
      "While it can not be concluded whether the act stemmed from incompetence, or whether it was purposeful, Democracy Restored points to the \"partisan political activity\" and involvement in political non-profits by the attorneys involved, suggesting it could shed light on the motivations behind the action.",

      "\"US Attorneys must be nonpartisan and objective in their work and the partisan backgrounds of these attorneys add to the doubts,\" Keene said. \"Far too many questions remain unanswered about this incident. The DOJ must investigate this matter immediately.\"",
      "In early January, NYC launched its congestion pricing program, or driver's tax, which imposed a $9 daytime toll on most individuals driving their cars into Manhattan's core, south of Central Park. A month later, the Trump administration issued a federal order meant to halt the program by March 21, but the tolls have continued as the result of a federal lawsuit filed by New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the state agency that runs New York City's public transit system.",

      "The state of cybersecurity in the healthcare industry worries me a lot. Healthcare organizations, whether nonprofit or for-profit, collect an enormous amount of data. And it's not just phone numbers, addresses or emails but also sensitive information like medical records, insurance details and more. This data is extremely valuable, which makes it a prime target for hackers.",
      "What's worse is that many healthcare institutions often neglect cybersecurity and treat it as an afterthought. In 2024 alone, an industry tracker recorded 1,160 healthcare breaches that exposed 305 million patient records. This marked a 26% increase compared to the previous year.",
      "Against this backdrop, Ascension, a Missouri-based Catholic health system with 142 hospitals and 142,000 employees, recently disclosed that a December 2024 breach exposed the personal and medical information of more than 430,000 patients.",

      "A hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "According to\u00a0Ascension's breach notification letters, the compromise began on Dec. 5, 2024, when the network learned patient data\u00a0\"may have been involved in a potential security incident.\" By Jan. 21, 2025, its investigators had determined that Ascension had \"inadvertently disclosed information to a former business partner,\" and that attackers likely stole data from that partner via a flaw in its software. In other words, patient records passed from Ascension into a third party's system and were then siphoned off by cybercriminals.",
      "The attackers gained a broad array of information. Impacted patients' demographic and financial details, names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, race, gender and Social Security numbers were exposed. Even more worryingly, the breach included clinical data from hospital stays, including physician names, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and procedure codes, medical record numbers and insurance details. This is the very data that criminals can exploit for fraud or identity theft.",
      "A healthcare worker typing on a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "Timeline and involvement",
      "Ascension reported the breach to regulators via an HHS filing on April 28, 2025, which shows 437,329 patients affected. By comparison, the company had earlier disclosed the impact in state filings. For example, 114,692 Texas patients and 96 Massachusetts residents were individually notified of exposure. In response, Ascension is offering those affected two years of free identity monitoring services (credit monitoring, fraud consultation and identity theft restoration).",
      "For scale, Ascension is a major nonprofit health system, one of the largest in the U.S., operating 142 hospitals across North America. The company has not named the third-party partner, but its description fits a vendor whose secure file-transfer software was breached.",
      "The timing aligns with a series of\u00a0recent Cl0p ransomware attacks. Cl0p has publicly claimed responsibility for exploiting a zero-day flaw in Cleo's secure file-transfer products, stealing data from dozens of organizations worldwide. While Ascension itself was not directly hit by ransomware, its data might have ended up in that same attack campaign.",
      "Ascension's patients and employees are no strangers to data breaches. In May 2024, a\u00a0Black Basta ransomware attack compromised Ascension's own network. That incident, traced back to a single employee opening a malicious file, resulted in the exfiltration of data belonging to nearly 5.6 million people.",
      "The fallout was severe. Hospitals lost access to digital records, forcing clinicians to record vitals, medications and orders on paper. Elective procedures and some appointments were paused, and emergency services were redirected to unaffected facilities to avoid delays in care.",

      "If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Ascension data breach.",
      "1) Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, Ascension attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Ascension breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Ascension breach, including Social Security numbers and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5) Monitor your credit reports: Regularly check your credit reports through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6) Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7) Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Attackers have frequently targeted Ascension, but the company does not seem to be learning its lesson. If it were a one-off incident, it might be understandable. But how do you fail to strengthen cybersecurity after experiencing a nationwide blackout? Rather than being an isolated event, this breach feels like part of a larger pattern. The industry relies on complex vendor networks and outdated IT systems, while cybercriminals continue to exploit emerging vulnerabilities.",

Lately, they have been getting more creative, turning to the built-in features of our phones to pull off their schemes. One of the latest targets is NFC, the technology behind tap-to-pay.",
      "It might seem harmless, but a new scam is using it in ways most people would never expect. An Android malware called SuperCard goes beyond just stealing your card details. It gives attackers the ability to use your card remotely for real transactions. And the worst part is that it all begins with something as simple as a text message.",

      "An Android phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What makes SuperCard X different?",
      "SuperCard X stands out from other Android malware because of how it operates. As reported by\u00a0researchers at Cleafy, instead of stealing usernames, passwords or verification codes, it uses a method called NFC relay. This allows attackers to copy card data from a victim's device in real time and use it elsewhere to make payments or withdraw cash. The process does not require physical access to the card or knowledge of the PIN.",
      "The malware is offered through a Malware-as-a-Service model, which means different cybercriminals can use it in their own regions. This makes the threat more scalable and harder to contain. Unlike most banking trojans, SuperCard X is not focused on one specific institution. It targets any cardholder regardless of which bank issued their card.",
      "Another key difference is how stealthy the malware is. It uses minimal permissions and does not include extra features that would make it easier to detect. This lean approach helps it avoid detection by antivirus software and allows it to operate quietly on infected devices.",

      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How the scam works",
      "The fraud begins with a message sent through SMS or WhatsApp. It pretends to be from a bank and warns the recipient about a suspicious transaction. The message includes a phone number and urges the person to call to resolve the issue. This is the first step in gaining the victim's trust.",
      "Once on the phone, the attacker poses as a bank representative and walks the victim through a fake security process. This may include asking them to confirm personal details or adjust settings in their mobile banking app, such as removing spending limits on their card.",
      "Next, the attacker asks the victim to install a mobile app that is described as a tool to verify the account or enhance security. In reality, this app contains the SuperCard X malware. After the installation, the attacker instructs the victim to tap their card against the phone. The malware then captures the NFC data from the card and sends it to a second phone controlled by the attacker.",
      "Using the copied data, the attacker can make contactless payments or make ATM withdrawals almost instantly. This method allows them to steal funds quickly and leaves little opportunity for banks or victims to intervene in time.",
      "A woman scrolling on her phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "8 ways you can stay safe from SuperCard X malware",
      "1) Be cautious of suspicious texts and calls. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Fraudulent campaigns often begin with an SMS or call that seems to come from your bank. These messages usually claim there's suspicious activity on your account and urge you to click a link or dial a number to resolve the issue. However, this is a tactic used to gain access to your personal information. Always approach such messages with skepticism.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:\u00a0One of the key ways malware like SuperCard X spreads is through deceptive apps that victims are persuaded to install. These apps often look harmless, posing as tools for security or account verification. If you receive a link to download an app via SMS, email or messaging apps like WhatsApp, do not click on it. Instead, only download apps from trusted sources, such as the Google Play Store. Additionally, carefully review app permissions and avoid granting unnecessary access, particularly to sensitive data like NFC, location or personal contacts.",
      "3) Turn off NFC when not in use:\u00a0NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a useful feature that allows contactless payments and data exchanges. However, it can be exploited by attackers to capture your card information without you even realizing it. To minimize your risk of falling victim to NFC-based malware like SuperCard X, turn off NFC when you're not actively using it.",
      "On most Android devices, you can do this by going to \"Settings,\" then \"Connected Devices\" or \"Connection Preferences,\" where you\u2019ll find the NFC toggle. By disabling NFC, your phone won't transmit data wirelessly, which helps protect your payment card information from being stolen by nearby attackers.",
      "4) Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and cards:\u00a0If your device has come into contact with the SuperCard or anything similar, it\u2019s possible your banking details are already compromised. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to regularly check your transaction history for anything odd, like a small payment you don\u2019t remember making or a charge from a strange location could be a sign of misuse. If you spot anything suspicious, report it to your bank right away. It\u2019s also worth checking your credit reports every now and then to catch signs of identity theft before they snowball into bigger issues.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: If scammers have targeted you once, there's a higher chance they\u2019ll try again, especially if your personal details (like your phone number, address or email) are easily found online. Data removal services scan people-search sites and brokers, then request the removal of your info. This reduces your exposure and helps prevent future phishing or social engineering attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Contact your bank and freeze your cards:\u00a0If you think you\u2019ve tapped or handled a suspicious card, or if your phone acted strangely afterward, don\u2019t brush it off. Call your bank and let them know what happened. They can freeze your card to stop any unauthorized payments and issue a new one for added safety. You should also ask them to monitor your account more closely for a while. On top of that, place a fraud alert with a credit bureau so no one can easily open a new line of credit in your name.",
      "7) Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you've been targeted by a sophisticated scam like SuperCard X, there's a chance your personal information, not just your card data, may be at risk. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information, like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8) Report the scam to your national cybercrime authority: Whether or not you lost money, reporting the scam helps authorities track emerging threats and warn others. You can report such fraud to the FBI\u2019s\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center or the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. Your report could help catch the people behind the scam or at least shut down their infrastructure.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The SuperCard X malware campaign represents a significant shift in how cybercriminals are targeting individuals and financial institutions. By exploiting NFC technology and combining it with social engineering tactics, attackers have found a way to bypass traditional fraud detection systems. What's especially concerning is how quickly these attacks unfold, making them harder to detect before the damage is done. As this threat evolves, it's important for both consumers and institutions to recognize the potential risks of these multilayered fraud strategies.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reports on China\u2019s Zhiyuan unveiling the world\u2019s first tri-ducted wearable eVTOL with hands-free control.",
      "Have you ever imagined what personal flying could look like in the near future? China's Zhiyuan Research Institute, based in Hangzhou, is bringing that vision closer to reality. They just unveiled what they're calling the world's first tri-ducted wearable electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for individual use, and their recent demo flight is already sparking curiosity about the future of personal flight.",

      "Tri-ducted wearable eVTOL for individual use (Zhiyuan Research Institute) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's so special about this flying machine?",
      "The coolest thing about this eVTOL is its tri-ducted propulsion system. That means it has three powerful propellers, one on the left, one on the right and one in the back, all working together to keep the aircraft stable and efficient. This setup isn't just for show. It actually helps the vehicle fly smoother, cut down on noise and hover more reliably. It's the first time a manned aircraft has used this kind of design, which is pretty groundbreaking.",
      "Safety is a huge focus for the Zhiyuan team. They built in a one-click separation system that lets the pilot quickly detach from the aircraft and deploy a low-altitude parachute if something goes wrong. That way, the pilot can land safely even in an emergency, which is a big comfort for anyone flying solo.",
      "Flying this thing isn't just for experts. Zhiyuan developed a ground control system that helps keep things simple. The eVTOL can hover steadily and fly on its own without the pilot having to constantly control it, and it can make quick, agile moves when needed. The controls are designed to be easy to use, so even people without much flying experience can handle them.",
      "On the power side, the team created a new propulsion system with a high thrust-to-weight ratio. They used advanced ducted motor designs to make the whole thing more efficient. Plus, the flight control system can handle turbulent weather, so the ride stays smooth even when the air gets rough.",

      "ARE THESE AUTONOMOUS TRANSPORT PODS THE FUTURE OF SKY-HIGH COMMUTING?",
      "China's growing low-altitude economy",
      "This new eVTOL is part of a much bigger trend in China. The country is working hard to grow what it calls its \"low-altitude economy,\" which includes drones, eVTOLs and other aircraft that fly below about 3,280 feet. The government has made low-altitude aviation a priority and is promising support for commercial spaceflight and next-generation air mobility technologies. Experts estimate that this industry could be worth more than $137 billion by 2030 as these aircraft find more uses in areas like logistics, tourism and public services.",

      "Here are 14 essential protective measures to shield yourself from check washing scams.",
      "1. Use a black gel pen: When writing checks, always use a\u00a0black gel pen. The ink is much harder to remove compared to regular ballpoint pen ink.",
      "2. Bring checks directly to the post office when mailing them: If using a mailbox, make sure to drop off your mail before the final scheduled pickup so it is not left sitting overnight.",
      "3. Sign up for USPS Informed Delivery: Stay ahead by signing up for\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery. You will receive digital previews of incoming mail so you can monitor for any missing items early. Learn more about why it's important\u00a0here.",
      "4. Monitor your bank accounts: Set up real-time alerts for check clearing and review your statements weekly to catch any suspicious activity. Also, ask your bank about any other fraud-prevention tools they offer to protect your accounts.",
      "5. Switch to digital payments when possible: Use your bank\u2019s mobile app to deposit checks without mailing or physically delivering them, reducing the risk of theft or tampering.",
      "6. Use checks with built-in security features: Choose checks printed on paper with watermarks, chemical-sensitive coatings or other security features that make check washing much harder.",
      "7. Limit the information on checks: Avoid unnecessary personal details. Do not print your Social Security number, driver\u2019s license number or phone number on your checks. The less information available, the less a fraudster can use.",
      "HOW CYBERSCAMS ARE DRAINING AMERICANS WALLETS BY THE BILLIONS",
      "8. Store checks securely: Keep blank checks in a safe place. Store your checkbook in a locked drawer or safe, not in your purse, car or an easily accessible location at home.",
      "9. Check your mailbox security: Install a\u00a0locking mailbox. If possible, use a mailbox with a lock to prevent thieves from stealing outgoing or incoming mail.",
      "10. Be cautious with endorsements: When endorsing checks, write \"For Deposit Only\" along with your account number to prevent others from cashing the check.",
      "11. Enroll in identity theft protection with check fraud specialization: Choose services that specifically monitor for compromised check details on dark web marketplaces and alert you to suspicious check-cashing patterns.

      "12. Invest in personal data removal services: Minimize exposure of sensitive details (like addresses or banking affiliations) that fraudsters could exploit for check-washing scams. Removing your personal information from these sites can help reduce your risk of becoming a victim. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "13. Shred sensitive documents: Shred old checks and bank statements. Don\u2019t just throw them away. Shred any documents with sensitive banking information.",
      "14. Report suspicious activity immediately: If you suspect check fraud or missing mail, report it to your bank and the\u00a0U.S. Postal Inspection Service right away.",
      "15. Use Positive Pay if you are a business:\u00a0Positive Pay is a fraud prevention service offered by most banks to business customers. It works by matching the checks you issue with the ones presented for payment. If something doesn\u2019t add up, like a changed amount or payee, the bank flags it for your review before it\u2019s processed. You usually need to sign up through your bank, and there might be a fee, but it\u2019s a smart way to protect your business from check fraud, especially if you write a lot of checks.",

      "First of all, once Microsoft stops supporting your version of Windows, your PC no longer receives security patches, bug fixes, updated drivers, or browser support. Even if the system still runs smoothly, it becomes more vulnerable to cyber threats like\u00a0malware,\u00a0ransomware,\u00a0phishing attacks and\u00a0data theft. An outdated operating system is like an unlocked door. Hackers and malicious software often target these systems specifically because of their weaknesses. If you plan to keep using an older computer, especially with internet access, it's time to\u00a0update your operating system.",

      "3. Disable browsers (or use a safer alternative): If you need occasional internet access, avoid using outdated browsers like old versions of Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Instead, try\u00a0privacy-focused alternative browsers. Or better yet? Disable browsers altogether and connect to the web on a newer, supported device.",
      "4. Install strong antivirus software that supports legacy systems: Even an offline PC can be exposed via USB drives or transferred files. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Before installing antivirus software, make sure your older computer meets the minimum system requirements. Check for supported operating system (OS) version, RAM, and processor architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).

Many desktops (and some laptops) let you upgrade RAM by simply opening the case and inserting the new memory sticks into available slots.",
      "2. Upgrade to an SSD: If you're still using a traditional hard drive, switching to a solid-state drive can dramatically reduce boot times and make your PC feel brand new. For most older machines, look for SSDs labeled \"2.5-inch SATA\", which are the most widely compatible and easy to install. Some newer systems support faster NVMe SSDs, which connect directly to the motherboard. Check your PC model or open the case to see which type your system supports. Be sure to back up your files, then either reinstall the operating system manually or clone your current drive before replacing it.",

These services allow you to securely store your photos, videos and documents in the cloud, freeing up valuable storage on your device. One significant advantage of cloud storage is accessing files from any device with an internet connection, whether on your phone, tablet or another computer.",
      "Most cloud services provide a certain amount of free storage (typically between 2GB and 15GB) before upgrading to a paid plan. For instance,\u00a0Google Drive offers 15GB of free storage shared across Google services, while\u00a0Dropbox\u00a0provides 2GB for free with options to upgrade for more space.\u00a0OneDrive provides 5GB for free, but Microsoft users can get additional storage through Office 365 subscriptions, granting access to the Microsoft Office suite.",

This can be particularly helpful for large photo and video libraries, which can be set to upload automatically from your phone or computer.

The following steps will help you protect your files and personal data from cyber threats and accidental loss.",

      "4.\u00a0Install and maintain strong antivirus software: Use a strong antivirus program and keep it updated to protect against malware and other security threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

      "5. Regularly update your operating system and applications: Keep your devices and software\u00a0up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6. Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Avoid accessing sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public networks, or use a VPN for added security. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Backup your data regularly: Create\u00a0multiple backups of your important files, including at least one offline copy.",
      "8. Use secure file transfer methods: When sharing files, use encrypted transfer methods or\u00a0password-protected links.",
      "By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your data and protect yourself from potential cyber threats.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Your PC\u2019s storage can fill up fast, but you can always free up some space. I personally prefer storing images and videos that take up too much space on an external drive. This way, I can access them whenever I need to while keeping my PC storage free. If an external drive feels like too much of a hassle, you can always opt for cloud storage.

There are other data brokers that do not bother indexing individual profiles with search engines, preferring instead to deal with other companies and even governments directly. These are the other major types of data brokers, in addition to people search sites:",

      "Recruitment data brokers collect and process personal information to offer background screening services to organizations evaluating job candidates or performing background checks before making an offer. Unfortunately, although illegal, there is nothing actually stopping unscrupulous employers from using the much less regulated and reliable people search sites for the same purposes.",
      "Risk mitigation brokers aggregate a variety of background, criminal, property and other information to provide assessment reports to various investment and business companies. The information they collect is aimed at helping such companies manage risk in taking on new business.",
      "Financial information brokers collect various personal finance and background information for credit companies and banks to calculate your credit score and may influence your eligibility to get loans and lines of credit.",
      "Health information data brokers collect information about your general health and sell it to companies in healthcare and related fields. This information can be used to target you with health product ads and even set your insurance premiums.",
      "Hackers are most likely to use people search sites, though; they are easily accessible, eminently searchable, relatively cheap (with trial offers for as little as a dollar) and do not ask any questions. Other data brokers may also sell personal information to hackers, but they tend to sell profiles in bulk.",

      "The good news is that, thanks to an incomplete patchwork of state laws, personal information removal services can approach hundreds of individual data brokers on your behalf with legally binding data-removal requests.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "It is easy to feel overwhelmed when you realize just how much of your personal information is out there, and how many different players are collecting, selling and using it. But knowing how data brokers operate is the first step to taking back control. Whether it is people search sites or the less visible brokers working behind the scenes, your data is valuable, and you deserve to know who has it and what they are doing with it. The good news is, there are tools and services out there that can help you clean up your digital footprint and protect your privacy.

      "\"It actually pretty much did the opposite with so many because the system was broken, the policies and practices were broken, where children were being placed [with] sponsors that were unvetted or improperly vetted or may have been illegal aliens themselves or smugglers or criminals,\" Clem, who was based out of Yuma, Arizona, during the Biden administration, told Fox News Digital. \"So, my role was to go in there with my 27-plus years of Border Patrol experience, and having dealt with this firsthand in the field for years, to rebuild and put\u2026 commonsense practices and policies in place.

That followed a slim-margin 2016 referendum vote calling for the U.K.'s departure. The government of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other senior EU officials, billed the summit as a major milestone in resetting relations.",

      "ROME \u2014 Vice President JD Vance shuffled between presidents and prime ministers this week, tending to complicated relationships with U.S. allies and puzzling over two wars.",
      "But it was his meeting Monday with newly installed Pope Leo XIV that could prove to be most consequential on the world stage, Vance said in an interview with NBC News.",
      "As his SUV limo sped to the airport here at the end of a three-day trip centered around the first U.S.-born pontiff\u2019s inaugural Mass, Vance spoke of Leo as a key potential partner in President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine and in other conflict areas.",
      "\u201cWe talked a lot about what\u2019s going on in Israel and Gaza. We talked a lot about the Russia-Ukraine situation,\u201d Vance said of the nearly hourlong audience he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio had with Leo. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict the future, but I do think that not just the pope, but the entire Vatican, has expressed a desire to be really helpful and to work together on facilitating, hopefully, a peace deal coming together in Russia and Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Vance, who is Catholic, said he found the pope to be \u201cextremely sweet.\u201d He described their conversation as substantive \u2014 a promising sign given how Leo had, in his previous service as a cardinal, signaled disapproval of Trump administration immigration policies. Hours after the audience, Trump issued a social media post suggesting Leo could be helpful in the Russia-Ukraine talks.",
      "\u201cWe have an American pope of the world\u2019s largest single religion \u2014 a guy who doesn\u2019t have an army, but who I think has an incredible amount of capacity to convene and to influence, not just Europe, but, really, the entire world,\u201d said Vance, riding in the backseat alongside second lady Usha Vance as their motorcade delivered them to Air Force Two for their return to Washington.",
      "\u201cI hope it\u2019s the beginning of a very good relationship, because I think he does care a lot about peace,\u201d he added. \u201cIf there is a single most productive thing [from the trip], my hope is that it will be that the relationship between us and the Vatican leads to a lot fewer people getting killed and a lot less humanitarian disaster.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the Vatican acknowledged \u201can exchange of views on some current international issues, during which hope was expressed that humanitarian law and international law be respected in areas of conflict and that there be a negotiated solution between the parties involved.\u201d",
      "This week\u2019s diplomatic efforts underscore the large foreign policy role Vance has carved out in Trump\u2019s administration. Trump has shown a limited appetite for travel in his second term. The president\u2019s recently completed Middle East visit was his first major overseas trip and only his second when counting his attendance last month at Pope Francis\u2019 funeral, where he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Vance, who met briefly with Francis\u00a0 the day before his death, has now been to Italy twice as vice president. He has also visited India, represented the White House at conferences in Paris and Munich and touched down in Greenland to reinforce Trump\u2019s interest in annexing the island from Denmark. And the White House nearly sent Vance from Rome on a last-minute mission to Israel \u2014 which Trump skipped on last week\u2019s tour \u2014 but said the logistics could not be worked out in time.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a particularly deliberate strategy of him traveling less or me traveling more,\u201d Vance said, weighing his globetrotting against Trump\u2019s. \u201cI just think it\u2019s kind of the way it\u2019s fallen.\u201d",
      "But Vance acknowledged that he has been given a broad portfolio and wide latitude.",
      "\u201cI definitely think the president has a lot of trust in me, and I\u2019m honored by it, and I think it makes me a more effective vice president,\u201d Vance said. \u201cA lot of people always asked me between the election and the inauguration: What would my role be? I would always say \u2026 I think it\u2019ll be being an extra set of eyes and ears for the president, doing the things that he thinks that I need to do, and that\u2019s largely how it\u2019s worked out.\u201d",
      "There was plenty for Vance to do in Rome.",
      "After Sunday\u2019s Mass, he and Rubio hosted Zelenskyy at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence here. A February clash between Vance and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office seemed like a distant memory when the vice president\u2019s office released a statement about \u201ctheir shared goal of ending the bloodshed\u201d and a photo of the two leaders smiling.",
      "From the Zelenskyy meeting, Vance hustled to Chigi Palace, where Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had brokered a meeting between Vance and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The sitdown was framed as an opportunity for constructive dialogue at a time when Trump\u2019s tariffs and Vance\u2019s adversarial posture toward European leaders have rattled the Continent.",
      "\u201cObviously, the president has had some pretty tough words \u2014 I guess I have, too, pretty tough words for Europe \u2014 about the importance of opening their markets, but also the importance of doing more burden-sharing in defense,\u201d Vance said in the interview. \u201cAnd I would say that one leader that both of us have consistently found is a really helpful bridge between the United States and Europe is Meloni.\u201d",
      "Meloni, like Trump and Vance, is known for her far-right politics. Vance observed that she has two qualities that he believes make her a strong diplomatic partner.",
      "\u201cThe first is that she\u2019s a very, very good listener. So if you have two people who really disagree on something, she tries to understand where both of them are coming from, and she\u2019s perceptive and insightful enough that she actually understands it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second thing is, she\u2019s extraordinarily direct. She actually reminds me a little bit of Usha in that way, where she can deliver an extraordinarily direct message without coming across as offensive. That\u2019s just a skill, right? There\u2019s a skill in actually being direct with somebody but not raising their guard.\u201d",
      "Vance also met Sunday with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and with British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Foreign Secretary David Lammy. He said his discussions with Carney centered on trade policy, a major issue between the U.S. and Canada.",
      "Diplomacy to this degree wasn\u2019t originally on the agenda for Vance\u2019s return to Rome.",
      "\u201cWhen we first started sketching out the trip, I thought, oh, this is kind of nice. We\u2019ll go to the papal Mass, Usha and I will have lunch afterwards, and just kind of take it easy on Sunday and fly home Sunday night or Monday,\u201d Vance, who had just finished a leisurely lunch with the second lady, said before clarifying that he looks for opportunities to \u201cdo as much as I possibly can\u201d on taxpayer-funded trips overseas.",
      "\u201cIt was a very personally rewarding trip,\u201d he added. \u201cOnce you\u2019re here and there are all these other world leaders here, you might as well try to try to sit down with them and talk to them.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s expansive role has placed him alongside Rubio, the administration\u2019s chief diplomat, as a face of Trump\u2019s foreign policy. The president stoked speculation of a 2028 rivalry between the two earlier this month when, in an interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d he suggested both as potential successors.",
      "At the time, allies of both Vance and Rubio dismissed any notion of competition or friction. Vance did so himself Monday, mentioning a recent conversation with a political consultant.",
      "\u201cI can just feel it \u2014 the media is going to start telling some story of me versus Marco or me having a rivalry with Marco,\u201d Vance recalled telling the consultant.",
      "\u201cMost of the time,\u201d Vance said, \u201cI don\u2019t give a s--- about this stuff. I don\u2019t even think that much about it.\u201d",
      "He and Rubio, Vance added, talk five times a day \u2014 \u201con a light day.\u201d If there\u2019s a call Vance knows Rubio will be on, he said, he knows he can skip the call and catch up with him later.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the level of trust and confidence that I have in Marco,\u201d Vance said.",
      "\u201cMy attitude is, if I do end up running in 2028, I\u2019m not entitled to it,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I really think that Marco and I can get a lot done together over the next few years. That\u2019s how I think about our friendship and our relationship. And I would be shocked if he thought about it any differently.\u201d"

      "A former executive assistant to Cuomo had testified that the notes written on a draft of the report looked like they were in his handwriting, the committee said.

      "Immigration attorneys told the court that at least two of their clients, from Myanmar and Vietnam, were deported Tuesday morning to South Sudan in violation of a court order, and they demanded their return.",
      "\u201cThe Court should further restrain all flights carrying class members to South Sudan or any other third country,\u201d the attorneys said.",
      "At an emergency hearing Tuesday night, U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy told the Trump administration to \u201cmaintain custody and control of class members currently being removed to South Sudan or to any other third country.\u201d This, the judge wrote in a court order, is to \u201censure the practical feasibility of return\u201d if the removals are found to have been unlawful.",

    "story": [
      "A two-paragraph Supreme Court order is upending the lives of some 350,000 Venezuelan migrants who have been allowed to live and work in the U.S. with special legal protection from deportation.",
      "The court\u2019s order Monday allows the Trump administration to strip Temporary Protected Status from the group of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans as a legal case on the matter continues.",
      "Attorneys representing the TPS holders said the Supreme Court\u2019s brief order raises questions, including exactly when the 350,000 Venezuelans will lose their legal protections.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the order and what comes next in the case.",
      "Who will be affected by the order?",
      "The Supreme Court order directly affects a group of some 350,000 Venezuelans who were granted Temporary Protected Status in 2023 by then-President Joe Biden for humanitarian reasons. Biden extended the protections for the group in January, allowing them to retain their legal status until October 2026.",
      "The Trump administration has been targeting both undocumented immigrants and those protected under legal programs in service of its goal of enacting mass deportations. President Donald Trump has sought to undo a series of protections granted during the Biden administration, including TPS.",
      "Shortly after Trump took office, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem moved to cancel the Biden administration\u2019s TPS extension, saying that it was \u201ccontrary to the national interest\u201d to continue the protections.",
      "Seven Venezuelan TPS holders and the National TPS Alliance sued the Trump administration, arguing that Noem\u2019s order violated legal procedures and was racially discriminatory. In March, a federal judge in San Francisco blocked the Trump administration from terminating the legal protections while the case played out. The administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene.",
      "Monday\u2019s order means that the 350,000 Venezuelans can now lose their protected status while the case continues to play out in court.",
      "\u201cThis is the largest de-documentation, or loss of legal status, for any group of people in the history of the country,\u201d Emi MacLean, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California working on the case, told NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s really devastating and has an extraordinary effect.\u201d",
      "What is TPS?",
      "Temporary Protected Status is granted to immigrants in the United States who can\u2019t return to their home countries because of natural disasters or political upheaval. It does not provide a path to citizenship.",
      "The Biden administration in March 2021 said because of political instability in the country, Venezuelans were eligible for the federal program, which has existed since 1990 to provide humanitarian relief to people from countries reeling from war, natural disasters or other catastrophes.",
      "People granted TPS have legal status in the U.S. and can get work authorization for up to 18 months, subject to extensions. Without that protection, those immigrants are subject to deportation but can seek other avenues for remaining in the U.S., such as claiming asylum.",
      "When will the Venezuelans lose TPS protections?",
      "Attorneys in the case said the group of 350,000 Venezuelans are now at risk of deportation and in limbo.",
      "Ahilan Arulanantham, one of the lawyers representing Venezuelan plaintiffs, said while the order means the 350,000 Venezuelans are going to lose their TPS status and work authorization, the court\u2019s order did not give a specific timing for the loss of the protected status.",
      "\u201cIt could be right now or it could be a week from now, or it could be some other time that\u2019s unclear,\u201d he said during a news conference Monday held after the Supreme Court\u2019s order.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in the hands of the government to clarify what the order means and how they interpret it,\u201d he said, adding that the legal team could challenge that interpretation in the ongoing court case.",
      "Arulanantham said what also remained unclear was the motivation or reasoning behind the Supreme Court\u2019s order.",
      "\u201cWe just don\u2019t know, because they haven\u2019t explained why,\u201d he said.",
      "MacLean said during the news conference that the district court has requested a status report on May 26 about the significance of the order, as well as a hearing on May 29 where both parties \u201cwill be discussing and analyzing what it means.\u201d",
      "While the order only directly affects the group of Venezuelan TPS holders who became eligible in 2023, the attorneys said the Supreme Court\u2019s order did not bode well for other TPS holders as their cases continue to play out in court.",
      "What has the Trump administration said about the order?",
      "The decision is a \u201cwin for the American people and the safety of our communities,\u201d Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Monday.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is re-instituting integrity into our immigration system to keep our homeland and its people safe,\u201d she added.",
      "The Trump administration on Tuesday declined to comment on how it interpreted the Supreme Court\u2019s order and the timing for Venezuelans' loss of TPS protections.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security stated on its website that it \u201chas every intention of ending Venezuela TPS under the 2023 designation as soon as it obtains relief from the court order.\u201d",
      "What comes next?",
      "\u201cThe litigation continues,\u201d said Jessica Bansal, an attorney with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s order leaves it open for the litigation to continue without the protection for the people who are affected by the secretary\u2019s decision.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut again, the case now continues under the shadow of an unexplained two-paragraph order with an unclear impact,\u201d Bansal said. \u201cWe will continue to fight because we know that we are in the right, both morally and legally.\u201d",
      "MacLean told NBC News the legal team will press forward with its arguments that Noem\u2019s order to terminate the TPS protections is \u201ccontrary to law and unconstitutionally motivated by racism.\u201d",
      "Oral arguments in the case were scheduled to be held in July.",
      "\u201cSo unless that is advanced, that means that there is a period of two months at least where Venezuelan TPS holders will be at risk,\u201d she said.",
      "MacLean said that if they succeeded in court, it would \u201creturn protections for the Venezuelan TPS holders\u201d as well as provide additional protections for 250,000 Venezuelan TPS holders who were granted their status in 2021, as well as some 500,000 Haitian TPS holders. Currently, TPS for Venezuelans who became eligible in 2021 would end in September. The administration would likely appeal that decision.",
      "If the judge ordered against the plaintiffs, their attorneys would also appeal that decision, MacLean said.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be additional legal battles that play out. The issue now for us is how quickly we can get back into court to try to return protections to the TPS holders who are at risk today or very soon,\u201d she said.",
      "The attorneys said they would also pursue other forms of immigration protection for the plaintiffs in the case, including tens of thousands of members of the National TPS Alliance who were affected by Noem\u2019s decision. They also encouraged other Venezuelan TPS holders to stay informed on the case and pursue if there are other forms of immigration protection they may be eligible for."

    "story": [
      "For some travelers, Newark Liberty International Airport has become a no-fly zone.",
      "With passengers spooked by reports of harried air traffic controllers' losing radio and radar contact with planes and dismayed by the resulting massive flight delays, the average daily number of travelers flying out of Newark, New Jersey, has dropped by as much as 20% compared with this time last year, from around 72,983 during the second week of May 2024 to 58,496 last week, according to Transportation Security Administration data reviewed by NBC News.",
      "Meanwhile, New York's LaGuardia Airport experienced a 16% increase in the average daily number of travelers during the same period, from 36,367 in 2024 to 42,037 this year, the data shows.",
      "And New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport has had a slight increase in the average number of daily travelers, from 96,392 in 2024 to 97,061 this year in the second week of May, according to the data.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration predicts higher-than-usual volume of flights for the Memorial Day weekend, with a peak of about 54,000 flights Thursday.",
      "\"We\u2019re expecting flight numbers to grow week by week throughout the summer, with the peak at the end of July and six more 54,000+ flight days before the end of August,\" the FAA said in a statement. \"Thursdays will be the busiest day of the week.\"",
      "But at Newark, the FAA has proposed reducing the number of arrivals and departures after air traffic communication issues caused controllers to lose radio and radar contact with the planes they were guiding for 90 seconds on April 28.",
      "There is \u201ca structure of how many flights can leave per hour. We have a delayed flight schedule of takeoffs,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said, Reuters reported Tuesday. \u201cYou are going to see a reduction.\u201d",
      "That reduction came by way of an interim order that takes effect Tuesday: Until construction of Runway 4-Left/22-Right is complete, the maximum hourly rate will be 28 arrivals and 28 departures, the FAA said. Daily construction will end June 15 but will continue on Saturdays through the end of the year.",
      "Outside of the construction period, 34 hourly arrivals and departures will be allowed until Oct. 25.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to relieve the substantial inconvenience to the traveling public from excessive flight delays due to construction, staffing challenges, and recent equipment issues, which magnify as they spread through the National Airspace System,\u201d acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau said in a statement.",
      "The agency added that arrival and departure limits could be adjusted higher or lower, depending on conditions.",
      "United Airlines, which has a hub at Newark, would be the most affected, Duffy said. \"They're the biggest player at Newark,\" he said.",
      "United Airlines said in a statement that \"reducing the number of flights scheduled at Newark will help ensure that we can safely and reliably operate the flights that remain on the schedule.\"",
      "Earlier this month, it voluntarily cut 35 round-trip flights per day from Newark, where, in addition to a shortage of controllers, ongoing runway construction has contributed to flight delays.",
      "\"We are confident that the decisive steps taken by Sec. Duffy, including his leadership on matching the airport\u2019s capacity to its operational limitations, will have it back operating reliably for the benefit of our customers,\" United said.",
      "Since Duffy announced last week that the FAA and the major airlines were talking about reducing the number of flights in and out of Newark, the percentage of flight cancellations has dropped significantly.",
      "For most of last week, Newark\u2019s share of nationwide flight cancellations had been hovering between 35% and 60%, according to FlightAware data. But on Friday, the number of cancellations was at 15%, and it dropped to 9% on Saturday.",
      "While Duffy has said no planes were ever in any danger of colliding or crashing when the controllers' radio and radar went down on April 28, several of the controllers working that day went on trauma leave, further reducing the already depleted ranks of controllers available to work the crowded skies over New Jersey.",
      "There should be 38 certified controllers serving Newark, the FAA has said. Currently, there are only 22.",
      "Mishaps continue to plague the aging system. The controllers for Newark, who are actually based in Philadelphia, lost radio frequencies with the planes they guide for 2 seconds at around 11:35 a.m. Monday.",
      "No planes were in danger of colliding, and the FAA said it is investigating.",
      "Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said Tuesday in an interview that \"it's absolutely safe to fly.\"",
      "But when he was asked whether it is likely to be a summer of travel woes at Newark airport, Daniels said that \"I think the focus has to be on it getting better soon\" and that the shortage of air traffic controllers is a nationwide problem.",
      "\u201cRight now we operate a system with 10,800 hard-working American men and women,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cBut we should be having 14,663 staff that very system.\u201d",
      "Many of the controllers are working six-day weeks and 10-hour shifts, he said.",
      "\"Morale is low right now when you\u2019re dealing with the pressure and scrutiny that\u2019s going on in the aviation system right now, with low staffing in every one of your facilities,\" Daniels said.",
      "Last month, Duffy said he expected the FAA to meet its goal of graduating 2,000 new air traffic controllers this year but warned the chronic shortage of controllers would take years to fix.",
      "But he has also gotten bipartisan pushback from lawmakers who noted that the April snafu happened not long after the Trump administration fired hundreds\u00a0of FAA workers, including maintenance mechanics, aeronautical information staff members and environmental protection specialists, in its effort to shrink the federal government."

      "A Southern California man was charged with felony animal cruelty after allegedly using food to lure and kill multiple cats over a period of months.",
      "Alejandro Oliveros Acosta, 46, of Santa Ana, is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday on charges that also include theft of a companion animal, a Bengal lynx he allegedly lured and stole, and possession of methamphetamine, prosecutors said.",
      "It wasn't clear if has retained a lawyer for the case. The Offices of the Orange County Public Defender did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.",
      "Oliveros was arrested April 24 amid ongoing investigations by police in Santa Ana and Westminster and freed on $40,000 bail, the Orange County District Attorney's Office said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Authorities said reports of a man luring cats with canned food and killing them by beating or stomping them began in Oliveros' neighborhood and other central Orange County communities late last year and continued to come in through spring.",
      "The Santa Ana and Westminster police departments zeroed in on Oliveros after witnesses identified him as a suspect in crimes against cats, and a search of his home on April 23 turned up evidence linking him to the attacks, Santa Ana police said in a statement.",
      "The DA's office and police also noted multiple incidents in which witnesses described a white Toyota pickup used by the suspect.",
      "According to the DA's statement on Tuesday, crimes connected to the defendant are alleged to include an April 5 fatal stomping of a cat captured on security video; an April 3 report of a man holding a cat over his head and slamming it down; and a March 21 report of a companion animal, a Bengal lynx, stolen after it was lured by a man with a can of food who was using a white Toyota Tacoma pickup.",
      "That cat, named Clubber, was ultimately returned to its owner, authorities said.",
      "\"Between November and April, seven reports of dead and injured cats were reported to Santa Ana Animal Control, including animals suffering from broken backs and bloody faces,\" the D.A.'s office said.",
      "On April 27, some of the residents who attended a nighttime Santa Ana vigil urging justice in the matter became unruly, vandalized property and threw objects, the city's police said in a statement.",
      "\"While we support the community\u2019s right to peacefully assemble, the Santa Ana Police Department will not tolerate acts of violence, vandalism, or any threats to public safety,\" it said.",
      "Oliveros' ability to remain free amid the ongoing investigation and case has angered some animal advocates. On Tuesday, the district attorney's office said it will seek a much higher bail amount, $100,000, arguing Oliveros poses a danger to the public.",
      "The defendant faces the possibility of more than five years behind bars if convicted on all counts, the DA's office said.",
      "Santa Ana, the seat of Orange County, is about 33 miles south-southeast of downtown Los Angeles."

    "story": [
      "Allegheny County Controller Corey O\u2019Connor defeated Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey in the city\u2019s hotly contested Democratic mayoral primary, The Associated Press projected Tuesday, after a race which garnered national attention as a notable proxy fight between progressives and center-left Democrats.",
      "With more than 85% of the vote in, O'Connor led Gainey 54%-46% in the nominating contest.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s election was one of the first major Democratic primaries since the 2024 election in which the party\u2019s progressive and center-left wings faced off. And the mayoral race followed an election cycle where Democratic governance of cities took center-stage in Republican campaign messaging.",
      "Gainey and his allies painted O\u2019Connor, the county controller and the son of a former mayor, as beholden to President Donald Trump and monied real estate interests, pointing to campaign donations from Trump backers and developers. The mayor, who was first elected in 2021, also pointed to drops in violent crime, local job growth and the city\u2019s improved credit ratings to counter O\u2019Connor, who portrayed Gainey as an unproductive mayor who\u2019s failed at managing city finances, its police department, and on general quality-of-life fronts",
      "O\u2019Connor launched his campaign late last year, emerging as a favorite early on and raising more money than Gainey, though polling showed the race tightening as Election Day neared. Last month, both campaigns touted internal polling showing them with an advantage in the tough-to-model local race: Gainey\u2019s campaign survey showed him up 7 points, while O\u2019Connor\u2019s showed him up by 4, though that was considerably closer than other polls his campaign touted earlier in the cycle that showed the challenger up double-digits.",
      "Gainey, the city\u2019s first Black mayor, won a contested primary in 2021, knocking off incumbent Mayor Bill Peduto in a three-way primary with a plurality of the vote. His win was part of a county-wide progressive advance, preceding wins by Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., and Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato, among other candidates on the left who have won major offices in the area in recent years.",
      "The Pittsburgh mayoral race elevated housing policy to the forefront of the local discussion. Gainey has sought to enact inclusionary zoning policies throughout Pittsburgh that require new developments to set aside at least 10% of units for affordable housing. Those policies currently apply to only a few neighborhoods, and O\u2019Connor came out against making inclusionary zoning citywide policy.",
      "Meanwhile, a key point of contention in the race focused on just how many affordable units have been or are being built in the city since the start of Gainey\u2019s term as mayor."

      "Republican Jack Ciattarelli is leaning on his endorsement from President Donald Trump to win next month's GOP primary for governor in New Jersey, pledging support for the president and saying during a debate Tuesday that he would not challenge Trump's executive orders in court.",
      "\"I'm going to continue to work with the president. We spoke about that last week when we spoke about making the country and New Jersey safe again. We do that by getting rid of sanctuary cities, by getting rid of our sanctuary state status,\" Ciattarelli said during an exchange on immigration policy.",
      "\u201cI told him my attorney general will not be suing the White House for executive orders. We're not going to waste taxpayer dollars,\u201d Ciattarelli said, later adding that he would \"follow [Trump]'s lead\" on deportations and that criminals should be deported.",
      "\"At the end of the day, if he's going to deport all 14, 15 or 16 million, I support the president,\" Ciattarelli said. \"He was elected on the promise of making the country safe again.\"",
      "Ciattarelli went on to defend his support for giving drivers licenses to undocumented immigrants, saying, \"If by chance there are people he is not going to deport, we have to know who they are.\"",
      "Ciattarelli touted Trump's endorsement multiple times throughout the debate, at which he faced off against former radio host Bill Spadea, a staunch Trump supporter, and state Sen. Jon Bramnick, a Trump critic. Two other GOP candidates on the ballot for the June 10 primary did not meet the fundraising threshold to qualify for the debate, which was hosted by On New Jersey, the New Jersey Globe, Rider University and Save Jersey.",
      "Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman who narrowly lost in the general election against Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021, has been leading the primary field in limited public polling and campaign spending. Ciattarelli's campaign also launched a TV ad Tuesday that highlighted Trump's endorsement.",
      "Spadea acknowledged at the debate that Trump opted to endorse Ciattarelli, but he suggested Trump was swayed by skewed polling.",
      "\u201cThe president endorsed a poll \u2014 a poll that was conducted and paid for by Jack\u2019s campaign,\" Spadea said in his opening statement. \"The president did not endorse a plan. The president did not endorse a set of principles.\u201d",
      "The candidates were asked how, as Trump allies, they would navigate Republican-led cuts to federal programs that could negatively affect New Jersey residents.",
      "\"Did not the recession back in 2011 impact our ability to do this and do that, but yet we met that challenge? And I believe we can meet this challenge,\" Ciattarelli said. \"But the first job of any governor is to provide for health and safety. And that [means] taking care of our most vulnerable people, whether it's people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, people on Medicaid, we will find a way.\"",
      "Spadea noted he has disagreed with Trump on \"multiple occasions.\"",
      "\"Disagreement is OK. You have to protect this state,\" Spadea said.",
      "Bramnick pledged \"to fight for New Jersey, even if it means disagreeing with Washington Republicans. New Jersey's got to come first; it's simple as that.\"",
      "Ciattarelli pitched himself as the candidate most likely to win in November. He lost to Murphy by 3 points four years ago, and this year's race is expected to be competitive. A crowded field of Democrats are competing in next month\u2019s primary to replace Murphy, who cannot run for re-election because of term limits."

      "Comey said he never considered that the post would generate controversy.",
      "\u201cI really thought that I was done,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in another life. I was a grandfather and an author wearing sweaters and jeans and then went for a walk on the beach and posted a silly picture of shells that I thought was a clever way to express a political viewpoint.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not my first rodeo,\u201d Comey said.",

      "McIver, the New Jersey congresswoman, was charged with two counts of \u201cassaulting, resisting, and impeding\u201d two federal immigration agents at a protest outside a migrant detention facility in Newark on May 9. She faces a maximum penalty of eight years in prison if she is convicted,\u00a0but\u00a0sentences are usually well below the maximum.",

      "A 21-year-old friend of the 20-year-old man who fell 20 feet from the stands during a Pittsburgh Pirates home game last month was charged Tuesday with giving him alcohol.",
      "Ethan Kirkwood, of McKeesport, Pennsylvania, was charged with two counts of furnishing alcohol to someone under 21. He is accused of buying beer for Kavan Markwood before Markwood plunged from the stands, according to a criminal complaint filed Tuesday.",
      "The complaint, written by Officer Timothy Zundel of the Pennsylvania State Police Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement, says Kirkwood admitted he bought beer for Markwood, who is a birthday shy of being the legal age to consume alcohol.",
      "The document does not allege alcohol consumption caused Markwood\u2019s fall. Kirkwood did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Kirkwood, the complaint says, is seen on video buying three rounds of beer, each time holding two 24-ounce cans. The high school acquaintances were at the game with two women, one of whom is Markwood's girlfriend, the complaint says.",
      "She told Pittsburgh police that her boyfriend had two of the beers during the game, according to the complaint.",
      "After Markwood fell, the women were seen on video scrambling to find Kirkwood, who subsequently handed a can to one of them, the complaint sats. She threw it in the trash, it says.",
      "Kirkwood then jumped over a railing and rushed to the field \"to help his friend,\" the complaint says.",
      "Court records show Kirkwood pleaded guilty to public drunkenness and the purchase of alcohol by a minor twice each for incidents in 2022 and 2023. Tuesday's criminal complaint alleges \"defendant's reputation for criminal activity\" bolsters its credibility.",
      "Markwood fell over the Roberto Clemente Wall after Pirates outfielder Andrew McCutchen produced a two-run double to give the Pirates a 4-3 lead and the final score in the seventh inning.",
      "The fall was followed by stunned silence among the more than 11,000 people at the park as players took a knee and Markwood appeared motionless on the field.",
      "He was rushed to Allegheny General Hospital, where he was reported in critical condition, before his condition improved.",
      "On May 5, Taryn Markwood, Markwood\u2019s sister, thanked first responders, hospital personnel and well-wishers who she said helped buoy the man's spirits and those of his family. She reported that breathing tubes were removed, a development that signals patients are breathing on their own.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m incredibly thankful to share that Kav is making remarkable progress,\u201d Taryn Markwood said at the time.",
      "Markwood himself spoke out two days later, telling the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\u00a0he had \"broken everything,\" that he had back pain and that he was unable to sleep but was otherwise \"all right.\"",
      "Markwood and Kirkwood are listed as players for South Allegheny High School's football team during the 2021-22 season. After Markwood fell, the South Allegheny School District said he was a team MVP who graduated in 2022.",
      "A preliminary hearing in the case against Kirkwood was scheduled for June 23."

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 00:46:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The spokesperson also said that the former president had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer before last week.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Joe Biden was never diagnosed with prostate cancer until last week, and the last time he was screened for it was more than a decade ago, a spokesperson for the former president said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s last known PSA was in 2014. Prior to Friday, President Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Screening for prostate cancer often involves a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test, which measures the level of protein produced by the prostate and could indicate potential disease. The test has a high proportion of false positives, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend it for men 70 and older since they are more likely to die of other medical conditions than prostate cancer.",
      "Biden, 82, had his last PSA 11 years ago.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "In recent years, doctors have increasingly begun screening for the disease in older patients. President Donald Trump, 78, received a PSA screening as recently as this year, according to medical records released by the White House.",
      "Since he revealed his diagnosis Sunday, Biden has faced scrutiny over whether the cancer had grown recently or whether it could have gone undiagnosed during his time as president.",
      "A diagnosis of prostate cancer so advanced is rare but not unheard of, according to doctors who treat it. Biden's cancer has advanced to an aggressive form, with medical experts saying it is treatable but not curable.",
      "Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist who did not treat Biden but served on his transition Covid advisory board, said Monday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that the cancer had most likely been \u201cgrowing there and spreading\u201d for years. Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society, told NBC News that in Biden\u2019s case, \u201cwe definitely would anticipate that he has had prostate cancer for many, many years.\u201d",
      "Still, there are exceptions \u2014 and some doctors have said that in rare cases patients can develop a high-risk form of the cancer that spreads quickly and aggressively."

    "story": [
      "HUNTSVILLE, Texas \u2014 A Texas man was executed Tuesday evening, 13 years to the day of a convenience store robbery in which he set an elderly clerk on fire in a Dallas suburb.",
      "Matthew Lee Johnson, 49, received a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. He was condemned for the May 20, 2012, attack on 76-year-old Nancy Harris, a great-grandmother he splashed with lighter fluid and set ablaze in the suburb of Garland. Badly burned, she died days afterward.",
      "Asked by the warden if he had a final statement, Johnson turned his head and looked at his victim\u2019s relatives, watching through a window close by.",
      "\u201cAs I look at each one of you, I can see her on that day,\u201d he said, speaking slowly and clearly. \u201cI please ask for your forgiveness. I never meant to hurt her.\u201d He added, \u201cI pray that she\u2019s the first person I see when I open my eyes and I spend eternity with.\u201d",
      "\u201cI made wrong choices, I\u2019ve made wrong decisions, and now I pay the consequences,\u201d said Johnson, who also asked forgiveness from his wife and daughters.",
      "There was little reaction from Harris\u2019 relatives \u2014 three sons, two daughters-in-law and a granddaughter \u2014 who witnessed the execution and declined to speak with reporters afterward.",
      "As the lethal dose of the sedative pentobarbital began taking effect, Johnson gasped several times, then made repeated sounds like snoring. Within a minute, all movement stopped. He was pronounced dead at 6:53 p.m. CT, 26 minutes after the drugs began flowing into his arms.",
      "Johnson\u2019s execution was the second carried out Tuesday in the United States. Hours earlier in Indiana, Benjamin Ritchie received a lethal injection for the 2000 killing of a police officer.",
      "The day\u2019s executions were part of a group of four scheduled within about a week\u2019s time. On May 15, Glen Rogers was executed in Florida. On Thursday, Oscar Smith is scheduled to receive a lethal injection in Tennessee.",
      "Security video captured part of the attack against Harris who, despite her burns, was able to describe the suspect before she died.",
      "Johnson\u2019s guilt was never in doubt. During his 2013 trial, he admitted to setting Harris on fire and also expressed remorse. \u201cI hurt an innocent woman. I took a human being\u2019s life ... It was not my intentions to \u2014 to kill her or to hurt her, but I did,\u201d he had said at the time.",
      "Johnson said he had not been aware of what he had done as he had been high after smoking $100 worth of crack. His attorneys told jurors Johnson had a long history of drug addiction and had been sexually abused as a child.",
      "Harris had worked at the convenience store for more than 10 years, living only about a block and a half away, according to testimony from one of her sons. She had four sons, 11 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.",
      "Prosecutors said Harris had only been working her Sunday morning shift for a short time when Johnson walked in, poured lighter fluid over her head and demanded money.",
      "After Johnson grabbed the money from the register, he set Harris on fire and calmly walked out of the store, according to court documents. Harris frantically tried to extinguish herself and her clothing, exiting the store and screaming for help before a police officer used a fire extinguisher to douse the flames covering her body. Johnson was arrested about an hour later.",
      "Harris suffered extensive second- and third-degree burns over her head and face, neck, shoulders, upper arms, and leg and was in a great deal of pain in the days before she died, a nurse and doctor testified.",
      "Johnson\u2019s legal team did not pursue any appeals this week with the U.S. Supreme Court, according to David Dow, one of the inmate\u2019s attorneys. Lower appeals courts had previously rejected defense requests to stay the execution, and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Friday denied Johnson\u2019s request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty.",
      "In previous appeals, Johnson\u2019s lawyers had argued his death sentence was unconstitutional because he was improperly determined to be a future danger to society, a legal finding that was needed to sentence him to death. His most recent appeals had argued his execution date had been illegally scheduled.",
      "Johnson was the fourth person put to death this year in Texas, historically the nation\u2019s busiest capital punishment state. Tuesday\u2019s executions in Texas and Indiana brought this year\u2019s total in the U.S. to 18."

    "story": [
      "For the second time in less than two weeks, immigration lawyers have gone to federal court to try and stop the Trump administration from deporting a small group of immigrants from the United States to a war-torn country not their own.",
      "Immigration attorneys told the court that at least two of their clients, from Myanmar and Vietnam, were deported Tuesday morning to South Sudan in violation of a court order, and they demanded their return.",
      "\u201cThe Court should further restrain all flights carrying class members to South Sudan or any other third country,\u201d the attorneys said.",

Murphy told the Trump administration to \u201cmaintain custody and control of class members currently being removed to South Sudan or to any other third country.\u201d This, the judge wrote in a court order, is to \u201censure the practical feasibility of return\u201d if the removals are found to have been unlawful.",
      "A further hearing on the matter is scheduled for Wednesday, where the judge has asked the Trump administration to identify those being\u00a0removed, the type of notice those individuals received and opportunities they had to \u201craise a fear-based claim\u201d before their removal to a third country. (A fear-based claim is generally one in which an individual expresses fear of harm like persecution or torture should they be deported.)",

      "Both of the immigrants alleged to have been sent to South Sudan on Tuesday were the subjects of final removal orders allowing the government to deport them to their countries of origin, according to court filings.",
      "In their filing, the attorneys included an email from the wife of a Vietnamese immigrant who said she believed her husband and at least 10 other people were deported to South Sudan on Tuesday morning. She said the immigrants had refused to sign forms facilitating their deportations to a country not their own.",
      "The woman, whose name was redacted in the filing, wrote to her husband\u2019s attorneys, \u201cThe order of removal signed by a judge is to deport my husband back to his country of origin, Vietnam, not to any other third country.\u201d",

The immigrants were from countries like the Philippines, Vietnam and Laos, according to an emergency motion their lawyers filed at the time.\u00a0That flight was stopped after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order.",
      "The judge said the immigrants needed to be given notice and the chance to raise concerns about possible torture or persecution. The attempt to stop or reverse the deportations to South Sudan is before the same judge.",
      "The immigration attorneys believe at least one of the people the Trump administration had tried to send to Libya was sent to South Sudan.",
      "Efforts to reach the South Sudanese government for comment were not successful."

    "story": [
      "House Democrats plan to introduce legislation overnight that would prevent further Trump administration cuts to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration funding or staffing after severe storms across the country drew attention to staffing cuts in National Weather Service field offices.",
      "The measure, which will be offered as an amendment to the Republican budget reconciliation bill, would also block NOAA from being dissolved, from having its work transferred to other federal agencies and from having its website or datasets degraded, according to a copy of the amendment reviewed by NBC News.",
      "Democratic Reps. Jared Moskowitz of Florida, Eric Sorensen of Illinois, Joe Neguse of Colorado and Wesley Bell of Missouri plan to introduce the amendment as soon as early Wednesday.",
      "The bill highlights congressional concern about National Weather Service staffing levels after the Trump administration fired probationary workers and offered early retirement to veteran employees. Short-staffed weather forecast offices dealt with a severe thunderstorm and tornado outbreak over the weekend, during which at\u00a0least 28 people died in the Midwest and the South.",
      "\u201cHurricane season is just days away, and extreme weather is only intensifying. It\u2019s not the time to put NOAA at risk,\u201d Moskowitz, the former director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said in an emailed statement.",
      "Sorensen, the only meteorologist in Congress, added:",
      "\u201cAs a meteorologist who has covered severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, I know how important it is that National Weather Service offices are fully staffed around the clock. This amendment Congressman Moskowitz and I introduced with our colleagues will help protect NOAA from any more reckless cuts by this Administration and keep our communities safe.\u201d",
      "The amendment does not have a likely path to success with Republicans in control of the House. The Trump administration\u2019s initial budget request would slash more than $1.5 billion from NOAA, a move that all living former directors of the National Weather Service warned could lead to unnecessary deaths.",
      "The National Weather Service has been scrambling to fill staffing holes this spring. Last week, NOAA opened a \u201cperiod of reassignment,\u201d asking for 76 meteorologists to transfer into critical roles left empty after cuts.",
      "At least eight of the country\u2019s 122 weather forecasting offices \u2014 including those in Sacramento, California; Goodland, Kansas; and Jackson, Kentucky \u2014 are no longer able to operate overnight, or they plan to cut overnight operations within the next month and a half, said Tom Fahy, legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization.\u00a0Fahy said that many forecast offices are dealing with significant staffing shortages and that 52 out of the country\u2019s 122 weather forecast offices have staffing vacancy rates above 20%.",
      "The National Weather Service declined to provide more information about staffing levels across its weather forecasting offices.",
      "\u201cThe National Weather Service continues to meet its core mission of providing life-saving forecasts, warnings, and decision support services to the public, our partners and stakeholders,\u201d Kim Doster, NOAA\u2019s communications director, said in an emailed statement. \u201cIn the near term, NWS has updated the service level standards for its weather forecast offices to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources. These revised standards reflect the transformation and prioritization of mission-essential operations, while supporting the balance of the operational workload for its workforce. NWS continues to ensure a continuity of service for mission-critical functions.\u201d",
      "The short-staffed Jackson, Kentucky, forecasting office was tested last weekend as dangerous storms roared across the state. Fahy said in an interview Monday that staffers worked overtime to respond to the \u201call hands on deck\u201d situation, which was predicted days in advance.",
      "\u201cWe had a long lead time with a supercell that we were able to monitor,\u201d Fahy said, adding that severe events could surprise in the future. \u201cA strong thunderstorm can produce a tornado or multiple tornadoes, and those are the events you haven\u2019t had an opportunity to anticipate.\u201d",
      "Outside meteorologists said forecasters in Jackson and at other offices performed well during a violent weekend, but they worried that the strain could catch up to a patchwork staff.",
      "\u201cThe tornado warnings have been really good in this outbreak,\u201d said Chris Vagasky, a meteorologist and research program manager for Wisconet, a network of weather stations across Wisconsin, but he added that it remains to be seen whether strain on the staff will manifest with time.",
      "\u201cHow do forecasters recover from that physically, mentally and emotionally, and is that going to impact warning performance?\u201d he said.",
      "Vagasky said warning times for the tornadoes forecast by the Jackson office were issued more than 15 minutes in advance, which is better than average.",
      "Victor Gensini, a professor of meteorology at Northern Illinois University, said that it is difficult to assess the effects of short staffing but that it is possible that researchers will identify a reduction in forecast quality over time because the weather service is releasing fewer weather balloons and has fewer meteorologists.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to judge a performance based on one significant event,\u201d Gensini said. \u201cWe should expect a degradation in performance with fewer and fewer people, but quantifying it will be hard.\u201d"

    "summary": "For some travelers, Newark Liberty International Airport has become a no-fly zone.",
    "story": [
      "For some travelers, Newark Liberty International Airport has become a no-fly zone.",
      "With passengers spooked by reports of harried air traffic controllers' losing radio and radar contact with planes and dismayed by the resulting massive flight delays, the average daily number of travelers flying out of Newark, New Jersey, has dropped by as much as 20% compared with this time last year, from around 72,983 during the second week of May 2024 to 58,496 last week, according to Transportation Security Administration data reviewed by NBC News.",
      "Meanwhile, New York's LaGuardia Airport experienced a 16% increase in the average daily number of travelers during the same period, from 36,367 in 2024 to 42,037 this year, the data shows.",
      "And New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport has had a slight increase in the average number of daily travelers, from 96,392 in 2024 to 97,061 this year in the second week of May, according to the data.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration predicts higher-than-usual volume of flights for the Memorial Day weekend, with a peak of about 54,000 flights Thursday.",
      "\"We\u2019re expecting flight numbers to grow week by week throughout the summer, with the peak at the end of July and six more 54,000+ flight days before the end of August,\" the FAA said in a statement. \"Thursdays will be the busiest day of the week.\"",
      "But at Newark, the FAA has proposed reducing the number of arrivals and departures after air traffic communication issues caused controllers to lose radio and radar contact with the planes they were guiding for 90 seconds on April 28.",
      "There is \u201ca structure of how many flights can leave per hour. We have a delayed flight schedule of takeoffs,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said, Reuters reported Tuesday. \u201cYou are going to see a reduction.\u201d",
      "That reduction came by way of an interim order that takes effect Tuesday: Until construction of Runway 4-Left/22-Right is complete, the maximum hourly rate will be 28 arrivals and 28 departures, the FAA said. Daily construction will end June 15 but will continue on Saturdays through the end of the year.",
      "Outside of the construction period, 34 hourly arrivals and departures will be allowed until Oct. 25.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to relieve the substantial inconvenience to the traveling public from excessive flight delays due to construction, staffing challenges, and recent equipment issues, which magnify as they spread through the National Airspace System,\u201d acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau said in a statement.",
      "The agency added that arrival and departure limits could be adjusted higher or lower, depending on conditions.",
      "United Airlines, which has a hub at Newark, would be the most affected, Duffy said. \"They're the biggest player at Newark,\" he said.",
      "United Airlines said in a statement that \"reducing the number of flights scheduled at Newark will help ensure that we can safely and reliably operate the flights that remain on the schedule.\"",
      "Earlier this month, it voluntarily cut 35 round-trip flights per day from Newark, where, in addition to a shortage of controllers, ongoing runway construction has contributed to flight delays.",
      "\"We are confident that the decisive steps taken by Sec. Duffy, including his leadership on matching the airport\u2019s capacity to its operational limitations, will have it back operating reliably for the benefit of our customers,\" United said.",
      "Since Duffy announced last week that the FAA and the major airlines were talking about reducing the number of flights in and out of Newark, the percentage of flight cancellations has dropped significantly.",
      "For most of last week, Newark\u2019s share of nationwide flight cancellations had been hovering between 35% and 60%, according to FlightAware data. But on Friday, the number of cancellations was at 15%, and it dropped to 9% on Saturday.",
      "While Duffy has said no planes were ever in any danger of colliding or crashing when the controllers' radio and radar went down on April 28, several of the controllers working that day went on trauma leave, further reducing the already depleted ranks of controllers available to work the crowded skies over New Jersey.",
      "There should be 38 certified controllers serving Newark, the FAA has said. Currently, there are only 22.",
      "Mishaps continue to plague the aging system. The controllers for Newark, who are actually based in Philadelphia, lost radio frequencies with the planes they guide for 2 seconds at around 11:35 a.m. Monday.",
      "No planes were in danger of colliding, and the FAA said it is investigating.",
      "Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said Tuesday in an interview that \"it's absolutely safe to fly.\"",
      "But when he was asked whether it is likely to be a summer of travel woes at Newark airport, Daniels said that \"I think the focus has to be on it getting better soon\" and that the shortage of air traffic controllers is a nationwide problem.",
      "\u201cRight now we operate a system with 10,800 hard-working American men and women,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cBut we should be having 14,663 staff that very system.\u201d",
      "Many of the controllers are working six-day weeks and 10-hour shifts, he said.",
      "\"Morale is low right now when you\u2019re dealing with the pressure and scrutiny that\u2019s going on in the aviation system right now, with low staffing in every one of your facilities,\" Daniels said.",
      "Last month, Duffy said he expected the FAA to meet its goal of graduating 2,000 new air traffic controllers this year but warned the chronic shortage of controllers would take years to fix.",
      "But he has also gotten bipartisan pushback from lawmakers who noted that the April snafu happened not long after the Trump administration fired hundreds\u00a0of FAA workers, including maintenance mechanics, aeronautical information staff members and environmental protection specialists, in its effort to shrink the federal government."

      "\u201cSocial media is immediate. You\u2019re writing, producing, and editing in real time, often by yourself. Making a show is the complete opposite,\u201d Kerrigan says. \u201cIt takes time, intention, and a village. But the overlap is in the storytelling. Whether I\u2019m crafting a 60-second reel or a seven-episode arc, I\u2019m always thinking about how to connect through honesty, humor and a strong point of view.\u201d",
      "Julie Christeas, founder & CEO of Tandem Pictures, which produced three of the four shows, describes this as the future of content.",
      "\u201cAs content consumption demographics and mediums are ever-changing, producers must adapt to a landscape that is asking the question, where is the next generation of great artists coming from?\u201d she says in a statement given to TODAY.com.",
      "Javier Pons, chief content officer and head of Telemundo Studios, said the collaboration between Telemundo and Katie Florence for \"The Council\" reflects \"a broader industry shift toward spotlighting authentic perspectives and developing content that resonates with new audiences.\"",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about all four shows.",
      "\u2018The Kouncil\u2019",
      "Created by: Katie Florence (@katieflorence), a creator known for videos where she acts out conversations between different parts of herself \u2014 her heart, her logic and so on \u2014 to process what\u2019s going on in her life.",
      "How Florence describes \u201cThe Kouncil\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s a dramedy that follows a girl going through a breakup. She deals with it by having discussions with her personified emotions that she calls her \u2018Kouncil.\u2019\u00a0It shows how easily one can be persuaded by their own anxiety or how they can be naive listening to their heart instead of their logic.\u201d",
      "Where the inspiration came from: \u201cThe inspiration came from a conversation I had with myself after being dumped abruptly out of nowhere. I wondered how I had missed all the red flags throughout our relationship and realized I wasn\u2019t thinking logically but rather emotionally. My heart saw what she wanted to see and ignored the glaring truth that this guy just wasn\u2019t that into me. I was hoping to get a better understanding of why I kept striking out when it came to my dating life and what pattern I was following.\u201d",
      "How making a show compares to making content for social media: \u201cContent on social media doesn\u2019t have to be taken as seriously. I can think of an idea, post a quick video and not think twice about it. When it comes to filming a show, one scene can be rewritten and discussed 30 different times before it actually becomes finalized. There\u2019s also a slight pressure when you put something on a big screen rather than a phone screen. It\u2019s suddenly looked at with a harsher eye. People tend to expect more from you. It\u2019s a bit scary.\u201d",
      "\u2018Older Hotter Wiser\u2019",
      "Created by: Serena Kerrigan, known for her series on dating and confidence-building. Her book, \u201cLet\u2019s F\u2014n Date,\u201d comes out in 2026.",
      "How Kerrigan describes \u2018Older Hotter Wiser\u2019: \u201cA road trip rom-com meets identity crisis with excellent lighting and even better breakdowns. It\u2019s funny, raw and just the right amount of unhinged. The story follows a woman who has built her entire persona around being confident, only to realize that confidence means nothing the moment she steps off the stage. It\u2019s chaotic, emotional and painfully real, even though it\u2019s completely scripted.\u201d",
      "What her followers can expect: \u201cMy followers know SFK, the Queen of Confidence. She\u2019s loud, direct, and doesn\u2019t apologize for who she is. That version of me definitely shows up in \u2018Older Hotter Wiser,\u2019 but you also see the vulnerability behind her. The fear. The confusion. The need to figure out who she is when no one\u2019s watching. The show blurs the line between character and creator, and that\u2019s intentional. It\u2019s not just about watching someone be confident. It\u2019s about watching her earn it.\u201d",
      "What the show taught her: \u201cThat I can do really hard things. There were moments I genuinely wasn\u2019t sure I could pull it off, but I kept going. This show stretched me in every possible way. It was a completely different muscle from making 60-second videos. It was more intense, more collaborative, and honestly, more fulfilling. Even though it took nearly three years in development and pushed me to my limits, the payoff was so much greater. To finally see something I dreamed up come to life with a team of people bringing their full talent and heart to it \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of work I\u2019ve always wanted to do. And now I know I can. This is just the beginning.\u201d",
      "\u2018People Like Me\u2019",
      "Created by: Daren Vongirdner (@darendarendaren), known for innovatively edited and moving videos about life.",
      "How Vongirdner describes \u2018People Like Me\u2019: \u201c\u2019People Like Me\u2019 is a show about going through life and the everyday emotions we all face.\u201d",
      "Where the inspiration came from:\u201cThe inspiration came from the universe. From art. From life. Stories are happening everywhere \u2014 you just gotta look.\u201d",
      "How making a show compares to making content for social media: \u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s just storytelling. The only difference, for me and my team, is the scale of the production. We normally spend the same amount of time producing the content, we are just used to it being released in a shorter and more frequent amount of time.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s next him: \u201cI have some good ideas for Hollywood. I think us creators have so much to learn from the traditional ways but at the same time, we have a lot to offer too.\u201d",
      "\u2018The Warehouse Phase\u2019",
      "Created by: Charlie Curtis Beard (@charliecurtisb), a musician and rapper who shares original songs on social media.",
      "How Beard describes 'Warehouse Phase'?\u00a0\u201cTWP is a show where we peel back the curtain on what it means to be an artist and content creator.\u201d",
      "Where the inspiration came from: \u201cI got the inspiration from my friend who worked in a warehouse to make ends meet. What he really wanted to do was make films. When we were talking he said he was in his \u2018warehouse phase.\u2019 I took that to mean the phase of life where you have to struggle to make ends meet before doing what you really want to do.\u201d",
      "How does the show compares to his social content: \u201cI\u2019m a rapper in the show! So my fans will love to hear that I not only made all the music in the show, but put the full songs on all streaming platforms.\u201d",
      "What he's learned from the experience:\u00a0\u201cWork with your friends! I actually came back from the experience wanting to work with people more even on my solo content.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Because their parents perform in the Broadway production of \"Wicked,\" these two munchkins receive magical privileges.",
      "Jordan Litz, who plays Fiyero, tells TODAY.com that Greta, his 20-month-old daughter, \"learned to walk in the lobby of the Gershwin (Theatre).\" Meanwhile, Greta's similarly aged buddy, Parker Peery, daughter of Glinda standby Jennafer Newberry, gets to play peekaboo with her mother's iconic \"bubble dress.\"",
      "\"Greta and Parker are like 'Wicked' besties,\" says Newberry. \"So it\u2019s really, really special to have all these memories and getting to watch them hang out together backstage.\"",
      "Though in the past, parenting and performing didn't mix, Broadway seems to have grown more tolerant of highlighting visibly pregnant performers, like Broadway legend Audra McDonald in \"Shuffle Along,\" or actors who request modified schedules to see more of their kids, as Tony nominee\u00a0Amber Gray did while in \"Hadestown.\"",
      "\"I think our industry in general is finally catching up to the fact that children and working parents are not a hindrance. It's actually something that adds so much to the experience,\" says Newberry, who suspects that the audience enjoys the relatability factor of knowing that actors have kids waiting for them at home.",
      "Though the optics couldn't be cuter, the daily grind of an 8-show week is especially tough for parents of young children. Together with their supportive partners and coworkers, Newberry and Litz find ways to make it work, but the theater life is not without sacrifice.",
      "The two performers shared that one of the hardest parts is missing bedtime.",
      "Newberry, who first performed the role of Glinda on Broadway while three months postpartum, lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, fairly close to the theater. Even so, she is only able to put her daughter to bed twice a week.",
      "\"My husband (Zach Peery) is so generous, and he FaceTimes me into bathtime almost every night, which is really, really sweet,\" she shares. Because Newberry breastfed Parker for a year, Peery would often bring the baby to the theater on two-show days so Newberry could feed and play with her.",
      "\"I\u2019m not foolish enough to think I\u2019ve done it alone,\" she says. \"It took a very supportive husband and very supportive community around me.\"",
      "Part of that community is Litz, who has known Newberry since they performed in Disney's \"Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Review\" in 2016. When visiting New York City that summer, Newberry took Litz to his first Broadway show, which just so happened to be \"Wicked.\" Newberry had a friend in the cast, so they got a backstage tour after the show, never knowing that they would one day be performing together in the very same show.",
      "Litz started playing Fiyero on the \"Wicked\" tour in early 2020, and he moved to the Broadway cast in May 2023. After his wife Julie gave birth to daughter Greta, he says, \"everything is different\" in terms of his performances. Much of the change is positive, but some is challenging, including the lack of consistency in his vocal and physical performance.",
      "\"When I was on the road with 'Wicked,' I called out once in a year and a half, and since Greta has been born, I\u2019ve called out ... I don\u2019t even know how many times,\" he says. \"And it\u2019s not necessarily because of Greta. It\u2019s just the extra stresses of life, having to not only do the show at night, but also be present as a dad and wanting to be involved by day.\"",
      "He and his family moved to a New Jersey suburb, so it's not as easy for his wife and Greta to stop by the theater, but they are involved in the Broadway community in other ways. For example, he chats with TODAY.com after taking the whole family to Central Park to see the \"Wicked\" softball team play \"Aladdin\" in the Broadway Show League.",
      "Like Newberry, Litz hates missing out on bedtime, but when he is home, he tries to make it extra special by singing \"Remember Me\" from Disney's \"Coco.\"",
      "From the \"Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Review\" to having daughters just four months apart while performing on Broadway, Litz and Newberry have a unique history. After all, it's not everyone who can say that an iconic Broadway theater is their child's playground.",
      "\"At some point, we\u2019ll be able to show Greta these pictures and videos of this unbelievable historic theater that she walked around in as a child, taking her first steps,\" says Litz.",
      "\"The best part has been just recognizing that my two dreams aren\u2019t mutually exclusive,\" Newberry adds. \"There is a world in which you can live your professional dream and and your personal family dream and neither one has to suffer. You can do both with excellence.\""

      "Billionaire Barry Diller called the chatter over his sexuality \"over the top\" after an excerpt of his new memoir led to headlines and commotion on social media.",
      "Diller spoke about his new memoir, \"Who Knew,\" in a CNBC interview that aired on TODAY on May 20, two weeks after an excerpt of the book was published in which he wrote he had always been attracted to men until he met his future wife, fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg.",
      "\"All this closet stuff, I mean, if I have been in a closet, it has been the most brightly lit closet with a glass door that you have ever seen,\" Diller said on TODAY.",
      "\"I understand, kind of, the catnip of media \u2014 but all this stuff about my sexuality at my frigging age just seems to me, well, it\u2019s kind of obvious and over the top.\"",
      "Diller's memoir was published on May 20, and the businessman shared the three words his wife told him ahead of the release of his life story.",
      "\"She said to me six months ago, or a year ago, when I knew I was going to publish: 'Just get ready,'\" Diller recalled von Furstenberg telling him.",
      "\"I said, 'Get ready, what are you talking about?'\" he said, before she replied, \"You just get ready.\"",
      "Diller also spoke of a set of rules he established for his life when he was around 20 or 21 years old.",
      "\"I just said I didn\u2019t want to live a hypocritical life,\" he said. \"It was in a way, rules of conduct that I just adopted for myself ... and I said, 'Well, there are things I will do and I won\u2019t do. And those are my rules.' And it was adopted because I didn\u2019t want to be a hypocrite. And yet I didn\u2019t want to tell anybody anything. So I said, I have to have rules for that. And I made them up.\"",
      "Diller said he was living in fear when he was creating those rules. But looking back, the billionaire said it was that same fear that led to his success.",
      "\"If you have one great fear ... you don\u2019t have room for many others,\" Diller said. \"And I think that \u2014 in a weird way, as painful as the early development was, I think that\u2019s actually a great gift. Odd, crazy-ish gift that I was given, that it allowed me to be fearless in so many other areas.\"",
      "Diller said that the process of writing his memoir helped him learn that he's always had trouble living in the moment.",
      "\"Actually, it\u2019s living in the old moments, since I didn\u2019t really live in those moments at the time, was kind of fun for me,\" he said. \"I learned things in the process of doing it that I had never known.\"",
      "\"For a lot of reasons, I worried that if I lived too much in the moment, it would take things away from me,\" he added. \"I thought if I lived in the moment, it would make me cynical. One of the things I have always tried to hold onto is a certain kind of naivete.\"",
      "In an excerpt of Diller's memoir published by New York Magazine on May 6, he wrote about how he met von Furstenberg for the first time, and that she was dismissive of him.",
      "But when they met again at a dinner party, Diller said, \u201cI was instantly bathed in such attention and cozy warmth I couldn\u2019t believe it was the same woman I\u2019d been dismissed by a year earlier.\u201d",
      "They later had dinner at her apartment, and \u201cafterward, on the same sofa as the night before, we wound around each other, making out like teenagers, something I hadn\u2019t done with a female since I was 16 years old,\u201d Diller wrote.",
      "\u201cNow, this has always amazed me: There was no effort, no reasoning, no what\u2019s-going-on-here, no ambition, no anything. Other than sheer excitement, I thought, Well, this is a surprise! I certainly didn\u2019t feel, Oh my God, what does this mean? I was simply existing in the moment, a rare place for me,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The pair dated for a few years until they separated in 1981 after von Furstenberg had an affair with actor Richard Gere, Diller wrote in the excerpt. The couple would eventually get back together, and they married in 2001.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve lived for decades reading about Diane and me: about us being best friends rather than lovers,\u201d Diller wrote. \u201cWe weren\u2019t just friends. We aren\u2019t just friends. Plain and simple, it was an explosion of passion that kept up for years. And, yes, I also liked guys, but that was not a conflict with my love for Diane.\u201d",
      "He wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve always thought that you never really know about anyone else\u2019s relationships. But I do know about ours. It is the bedrock of my life. What others think sometimes irritates but mostly amuses us. We know, our family knows, and our friends know. The rest is blather.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Right-wing tech moguls who are part of President Donald Trump\u2019s White House are casting doubt on the state of democracy in Romania, putting them at odds with the chief U.S. diplomat in the country.",
      "In much of Europe, the response to Sunday\u2019s Romanian presidential election was a sigh of relief. The winner, Nicu\u0219or\u00a0Dan, is a centrist who supports Ukraine, and his victory shut the door on what Romanian authorities say was an attempted coup supported by Russia.",
      "But to a handful of right-wing tech moguls, Dan\u2019s defeat of George Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, was something else entirely. Two of them, Elon Musk and David Sacks, both of whom are advisers to Trump, expressed dissatisfaction with the state of Romania\u2019s democracy.",
      "Sacks, a wealthy investor, denounced the result Monday in a post on X as \u201cstatistically unlikely, if not impossible.\u201d The statement amounted to an accusation of fraud, although Sacks provided no evidence, and he criticized Romanian authorities for disqualifying a leading pro-Russia candidate, C\u0103lin\u00a0Georgescu. Simion, the losing candidate, had already conceded defeat when Sacks posted.",
      "Sacks, who was named \u201cczar\u201d for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency by Trump in December, made the comments on his personal account on X, where he has 1.3 million followers, not on his government account.",
      "Musk weighed in separately. On X, he amplified an accusation by the head of the messaging app Telegram, Pavel Durov, who said the French government had asked him to ban conservative voices in Romania from Telegram ahead of the election. Durov, who has dual French and United Arab Emirates citizenship, said he refused. France\u2019s foreign ministry denied ever making such a request.",
      "Durov, who was born in Russia, is embroiled in a legal battle in France. Last year, French prosecutors charged him with enabling various forms of criminality on Telegram. Durov returned home to Dubai in March, but said he met with French authorities this spring in Paris.",
      "\u201cWow,\u201d Musk wrote, sharing Durov\u2019s allegation with his own 219 million followers. Responding to another Durov post that said Romanian democracy was at risk, Musk wrote, \u201cHear, hear!\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the statements by Musk and Sacks, two of the most prominent tech figures in the Trump administration. Neither Musk nor Sacks responded to emailed requests for comment.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Romania posted Sunday that it had sent several teams to observe voting. On Tuesday, the interim U.S. head of mission Romania, Michael L. Dickerson, posted a congratulatory note to Romania\u2019s president-elect on X.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to working with you as Romania\u2019s new president and the government to advance our shared priorities, including defense, energy, and commercial partnerships,\u201d Dickerson wrote, tagging Dan.",
      "Dickerson was named to the interim diplomatic post earlier Tuesday, when the embassy announced the retirement of U.S. Ambassador to Romania Kathleen Kavalec on Facebook. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "It\u2019s unusual in recent history for White House advisers to comment individually on foreign policy subjects unless their job is specific to national security, but Musk in particular has veered far from past practice. He has pushed right-wing political movements, policies and administrations in at least 18 countries, especially in Europe, according to an NBC News tally.",
      "The social media posts by Musk and Sacks show how Romanian politics has risen in importance in the minds of some wealthy tech figures in recent years, especially as a proxy for attitudes about Russia.",
      "Romania borders Ukraine and has provided aid to its neighbor as it defends itself. Political candidates in the country hold a wide range of views about Russia, although pro-Ukraine candidate Dan prevailed on Sunday.",
      "Musk and Sacks have both expressed support for Russia\u2019s position in its war against Ukraine. In 2022, Musk suggested that Ukraine cede territory to Russia, and this year he called Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., a \u201ctraitor\u201d for expressing support for Ukraine. Sacks has repeatedly criticized the U.S. decision to back Ukraine and has said Russia is \u201cnot our enemy.\u201d",
      "The two are also longtime friends and business associates, dating to their time as early executives at PayPal two decades ago.",
      "Elections have recently been a charged issue in Romania.",
      "Georgescu won the first round of Romania\u2019s presidential election in 2024, but the country\u2019s top court annulled the result in December, two days before the final runoff vote, amid accusations that Moscow had interfered via a TikTok disinformation campaign.\u00a0Georgescu, who is under criminal investigation in connection with alleged Russian meddling, was barred from the new ballot in March. The same month, Romanian authorities announced the arrest of six people who they said were plotting a coup against the government in collusion with Russia.",
      "Sacks, on X, turned the coup allegation around: He shared a post by another X user Monday who accused the European Union of mounting a \u201cquiet coup\u201d with the disqualification of Georgescu. However, Georgescu was disqualified by a Romanian election authority based on Romanian law, unrelated to E.U. membership, according to a Reuters fact-check. The E.U.\u2019s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, has singled out Russia for allegations of interfering in Romania\u2019s election.",
      "Moscow has denied interfering, but on Monday the Kremlin criticized Romania\u2019s election as \u201cstrange,\u201d according to Reuters.",
      "Both Sacks and Musk had earlier expressed support for Georgescu, the pro-Russia candidate, remaining on the ballot. Musk called the decision to bar him \u201ccrazy,\u201d while Sacks said it represented the death of democracy. Vice President JD Vance has expressed similar views, saying that the evidence against Georgescu was \u201cflimsy,\u201d although he has not commented on the results of the election."

      "Edan Alexander, who was believed to be\u00a0the last living U.S. citizen\u00a0held captive in Gaza, was freed on May 12 after having been captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",

His son called the first year in captivity \u201ccomplete hell,\u201d he said, because he was frequently moved around to various locations above ground, underground and in tents, at one point during the war living in a tent that, his father recounted, Edan said he couldn\u2019t leave for weeks.",

      "Edan endured hunger, eating only hummus, pita bread, rice and whatever his captors served him from cans, his father said, a reflection of the food scarcity in Gaza since the start of the war. Fears of famine have heightened there in recent weeks as Israel has carried out a nearly three-month blockade on the enclave \u2014\u00a0the longest of its kind since the start of the conflict.",
      "Israel said Sunday it would begin allowing limited resources to flow into the Gaza Strip to avoid a \u201chunger crisis.\u201d Worries of such a crisis aren\u2019t new, with aid groups warning about such conditions for months as a result of Israel\u2019s military operation.",
      "Food began to flow more regularly during the fragile January ceasefire brokered during the Biden administration, offering the hostages an opportunity to eat meat, Adi Alexander said. Edan told his parents conditions improved during what Adi called the \u201csecond phase\u201d of his son's captivity \u2014 after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "By then, he said, Edan, who had lost about a quarter of his body mass, stayed in one \u201csecure and safe\u201d location for the rest of his time in Gaza and was able to regain some weight.",
      "Adi lauded his son\u2019s \u201cwisdom to get along with the captors and survive,\u201d even when death from bombardments by the Israeli army \u2014 which he said Edan described as \u201clike an earthquake\u201d \u2014 seemed possible. At one point, Edan also survived a tunnel collapse, his father said.",
      "\u201cWe consider ourselves lucky that he survived that day,\u201d Adi said of the collapse. \u201cHe has some injury from that event, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something major now.\u201d",
      "Adi said he and his family were devastated when the ceasefire collapsed and \u201cthe war re-started.\u201d",
      "On May 5, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced an intensive military operation aiming to take the whole of the Gaza Strip in an effort to eliminate Hamas, a move approved by the country\u2019s security Cabinet.",
      "But the plan hasn\u2019t been without pushback. A number of military reservists have rejected the call to serve in the operation, saying it is part of a war that has become politically motivated. At a Knesset committee\u00a0meeting this month, the father of one of the remaining hostages called on soldiers \u201cnot to report for reserve duty for moral and ethical reasons.\u201d",
      "More than 1,200 people were killed in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, and around 250 hostages were taken, according to Israeli tallies. Fifty-eight hostages are believed to remain in captivity.",
      "More than 53,000 people \u2014 many of them women and children \u2014 have been killed in Gaza in the resulting war, according to health officials in the enclave, which Hamas has run since 2007.",
      "Talks to end the war have stalled, even as many Israelis urge their leaders to bring the rest of the hostages home. Adi Alexander expressed reservations about the \u201cmixed messaging.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy hope is that it\u2019s just a political posture,\u201d he said of Netanyahu's plan for an expanded military operation. \u201cMy expectation is going back to the bargaining table, rising above politics and prioritizing human life.\u201d",
      "The Alexander family knows all too well the suffering of the hostages.",
      "Yael Alexander recalled how her son said he held on to hope in captivity, thanks in part to seeing glimpses of his family on the news.",
      "\u201cHe saw us,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knew we were fighting for him.\u201d",
      "Their fight culminated on Mother\u2019s Day with a call from Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s\u00a0special envoy to the Middle East, who told the Alexanders that Hamas would be announcing the release of their son momentarily.",
      "Yael said she immediately packed her things and got the next flight to Israel. Adi and their other children followed on a later flight.",
      "\u201cIt was perfectly timed, and everyone was together just one time,\u201d Yael said of Edan\u2019s release. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d",
      "Despite being a bit thinner, paler and weaker, Yael said, her son is the same as before he was captured, and in their first conversation since his kidnapping, he joked that he needs a tan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same laughter, the same smile, the same kind eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is our boy.\u201d"

      "Israeli bombardment had killed more than 300 people in the 72 hours to early Monday, the Health Authority in Gaza said. Children were among the dead after a wave of airstrikes in the southern city of Khan Younis that came even after Netanyahu said his forces would allow in limited amounts of food to avoid the risk of famine.",
      "In a statement Monday, Gaza's Hamas-run government urged the international community to pressure Israel to allow the entry of at least 500 aid trucks and 50 fuel trucks daily, adding that \u201csigns of famine and humanitarian collapse are worsening at a terrifying rate.\u201d",
      "That came after the Israeli government announced plans Sunday that, if actioned, would end its 11-week aid blockade of Gaza and allow in \u201cbasic\u201d quantities of food. Netanyahu doubled down Monday on his decision, responding on Telegram to critics from Israel\u2019s political right wing.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of criticism from the right this morning regarding the humanitarian issue \u2014 and that\u2019s understandable. But it\u2019s important to know the facts,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe must avoid a situation of famine, both in substance and in perception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf there is famine,\u201d he added, \u201cwe will lose international support and won\u2019t be able to achieve victory.\u201d",
      "That decision came even as Israel moved ahead with plans for a new ground offensive, dubbed \u201cChariots of Gideon,\u201d after its security Cabinet earlier this month unanimously approved plans to\u00a0seize all of the Gaza Strip.",
      "It was in his statement Monday that Netanyahu said that \u201cthere is intensive and large-scale military activity in Gaza\u201d and that the Israeli military was \u201cmoving toward full control of the entire Strip.\u201d",
      "Israel says the operation is aimed at defeating Hamas and ensuring the return of the remaining hostages of the 250 taken captive during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks\u00a0in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, during which around 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli counts.",
      "The ensuing war in Gaza has killed more than 53,000 people in the enclave, Palestinian health officials say. That death toll is still rising.",

      "The Israel Defense Forces said Monday that it had struck 160 of what it called \u201cterror targets\u201d in the past 24 hours.",
      "The attacks come as international aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks of the risk of famine\u00a0in Gaza after the Israeli government maintained a complete aid blockade since March 2.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a race against time to avoid famine,\u201d the United Nations' World Food Programme said in an X post Sunday, in which it urged the international community to \u201cact urgently to get aid flowing again.\u201d",
      "Those warnings have sparked alarm among even Israel\u2019s closest allies, with President Donald Trump telling reporters Friday that \u201ca lot of people are starving\u201d in Gaza.",

      "\u201cCan Taiwan continue to view the U.S. as an ally?\u201d said Chan Yu-hsiang, 25, a graduate student at National Taiwan University.",
      "Chan\u2019s question reflects growing concern in Taiwan over the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner under President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the Beijing-claimed island in the face of Chinese military threats but also made critical remarks and upended trade relations.",
      "In a Taiwan government poll released in March, the percentage of respondents who said the U.S. military would \u201cdefinitely\u201d intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion dropped to 14% from 19% a year earlier. Almost half of respondents said the U.S. military was unlikely to intervene, the same as a poll by the Brookings Institution conducted the same month.",
      "According to the same Taiwan government poll, 36% of respondents said U.S.-Taiwan relations would get worse under Trump, a 12% increase since January.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s rising wariness toward the U.S. comes amid growing pressure from China, which claims the self-governing democracy as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force in achieving its unification goal. Beijing sends warplanes and ships toward the island on near-daily sorties.",
      "Last month, the Chinese military conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan in what it said was a warning to \u201cseparatist\u201d forces. The Taiwan government has warned that Beijing could hold more drills in the coming days as the island marks one year under President Lai Ching-te, whom China describes as a \u201cseparatist\u201d and \u201ctroublemaker.\u201d",
      "China has rebuffed multiple offers of talks from Lai, who says only Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people can decide its future. Beijing insists the island\u2019s future is \u201cby no means an \u2018internal affair of Taiwan,\u2019\u201d warning that Taiwanese authorities would \u201csuffer an apocalypse\u201d if they sought formal independence.",
      "Strategic ambiguity",
      "The U.S. has no formal relations with Taiwan but is its most important international backer, bound by law to provide it with defensive weapons. On Monday, Taiwan test-fired for the first time a new rocket system provided by the U.S. that Ukraine has also used against Russia.",
      "Washington has long maintained a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d when it comes to whether the U.S. military would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, not giving a definitive answer either way.",
      "Trump has not given any indication of a change in that policy. But he has unnerved Taiwan with comments accusing it of stealing semiconductor business from the U.S. and calling for Taiwan to pay more for its own defense, which it has pledged to do.",
      "Last month, he also slapped Taiwan with a 32% tariff on its goods, with an exemption for the chip industry, which makes up a big part of the Taiwan economy and which the U.S. relies on heavily.",
      "Taiwan has said it will not retaliate against the U.S. and that it is ready for trade talks \u201cat any time,\u201d offering a package of zero tariffs on American goods and increased U.S. investment.",
      "The duties came as a surprise to Taiwan after state-backed chipmaker TSMC announced a plan in March to invest an additional $100 million in the U.S., where it is already building multiple factories.",
      "For Chan, this suggested that even Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield\u201d \u2014 the semiconductor industry that makes the island so indispensable to the global economy \u2014 is not enough to guarantee U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIf you keep giving away Taiwan\u2019s last line of defense, the U.S. will take advantage of it, but they won\u2019t necessarily treat you well,\u201d he said.",

      "A survey last year by National Chengchi University in Taipei showed that over 88% of people in Taiwan support maintaining the status quo, in which Taiwan operates as a de facto independent country without formally declaring independence, a move that would risk all-out war with China.",
      "That\u2019s especially true for Taiwan\u2019s youngest voters, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and assistant professor at National Taiwan University who has studied their views.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Gen Zers \u201care by no means pro-China relative to other generations, but they don\u2019t have the same attitude towards Taiwan independence\u201d as millennials do, he said.",
      "\u201cInstead, we see younger generations having a much more sort of pro-status-quo approach to politics,\u201d Nachman said.",
      "Young people in Taiwan were too young to be radicalized in political upheavals such as the island\u2019s Sunflower Movement in 2014 and the martial law era, he said.",
      "They don\u2019t want to \u201crock any major boat\u201d with any \u201cradical change\u201d in the Taiwan Strait, Nachman added, though the desire for unification with mainland China is still \u201cincredibly low.\u201d",
      "The Taiwan government poll found that over a third of respondents ages 18 to 29 viewed China as the island\u2019s \u201cprimary threat\u201d despite efforts by Beijing to win them over with preferential policies for studying and working in the mainland, as well as various activities including sponsored trips, internships and cultural events.",
      "Last year, over 4 million people from Taiwan visited mainland China for tourism, study or work, a year-over-year increase of 54.3%, according to official data released by Chinese authorities. According to China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, young people were the \u201cmost active\u201d group.",
      "\u201cYou are also Chinese. You are our family,\u201d Chan said he and other students from Taiwan were told by a tour guide last year on a Beijing-sponsored trip to the Chinese province of Henan.",
      "While some accuse Beijing of using such efforts to strengthen its sovereignty claims, these measures are \u201cquite good\u201d and enable young people in Taiwan to visit and explore different places, said Chen Pin-yin, a student at the National Taiwan University of Arts.",
      "Chen, 21, who is also pro status quo, said not everything is about politics. Young people in Taiwan are mainly concerned about practical issues such as the cost of living and their job prospects, she said.",
      "Chen did a one-month internship last summer for a variety show in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that was partly funded by Chinese organizers.",

      "The most important thing \u201cis to avoid wars for now,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI hope the U.S. can play the role of a mediator when tensions are high.\u201d"

This year, Azerbaijan didn\u2019t make it to the final. Azerbaijan yet again did not give any jury points to Armenia.",
      "The most geopolitically divisive entrant was Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, whose song \u201cNew Day Will Rise\u201d is about finding hope after tragedy.

    "story": [
      "A day after 59 white South Africans were welcomed to America as refugees, more than 86,000 South African farmers \u2014 who are mostly white \u2014 are gathering this week at the NAMPO Harvest Day trade fair, an annual agricultural exhibition considered the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "Over four days, the attendees will discuss innovations in technology, collaborations and various other elements of an industry that last year generated nearly $14 billion in revenue.",
      "Notably, according to one participant, there is no planned discussion of violence against white farmers or \u201cAfrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored, race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation\u201d without compensation, as President Donald Trump wrote in a Feb. 7 executive order that opened the way for the 59 South Africans to come to U.S., despite a ban on refugees from other nations.",
      "The executive order referenced South Africa\u2019s Expropriation Act enacted last year, which in some cases allows the government to seize unused land without compensation, something Cyril Ramaphosa, the country\u2019s president, said has not happened.",
      "The act awakened a profoundly troubling argument over land rights. South Africa's dark history of racism includes the confiscation of land from Black residents, both before and during the apartheid. Afrikaners, the minority white descendants of Dutch and French settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 1600s, were leaders of the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.",
      "The purported goal of the Expropriation Act is to shrink the vast land ownership disparity that came with the oppressive rule. According to the organization Action for Southern Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by whites, who make up 7.3% of the population. Black Africans, representing 81.4%, own only 4% of the land.",
      "Trump asserted on Monday, ahead of the refugees\u2019 arrival in the U.S., that \u201cwhite farmers are being brutally killed and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.\u201d",
      "Yet Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, said that the spirit of NAMPO this week reaffirms that \u201cgenocide\u201d of white South African farmers \u201cwas imaginary and not happening in our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all disturbed that the U.S. side is alleging that there\u2019s genocide and mistreatment of white farmers in South Africa. It is incorrect,\u201d said Sihlobo, who is also co-author of the book \u201cThe Uncomfortable Truth About South Africa\u2019s Agriculture.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anything, the sector continues to flourish. [Trump's] comments are misinformed and not mirroring the reality on the ground in the country,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "The New York Times reported 225 people were killed on South African farms over a four-year period ending in 2024. Of those deaths, 101 were Black current or former workers living on farms, and 53 were farmers, who are usually white.",
      "Nico Harris, a farmer of Afrikaans heritage, told Daily Maverick South African newspaper that the problems he sees can be overcome and stem from the government not being \u201cpro-farmer.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the refugees that have gone [to the U.S.] are not well-established family farming businesses like we are,\u201d Harris told the paper. \u201cI think they don\u2019t have an opportunity in the country and they might think that, \u2018This is an opportunity for us.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really fleeing because they are scared or worried, I think they see it as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Harris added, \u201cI think there are racially discriminating laws against white farmers, and I think they have problems and haven\u2019t got sympathy from the government. But there are no real land grabs, and I don\u2019t think there are real threats. There are individual farm attacks, but it\u2019s more related to criminal activity. We just hope our government is going to wake up and realize that they need the farmers, Black and white.\u201d",
      "One of the South Africans who arrived in the U.S. on Monday told The Washington Post that she had been advised not to speak with the media and said it had been a \u201cvery emotional, very rough couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "Theo Boshoff, CEO of AgBiz, which represents companies across the agricultural value chain, including South African and multinational companies, said crime in rural farming areas is high but \u201cnot targeted against any racial or ethnic group.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no genocide in South Africa,\u201d Boshoff added. \u201cPeople who live in rural areas, who are often farmers, are simply more vulnerable to crime and violent crime because they live in remote areas.\u201d",
      "And because they are remote, law enforcement often is not nearby to protect them. \u201cThere is no cultural or racial bias at play. White farmers, Black farmers, white farmworkers, Black farmworkers are\u00a0all equally at risk and united in combatting this challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t agree with insinuations that rural crime is motivated by politics or in any way related to South Africa\u2019s affirmative action efforts to remedy our checkered past.\u201d",
      "Solidarity, a South African trade union that represents 600,000 Afrikaner families, said in a statement in February that it does not agree with the African National Congress, which wants to close the farmland disparity gap. \u201cBut we love our country. As in any community, there are individuals who wish to immigrate, but repatriation of Afrikaners as refugees is not a solution for us,\u201c the group wrote.",
      "President Ramaphosa said on X that the country\u2019s laws \u201cbalance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\u201d He said that a meeting with President Trump about the country\u2019s land reform policy would result in them sharing \u201ca better and common understanding over these matters.\u201d",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, has talked of his home country having \u201cracist ownership laws\u201d in a genocidal effort against white farmers.",
      "Fadial Adams, a member of the National Assembly of South Africa, a political body that passes legislation and analyzes executive action, warned of Musk\u2019s influence on the president. \u201cLet us not forget that Elon Musk is a beneficiary of our suffering and our slavery in South Africa, and it is not something that he hides. He was raised on a system which benefited white South Africans exclusively,\u201d\u00a0Adams said. \u201cElon Musk should stop acting like the minister for foreign affairs for South Africa. He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration and Musk representative did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Afriforum, a nongovernmental South African agency that supports the interests of white citizens, have called for farm murders to be classified as priority crimes requiring special attention, like gender-based violence or rhino-poaching. It does not support the Expropriation Act.",
      "\u201cMany laws identified by the Afrikaner lobby groups as racist are viewed by the African National Congress as being necessary, intentional measures to redress past wrongs,\u201d said Thula Simpson, an associate professor of history at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. \u201cSo the present developments strike at the heart of the post-apartheid consensus.\u201d",
      "As for the farmers in South Africa as a whole, Sihlobo, the economist from the Agricultural Business Chamber, pointed at how the country's earnings from exporting produce have grown from $2 billion in the year 2000 to nearly $14 billion in 2024.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re self-sufficient,\u201d Sihlobo said. \u201cThat speaks to the progress the sector has been making. You can\u2019t see numbers like that where there\u2019s a genocide.\u201d",
      "Jaco Minnaar, the chairman of AGRI SA, the largest agriculture organization in South Africa, says the larger problem is South Africa\u2019s crime rate.",

That\u2019s something that we need to address,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t specifically see from the statistics that white people or any other demographic group are targeted.

      "In the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, 38 Hondurans, including 19 children, disembarked from the charter flight carrying $1,000 debit cards from the U.S. government and the offer to one day be allowed to apply for legal entry into the U.S.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to increase deportations substantially. Experts believe the self-deportation offer will only appeal to a small portion of migrants already considering return, but unlikely to spur high demand. The offer has been paired with highly-publicized migrant detentions in the U.S. and flying a couple hundred Venezuelan migrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.",
      "Kevin Antonio Posadas, from Tegucigalpa, had lived in Houston for three years, but had already been considering a return to Honduras when the Trump administration announced its offer.",
      "\u201cI wanted to see my family and my mom,\u201d said Posadas, who added that the process was easy.",
      "\u201cYou just apply (through the CBP Home app ) and in three days you\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said. The flight left Houston early Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s good because you save the cost of the flight if you have the intention of leaving.\u201d",
      "Posadas said he hadn\u2019t feared deportation and liked living in the U.S., but had been thinking for some time about going home. He said eventually he would consider taking up the U.S. government\u2019s offer of allowing those who self-deport to apply to enter the United States legally.",
      "In a statement about the flight Monday, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, \u201cIf you are here illegally, use the CBP Home App to take control of your departure and receive financial support to return home. If you don\u2019t, you will be subjected to fines, arrest, deportation and will never be allowed to return.\u201d",
      "Twenty-six more migrants aboard the flight were headed home to Colombia, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security statement.",
      "Honduras Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio Garc\u00eda said the Honduran government would also support the returning migrants with $100 cash and another $200 credit at a government-run store that sells basic necessities.",
      "Among the migrants arriving voluntarily Monday were four children who were born in the United States, Garc\u00eda said.",
      "Garc\u00eda, who met the arriving migrants at the airport, said they told him that being in the U.S. without documents required for legal immigration or residence had been increasingly difficult, that things were growing more hostile and they feared going to work.",
      "Still, the number of Hondurans deported from the U.S. so far this year is below last year\u2019s pace, said Honduras immigration director Wilson Paz.",

      "The phone call between President Donald Trump and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin may not have achieved great strides on ending the war in Ukraine, but it did confirm one thing: The bromance is real. But a question is left hanging: What does this bonhomie actually deliver for the men in the Kremlin and White House?",
      "\u201cThe tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent,\u201d Trump said of his Russian counterpart after their two-hour conversation Monday, adding that Putin is a \u201cnice gentleman.\u201d Putin adviser Yuri Ushakov, meanwhile, said Trump and Putin called each other by their first names and \u201cneither of them wanted to end the conversation.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Putin commissioned a portrait of his American counterpart and delivered it to him. One of Trump\u2019s envoys, Steve Witkoff, told Tucker Carlson in March that the president was \u201cclearly touched\u201d by what he called a \u201cbeautiful\u201d portrait.",
      "Trump is not just seeking an end to the war in Ukraine, which Russia started by launching its large-scale 2022 invasion; in addition, he has made no secret of his desire to do lucrative deals with a Kremlin reintroduced to the international financial fold.",
      "In April he wrote on Truth Social that he was \u201chopeful Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week,\u201d adding that \u201cboth will then start to do big business with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "Before that happens, Trump and his team have suggested they want the war to end, something the president has made a clear political goal, having promised during his presidential campaign that it would take just 24 hours to secure, although he later told Time magazine that this was an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d",
      "His call with Putin appears to have brought that no closer to fruition, with a chasm still aching between Ukraine\u2019s willingness for a 30-day ceasefire and Russia\u2019s demand for Kyiv\u2019s effective surrender.",
      "It\u2019s not been a total love-in between the leaders of these former Cold War foes. Trump has expressed frustration with his Russian counterpart for continuing to launch missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians while negotiations to end the fighting are ongoing.",
      "And Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the White House is not asking the Senate to hold back on a bill that would slap a 500% tariff on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, gas and other products.",
      "But one thing that Putin\u2019s personal connection with Trump does is buy him time, according to Mark Galeotti, director of the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "Putin has shown little desire for any sort of ceasefire that does not satisfy his maximalist goals. And right now his forces continue to make slow but steady battlefield advances in eastern Ukraine, according to independent monitors like the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War think tank.",
      "So, with negotiations at an impasse, Putin will be more than happy to delay any definite decision \u2014 on both American support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, Galeotti said.",
      "\u201cEvery week counts\u201d in this \u201cparticularly pivotal moment,\u201d Galeotti said. If his call with Trump delays making any decisions, then \u201cI think Putin will see it as a good job done,\u201d he said.",
      "As with its lack of detail on how the war might end, the call also provided little clarity on whether or when Trump and Putin might meet in person, something they have both suggested could happen. If and when this real-world t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate does take place, it will be harder for Putin to resist giving Trump something, according to Galeotti.",
      "The Russians are \u201ctrying to avoid giving anything because they are very, very hard-nosed negotiators,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they do meet in person, then Trump will have to leave with something.\u201d",
      "While no date for a meeting between the two leaders has been set, their longtime fondness has long caused widespread alarm across the West. Intelligence agencies see Putin as a foe who has challenged international norms through hybrid warfare such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against democratic institutions.",
      "NBC News has asked the White House for a response.",
      "The American president\u2019s connection with Putin has roots at least as far back as 2013, when he visited Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant and pondered on Twitter whether Putin will \u201cbecome my new best friend?\u201d",
      "By 2015, before the two men had even met, Putin was heaping praise on Trump as a \u201ccolorful, talented person,\u201d something the American leader said was a \u201cgreat honor\u201d coming from the \u201chighly respected\u201d Russian leader.",
      "A year later, Trump openly urged Putin to influence the American presidential election, telling a rally in Doral, Florida, that \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d This was in the eyes of many observers an overt invitation for Russian intelligence services to hack into the account of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.",
      "Putin would indeed conduct a campaign to interfere, according to a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released in 2020.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, the pair met on multiple occasions without any staff present, a highly unusual departure from standard protocol. But the Russian government would ultimately conclude that while the president himself was friendly, his administration was not. The Trump White House imposed sanctions and withdrew from a nuclear deal it said Russia wasn\u2019t respecting.",

      "Vance, who is Catholic, said he found the pope to be \u201cextremely sweet.\u201d He described their conversation as substantive \u2014 a promising sign given how Leo had, in his previous service as a cardinal, signaled disapproval of Trump administration immigration policies.

He has also visited India, represented the White House at conferences in Paris and Munich and touched down in Greenland to reinforce Trump\u2019s interest in annexing the island from Denmark. And the White House nearly sent Vance from Rome on a last-minute mission to Israel \u2014 which Trump skipped on last week\u2019s tour \u2014 but said the logistics could not be worked out in time.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a particularly deliberate strategy of him traveling less or me traveling more,\u201d Vance said, weighing his globetrotting against Trump\u2019s. \u201cI just think it\u2019s kind of the way it\u2019s fallen.\u201d",
      "But Vance acknowledged that he has been given a broad portfolio and wide latitude.",
      "\u201cI definitely think the president has a lot of trust in me, and I\u2019m honored by it, and I think it makes me a more effective vice president,\u201d Vance said. \u201cA lot of people always asked me between the election and the inauguration: What would my role be? I would always say \u2026 I think it\u2019ll be being an extra set of eyes and ears for the president, doing the things that he thinks that I need to do, and that\u2019s largely how it\u2019s worked out.\u201d",
      "There was plenty for Vance to do in Rome.",
      "After Sunday\u2019s Mass, he and Rubio hosted Zelenskyy at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence here. A February clash between Vance and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office seemed like a distant memory when the vice president\u2019s office released a statement about \u201ctheir shared goal of ending the bloodshed\u201d and a photo of the two leaders smiling.",
      "From the Zelenskyy meeting, Vance hustled to Chigi Palace, where Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had brokered a meeting between Vance and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The sitdown was framed as an opportunity for constructive dialogue at a time when Trump\u2019s tariffs and Vance\u2019s adversarial posture toward European leaders have rattled the Continent.",
      "\u201cObviously, the president has had some pretty tough words \u2014 I guess I have, too, pretty tough words for Europe \u2014 about the importance of opening their markets, but also the importance of doing more burden-sharing in defense,\u201d Vance said in the interview. \u201cAnd I would say that one leader that both of us have consistently found is a really helpful bridge between the United States and Europe is Meloni.\u201d",
      "Meloni, like Trump and Vance, is known for her far-right politics. Vance observed that she has two qualities that he believes make her a strong diplomatic partner.",
      "\u201cThe first is that she\u2019s a very, very good listener. So if you have two people who really disagree on something, she tries to understand where both of them are coming from, and she\u2019s perceptive and insightful enough that she actually understands it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second thing is, she\u2019s extraordinarily direct. She actually reminds me a little bit of Usha in that way, where she can deliver an extraordinarily direct message without coming across as offensive. That\u2019s just a skill, right? There\u2019s a skill in actually being direct with somebody but not raising their guard.\u201d",
      "Vance also met Sunday with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and with British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Foreign Secretary David Lammy. He said his discussions with Carney centered on trade policy, a major issue between the U.S. and Canada.",
      "Diplomacy to this degree wasn\u2019t originally on the agenda for Vance\u2019s return to Rome.",
      "\u201cWhen we first started sketching out the trip, I thought, oh, this is kind of nice. We\u2019ll go to the papal Mass, Usha and I will have lunch afterwards, and just kind of take it easy on Sunday and fly home Sunday night or Monday,\u201d Vance, who had just finished a leisurely lunch with the second lady, said before clarifying that he looks for opportunities to \u201cdo as much as I possibly can\u201d on taxpayer-funded trips overseas.",
      "\u201cIt was a very personally rewarding trip,\u201d he added. \u201cOnce you\u2019re here and there are all these other world leaders here, you might as well try to try to sit down with them and talk to them.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s expansive role has placed him alongside Rubio, the administration\u2019s chief diplomat, as a face of Trump\u2019s foreign policy. The president stoked speculation of a 2028 rivalry between the two earlier this month when, in an interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d he suggested both as potential successors.",
      "At the time, allies of both Vance and Rubio dismissed any notion of competition or friction. Vance did so himself Monday, mentioning a recent conversation with a political consultant.",
      "\u201cI can just feel it \u2014 the media is going to start telling some story of me versus Marco or me having a rivalry with Marco,\u201d Vance recalled telling the consultant.",
      "\u201cMost of the time,\u201d Vance said, \u201cI don\u2019t give a s--- about this stuff. I don\u2019t even think that much about it.\u201d",
      "He and Rubio, Vance added, talk five times a day \u2014 \u201con a light day.\u201d If there\u2019s a call Vance knows Rubio will be on, he said, he knows he can skip the call and catch up with him later.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the level of trust and confidence that I have in Marco,\u201d Vance said.",
      "\u201cMy attitude is, if I do end up running in 2028, I\u2019m not entitled to it,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I really think that Marco and I can get a lot done together over the next few years. That\u2019s how I think about our friendship and our relationship. And I would be shocked if he thought about it any differently.\u201d"

      "Shanghai-based Bc Babycare expects its supply chain diversification and the U.S. market potential to more than offset the impact of ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, according to Chi Yang, the company\u2019s vice president of Europe and the Americas.",
      "\u201cEven [if] the political things are not steady ... I\u2019m very confident about our product for the moment,\u201d he told CNBC, adding he anticipates \u201cvery fast\u201d growth in the U.S. in coming years. That includes his bold predictions that Bc Babycare\u2019s flagship baby carrier can become the best-seller on Amazon.com in half a year, and that U.S. sales can grow by 10-fold in a year.",
      "The $159.99 carrier, eligible for a $40 discount, already has 4.7 stars on Amazon.com across more than 30 reviews. The device claims to reduce pressure on the parent\u2019s body by up to 33%. A far cheaper version of the baby carrier is a top seller among travel products for pregnancy and childbirth on JD.com in China.",
      "Bc Babycare already has the carrier stocked in its U.S. warehouses, and has a network of factories and raw materials suppliers in the Americas, Europe and Asia, Yang said. \u201cThe global supply chain is one of the things we keep on building in the past couple years.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration has sought to reduce U.S. reliance on China-made goods and to encourage the return of manufacturing jobs to the U.S. In a rapid escalation of tensions last month, the U.S. and China had added tariffs of more than 100% on each other\u2019s goods. Last week, the two sides agreed to a 90-day pause for most of the new duties in order to\u00a0discuss a trade deal.",
      "Baby gear is particularly sensitive to tariffs since the majority of those sold in the U.S. are made in China, said U.S.-based\u00a0Newell Brands, which owns stroller company Graco, on an April 30 earnings call. That\u2019s according to a FactSet transcript.",
      "The company said it raised baby gear prices by about 20% in the last few weeks, but had not incorporated the additional 125% tariffs announced in mid-April. Newell said on the call it had about three to four months of inventory in the U.S., and had paused additional orders from China.",
      "The company did not respond to a request for comment about whether it had resumed orders from China and whether it planned more price increases.",
      "Bc Babycare declined to share how much it planned to invest in the U.S. But Yang said the company plans to open an office in the country and hire about five to 10 locals.",
      "The company initially plans to sell online, spend on marketing and eventually work with major retailers for offline store sales. Its partners for raw materials and research include three U.S. companies: Lyra, Dow and Eastman.",
      "The Chinese company, which entered the baby products segment in 2014, in 2021 claimed a\u00a0700 million yuan ($97.09 million)\u00a0funding round from investors including Sequoia Capital China.",
      "Yang said the company scrutinizes the comments section on Chinese and U.S. e-commerce websites to improve its products. As a result, the U.S. version of the baby carrier is softer and larger than the Chinese version, he said.",
      "Bc Babycare\u2019s U.S. market ambitions reflect how large U.S. and European multinationals not only face growing competition in China, but also in their home markets.",
      "\u201cAfter experiencing substantial growth due to the premiumization of consumption in the Chinese market, multinational brands are now entering a challenging second phase where they compete fiercely for market share,\u201d Dave Xie, retail and consumer goods partner in Shanghai at consultancy Oliver Wyman, said in a statement last week.",
      "Oliver Wyman said in a report last month that the Chinese market has become the incubator for premium product innovations that are being exported. The authors noted, for example, that Tineco floor scrubbers have become Amazon best-sellers."

    "story": [
      "A long-lost memorial bust of Jim Morrison, the legendary frontman of The Doors, has been recovered 37 years after it was stolen, French police said.",
      "Crafted in 1981 by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Morrison\u2019s death, the bust was defaced with graffiti and messages by fans at the gravesite in Paris\u2019 P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, which is also the final resting place of French singer Edith Piaf and the Irish author, poet and playwright Oscar Wilde.",
      "Seven years later someone took it from the cemetery, which has become a pilgrimage for fans of Morrison, who was known for his dark lyrics, wavy locks, leather pants and theatrical stage presence.",
      "The singer propelled The Doors to several major hits from 1965 to 1967, including \u201cLight My Fire,\u201d \u201cHello I Love You,\u201d \u201cTouch Me\u201d and \u201cRiders on the Storm.\u201d",
      "Almost six decades on, the sculpture was found during an unrelated search, France's Financial and Anti-Corruption Brigade said Friday in a statement on Instagram.",
      "A representative for Morrison\u2019s estate told Rolling Stone that it was \u201chappy to hear the news\u201d of the statue\u2019s recovery. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a piece of history, and one Jim\u2019s family wanted there on his grave, so it\u2019s gratifying to see that it\u2019s been recovered.\u201d",
      "Born in 1943 in Melbourne, Florida, Morrison said he witnessed the aftermath of a terrible car accident on a Native American reservation as a child, an event that loomed large in his later lyrics and poetry.",
      "He founded The Doors with keyboardist Ray Manzarek in 1965, and guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore joined soon after.",
      "The band released their eponymous debut album \u201cThe Doors\u201d and \u201cStrange Days\u201d in 1967 and \u201cThe Soft Parade\u201d the following year. They followed this up with \u201cMorrison Hotel\u201d in 1970.",
      "But the band would burn out quickly as Morrison sank into alcoholism. He was twice arrested for his on-stage antics, including a Miami concert that saw him convicted of indecent exposure and profanity. He received a\u00a0posthumous pardon\u00a0in 2010.",
      "Morrison made his final album with The Doors, \u201cL.A. Woman,\u201d in 1971, and moved to Paris soon afterward.",
      "There, on July 3, 1971, he was found dead in a bathtub. He was 27. No autopsy was performed and accounts of what caused his death are disputed."

      "Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, the largest EV battery maker, traded as much as 18.4% above the listing price of 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.61), raising at least $4.6 billion. At a ceremony at the stock exchange in central Hong Kong, CATL\u2019s billionaire founder, Robin Zeng, marked the start of trading by banging a bronze \u201cmegagong\u201d reserved for only the biggest listings.",
      "The company, which makes batteries for Tesla and other automakers and has a tech licensing agreement with Ford, controls more than a third of the global market for EV batteries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the 800-pound gorilla in the battery space,\u201d said Lei Xing, an independent analyst of the Chinese auto industry based in Amherst, Massachusetts. \u201cYou could look at it as the Tesla of batteries.\u201d",
      "International investors clamored for CATL stock despite U.S.-China tensions that have effectively kept it and other Chinese EV and battery makers \u2014 and their world-leading technology \u2014 out of the United States, the second-largest passenger vehicle market in the world after China. U.S. investors were restricted from buying stock unless they had offshore accounts.",
      "Zeng was joined by officials representing the coastal city of Ningde in China\u2019s Fujian province, where CATL is based.",
      "\u201cThe Hong Kong listing means that we are more deeply integrated into the global capital market, and it marks a new starting point in promoting the global zero-carbon economy,\u201d he said.",
      "The listing is also a boost for the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, an international financial hub where the market has been sluggish in recent years.",
      "One reason Chinese companies are choosing to list in Hong Kong is to mitigate geopolitical risk, Xing said, as it\u2019s \u201ccloser to home, safer.\u201d",
      "In the United States, CATL is among dozens of companies the Defense Department blacklisted in the final days of the Biden administration over alleged ties to the Chinese military, which CATL denies. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party cited that blacklisting last month in letters urging Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase to withdraw from the deal \u2014 both banks remained involved.",
      "Ford has faced questions from lawmakers over an agreement to license technology from CATL to produce battery cells at a $3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan.",
      "Chinese EV and battery makers also face a 100% U.S. tariff on EVs and a 25% tariff on lithium-ion EV batteries introduced by the Biden administration, as well as the steep tariffs on all Chinese imports imposed by President Donald Trump, with both presidents citing unfair trade practices by Beijing. CATL says the impact of tariffs is minimal given its limited business in the United States.",
      "Experts say the trade barriers could slow the development of American EVs, whose high prices have discouraged consumers from buying.",
      "It would take \u201cat least a decade\u201d for the United States to develop its own version of CATL, Xing said.",
      "The company, which was founded in 2011 and is already listed in the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen, reported $50 billion in revenue last year, about 70% of it in China. It faces intense competition, however, from Chinese rivals such as BYD \u2014 reporting an almost 10% decrease in revenue last year, the first such drop since CATL began releasing operating figures in 2015.",
      "CATL says it will use almost all of the money raised in Hong Kong to build a $7.3 billion factory in Hungary, allowing it to make batteries in Europe for automakers such as BMW, Stellantis\u00a0and Volkswagen.",
      "\u201cThey know that in order to continue to grow the way they want to, they really need to establish a presence outside of China,\u201d said Tu Le, the Detroit-based founder and managing director of Sino Auto Insights. \u201cAnd the $4\u00bd billion-dollar IPO is effectively building a war chest for them to do that.\u201d",

      "Jobs traditionally done by women are more vulnerable to the impact of artificial intelligence than those done by men, especially in high-income countries, a report by the United Nations\u2019 International Labour Organization showed on Tuesday.",
      "It found 9.6% of traditionally female jobs were set to be transformed compared with 3.5% of those carried out by men as AI increasingly takes on administrative tasks and transforms clerical jobs, such as secretarial work.",
      "Human involvement will still be required for many tasks \u2014 and roles are more likely to be radically changed rather than eliminated, the report said.",
      "Jobs in the media, software and finance-related roles are also at the forefront of change as generative AI expands its learning abilities.",
      "\u201cWe stress that such exposure does not imply the immediate automation of an entire occupation, but rather the potential for a large share of its current tasks to be performed using this technology,\u201d the report said.",
      "It called on governments and employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations to think about how AI can be used to enhance productivity and job quality."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump is set to speak Monday with Vladimir Putin, in what the U.S. president said is an attempt to stop the \u201cbloodbath\u201d of the war in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump spoke with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other leaders in separate calls Monday, in an attempt to stop the \u201cbloodbath\u201d of the war in Ukraine.",
      "But the president\u2019s outreach was inconclusive, and there was little sign of a breakthrough. Russia and Ukraine would hold direct talks on a ceasefire \u201cimmediately,\u201d Trump said afterward in a post on his social network Truth Social, but it was unclear what form those talks would take or when they would happen. The Vatican, Trump said, has expressed interest in hosting the negotiations.",
      "\u201cThe conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump\u2019s call with Putin lasted more than two hours and \u201cwas very informative and very open,\u201d Putin told Russian state media.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Monday afternoon, Trump said he had asked Putin to meet with him, but did not say whether Putin had agreed.",
      "Trump said little about his conversation with Zelenskyy, with whom he spoke first, other than to say that he had informed Zelenskyy and the leaders of other NATO countries of the negotiations. White House officials declined to offer any further details.",
      "Trump spoke with Zelenskyy twice on Monday, according to Zelenskyy, once one-on-one, before Trump\u2019s call with Putin, and again during a conference call with the Ukrainian and NATO leaders.",
      "\u201cI reaffirmed to President Trump that Ukraine is ready for a full and unconditional ceasefire,\u201d Zelenskyy tweeted. \u201cIf the Russians are not ready to stop the killings, there must be stronger sanctions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPressure on Russia will push it toward real peace \u2014 this is obvious to everyone around the world.\u201d",
      "In a Monday interview with NBC News in Rome, where he was received by Pope Leo XIV, Vice President JD Vance said, \u201cWe talked about a couple of what I would call the president\u2019s major peace initiatives with the pope. We talked a lot about what\u2019s going on in Israel and Gaza. We talked a lot about the Russia-Ukraine situation. It\u2019s hard to predict the future, but I do think that, not just the pope, but the entire Vatican, has expressed a desire to be, you know, really helpful, and to work together on facilitating, hopefully, a peace deal coming together. Can\u2019t predict the future, but that was very meaningful, and I think will hopefully bear fruit for the country.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Putin\u2019s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said before the call that Russia \u201chighly values\u201d and is \u201cgrateful to the American side.\u201d In a briefing with journalists, he said that if the U.S. can \u201chelp to achieve our goals through peaceful means, then this is indeed preferable.\u201d",
      "Peskov was also asked about the chance of Trump and Putin meeting in person, a possibility the American president floated on Friday.",
      "\u201cIt will largely depend on what they themselves decide,\u201d Peskov said. The meeting \u201cneeds to be worked out\u201d by the two leaders in terms of dates and other details, he added.",
      "Ahead of the much anticipated Trump-Putin call, leaders from Britain, France, Germany and Italy said they spoke Sunday with Trump. The British government said in a statement that it was urging \u201cPutin to take peace talks seriously.\u201d",
      "Those leaders \u201calso discussed the use of sanctions if Russia failed to engage seriously in a ceasefire and peace talks,\u201d the statement said \u2014 something Trump has previously threatened.",
      "\u201cTomorrow, President Putin must show he wants peace by accepting the 30-day unconditional ceasefire proposed by President Trump and backed by Ukraine and Europe,\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron said on X.",
      "Trump has been widely criticized for appearing to offer concessions to Russia while demanding sacrifices from Ukraine. Those voices were joined last week by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, who gave details of why she stepped down last month.",
      "\u201cThe policy since the beginning of the Trump administration has been to put pressure on the victim, Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia,\u201d she wrote in an opinion piece Friday for the Detroit Free Press.",
      "\u201cPeace at any price is not peace at all \u2015 it is appeasement,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cwe must show leadership in the face of aggression, not weakness or complicity.\u201d",
      "While the diplomatic activity carries on, the violence in Ukraine continues. Russia has continued its near-nightly drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian civilians, more than three years after it launched a full-scale invasion and tried to seize Kyiv.",
      "On Sunday, Russia shelled residential neighborhoods of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kherson, killing a 75-year-old woman and injuring two other people, the city council posted on the Telegram messaging site.",
      "As well as being widely blamed for launching an unprovoked war, Russia is condemned across the West for the highly repressive and authoritarian state fashioned by Putin's Kremlin.",
      "On Monday, the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office labeled one of those critics, Amnesty International, as an \"undesirable organization\" and effectively banned it. The authority accused the London-based human rights watchdog of being \"Russophobic,\" trying to prolong the war, wanting to \"justify the crimes of Ukrainian neo-Nazis\" and its staffers of supporting \"extremist organizations.\"",
      "Trump, who has often spoken warmly of Putin, rarely if ever mentions these human rights concerns.",
      "Trump said in a Truth Social post on Saturday that he would be speaking with Putin at 10 a.m. Monday with the purpose of \u201cstopping the \u2018bloodbath\u2019 that is killing, on average, more than 5,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week.\u201d NBC News has not independently verified the numbers that Trump cited.",
      "Apparently referring both to his planned call with Putin and his slated talks with Zelenskyy and other European leaders, Trump added that \u201chopefully it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war, a war that should have never happened, will end.\u201d",
      "Despite promising on multiple occasions to end the war in 24 hours of taking office, Trump has since found the reality much different since beginning his second term.",
      "U.S.-brokered negotiations saw Russia and Ukrainian delegations meet in person in Istanbul last week for the first time since the early days of the war.",
      "However, the demands of the two sides remain far apart, with Russia saying it will only agree to a truce if Ukraine effectively surrenders. Ukraine has said these demands are unacceptable."

      "But a surge in support for far-right and anti-establishment candidates left the\u00a0runoff on a knife-edge.",
      "An Opinia24 poll for private broadcaster TVN published after the first round gave Trzaskowski 46% in the runoff and Nawrocki 44%, with 10% undecided or refusing to say.\u00a0The second round takes place on June 1.",
      "\u201cWe have to talk to everyone, the most important thing is the arguments,\u201d Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw,\u00a0told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0glad that many young people went to the polls, but it\u2018s\u00a0a great challenge to convince them to vote for me.\u201d",
      "Nawrocki said he would seek support from both left and right.",

      "Many young voters have expressed disillusionment with the dominant parties, KO and PiS, and Mentzen in particular enthused them with an economically liberal, eurosceptic and anti-immigrant program that he says provides an alternative to both.",
      "But Mentzen has criticized Nawrocki and analysts say it is by no means certain that all his supporters will back the PiS candidate.",
      "Meanwhile, two left-wing\u00a0candidates together\u00a0scored just over 9% on Sunday. But neither\u00a0gave Trzaskowski\u00a0an unequivocal endorsement.",
