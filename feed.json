      "The 2023 comedy is about two veiled brides who are accidentally swapped during a train ride, and tackles issues of patriarchy and gender roles, a shift from decades of male-centered mainstream Indian movies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rare privilege to win an award for a film like \u2018Laapataa Ladies.' It\u2019s been a wonderful night. It\u2019s a rare privilege to make a film like this,\u201d Rao said in her acceptance speech.",

      "\u201cParasite\u201d filmmaker Bong Joon Ho\u2019s original science fiction film \u201cMickey 17\u201d opened in first place on the North American box office charts. According to studio estimates Sunday, the Robert Pattinson-led film earned $19.1 million in its first weekend in theaters, which was enough to dethrone \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d after a three-week reign.",
      "Overseas, \u201cMickey 17\u201d has already made $34.2 million, bringing its worldwide total to $53.3 million. But profitability for the film is a long way off: It cost a reported $118 million to produce, which does not account for millions spent on marketing and promotion.",

It\u2019s an original film from an Oscar-winning director led by a big star that was afforded a blockbuster budget and given a robust theatrical release by Warner Bros., one of the few major studios remaining. But despite all of that, and reviews that were mostly positive (79% on RottenTomatoes), audiences did not treat it as an event movie, and it may ultimately struggle to break even.",
      "Originally set for release in March 2024, Bong Joon Ho\u2019s follow-up to the Oscar-winning \u201cParasite\u201d faced several delays, which he has attributed to extenuating circumstances around the Hollywood strikes. Based on the novel \u201cMickey7\u201d by Edward Ashton, Pattinson plays an expendable employee who dies on missions and is re-printed time and time again. Steven Yeun, Naomi Ackie, Toni Collette and Mark Ruffalo also star.",
      "It opened in 3,807 locations domestically where it performed best in New York and Los Angeles. Premium large format showings, including IMAX screens, also accounted for nearly half of its opening weekend. Internationally, it did especially well in Korea, where it made an estimated $14.6 million.",
      "Second place went to \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u201d which added $8.5 million from 3,480 locations in North America and $9.2 million internationally. Its global total currently rests at $370.8 million. The Walt Disney Studios is on track to become the first studio to cross $1 billion in 2025 sometime this week.",
      "Holdovers \u201cLast Breath,\u201d \u201cThe Monkey\u201d and \u201cPaddington in Peru\u201d rounded out the top five.

      "According to data from Comscore, the 2025 box office as a whole is up 1% from where it was last year as of this weekend and down 34.2% from the last pre-pandemic box office year of 2019.",

      "His family added: \u201cThrough this fight, he remained committed and present for his family, his music, his fans and his community.\u201d",
      "Wiggins was a vocalist and bass guitarist of the beloved R&B group, which included his brother Raphael Saadiq and their cousin Christian Riley. The group became mainstays of the New Jack Swing movement, blending R&B, jazz and traces of gospel melodies.",
      "The Oakland, California, natives burst onto the music scene with their 1988 debut album, \u201cWho?\u201d with songs like \u201cBaby Doll\u201d and \u201cLittle Walter.\u201d But it was their 1990 New Jack Swing-infused \u201cFeels Good\u201d record that gave the group mainstream success, peaking at No. 9 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart.",
      "They released two more studio projects together, with party hits like \u201cLet\u2019s Get Down,\u201d featuring DJ Quik, and timeless slow jams including \u201cWhatever You Want,\u201d \u201cIt Never Rains (In Southern California),\u201d \u201c(Lay Your Head on My) Pillow\u201d and \u201cAnniversary,\u201d a standard in the Black music romance canon. Their \u201cIt Never Rains\u201d version was a cover of the 1972 hit by British singer-songwriter Albert Hammond.",
      "The blood relatives also couldn\u2019t predict how their success would affect their relationship. The Tonyies went their separate ways after their fourth album, 1996\u2019s platinum-selling \u201cHouse of Music.\u201d Fame. Finances, miscommunication and creative differences were unsustainable for the group.",
      "Wiggins and Riley toured under the group\u2019s name between 1998 and 2018, with Amar Khalil taking over lead singing duties. Wiggins also produced and helped grow young artists who would become some of today\u2019s brightest young stars, including Zendaya, H.E.R., Kehlani and even Destiny\u2019s Child.",
      "Ultimately, through Saadiq's efforts, the group made amends and reunited for a tour in 2023. It was the first road trip featuring the three original members in nearly 30 years.",
      "The family members vowed not to let outside influences like managers, record executives and the entertainment business as a whole drive them apart again, realizing that time \u2014 at least in the professional sense \u2014 is no longer a luxury.",
      "In a 2023 interview with The AP, The Tonyies had planned on a new project.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of material, and now we just want to make sure that we put out the right energy through our music,\u201d Wiggins said.",

      "Authorities are preparing to reveal more information about the investigation into the deaths of actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- Authorities are set to reveal more information about an investigation into the deaths of actor Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa, whose partially mummified bodies were discovered last month at their home in New Mexico.",
      "The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office has said it does not suspect foul play, and tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Sheriff Adan Mendoza and state fire, health and forensics officials scheduled an afternoon news conference Friday to provide updates on the case.",
      "Mendoza has said the couple may have died up to two weeks before they were discovered on Feb. 26. Hackman\u2019s pacemaker last showed activity Feb. 17, nine days before maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police.",
      "Arakawa was found with an open prescription bottle and pills scattered on the bathroom counter, while Hackman was found in the home\u2019s entryway.",
      "One of the couple's three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed of the dead animal.",
      "Authorities retrieved personal items from the home including a monthly planner and two cellphones that will be analyzed. Medical investigators have been working to establish the cause of their deaths, but toxicology reports often take weeks to complete.",
      "When they were found, the bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe\u2019s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \"Hoosiers\" and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.",
      "The couple\u2019s stucco, Pueblo-revival style home sits on a hill in a gated community at the southern tip of the Rocky Mountains. Santa Fe is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.",
      "Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood\u2019s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses."

      "Seven years ago, global pop phenomenon Jennie became the first member of the K-pop group Blackpink to release solo music",
      "NEW YORK -- She was the first to go \u201cSOLO.\u201d",
      "Seven years ago, global pop phenomenon Jennie became the first member of the K-pop group Blackpink to release solo music. On Friday, she becomes the latest to drop a debut solo studio album, the English-language \u201cRuby.\u201d It's a kaleidoscope of different sounds for Jennie, full of incongruous, polished pleasures.",
      "\u201cSOLO,\u201d her debut single, was a product of its time \u2013 nostalgic EDM-pop with pitched up whistle effects and simple, declarative lyrics. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 solo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo,\" she repeated on the chorus. You had to believe her: She wasn\u2019t leaving her band, but a lackluster relationship, an ex so innocuous they're barely a player in the song. \u201cThis time I\u2019m only lookin\u2019 at me, myself and I,\u201d she sang, \u201cI\u2019ma do it on my own now.\u201d A lot has changed in the time since, but the core of her and her band's sonic messaging \u2014 self-empowerment above all else \u2014 hasn't wavered.",
      "On \u201cRuby,\u201d it's strongest on the singles \u201cMantra,\" where Jennie cheerleads in a chant-along chorus: \u201cPretty girls don\u2019t do drama \u2019less we wanna / it\u2019ll be depending on the day\" atop brassy production perfect for primetime commercial placement. Or \u201cExtraL\u201d with the innovative Doechii, whose acicular raps give additional weight to \u201cYeah, we lappin\u2019 the men,\u201d a line delivered with laughter.",
      "But it isn't all assertions of autonomy. On the languid \u201cLove Hangover\u201d with Dominic Fike, she's falling into destructive patterns with an undeserving partner; in a falsetto, her chameleonic vocal performance is so convincing, the recording almost doesn't even sound like Jennie. Or maybe it just doesn't sound like the Jennie fans have grown to known?",
      "Across \u201cRuby,\u201d don\u2019t expect cuts that would make a Blackpink record. Prior to \u201cRuby,\u201d Jennie had only worked with one producer \u2014 Teddy Park, a man synonymous with her girl group hits. This time around, she worked with an eclectic team ranging from Diplo to El Guincho \u2014 new voices to explore different facets of her personality. It's ambitious and glossy, moving from an acoustic ballad here (\u201cTwin\u201d), virtuosic rapping there (\u201cZen\u201d), to familiar beats on (\"With the IE (Way Up)\" and \u201cStart A War\u201d). And it pays off.",
      "Jennie tries her best Rihanna phrasing on the SZA-channeling \u201cStart A War,\" and maybe spends too much time with robust collaborations \u2014 Childish Gambino and Kali Uchis on the nostalgic R&B of \u201cDamn Right,\u201d Dua Lipa on \u201cHandlebars\" that launches straight into the chorus \u2014 perfect for TikTok.",
      "In whole, Jennie's \u201cRuby\u201d is a solid re-introduction to the Blackpink superstar. The songs are strong and diverse and nostalgic \u2014 but maybe not wholly distinctive. It is still a reason to be excited for her future solo work."

      "Research by the charity English Heritage suggests it may have found a portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen Lady Jane Grey",
      "LONDON -- A painting that has gone on public display Friday could be the only portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen, Lady Jane Grey, painted during her lifetime, according to the conservation group English Heritage.",
      "It said there is \u201ccompelling\u201d evidence to suggest that the portrait, on loan from a private collection, shows Jane, who was no older than 17 when she became queen for just nine days in the summer of 1553.",
      "One of England's most tragic regal figures, she was executed at the Tower of London in 1554. Jane was a devout Protestant at a time of religious upheaval, the ultimate innocent victim of the chicanery of the Tudor court in the chaotic aftermath of Henry VIII\u2019s reign.",
      "She is perhaps best-known from Paul Delaroche\u2019s painting, \u201cThe Execution of Lady Jane Grey,\u201d which hangs in the National Gallery in central London. Jane, who may have been as young as 16, is shown blindfolded as an executioner with an axe waits to behead her.",
      "But that painting, like the few others that purport to show Jane, all date from after her death.",
      "Now, English Heritage says a Tudor-era work could be a \u201clive\u201d painting of Jane. The portrait, along with six others, will hang at Wrest Park, a country estate west of London managed by English Heritage, and which incidentally is the location of many scenes of Netflix's steamy period drama \"Bridgerton.\"",
      "The charity worked with the Courtauld Institute of Art and scientist Ian Tyers, who specializes in dendrochronology, or the dating of tree rings. It said there is enough evidence to raise the question: \"Could this mysterious portrait be Lady Jane Grey?\"",
      "Among the evidence presented, English Heritage said the tree-dating points to the wooden panel having been constructed between 1539 and around 1571 \u2014 Jane is believed to have been born in 1536 or 1537 and was executed in early 1554. It also said the back of the panel displays a merchant or cargo mark, identical to one used on a royal portrait of King Edward VI, who, in an ultimately tragic turn, anointed his first cousin once removed as his successor.",
      "It also noted a \u201cstriking change\" in the eyes of the sitter to the left rather than the right and that at some point, the eyes, mouth and ears were deliberately scratched out. In addition, it said the sitter was likely wearing a more elaborate costume.",
      "Rachel Turnbull, English Heritage\u2019s Senior Collections Conservator, said the evidence points to the possibility that \u201cwe are looking at the shadows of a once more royal portrait of Lady Jane Grey, toned down into subdued, Protestant martyrdom after her death.\u201d",
      "Jane was bright, reportedly spoke multiple languages and a big fan of Plato. But it was her commitment to Protestantism that interested Edward VI.",
      "Edward VI, the only surviving son of Henry VIII, was the first monarch to be raised a Protestant after his father split from Rome in order to divorce his first wife Catherine of Aragon. His mother was Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour, who Lady Jane was named after.",
      "On being informed in 1553 that he was terminally ill, the 15-year-old Edward wanted to bypass his older sisters Mary and Elizabeth, and named Lady Jane his heir to prevent the realm reverting to Catholicism.",
      "On July 10, Jane became queen but was deposed nine days later after her support melted away in the wake of an uprising by Mary's supporters. Jane was subsequently convicted of treason and sentenced to death."

      "The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize has been awarded to Liu Jiakun of China, who earned the field\u2019s highest honor for \u201caffirming architecture that celebrates the lives of ordinary citizens,\u201d organizers announced Tuesday.",

      "Liu is known for creating public areas in highly populated cities where there is little public space, \u201cforging a positive relationship between density and open space,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Organizers cited his West Village in Chengdu, a 2015 five-story project that spans a block. It includes a perimeter of pathways for cyclists and pedestrians around \u201cits own vibrant city of cultural, athletic, recreational, office and business activities within, while allowing the public to view through to the surrounding natural and built environments.\u201d",

      "In an interview Sunday in his office in Chengdu, Liu said he was not one of those architects who likes to have a strongly recognizable visual style. Rather, he said, he pays more attention to method and strategy.",
      "\u201cMany architects use a strong personal style and form to gain a foothold in the world,\u201d Liu told The Associated Press, speaking in Mandarin. \u201cNo matter where it is, people can tell immediately that it is his or her work with a very strong symbolism. But I am not such a kind of architect.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a very clear or obvious style that can be recognized as mine just at a glance,\u201d he said. \u201cI take a more methodological and strategic approach. I hope that when I go to a specific place, I can use my methodology and strategy to adapt to local conditions. I like to fully understand the place, and then look for resources, problems \u2026 and then distill and refine, and finally turn (this) into my work.\u201d",

      "When he was 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France",
      "AMSTERDAM -- When he was just 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France.",
      "Now, more than half a century later, the museum named for the Dutch master is joining forces for the first time with the neighboring Stedelijk modern and contemporary art museum in Amsterdam to stage a blockbuster exhibition of Kiefer's work, titled \u201cSag mir wo die Blumen sind,\u201d a reference to folk singer Pete Seeger's iconic pacifist anthem \u201cWhere have all the flowers gone?\u201d",
      "Kiefer said he did not set out to make an exclusively anti-war exhibition, even though he closely follows world events including the conflict triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t say \u2018I do now an exhibition against the war.\u2019 This I don\u2019t do because this is a program; I\u2019m not a programmatic artist,\" he said. \"I do what is in me, what has to come out. And that is about all kinds of things, about the dead, about the war.\u201d",
      "Kiefer's sometimes bleak work, rooted in growing up in post-World War II Germany, might not immediately feel closely related to Van Gogh's vibrant and richly colored landscapes and vases of sunflowers.",
      "But take a look at Kiefer's 2019 \u201cThe Crows,\u201d alongside Van Gogh's 1890 \u201cWheatfield with Crows,\u201d and the inspiration for the German's work jumps from the wall.",
      "The brooding black birds aren't the only shared subjects that the two artists depict.",
      "One of Van Gogh's most famous inspirations \u2014 sunflowers \u2014 also appear in Kiefer's works.",
      "A huge dried sunflower hangs upside down in a glass cabinet, shedding its seeds on a book made from lead sheets, while \u201cSol Invictus\u201d shows a sunflower towering over the artist, who is lying in a yoga position known as the corpse pose.",
      "The show also includes some of his sketches from his trip retracing Van Gogh's footsteps.",
      "The 79-year-old German artist has a long relationship not just with Van Gogh, but also with the Stedelijk and Dutch collectors who bought some of his early works. The Stedelijk is showing early pieces such as a sculpture of an aeroplane resembling a B-1 bomber that is made of lead and called \u201cJourney to the end of the Night.\u201d",
      "The centerpiece of the Stedelijk is the installation for which the show is named. Built up around the museum's central staircase, it features paint-splattered clothes on hangers and flower petals spilling down paintings and into piles on the floor, among many things.",
      "Kiefer said that he wrote one of the lines in the Seeger song, which was later also sung in German by Marlene Dietrich, on the wall as part of the installation: \u201cWho will ever learn?\u201d",
      "\"This sentence makes the song philosophical,\" he told reporters. \"You know, because we cannot understand. We cannot understand, for example, that today things happened in (19)33 in the world.\u201d",
      "Asked about the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party that surged in last month's German election, he said: \u201cIt's horrible.\u201d",
      "The huge central work is made up of a long list of components including emulsion, oil, acrylic, shellac, golf leaf, sediment of electrolysis, dried flowers, straw, fabric and steel.",
      "The straw features in many of Kiefer\u2019s paintings, giving them a complex surface that sometimes echoes Van Gogh\u2019s bold brush strokes.",
      "\"He\u2019s working like a sort of ... alchemist transforming material into an art,\u201d curator Edwin Bakker of the Van Gogh Museum told The Associated Press.",
      "The exhibition opens March 7 and runs until June 9 at the Van Gogh Museum and Stedelijk Museum."

      "George Clooney, the proud son of a journalist, likes journalism and telling truth to power",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 George Clooney made waves in July when he called on Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, citing diminished capacity. For Clooney, there wasn't a choice to stay silent.",
      "\u201cI was raised to tell the truth and telling the truth means telling it when it's not comfortable,\" the actor-director and big Democratic booster tells The Associated Press. \u201cI did what I was raised and taught to do. That\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "There was inevitable backlash \u2014 just as there was back when he was branded a traitor for speaking out against the invasion of Iraq \u2014 but Clooney took the hits.",
      "\u201cTelling the truth to power or taking chances like that \u2014we\u2019ve seen it over our history,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here and survived these things and we will survive it.\u201d",
      "Clooney's truth-to-power stance takes another step this spring as he makes his Broadway debut, telling the story of legendary reporter Edward R. Murrow in an adaptation of his 2005 film \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d Performances starts March 12.",
      "Murrow, who died in 1965, is considered one of the architects of U.S. broadcast news and perhaps his greatest moment was opposing Sen. Joe McCarthy, who cynically created paranoia of a communist threat in the 1950s.",
      "\u201cThis is a story about who we are at our best, when we hold our own feet to the fire, when we check and balance ourselves,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary about now and the difference between Murrow\u2019s time is that we\u2019ve now decided that truth is negotiable.\u201d",
      "In the movie version \u2014 which Clooney co-wrote with Grant Heslov \u2014 the role of Murrow went to David Strathairn and Clooney played CBS executive Fred Friendly; this time, Clooney takes up the mantle of Murrow. When he and Heslov did a reading for theater investors he just played Murrow and the financiers agreed to sink their money in the play \u2014 on the condition Clooney stay in the role.",
      "As in the movie, the play version will have footage of the real McCarthy on screens and the stage will resemble a newsroom with several dozen old-fashioned monitors mixing old and new footage.",
      "The transition to Broadway makes a lot of sense since many of the movie's reviewers said it felt to them a lot like a play. It actually was originally conceived as a live TV movie, an idea scuttled after Justin Timberlake exposed Janet Jackson's nipple in the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show and scared away any notion of live network events.",
      "\u201cIt is an incredibly literary play,\u201d says Tony-winning director David Cromer. \u201cIt is filled with debate. It is filled with well-reasoned and very complex arguments about is this the right thing to do? Is this the right thing to do now? What happens when we do this? How do we say this?\u201d",
      "Two-time Oscar winner Clooney returns to Murrow at a time when journalists are under fire from the new U.S. administration and being denied access for not following White House talking points.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t decide to remount or do the play for any real political reasons,\u201d says Heslov, a frequent Clooney collaborator who is also making his Broadway writing debut. \u201cIt turns out that the environment might be ripe for it.\u201d",
      "Murrow had a large presence in Clooney\u2019s home growing up. His father, Nick Clooney, a veteran journalist, worked as a TV news anchor and host in a variety of cities including Cincinnati, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. He also wrote a newspaper column in Cincinnati and taught journalism at American University.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the son of a journalist, a proper journalist, a guy who tells the truth. My father\u2019s still out there fighting the good fight,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cI believe in it. I believe in the whole idea of how this works.\u201d",
      "Clooney is part of a starry group of Hollywood veterans arriving on Broadway this season, a list that includes Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Parsons, Sarah Snook and John Mulaney.",
      "Clooney insisted before he came that he didn't want to be the highest paid actor on Broadway. It mirrored the time he mortgaged his house and paid himself a salary of just $1 to finance the movie version of \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s like, pay Patti LuPone the most of anybody on Broadway. Pay somebody who\u2019s paid their dues. It shouldn\u2019t be somebody who\u2019s doing his first Broadway play,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to be part of that. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d",
      "The box office for a ticket to see him at the Winter Garden is white hot even before previews begin but Clooney deflects that to Murrow \u2014 it's not me, he suggests, it's the character he's playing.",
      "\u201cThe words of Edward Murrow are words that kind of soothe us,\" he says. \"It\u2019s a salve for insanity. And I think people are excited to be in a room and share some of those conversations.\u201d",
      "Clooney hasn't done a full-length play since he got his Equity Card in 1986 in Chicago as the comic relief in \u201cVicious,\u201d about punk icon Sid Vicious. \u201cMost of the cast members that I\u2019m working with weren\u2019t born when I did my last play. So it\u2019s scary,\u201d he says.",
      "He thought he'd missed his chance at Broadway, a notch on many actor's bucket list. He's 63 now and it would mean uprooting his family for months.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve succeeded in my career. I\u2019m not saying that I haven\u2019t succeeded, but I hadn\u2019t done anything on Broadway and I thought maybe it\u2019s too late,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d been offered a couple of plays that I didn\u2019t think I was right for, and I thought if I was going to do it, I should do something that I was right for. And this was an opportunity where I thought, \u2018Well, I know how to tell this story. I may not do a great job with it. You know, I may really screw it up, but I know what\u2019s required of the thing.\u2019\u201d"

But on the runway, designer Olivier Rousteing shifted from red carpet opulence to a new kind of luxury, built on sculptural knitwear, fluid draping and dazzling blown-up zebra motifs.",

      "The abuse last summer quickly escalated, including attacks based on Jolly's sexual orientation and wrongly assumed Israeli roots, and reportedly aimed to silence the artistic intent of the show. Jolly responded by filing a formal complaint with the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office on July 31, prompting an investigation that led to arrests in the south of France in October 2024.",

      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Despite finding \u201cimproprieties\u201d were committed by a prosecutor, the Connecticut Supreme Court on Monday upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in a case that drew wide attention because the victim's Fitbit exercise tracker contradicted his statements to police.",
      "The justices ruled in a 6-0 decision that Richard Dabate was not deprived of a fair trial because of four missteps by the prosecutor they called \u201ctroubling,\u201d including referring to one of Connecticut's most notorious crimes while cross-examining the man.",
      "Dabate, 48, was convicted of murder and other charges in the fatal shooting of Connie Dabate, 39, at the couple's home in Ellington two days before Christmas in 2015 while their two young sons were in school. He's serving a 65-year prison sentence.",
      "Prosecutors said Dabate wanted his wife dead, in part, because he had a yearslong affair with another woman who was pregnant at the time of the killing and later gave birth to their child.",
      "Dabate staged a phony crime scene, including tying himself up loosely with zip ties and stabbing himself with a box cutter, and told police an unknown intruder in camouflage broke into their home, killed his wife and assaulted him, authorities said.",

      "Dabate testified in his defense and maintained his innocence, saying a large masked man with a voice like actor Vin Diesel was the killer.",
      "Part of Dabate's appeal questioned the reliability of the Fitbit evidence and whether the trial judge was wrong to have allowed it, but the Supreme Court upheld the data and its use.",
      "Dabate also accused Tolland State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky of multiple instances of impropriety, including Gedansky mentioning a notorious home invasion in Cheshire in 2007 while cross-examining Dabate. The home invaders killed a woman and her two daughters, ages 11 and 17, after terrorizing them for hours, while the woman's husband survived a vicious beating.",
      "Gedansky asked Dabate if he was trying to create a \u201clittle mini-Cheshire scene\u201d in his own home. The trial judge upheld an objection by Dabate's lawyer and asked Gedansky to rephrase the question, but Gedansky asked nearly the same exact question. The Supreme Court found Gedansky violated the judge's order to rephrase.",
      "\u201cIn referring to a \u2018mini Cheshire,\u2019 the prosecutor\u2019s question was unnecessarily inflammatory because it compared the defendant to other notorious offenders or infamous figures,\u201d Justice Joan Alexander wrote in the decision.",
      "Gedansky and Dabate's lawyer, Trent LaLima, did not immediately return email messages seeking comment Monday.",
      "The Supreme Court also found that Gedansky committed three other improprieties, including suggesting that the jury would have to be unintelligent or lazy to agree with the defense theory of the case.",
      "\u201cWe disapprove of the improprieties committed by the prosecutor during the trial of this case in strong and unqualified terms and expect our message to be taken with the utmost seriousness by prosecutors,\u201d the decision said.",
      "The court said it agreed with Dabate that \u201cthe prosecutor engaged in multiple acts of impropriety at trial that we consider troubling.\u201d",
      "Justices, however, said the state's case was very strong and Gedansky's missteps did not overshadow testimony by 130 witnesses and the 600 exhibits presented during the five-week trial."

      "The Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether state and local governments can enforce laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children, in a Colorado case",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday in a case from Colorado to decide whether state and local governments can enforce laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children.",
      "The conservative-led court is taking up the case amid actions by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people, including a ban on military service and an end to federal funding for gender-affirming care for transgender minors.",
      "The justices also have heard arguments in a Tennessee case over whether state bans on treating transgender minors violate the Constitution. But they have yet to issue a decision.",
      "Colorado is among roughly half the states that prohibit the practice of trying to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity through counseling.",
      "The issue is whether the law violates the speech rights of counselors. Defenders of such laws argue that they regulate the conduct of professionals who are licensed by the state.",
      "The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upheld the state law. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has struck down local local bans in Florida.",
      "In 2023, the court had turned away a similar challenge, despite a split among federal appeals courts that had weighed state bans and come to differing decisions.",
      "At the time, three justices, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, said they would have taken on the issue. It takes four justices to grant review. The nine-member court does not typically reveal how justices vote at this stage of a case so it\u2019s unclear who might have provided the fourth vote.",
      "The case will be argued in the court\u2019s new term, which begins in October. The appeal on behalf of Kaley Chiles, a counselor in Colorado Springs, was filed by Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal organization that has appeared frequently at the court in recent years in cases involving high-profile social issues.",
      "One of those cases was a 5-4 decision in 2018 in which the justices ruled that California could not force state-licensed anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion.",
      "Chiles\u2019 lawyers leaned heavily on that decision in asking the court to take up her case. They wrote that Chiles doesn\u2019t \u201cseek to \u2018cure\u2019 clients of same-sex attractions or to \u2018change\u2019 clients\u2019 sexual orientation.\u201d",
      "In arguing for the court to reject the appeal, lawyers for Colorado wrote that lawmakers acted to regulate professional conduct, \u201cbased on overwhelming evidence that efforts to change a child\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity are unsafe and ineffective.\u201d",

      "Authorities have revealed that actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease and showed severe signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease a full week after his wife died of hantavirus in their home",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease a full week after his wife died from hantavirus in their New Mexico hillside home, likely unaware that she was dead because he was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, authorities revealed Friday.",
      "Both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes, chief medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell said alongside state fire and health officials at a news conference.",
      "\u201cMr. Hackman showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Jarrell said. \u201cHe was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that\u2019s what resulted in his death.\u201d",
      "Authorities didn't suspect foul play after the bodies of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were discovered Feb 26. Immediate tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Investigators found that the last known communication and activity from Arakawa was Feb. 11 when she visited a pharmacy, pet store and grocery before returning to their gated neighborhood that afternoon, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday.",
      "Hackman's pacemaker last showed signs of activity a week later and that he had an abnormal heart rhythm Feb. 18, the day he likely died, Jarrell said.",
      "Although there was no reliable way to determine the date and time when both died, all signs point to their deaths coming a week apart, Jarrell said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible he was not aware she was deceased,\u201d Jarrell said.",
      "Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, said he believes Hackman was severely impaired due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and unable to deal with his wife\u2019s death in the last week of his life.",
      "Most older Americans with dementia live at home, and many receive care from family or friends.",
      "Their bodies were found a little over a week later. Hackman was found in the home\u2019s entryway. His death was tied to heart disease with Alzheimer\u2019s disease contributing.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Authorities linked her death to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Thyroid medication pills prescribed to Arakawa were found nearby and weren\u2019t listed as contributing to her death, Jarrell said.",
      "Hantavirus typically is reported in spring and summer, often due to exposures that occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in New Mexico this year.",
      "While hantavirus is found throughout the world, most cases in the U.S. have been found in western states. The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection.",
      "Jarrell said it was not known how quickly Arakawa died.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, said Erin Phipps, a veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department. The sheriff considers this an open investigation until they receive results of the dog's necropsy and finish checking into data from personal cellphones retrieved from the home.",
      "When Hackman and Arakawa were found, the bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe\u2019s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).",
      "\u201cAll of us that knew him should have been checking on him,\u201d said Stuart Ashman, co-owner of Artes de Cuba gallery who cherished his encounters with Hackman at a local Pilates exercise studio, where they used to swap stories. \u201cI had no idea. ... It's just really sad. And that she died a week before him. My God.\u201d",
      "Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist in Virginia, said when two bodies are found at the same time, the usual assumption would be that they died at the same time. But Hackman\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease added a complicating factor: He apparently was unable to seek help after his wife died.",
      "\u201cThey died several days apart: One dying of a viral infection, the hantavirus, which can kill quite quickly. And the other death occurring from heart disease. And that too can be a relatively sudden death,\" Weedn said. \"Their (the authorities\u2019) explanation, I thought, was quite clear and plausible. I believe they really discovered what truly happened in this case.\u201d",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.",
      "Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood\u2019s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses.",

    "story": [
      "If you\u2019re about to go to the gym, should you eat something beforehand",
      "If you listen to some self-proclaimed exercise experts on social media, they swear that working out on an empty stomach burns more fat.",
      "But it\u2019s a common misconception that exercising in a fasted state improves performance or burns more calories, said Abby Langer, a dietitian in Toronto.",
      "\u201cThe research shows that in terms of gains, it doesn\u2019t really make much of a difference,\u201d she said.",
      "Does that mean you should load up on protein and carbs right before a workout? No, that\u2019s not true either.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at when \u2014 and how \u2014 you should eat, before, after or even during a workout. (And remember, experts say what you eat is more important than when you eat.)",
      "The calories in food literally are energy, so you need them to fuel your body for a proper workout. Eating too much too soon beforehand, though, can be problematic.",
      "Exercising diverts blood from organs including the stomach to the muscles, said Langer, author of \u201cGood Food, Bad Diet.\u201d So exercising on a full stomach affects the digestive process, which could cause cramping or even make you feel sick.",
      "That\u2019s particularly the case with meals high in fat, protein or fiber, which take longer to digest than carbohydrates. Langer recommends eating a high ratio of carbs beforehand and waiting two to three hours before intense exercise.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat a big steak an hour before you play hockey,\u201d she said.",
      "If you exercise first thing in the morning or before dinner, it\u2019s OK to have a carb-rich snack like a banana with peanut butter or yogurt with fruit beforehand. It will give you the energy to perform well, and you can fuel up afterward with a full meal.",
      "That steak may serve you better afterward because that\u2019s when a higher ratio of protein is easier to digest, said Krista Austin, a physiologist in Colorado Springs.",
      "Austin said if it will be an hour or longer before you can have a full meal, it\u2019s better to have a high-protein snack in the meantime to help curb your appetite. The reason has little to do with muscle recovery or nutrient absorption: Rather, people who are too hungry make poor dietary choices.",
      "\u201cA lot of people get very hungry about an hour after exercise, and you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d said Austin, author of \u201cPerformance Nutrition: Applying the Science of Nutrient Timing.\u201d \u201cYou want to catch it early, or you go and overeat.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s another myth that you need to grab a protein shake within minutes of finishing to build the biggest muscles, Langer said.",
      "Many exercise enthusiasts point to what\u2019s known as an \u201canabolic window\u201d of about an hour within exercising that the body is primed to repair muscle. For the average person, you have a much longer window, and nutrient timing is less important than making sure you consume some protein at every meal, Langer said. The body needs a continuous supply of amino acids like protein for muscle repair and maintenance, she said, which means about 25 to 30 grams at every meal, depending on various factors.",
      "\u201cPrioritizing that will help with goals, either muscle building, satiety, weight loss, all of that,\u201d Langer said.",
      "Most people who are eating enough throughout the day don\u2019t need anything during a workout. Langer and Austin said the threshold is about an hour of intense exercise. Longer than that \u2014 say you're training for a marathon \u2014 and you can benefit from a carb-rich snack in the middle.",
      "Instead of focusing on when to eat, Austin said to focus on what and how much. She cautioned against overcomplicating the topic and recommended following the USDA\u2019s My Plate recommendations for a balanced diet.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing we need to teach people is that nutrition is simple,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you need to stop focusing on the concept of nutrient timing and just make sure that you\u2019re consistently eating throughout the day and focus on health.\u201d",

      "The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was originally filed by the Biden administration, in a reversal that could have national implications for urgent care.",
      "The lawsuit had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences in Idaho, which has one of the country's strictest abortion bans.",
      "The Democratic administration had given similar guidance to hospitals nationwide in the wake of the Supreme Court 2022 decision overturning the right to abortion. It's being challenged in other conservative states.",
      "In Idaho, the state argued that its law does allow life-saving abortions and the Biden administration wrongly sought to expand the exceptions. The state agrees with the dismissal, so it does not need judicial approval, Justice Department attorneys wrote in court documents.",
      "Idaho doctors, meanwhile, say it remains unclear which abortion are legal, forcing them to airlift pregnant women of state if a termination might be part of the standard of care. It's often unclear in fast-moving emergencies whether pregnancy complications could ultimately prove fatal, doctors said in court documents.",
      "A judge has blocked Idaho from any abortion ban enforcement that would change emergency treatment at the state's largest hospital system for now.",
      "In his first term, Trump, a Republican, appointed many of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturned the constitutional right to abortion. He has since said the issue should be left to the states.",
      "Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after the overturning of Roe v. Wade amid questions about what care hospitals could legally provide, federal records showed.",
      "The Supreme Court stepped into the Idaho case last year. It ultimately handed down a narrow ruling that allowed hospitals to keep making determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations but left key legal questions unresolved.",
      "The case went before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December. Those judges have not yet ruled.",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening pregnancy complications each year, including major blood loss, sepsis or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since 2022. Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant."

      "The chamber voted 34-19 for a bill that would ban puberty blockers and most gender-affirming care for people under 18, including those already undergoing treatment. Georgia lawmakers in 2023 banned most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors unless they were already receiving treatment. The law lets doctors prescribe puberty blockers.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re asking (minors) to make changes that will have changes to the rest of their lives,\u201d bill sponsor Republican Sen. Ben Watson, of Savannah, said Monday. \u201cIt is not a fair decision to them. It is not a fair decision to the parents.\u201d",
      "A second bill sponsored by Senate Majority Whip Randy Robertson passed 37-15 and would ban most gender-affirming care for people incarcerated in state prisons.",
      "Last month, the chamber passed bills to ban transgender people from playing in school sports and cut off public funding for gender-affirming care for adults. The four bills will now head to the House for debate.",
      "Opponents said Republicans are playing politics by targeting transgender people and that lawmakers should focus on helping Georgians with more pressing issues such as housing and healthcare.

Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who built a following by sowing doubts about vaccines, ultraprocessed foods and fluoride. Notably, Makary has never embraced Kennedy\u2019s discredited idea that vaccines might cause autism.",
      "Experts who have worked with Makary say his contrarian approach could be useful at FDA \u2014 but only if he\u2019s able to resist political pressure from Kennedy and others on hot-button issues like vaccines.",
      "\u201cHe has this reputation of being someone who cares about evidence and transparency,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran of Yale University, who was part of an informal research group with Makary. \u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s going to preserve and defend the integrity of the agency or is he going to fall in line with the administration.\u201d",
      "Makary did not respond to an AP interview request.",
      "Trained as a pancreatic surgeon, Makary\u2019s initial work focused on uncontroversial topics like hospital costs and surgical checklists.",
      "In 2016, he made headlines with a paper stating that medical errors were \u201cthe third leading cause of death in the U.S.\u201d That conclusion was quickly disputed by other experts, who said the paper\u2019s death estimate was ten times higher than more rigorous reviews.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary reached a much broader audience as a regular on Fox News, where he opposed vaccine mandates and called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Makary often directs his harshest criticism toward the \u201cmedical hubris\u201d of fellow doctors, as in his latest book \u201cBlind Spots,\u201d which catalogues a number of cases where experts \u201cgot the science perfectly backwards.\u201d",
      "For example, he examines early recommendations that parents delay giving babies peanut-based foods due to allergy risks. Today, pediatricians generally recommend earlier introduction to prevent food allergies.",
      "Many researchers view such examples differently.",
      "\u201cThese are cases of people doing the best they can with evolving information and needing to make decisions along the way,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School. \u201cAs commissioner, he\u2019s going to have to be OK with making decisions based on evolving evidence \u2014 and some of those decisions might be wrong.\u201d",
      "Like others in Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, Makary says many of the chronic health problems afflicting Americans may be related to food additives, pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "\u201cHow about research on the pesticides that have hormone effects in children that may explain the declining fertility and lowering age of puberty?\u201d Makary asked, in a September podcast with Dr. Drew Pinsky.",
      "New York University food researcher Marion Nestle says Makary\u2019s questions \u201care extremely difficult to settle,\u201d because there\u2019s no way to ethically do the type of research needed to reach a firm conclusion: give one group of children food with pesticides and compare them with a control group getting food not grown with pesticides.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with his frustration and think we would be much better off with a lot fewer pesticides in our food supply, but I tend to view these issues more cautiously,\u201d Nestle said.",
      "Nutrition experts also say it\u2019s overly simplistic to declare all ultraprocessed foods harmful, since the category includes an estimated 60% of U.S. foods, including granola, peanut butter and ice cream.",
      "\u201cThey are not all created equal,\u201d said Gabby Headrick of George Washington University. \u201cIt is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultraprocessed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government,\u201d Makary told House lawmakers during a 2023 roundtable hosted by Republicans.",
      "Among the many COVID-19 policies Makary attacked was the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. That group received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild. Complicating the issue was the fact that COVID-19 itself also caused cases of myocarditis that were usually more severe.",
      "A 2022 paper coauthored by Makary concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions.",
      "\u201cThey made mistake after mistake and every time it either minimized the vaccine\u2019s benefits or exaggerated the risks,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris of the University of Washington, who published a critique of the work. \u201cThis paper really fed the whole notion that the vaccine is worse than the disease.\u201d",
      "Makary's conclusion contradicted that of U.K. experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimated the booster prevented 114 hospitalizations for every seven it caused in young people.",
      "Despite such pushback, Makary told Congress that CDC and FDA \u201clied to the American people\u201d about the need for boosters and other COVID measures.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser, says the Biden administration made missteps in rolling out boosters, including announcing plans to make them available for all age groups before outside experts had weighed in. But, Offit said, Makary\u2019s language has damaged public trust in health institutions, including the one he\u2019s been picked to lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rhetoric that\u2019s purposefully inflammatory to win over a certain crowd, which is part of today\u2019s zeitgeist of disdaining public health agencies,\u201d Offit said. \u201cSo he\u2019s offered the position at FDA because he has disdain for the agency.\u201d",

      "A new study finds the number of butterflies has dropped 22% since 2000, a new study finds",
      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "Dr. Marty Makary \u2014 a surgeon, author and researcher \u2014 is known for his contrarian views and outspoken criticism of the medical establishment. Like health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Makary traces many of the health issues afflicting Americans to food additives, overprescribing of drugs and the influence of drugmakers, insurers and food companies.",
      "To become commissioner, he\u2019ll need a majority vote from members of the Senate\u2019s health committee, who will question him Thursday morning. A confirmation vote by the full Senate is expected later this month.",
      "The FDA has long been a target for Kennedy, who last year vowed to \u201cclear out\u201d entire departments at the agency, including those overseeing nutrition. Kennedy recently called for a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d commission to review the safety of vaccines, antidepressants, stimulants and weight-loss drugs \u2014 all products regulated by the FDA \u2014 particularly in children.",
      "The approach has been lauded by most Republicans. But Senate Democrats are expected to push Makary on his willingness to break with Kennedy on key issues, including the safety and benefits of childhood vaccinations.",
      "FDA commissioners aren\u2019t typically involved in the agency\u2019s day-to-day scientific reviews, but they often serve as a buffer between FDA staff and political appointees elsewhere in government.",
      "For his part, Makary has been critical of the agency he would lead. While working as a Fox News contributor during COVID-19, he called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Despite such views, Makary is considered one of Trump\u2019s more conventional health nominees and is widely expected to be confirmed. Before the pandemic, Makary was mainly known for influential studies of medical errors, hospital costs and overprescribing of opioids.",
      "Headquartered in the suburbs outside Washington, the FDA oversees medical products plus billions of dollars in consumer goods, including most foods, cosmetics and vaping products.",
      "Makary would take over at a particularly turbulent period for the agency. Last month, the FDA abruptly fired hundreds of medical reviewers, researchers and inspectors, only to rehire some of them a week later. Several senior FDA officials have resigned or retired in recent months. The agency is also expected to lose more staffers to buyouts, further layoffs and return-to-office requirements.",
      "Among other issues facing the agency:",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An Australian man credited with saving 2.4 million babies through his record-breaking blood plasma donations over six decades, has died, his family said Tuesday. He was 88.",
      "James Harrison, a retired state railway department clerk, died in a nursing home on the central coast of New South Wales state on Feb. 17, according to his grandson, Jarrod Mellowship.",
      "Harrison\u2019s plasma contained a rare antibody, known as anti-D, which is used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman\u2019s immune system attacks her fetus\u2019 red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh negative blood type and her baby\u2019s is Rh positive.",
      "Australia has only 200 anti-D donors who help 45,000 mothers and their babies annually.",
      "Despite an aversion to needles, Harrison made 1,173 donations after he turned 18 in 1954 until he was forced to retire in 2018, aged 81.",
      "\u201cHe did it for the right reasons. As humble as he was, he did like the attention. But he would never do it for the attention,\u201d Mellowship said, adding his grandfather had been surprised to be recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005 as the person who had donated the most blood plasma in the world.",
      "The record was beaten in 2022 by American Brett Cooper from Walker, Michigan.",
      "The Australian Red Cross Blood Service said Harrison was renowned as the \u201cMan with the Golden Arm.\u201d",
      "He was credited with saving the lives of 2.4 million babies through his plasma donations, the national agency responsible for collecting and distributing blood products, also known as Lifeblood, said in a statement.",

      "Fathers shushed babbling toddlers as their wives snuck out to change infants' diapers.",
      "A little girl in this mostly Mennonite congregation was among those who\u2019d fallen ill with the highly contagious respiratory disease, senior pastor David Klassen said \u2014 but she\u2019s doing fine, and she happily played through her quarantine. He heard that at least two Mennonite schools shut down for a bit to disinfect.",
      "What he hasn\u2019t heard: Any direct outreach from public health officials on what to do as the number of those sickened with measles has grown to 146 and a school-age child has died. And though Klassen is a trusted church and community leader, his congregants haven\u2019t asked about whether they should vaccinate their kids \u2014 and he wouldn\u2019t want to weigh in.",
      "\u201cWith this measles situation, I can honestly just tell you we haven\u2019t taken any steps as a church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did leave it up to the mothers.\u201d",
      "As measles \u2014 a preventable disease the U.S. considered eliminated in 2000 \u2014 spreads through West Texas\u2019 rural expanse, Klassen is sticking to an approach on vaccines that is a key tenet for Mennonites. Family leaders are the top decision-making authority \u2014 not outside recommendations, certainly not government mandates.",
      "Alongside measles in this region, where voters overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump, there\u2019s another outbreak: one of misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials and fear of governmental authority overruling family autonomy. And on the national stage, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the country\u2019s top health official and an anti-vaccine activist, dismissed the Texas outbreak as \u201cnot unusual.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I trust all the vaccines? No,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cAnd I get from (Kennedy) that he doesn\u2019t trust all the vaccines, either. And he is very well educated in that; I\u2019m not.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece for Fox News Digital, Kennedy wrote about the value of the vaccine but stopped short of calling on families to get it, saying the decision is \u201ca personal one.\u201d He urged parents to speak to their health care providers about options.",
      "Vaccine skepticism has also been spurred by state lawmakers who this year filed more than a dozen bills that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions, which Texas already allows for \u201creasons of conscience, including a religious belief.\u201d",
      "At hospitals in Lubbock, 80 miles to the north and on the front lines of the outbreak, babies with measles are struggling to breathe.",
      "Dr. Summer Davies, a Texas Tech Physicians pediatrician, said she has treated about 10 of the outbreak\u2019s patients, most very young or teens. She said children have had to be intubated, including one younger than 6 months old. Others come in with such high fevers or severe sore throats that they refuse to eat or drink to the point of dehydration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard as a pediatrician, knowing that we have a way to prevent this and prevent kids from suffering and even death,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do agree that the herd immunity that we have established in the past isn\u2019t the same now. And I think kids are suffering because of that.\u201d",
      "In Lubbock County, 92% of kindergarteners are up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella shots, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That\u2019s lower than the 95% threshold experts say is needed to prevent measles from spreading. Gaines County, which includes Seminole, has an 82% MMR vaccination rate, though rates for homeschooled or private school students may be much lower. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Many Mennonite families don\u2019t send children to public schools.",
      "All of the children admitted with measles to Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock were unvaccinated, officials said last week. Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer, told The Associated Press that Covenant has seen more than 20 patients, including children, teens and pregnant mothers, since the outbreak began in late January.",
      "News of a measles case in Seminole, population 7,200, put doctors on a \u201cshared high alert,\u201d said Dr. Martin Ortega, a family physician for Texas Tech Physicians in Odessa, about an hour away. The small towns of West Texas may look completely isolated on a map, with little between them beyond oil and gas facilities and sprawling desert. But the region is connected by its people, who regularly travel long distances to grocery stores, hospitals and houses of worship.",
      "Many doctors are seeing measles cases for the first time in their careers. In Lea County, New Mexico, 30 minutes west of Seminole, nine measles cases with no clear connection to the Texas outbreak, rattled doctors and parents. An unvaccinated infant in Austin also tested positive for measles after an overseas vacation.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca little bit surreal,\u201d said Dr. Rumbidzai Mutikani, a pediatrician at Nor-Lea Hospital District\u2019s Hobbs Medical Clinic. Parents were so concerned \u201cour phones were just ringing,\u201d Mutikani said.",
      "Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock\u2019s public health department, said West Texas' rural landscape is a major challenge, not just in getting to patients and transporting test samples, but also in getting the word out.",
      "A lot of the messaging is word of mouth, she said, but they are working on public-service announcements featuring trusted Gaines County residents, putting up billboards about measles, handing out flyers and posting in WhatsApp groups.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic caused \u201ca lot of distrust in public health\u201d and government requirements, Wells said. On Facebook, people have accused her of making up the measles outbreak. They hope her department loses its funding.",
      "It\u2019s \u201creally hurtful stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really working to help encourage vaccines for our community and help those kids that are infected to make sure they get medical treatment so that we don\u2019t end up with another death.\u201d",
      "The reality on the ground can be nuanced, however.",
      "Brownfield Mayor Eric Horton is pro-Trump, he said, but also pro-MMR vaccine.",
      "His county was hard-hit by COVID-19, Horton said, with nearly 90 deaths. So when measles cases came to his town of 8,600, Horton feared for his community. He said the local hospital has been busy administering vaccines since the outbreak started.",
      "\u201cOut here on the south plains of Texas, we are conservative people, but we also are not anti-vaxxers,\u201d he said.",
      "Across the region, people echoed this sentiment about routine childhood vaccinations in interviews with the AP and The Texas Tribune. Often, though, they are less supportive of COVID-19 and flu shots.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that (Mennonites) don\u2019t vaccinate, and they put other people\u2019s families and children at exposure for it,\u201d said Stephen Spruill, a 36-year-old trucker from Seminole.",
      "But \"this is America. People have the right to choose.\u201d",
      "Macey Lane, 31, of Hobbs, said: \u201cI do support Donald Trump. I don\u2019t support not requiring vaccines.\u201d\u201c",
      "All of Lane\u2019s kids are vaccinated. Praising Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s vote against Kennedy\u2019s nomination, she said the fact that \u201cthe only Republican that went against RFK was a polio survivor says a lot.\u201d But she said she voted off other issues: her religious beliefs, stance on abortion and who would be best for the region\u2019s oil and gas industry.",
      "\u201cAs far as RFK being an anti-vaxxer, this is the most important thing: People have to make a decision for themselves and be as informed as they possibly can,\u201d Horton said.",
      "But in doctors' offices throughout the region, pediatricians see the consequences of that stance.",
      "Mutikani, the Hobbs pediatrician, said she\u2019s seen vaccine hesitancy increase in recent years as parents come to her with worries that line up with what\u2019s trending on social media. \u201cVirulent\u201d misinformation is especially worrisome in rural areas with few news sources or where many people who don\u2019t regularly see doctors live, she said.",
      "And having \u201cthese really big, respected public figures openly going against the grain, going against research and what we know, it makes it really, really difficult,\u201d she said.",
      "Most Texans are still vaccinating their kids, including Jennifer Sanchez, a 26-year-old Odessa resident. She took her 6-year-old and 1-year-old to the local public health department last week to get the measles vaccine.",
      "She is disinfecting her house out of an abundance of caution, wishing she had more information on how to stop the spread.",
      "\u201cThe government needs to give us more tools so we can protect ourselves,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life",
      "NEW YORK -- It took five years for Crystal Burke to put a name to the symptoms that haunted her.",
      "Heart palpitations. Insomnia so severe she slept only two to four hours a night. A newfound struggle to make decisions in her job as a nurse. Confusion when dealing with statistics, which she used to handle with ease.",
      "\u201cIt affected my work, it affected my relationships, it affected everything,\" Burke said. \"I felt lost. I didn\u2019t talk to anybody about it.\u201d",
      "Then Burke saw an advertisement about a face cream which contained estrogen, one of the two hormones ovaries produce less and less of with aging. She began talking with friends about her symptoms. And she connected the dots: menopause.",
      "At just 38, Burke had thought she was too young to be going through the life stage when menstrual periods stop and women no longer can become pregnant. But menopause is more than the pop culture stereotype featuring women in their 50s having hot flashes. Symptoms can start much earlier \u2014 during perimenopause, the time leading up to menopause \u2014 and go well beyond hot flashes.",
      "The many manifestations include insomnia, migraines, brain fog, loss of concentration, memory problems, mood swings, depression, anxiety, heart palpitations, hair loss and weight gain. If that wasn\u2019t enough, some people experience heavy, painful periods or recurring urinary tract infections.",
      "Chronic insomnia can make it difficult to concentrate. Brain fog leaves the afflicted struggling to find words during meetings. But social stigma and a lack of information have left menopausal people dealing alone with severe symptoms that may impact their work. Many stay silent, fearing they\u2019ll be viewed as underperformers or weak.",
      "Some women in senior leadership positions leave their jobs or reduce their hours as a result of debilitating side effects from menopause, said Lauren Redfern, executive director of Hormonally, a nonprofit that provides workplace training and education about women\u2019s health. But those who feel supported by employers during the transition are more likely to remain at work, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you open up a space to talk about these things, people are desperate to have a conversation,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cThe symptoms are so diverse and so far-reaching and so prolific they impact every area of someone\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life. Yet due to the epidemic of silence around it, women, nonbinary people and transgender individuals often don't recognize the onset of unpleasant physical and emotional changes as side effects of declining hormone levels.",
      "Finding health care providers who are trained to identify and treat their symptoms can be challenging. Some startups have sought to change that by providing access to referrals or telehealth appointments with doctors or therapists who specialize in treating menopausal patients.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know that something can get fixed, it\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Midi Health founder Joanna Strober, whose company connects women with professionals who understand menopause. \u201dIf you think, \u2018For the rest of my life I\u2019m going to have brain fog and not remember anyone\u2019s name, and I\u2019m going to keep losing my car in the parking lot and I\u2019m going to keep gaining weight,\u2019 then it\u2019s very demoralizing.\u201d",
      "Burke found relief when she began hormone replacement therapy. Inspired to help others, she co-founded The Menopause Clinic in Louisiana to offer telehealth services focused on menopause.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing is for women to know what perimenopause is, what menopause is, and that there are options,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThe suffering isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d",
      "Hormone replacement therapy is not an option for those with certain medical histories, and some doctors are unwilling to prescribe it. Some experts recommend acupuncture, dietary changes and exercise to help manage symptoms.",
      "The Mayo Clinic estimates that menopause symptoms lead to $1.8 billion in lost work time per year in the U.S. About 5% of employers offer menopause benefits or accommodations such as the ability to work from home or a cool room, according to benefit consulting company NFP.",
      "Here are some steps you or your employer can take to make the workplace more hospitable for people experiencing menopause.",
      "Finding supportive colleagues can help bridge knowledge gaps. If your organization doesn't have a menopause support group, you can start one. Once established, the group or human resources department can bring in facilitators to teach the entire workforce \u2014 not just women \u2014 about menopause.",
      "Sarah Daniels, a communications manager, started a support group called \u201cMenopause Matters\u201d at Arriva Group, a U.K.-based public transportation company. The male-dominated company already had a gender inclusion group, so Daniels joined and organized the menopause group as an offshoot.",
      "The group's monthly meetings are held online during business hours. Participants swap notes on supplements, teas, treatments and beauty products. Daniels believes the group improves productivity because it gives members a sense of belonging within the organization.",
      "\u201cI know how lonely it is when you are going through these things, because you think, \u2018Is this just happening to me?'\" she said. \u201cI had a UTI (urinary tract infection) that was so severe that I fainted on a train. My periods were so heavy that I couldn\u2019t leave the house.\u201d",
      "Arriva has a policy that says bosses must listen to and make reasonable adjustments for employees struggling with menopause. That could mean more restroom breaks, uniform adaptations to help with hot flashes or flexible working hours, Daniels said.",
      "People working for employers who do not subsidize menopause-related care and programs can model requests for similar benefits after the small percentage of companies that do.",
      "When Shevonya Noble joined biotechnology firm Genentech as a principal quality and compliance leader, she was connected with a care advocate who helped her find a nutritionist, wellness coach, career coach, mental health provider and physical support coach to address her menopause symptoms.",
      "Appointment costs were covered through a benefit provided by Maven, which partners with employers and health plans to deliver care targeted to women. Genentech\u2019s benefits also include menopause-specific classes and support groups.",
      "At a former employer, Noble felt she had to hide the hot flashes that interrupted her sleep and disrupted her concentration while giving presentations because she didn't see anyone else furiously fanning themselves at their desks.",
      "\u201cThe conversation about menopause needs to be broadened to include men, not just men in our lives but in the workplace as well,\u201d Noble said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we not shy away from the topic but include it in our conversations and to just take the mystique away from what goes on with women at this stage in life.\u201d",
      "Speaking up about symptoms also may help. When women experience hot flashes and brain fog at work, they\u2019re often seen as less competent, but if they say, \u201cIt\u2019s menopausal, I\u2019m getting treated for it,\u2019\u201d the discrimination goes away and they\u2019re seen as powerful leaders again, according to Midi founder Strober.",
      "\u201cYou have to call it out. You have to say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a hot flash,\u2019 not just look sweaty in a meeting, because then they just discount you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you call it out, you can take your power back.\u201d",

      "A bucktoothed llama that spends his days comforting chronically ill children at a North Carolina camp founded by NASCAR royalty has been crowned the world\u2019s oldest llama in captivity.",
      "At 27 years and more than 250 days, the selfie- and snuggle-loving llama called Whitetop dethroned Dalai Llama, the Guinness World Records announced last week. Dalai lived on a ranch in Albuquerque and was announced as the oldest in 2023 shortly after his 27th birthday.",
      "Whitetop was donated to the Victory Junction camp in 2006, just two years after race car driver Kyle Petty \u2014 the son of NASCAR great Richard Petty \u2014 and his family founded the camp in honor of Petty's own son, Adam, who was 19 when he was killed in a 2000 crash while practicing for a race.",
      "The year-round free camp sits on 84 acres (34 hectares) in the Petty hometown of Randleman, North Carolina, about 75 miles (121 kilometers) west of Raleigh. It\u2019s designed for children with conditions that include cancer, kidney and heart disease, cerebral palsy, Spina Bifida and an array of neurological and physical disabilities.",
      "Whitetop has become known for his relaxed, sweet and empathetic personality. His go-to move is to lie still while campers pet him, which can comfort children and give them important sensory input, said Billie Davis, the camp's barn director.",
      "\u201cHe really gets to help campers come out of their shell when they interact with him,\" she said. \"He can be kind of intimidating at first, but once they come over to him and love on him and pet on him, they just realize how sweet he is.\u201d",
      "One of his best friends is a miniature highland cow named Gus-Gus, who tends to forget Whitetop is a llama and enjoys jumping on him. Whitetop also likes to roll in fresh wood chippings, chomp on soaked alfalfa and pose for selfies.",
      "\u201cIf you try to take a picture of him from the side, he\u2019s not into it,\" Davis said. \"He will, like scoot in there and try to get his face from a side profile so that it\u2019s like he\u2019s cheesing.\u201d",
      "Davis attributes Whitetop's long life to great veterinary care and exercise, as well as it simply loving his job.",
      "The average life span for a llama is 15 years, according to the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance.",
      "Whitetop has developed arthritis in his twilight years but otherwise is very healthy, said Davis. And the only times the llama becomes upset is when Gus-Gus, along with two miniature donkeys named Jed and Jethro, leave him alone.",
      "Stephanie Wilkerson, 33, first went to the camp\u2019s family weekend in 2006 after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She said she was initially a little nervous around Whitetop but soon realized petting him and giving him hugs made her feel better.",
      "\u201cWhen I started stroking him more and more and more, I got more relaxed,\" said Wilkerson, who lives in Thomasville, North Carolina.",
      "With Whitetop\u2019s newfound fame in longevity, the camp has started selling limited edition T-shirts displaying Whitetop with sunglasses and the words, \u201cStill Spit\u2019n.\u201d The proceeds go to the camp.",
      "Although Davis said Whitetop would like people to know not all llamas spit on you.",
      "\u201cTypically llamas only spit when they are scared, uncomfortable or territorial over something,\" she said. \"And he just loves his job so much that he doesn\u2019t do it.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A health economist who famously clashed with officials at the National Institutes of Health faces Senate questioning Wednesday on his nomination to head that agency.",
      "Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University professor, was an outspoken critic of the government\u2019s COVID-19 shutdowns and vaccine policies. Now he\u2019s poised to become director of the NIH, long called the government\u2019s crown jewel, as it faces mass firings and drastic funding cutbacks.",
      "He \u201chas a vision to restore faith in medical research for the American people,\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who chairs the Senate health committee considering the nomination, wrote on X after meeting with Bhattacharya last month.",
      "But he faces scrutiny from Democrats furious that turmoil at the nation\u2019s largest funder of medical research threatens the development of cures and new treatments.",
      "\u201cIt is incredibly important that we have a leader at NIH who will stand up for the agency\u2019s role as a world leader in lifesaving research,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state.",
      "Until recently, the $48 billion NIH had strong bipartisan support. NIH scientists conduct cutting-edge research at its 27 institutes specializing in diseases including cancer, chronic illnesses such as heart, lung and kidney disease, aging and Alzheimer\u2019s. Most of the agency\u2019s budget is dispersed to universities, hospitals and other research groups through highly competitive grants to conduct everything from basic research to clinical trials.",
      "NIH-funded research has played a part in the development of most treatments approved in the U.S. in recent years.",
      "Bhattacharya gained public attention as one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm and argued that people at low risk of COVID-19 should live normally while building up immunity through infection.",
      "At the time -- before vaccinations had begun \u2013 that view was embraced by some in the first Trump administration but was widely denounced by infectious disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "Bhattacharya became a plaintiff in a Supreme Court case, Murthy v. Missouri, arguing he was \u201cunfairly censored\u201d on social media as part of government efforts to combat misinformation. While the case gained national attention, it was ultimately unsuccessful in a 6-3 ruling.",

      "Wednesday's 22-9 vote by the state Senate followed a 45-16 vote by the House on Tuesday to override. In vetoing the bill Monday, Republican Gov. Mark Gordon questioned whether it was reasonable and necessary, especially for victims of rape and incest.",
      "Lawmakers cited concerns about women's well-being Wednesday in voting to override, and they cleared the two-thirds majority requirement.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very concerned about the psychological effects of this procedure,\u201d Republican Sen. Darin Smith of Cheyenne said of the governor, \u201cbut what about the psychological effects of having an abortion, for the rest of your life?\u201d",
      "The new requirement, which takes effect right away, was criticized by abortion rights advocates.",
      "\u201cWe are saddened so many legislators lack empathy and respect for women\u2019s decision-making authority, but we stand ready to fight this unconstitutional, unnecessary and unreasonable bill in court,\u201d Christine Lichtenfels, executive director of the Wyoming abortion access advocacy group Chelsea\u2019s Fund, said in a statement.",

      "Existing state law already requires abortion providers to offer an ultrasound to women getting abortions.",

      "",
      "Taken together, experts have raised concerns about a possible misinterpretation of Kennedy's message: that because vitamin A is available, they don't need to be vaccinated.",
      "",
      "\"Vitamin A is absolutely not a substitute nor an equivalent for MMR vaccination, which is the best way to prevent a child from getting measles,\" Ericka Hayes, MD, of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told MedPage Today.",
      "",
      "Indeed, the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is \"one of the most effective and durable vaccines that we have,\" she said, with the full two-dose series being 97% effective against measles.",
      "",
      "\"I think some people are thinking, 'Oh, well, then, if I, for example, take vitamin A, I won't get measles, or I'm less likely to get measles,'\" Hayes said. \"And that is absolutely not the case.\"",
      "",
      "Much of the literature about vitamin A and measles comes from lower- and middle-income countries, where deficiency may pose more of a problem. However, given that vitamin A deficiency can put kids at risk of worse outcomes with measles  --  and most kids aren't assessed for vitamin A levels  --  U.S. expert consensus has settled on administering the vitamin in all cases.",
      "",
      "Tina Tan, MD, of Northwestern University, who is president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said vitamin A \"really plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system and supports the function of immune cells so the body can fight off infections like measles.\"",
      "",
      "However, taking vitamin A won't prevent a child from getting measles in the first place, Hayes said, and it can have \"significant toxicities,\" especially when taken in high doses. \"And just because you're taking vitamin A or have a good vitamin A level doesn't guarantee that you will not have a ... severe case of measles,\" she added.",
      "",
      "The AAP Red Book  --  an encyclopedia of pediatric infectious diseases  --  noted that U.S. experts concur with WHO recommendations on giving vitamin A to all children with measles, and recommends giving it once a day for 2 days at the following doses:",
      "50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months",
      "50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months",
      "",
      "\"Again, if a child has measles, that vitamin A should be prescribed under the supervision of the physician to make sure that it is dosed appropriately,\" Hayes said.",
      "",
      "Still, both Hayes and Tan emphasized that vaccination is the only way to stop more measles outbreaks like the current one in west Texas, where 159 cases have been identified since late January, with 22 hospitalizations and one death  --  the first measles death in the U.S. since 2015.",
      "",
      "Tan said that the \"number of unvaccinated individuals is growing, and that basically increases the risk for spread of measles, because measles is one of the most contagious viruses.\"",
      "",
      "\"If we cannot get our vaccination rates up to where they were, we're going to continue to see these outbreaks,\" she added, and that could mean more deaths, as it's estimated that one to three children in 1,000 with measles will die.",

      "Measles can also cause complications after the initial illness has passed, including subacute sclerosing panencephalitis  --  a rare, though fatal, neurologic disease  --  and immunodeficiency, Hayes said.",

      "\"I always find measles extremely concerning because it is so contagious,\" Hayes said. There are \"so many individuals in this country who are not immune,\" such as infants under 1 year of age, who cannot be vaccinated yet, and individuals who are immunocompromised, she added.

      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if it was needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences.",
      "Yet a little more than a month after taking over the White House, Trump's decision to abandon the legal fight signals how the Republican administration plans on interpreting federal law designed to protect urgent care when up against states' abortion bans.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. The ruling came down while President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was in office, but many of the justices who helped reverse Roe v. Wade were appointed under Trump.",
      "So in response, Biden warned that his administration considered abortion part of the stabilizing care that federal law requires facilities to provide to patients who show up at an emergency room. A month later, Biden sued Idaho, which had enacted an abortion ban that makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion.",
      "The Biden administration argued that Idaho\u2019s abortion ban prevented ER doctors from offering an abortion if a woman needs one in a medical emergency. But Idaho\u2019s attorney general has pointed out that federal law also requires hospitals to consider the health of the \u201cunborn child\u201d in its treatment, too.",
      "The lawsuit has twisted and turned in the legal system ever since. Last year, the Supreme Court agreed to step into the Idaho case, but it handed down a narrow ruling: Hospitals were allowed to make determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations, but the key legal question about what care hospitals should legally provide remains unresolved.",
      "Known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, the 1986 law requires emergency rooms to offer a medical exam if you turn up at their facility. The law applies to any ERs that accept Medicare funding \u2014 so nearly all of them.",
      "Those ERs are also required to stabilize patients experiencing a medical emergency before discharging or transferring them. Notably, if the ER doesn't have the resources or staff to treat a patient, medical staffers must arrange a medical transfer to another hospital \u2014 they can't simply direct a patient to go elsewhere.",
      "EMTALA is more scrutinized than ever since Roe was overturned. Multiple doctors and families have told The Associated Press about pregnant women with dangerous medical conditions showing up in hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices only to be denied the abortions that could help treat them. Some women described facing harmful delays.",
      "Not yet. And the DOJ's three-page motion didn't explain why they wanted to abandon the lawsuit either. However, since having a hand in revoking the constitutional right to abortion, Trump has repeatedly touted his support of leaving abortion regulations up to the states.",
      "Meanwhile, ending the effort to use federal law to protect emergency abortions was a goal of Project 2025, the blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, which calls for reversing what it describes as \u201cdistorted pro-abortion\u201d interpretations of federal law. Trump insisted during his 2024 presidential campaign that Project 2025 was not part of his agenda.",
      "\u201cTheir move to drop this case against Idaho I think really shows what their true priorities are \u2014 and it is to push an anti-abortion political agenda rather than support the lives, health and well being of pregnant women and people, not just in Idaho but across the country because this case does have far-reaching impact,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers.",
      "Trump's decision to drop the Idaho case comes several months after the Supreme Court said the federal government couldn't require hospitals to provide pregnancy terminations when it would violate Texas' abortion ban.",
      "Texas had sued over the Biden administration's enforcement of EMTALA, and a lower federal court eventually sided with the state. But similar to the case in Idaho, the Supreme Court stopped short of deciding whether the federal law can supersede a state's abortion ban.",
      "Meanwhile, concern has grown over whether Trump's decision in the Idaho case is a sign that his administration may also reverse course in a longstanding legal battle over telehealth access to mifepristone, the medication used in the nation's most common abortion method.",
      "The Department of Justice under Biden had sought to dismiss a complaint brought by a handful states seeking to roll back access to mifepristone. It's currently unclear how Trump plans on proceeding."

      "Yet \u201call the people out there who have, you know, sick parents, sick children, this is going to impact,\u201d said neuroscientist Richard Huganir of Johns Hopkins University.",

      "Among the biggest blows, if it survives a court challenge: Massive cuts in funding from the National Institutes of Health that would cost jobs in every state, according to an analysis by The Associated Press with assistance from the nonprofit United for Medical Research.",
      "That\u2019s on top of mass firings of government workers, NIH delays in issuing grants and uncertainty about how many already funded studies are being canceled under the president's anti-diversity executive orders.",
      "Earlier this week, lawmakers pressured Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the nominee to become NIH director, about the turmoil. Bhattacharya said if confirmed, he'd look into it to ensure scientists employed by and funded by the agency \u201chave resources to do the lifesaving work they do.\u201d",
      "Patients who live in rural counties are 10% more likely to die of their cancer than those living in metropolitan areas, said Neli Ulrich of the University of Utah\u2019s Huntsman Cancer Institute.",
      "A third of patients travel more than 150 miles for care at the Salt Lake City cancer center. But for patients even further away \u2014 in Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Wyoming \u2014 because it\u2019s also the regional hub for NIH-funded studies of new treatments.",
      "So Ulrich\u2019s center helps train local doctors to do at least some of the blood tests and other steps of clinical trials that let faraway patients participate without traveling \u2014 a program threatened if her university loses tens of millions in NIH cuts.",
      "The issue: Most of the NIH\u2019s budget \u2014 more than $35 billion a year \u2014 goes to universities, hospitals and other research groups. The grants are divided into \u201cdirect costs\u201d \u2014 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and a project\u2019s supplies \u2014 and \u201cindirect costs,\u201d to reimburse other expenses supporting the work such as electricity, maintenance and janitorial staff, and safety and ethics oversight.",
      "NIH directly negotiates with research groups, a process that grants managers say requires receipts and audits, to set rates for those indirect expenses that can reach 50% or more. But the Trump administration now plans to cap those rates at 15%. The administration estimates it would save the government $4 billion a year but scientists say it really means they'll have to stop some lifesaving work.",
      "They are \u201creal expenses, that\u2019s the critical point \u2013 they are not fluff,\u201d said Ulrich. Using separate cancer center funds to cover those costs would threaten other \u201cactivities that are really important to us in serving our communities across the mountain West.\u201d",
      "A federal judge has blocked the move but until the court fight is done researchers aren\u2019t sure what they can continue to afford.",
      "NIH grants divided between researchers in every state in 2023 supported more than 412,000 jobs and $92 billion in new economic activity, according to a yearly report from United for Medical Research that often is cited as Congress sets the agency's budget.",
      "The AP tallied how much money would have been lost in each state under a 15% cap on those grants\u2019 indirect costs. Those lost dollars alone would have cost at least 58,000 jobs, concluded an analysis assisted by Inforum, a nonpartisan economic consulting firm that conducts UMR's economic impact reports.",
      "Consider Hopkins, which runs about 600 NIH-funded clinical trials plus other laboratory research and is Baltimore\u2019s largest private employer. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do science and we can\u2019t support the science, we can\u2019t support the surrounding community either,\u201d Huganir said.",
      "Huganir studies how the brain stores memory as people learn when he discovered a gene that, when mutated, causes certain intellectual disabilities.",

      "Conservation efforts have paid off, and in recent years, the species climbed down a notch on the IUCN\u2019s Red List of threatened species to \u201cendangered.\u201d About a year ago improved one step further, to \u201cvulnerable.\u201d",
      "Usually contacted by members of the public who find an animal in distress, MOm specialists tend to adult seals on location where possible, and transport young seals to the organization's rehabilitation center housed in the grounds of Athens zoo, on the outskirts of the Greek capital.",
      "There, the young mammals are looked after by veterinarians, fed a special diet to provide them with the best nutrition and hone their swimming skills in a pool.",
      "Their carers give them names \u2014 often after the people who found them \u2014 but make sure contact with humans is kept to a minimum to prepare the animals for their return into the wild.",
      "The young seals typically stay in the rehab center for several months, until they've put on enough weight and their natural hunting instinct kicks in, allowing them to fend for themselves. They are then tagged so they can be tracked, and re-introduced into the wild.",
      "MOm, the only center of its kind in the region, has cared for about 40 seals from far and wide, both on location and in its facilities, Dendrinos said.",
      "\u201cThis year, we had a really pleasant surprise,\u201d he said. A female seal that had been treated and released four years ago was spotted nursing a pup.",
      "Panagis was found in Cyprus, near where the body of his mother had been found a few days earlier. Alerted by locals, the organization arranged for the seal to be flown to Athens.",
      "\u201cTransportation is carried out with whatever is available,\u201d said veterinary assistant Nikitas Vogiatzis, shortly after feeding Panagis. \u201cEither by plane, or by boat, or even by taxi. \"Konstantina came in a taxi, Panagis by plane, Renos came on a boat,\u201d he said, listing MOm\u2019s most recent wards.",
      "Weighing just under 15 kilograms (33 pounds) when he arrived, the now 3-month-old seal has reached over 40 kilograms (88 pounds). Panagis is nearly ready for his return trip home, which MOm experts hope will happen in May.",
      "Renos \u2014 short for Renos-Pantelis \u2014 was found in November in the small Aegean island of Anafi by a nurse and a military conscript whom he was named after.",
      "The seal pup was shipped to MOm\u2019s facility. He got medical treatment and was put on a special diet until he was old enough to move on to solid fish \u2014 the mackerel that Panagis is so fond of.",
      "He recovered and on a cold, sunny February day, it was his turn to head back into the wild. MOm personnel loaded him into a crate and whisked him by speedboat to the uninhabited islet of Gyaros, the closest marine protected area to Athens.",
      "The release location is chosen \u201cbased on there being enough food, and there being no disturbance by people, which is very important,\u201d said Vogiatzis, the veterinary assistant.",
      "The crate is placed near the water, he said. Then, \"you open the door, you say a prayer and you say: \u2018So long\u2019.\u201d",
      "Renos\u2019 crate was deposited on a beach and the door opened. The young seal sniffed the air timidly, and waited. Slowly, he inched his way out of the crate, then picked up speed as he belly-hauled his way down the beach, splashed into the sea and was gone.",

      "Israel has cut off the electricity supply to Gaza",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, officials said Sunday, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory. Hamas called it part of Israel's \u201cstarvation policy.\"",
      "Israel last week suspended supplies of goods to the territory of more than 2 million Palestinians, an echo of the siege it imposed in the earliest days of the war.",
      "Israel is pressing the militant group to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire. That phase ended last weekend. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce.",
      "Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire\u2019s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.",
      "The militant group \u2014 which has warned that discontinuing supplies would affect the hostages \u2014 said Sunday that it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position.",
      "Israel has said it would send a delegation to Qatar on Monday in an effort to \u201cadvance\u201d the negotiations.",
      "Israel had warned when it stopped all supplies that water and electricity could be next. The letter from Israel's energy minister to the Israel Electric Corporation tells it to stop selling power to Gaza.",
      "The territory and its infrastructure have been largely devastated, and most facilities, including hospitals, now use generators. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassam said that Israel has \u201dpractically\u201d cut off electricity since the war began and called the latest decision part of Israel's \u201cstarvation policy, in clear disregard for all international laws and norms.\"",
      "The desalination plant was providing 18,000 cubic meters of water per day for central Gaza\u2019s Deir al-Balah area, according to Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians\u2019 right to freedom of movement. Executive director Tania Hary said that it's expected to run on generators and produce around 2,500 cubic meters per day, about the amount in an Olympic swimming pool.",
      "Israel\u2019s restrictions on fuel entering Gaza have a larger impact, Hary said, and water shortages are a looming issue, because fuel is needed for distribution trucks.",
      "Israel has faced sharp criticism over suspending supplies.",
      "\u201cAny denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,\u201d the U.N. human rights office said Friday.",
      "The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d when it issued an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. The allegation is central to South Africa\u2019s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide.",
      "Israel has denied the accusations, saying it has allowed in enough aid and blaming shortages on what it called the United Nations' inability to distribute it. It also accused Hamas of siphoning off aid.",
      "The leader of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels off Yemen would resume within four days if aid doesn't resume to Gaza. The Houthis described their earlier attacks as solidarity with Palestinians there.",
      "The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies.",
      "The White House on Wednesday made the surprise confirmation of direct U.S. talks with Hamas.",
      "On Sunday, envoy Adam Boehler told Israeli broadcaster Kan that Hamas has suggested a truce of five to 10 years while it would disarm. The militant group has previously called disarming unacceptable.",
      "A senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss contacts with the U.S., said that the group had expressed its longstanding position that it would lay down its arms in return for a \u201cfair and just solution\u201d that includes an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Boehler also told CNN that \u201cI think you could see something like a long-term truce, where we forgive prisoners, where Hamas lays down their arms, where they agree they\u2019re not part of the political party going forward. I think that\u2019s a reality. It\u2019s real close.\u201d",
      "When asked if he would speak with the militant group again, Boehler replied, \u201cYou never know.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cI think something could come together within weeks,\u201d and expressed hope for a deal that would see all hostages released, not only American ones. Boehler has said four of the five American hostages in Gaza are dead, with Edan Alexander alive.",
      "Hamas on Sunday didn't mention the talks, but reiterated its support for a proposal for the establishment of an independent committee of technocrats to run Gaza until Palestinians hold presidential and legislative elections.",
      "Hamas\u2019 attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements.",
      "Many Israelis are pressing for a deal to bring everyone home. \u201cWe are here to send a clear message to the Israeli government: stop stalling,\u201d Zahiro Shahar Mor, nephew of slain hostage Avraham Munder, said in front of tents set up outside Israel\u2019s defense ministry in one demonstration.",

      "Malaria season begins this month in a large part of Africa",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Malaria season begins this month in a large part of Africa. No disease is deadlier on the continent, especially for children. But the Trump administration's decision to terminate 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign aid contracts has local health officials warning of catastrophe in some of the world\u2019s poorest communities.",
      "Dr. Jimmy Opigo, who runs Uganda\u2019s malaria control program, told The Associated Press that USAID stop-work orders issued in late January left him and others \u201cfocusing on disaster preparedness.\u201d The U.S. is the top bilateral funder of anti-malaria efforts in Africa.",
      "Anti-malarial medicines and insecticide-treated bed nets to help control the mosquito-borne disease are \u201clike our groceries,\u201d Opigo said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be continuous supply.\u201d",
      "As those dwindle with the U.S.-terminated contracts, he expects a rise in cases later this year of severe malaria, which includes problems like organ failure. There is no cure. Vaccines being rolled out in parts of Africa are imperfect but are expected to largely continue with the support of a global vaccine alliance.",
      "The Washington-based Malaria No More says new modeling shows that just a year of disruption in the malaria-control supply chain would lead to nearly 15 million additional cases and 107,000 additional deaths globally. It has urged the Trump administration to \u201crestart these life-saving programs before outbreaks get out of hand.\u201d",
      "Africa's 1.5 billion people accounted for 95% of an estimated 597,000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2023, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "Health workers in the three African nations most burdened by malaria \u2014 Nigeria, Congo and Uganda \u2014 described a cascade of effects with the end of most U.S. government support.",
      "The U.S. has provided hundreds of millions of dollars every year to the three countries alone through the USAID-led President\u2019s Malaria Initiative.",
      "The U.S. funding has often been channeled through a web of non-governmental organizations, medical charities and faith-based organizations in projects that made malaria prevention and treatment more accessible, even free, especially for rural communities.",
      "Uganda in 2023 had 12.6 million malaria cases and nearly 16,000 deaths, many of them children under 5 and pregnant women, according to WHO.",
      "Opigo said the U.S. has been giving between $30 million and $35 million annually for malaria control. He didn't say which contracts have been terminated but noted that field research was also affected.",
      "Some of the USAID funding in Uganda paid for mosquito-spraying operations in remote areas. Those operations were supposed to begin in February ahead of the rainy season, when stagnant water becomes breeding ground for the wide-ranging anopheles mosquito. They have been suspended.",
      "\u201cWe have to spray the houses before the rains, when the mosquitoes come to multiply,\u201d Opigo said.",
      "Already, long lines of malaria patients can be seen outside clinics in many areas every year. Malaria accounts for 30% to 50% of outpatient visits to health facilities across the country, according to Uganda National Institute of Public Health.",
      "Nigeria records a quarter of the world's malaria cases. But authorities have reduced malaria-related deaths there by 55% since 2000 with the support of the U.S. and others.",
      "That support is part of the $600 million in health assistance the west African country received from the U.S. in 2023, according to U.S. Embassy figures. It was not immediately clear whether all of that funding has stopped.",
      "The President\u2019s Malaria Initiative has supported Nigeria\u2019s malaria response with nearly 164 million fast-acting medicines, 83 million insecticide-treated bed nets, over 100 million rapid diagnostic tests, 22 million preventive treatments in pregnancy and insecticide for 121,000 homes since 2011, the embassy says.",
      "In Congo, U.S government funding has contributed about $650 million towards malaria control since 2010.",
      "Now, some of the successes in fighting malaria in Congo are being threatened, which will complicate already difficult efforts to identify and track disease outbreaks across the vast country as supplies and expertise for malaria testing are affected.",
      "Worsening conflict in Congo's east, where some health workers have fled, has raised the risk of infection, with little backup coming.",
      "With the loss of substantial U.S. support, \u201ca lot of people are going to be affected. Some people are really poor and cannot afford (malaria treatment),\u201d said Dr. Yetunde Ayo-Oyalowo, a Nigerian who runs the Market Doctors nonprofit providing affordable local healthcare services.",
      "Up to 40% of her organization's clients are diagnosed with malaria, Ayo-Oyalowo said.",
      "There is hope among health workers in Africa that, even after the dismantling of USAID, some U.S. funding will continue flowing via other groups including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. But that group also received U.S. support and has not issued a public statement on the dramatic cuts in U.S. aid.",
      "Opigo in Uganda said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health might be sources of help.",

      "Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night.",
      "Francis was hospitalized Feb. 14 for what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future.",

      "COX\u2019S BAZAR, Bangladesh -- Rohingya refugees in crammed Bangladeshi camps say they are worried about a U.S. decision to cut food rations by half beginning next month, while a refugee official says the reduction will impact the nutrition of more than 1 million refugees and create \u201csocial and mental pressure.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump abruptly stopped most foreign aid and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has significantly hampered the global humanitarian sector. Trump's Jan. 20 executive order froze the funding for a 90-day review.",
      "The World Food Program, the main U.N. food agency, recently announced that cuts to food rations will take effect from April 1 in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, where dozens of camps are inhabited by Rohingya refugees.",
      "More than 700,000 Muslim Rohingya fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar starting in late August 2017 when Myanmar's military launched a \u201cclearance operation.\u201d The ethnic group faces discrimination and are denied citizenship and other rights in the Buddhist-majority nation. Following a miliary takeover in 2021, the country has been engulfed in an armed conflict widely seen as civil war.",
      "It was not immediately clear if the WFP's decision was directly related to the Trump administration's action.",
      "\u201cWe received a letter that (says) previously it was $12.50, and now it is $6. They used to get $12.50 per month, and from now $6, this will greatly affect them,\u201d Shamsud Douza, additional refugee relief and repatriation commissioner of Bangladesh, told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cAs the food is cut, they will get less nutritious food, which may lead to a lack of nutrition. There will be social and mental pressure created amongst the Rohingya people in their community. They will have to look for an alternative for the food,\u201d he said.",
      "Douza said there are more sectors where budgets have been cut beyond the food rations, but he would not say whether WFP cuts were related to the U.S. funding rollback.",
      "\u201cGenerally, there will be less (support) for the (Rohingya) response after the funding cuts. The response already has been slowed, and some people, including Rohingya, have lost their jobs, and some services are reduced. It does not bring a good result when the available services get reduced,\u201d he said.",

      "The U.S. has been the top donor to Bangladesh for Rohingya refugees, providing the U.N. with emergency food and nutrition assistance. The U.S. usually provides almost half of the aid money spent on the humanitarian response to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, which provided about $300 million in 2024.",
      "As the news of the impending food reductions spread through the camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, fear and frustration gripped the refugees.",
      "\u201cI am afraid now about how I am going to run my family, as we don\u2019t have any income-generating opportunities here. I got scared when I heard it,\u201d 40-year-old Manzur Ahmed said. \u201cHow will I buy rice, chilies, salt, sugar and dal, let alone fish, meat and vegetables, with 700 taka ($6)? We won\u2019t even be able to buy (cooking) oil. How are we going to get them?\"",
      "Medical treatment also is decreasing, refugees said.",
      "\u201cWhen we go to the hospital, they don\u2019t provide medicines unless it\u2019s an emergency. They only provide medicines to the very emergency patients.

      "Hundreds of thousands have lived in Bangladesh for decades and about 70,000 crossed the border from Myanmar in 2024.

      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Chaos broke out in Romania's capital Sunday evening as incensed supporters of the far-right populist Calin Georgescu protested the electoral body's decision to reject his candidacy in a presidential election redo. He won the first round of last year\u2019s race before a top court annulled the election.",
      "The 62-year-old Georgescu filed his candidacy on Friday in the capital, Bucharest. The Central Election Bureau, also known by its Romanian acronym BEC, had 48 hours to register or reject it.",
      "In its decision, the BEC cited the country's Constitutional Court ruling last year to cancel the election, arguing it was ordered due to \"the candidate\u2019s failure to comply with electoral regulations.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would be unacceptable for the restarted election process to consider the same individual as eligible for the presidency,\u201d BEC said. The decision can be appealed before the Constitutional Court within 24 hours.",

      "The BEC's rejection of Georgescu's candidacy came after the Constitutional Court annulled the first-round results two days before the Dec. 8 runoff, after allegations emerged that Russia had run a coordinated online campaign to promote the outsider, who ran as an independent.",
      "The court's unprecedented decision plunged the European Union and NATO member country into a protracted political crisis.",
      "Last month, prosecutors launched a criminal investigation against Georgescu, accusing him of \u201cincitement to actions against the constitutional order,\u201d supporting fascist groups and false declarations of electoral campaign funding and asset disclosures.",
      "Before the Nov. 24 election, Georgescu, who is under judicial control and has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, had polled in single digits and declared zero campaign spending. Allegations quickly emerged of electoral violations and Russian interference. Moscow denied that it had meddled in the election.",
      "Georgescu has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and questioned Ukraine\u2019s statehood, but says that he's not pro-Russia.",
      "The first round of the rerun is scheduled for May 4. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the ballots, a runoff will follow on May 18. The deadline for presidential candidacy applications is March 15 at midnight.",
      "George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, who had backed Georgescu\u2019s bid, reacted to the BEC\u2019s decision on Sunday by calling it \u201ca new abuse and a continuation of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d",
      "\u201cDown with Ciolacu, down with the dictators!\u201d he said in a post on Facebook, referring to Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu.",
      "Since Romania canceled the election, Georgescu has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among the far right, with support coming from prominent figures such as U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk, who have both strongly criticized Romania for annulling the vote.",
      "Musk reacted to the BEC decision in a repost of the news on X, saying: \u201cThis is crazy!\u201d",
      "Incumbent Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan also filed his candidacy on Friday as an independent under the campaign slogan \u201cHonest Romania.\u201d The BEC registered his candidacy on Sunday.",
      "Crin Antonescu, the joint presidential candidate backed by Romania\u2019s governing coalition \u2014 comprised of the Social Democratic Party, the National Liberal Party, and the small ethnic Hungarian UDMR party \u2014 also registered his presidential bid on Sunday."

      "The Norse explorer Erik the Red arrives in Greenland with a fleet of Viking ships, according to the medieval Icelandic sagas. The Norsemen established two settlements that had a peak population of 2,500-5,000 but disappeared around 1450 for unknown reasons.",

      "Lutheran missionary Hans Egede arrives in Greenland to search for the lost Norse settlements. Finding no survivors, he builds a new settlement at Kangeq, near modern day Nuuk, Greenland\u2019s capital, and begins efforts to convert the Indigenous people to Christianity. This marks the start of Denmark\u2019s modern colonization of Greenland.",

The mine closed after it was depleted and manufacturers switched to synthetic cryolite.",

      "The National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday that the consumer price index dropped 0.7% in February compared to a year ago. On a monthly basis, prices were down 0.2% from January.",
      "While many other countries wrestle with inflation, China's policymakers face flat to falling prices, and the possibility they could evolve into a deflationary spiral that would drag down the economy. The government stressed the need to increase domestic demand and consumer spending in an annual report last week to its ceremonial legislature, the National People's Congress, but held back on unveiling any dramatic new steps to boost the economy.",
      "The Lunar New Year, a time when spending rises for travel, dining out and entertainment, came in late January this year instead of February, as it's based on the cycles of the moon. Holiday spending helped drive the consumer price index up 0.5% in January, but it then fell last month compared to 2024's elevated level.",
      "Factoring out the impact of the holiday, the index rose 0.1% last month, Dong Lijuan, a statistician at the government's statistics bureau, said in a written analysis.",
      "That is still far lower than ideal. Last week's government annual report included an inflation target of 2% for this year, but it is likely to fall far short of that goal. The consumer price index was flat in 2024, rising 0.2%.",
      "A burgeoning trade war with the United States could add to China's economic headwinds.",
      "Besides the early Lunar New Year, two other factors contributed to falling prices in February, Dong said: Better weather boosted farm production, driving down the price of fresh vegetables and automakers also stepped up promotions to try to boost sales, reducing prices for new cars.",
      "The producer price index, which measures the wholesale price of goods, fell 2.2% in February, the statistics bureau said. Producer prices have been falling more sharply than consumer prices, putting pressure on companies to cut labor and other costs."

      "The Indian Embassy in Bangkok did not respond to requests for comment. The Czech Foreign Ministry says it cannot confirm a Czech citizen is among those repatriated. It says it is in touch with the embassies in Bangkok and Yangon over the issue and that the embassies have not been asked for assistance.",
      "Amy Miller, the Southeast Asia director of Acts of Mercy International who is based at the Thai-Myanmar border, says it\u2019s hard for the world to understand why all of the released workers aren\u2019t free.",
      "\u201cYou can literally, with your naked eye, stand at the border and see people inside, on their balconies, in these compounds, and yet we cannot reach them,\u201d she said. Pausing a moment, she gestured out a nearby window toward the Friendship Bridge to Myanmar just blocks away. \u201cI think what people don\u2019t understand is that to enter into another country is an act of war. You cannot just go in and receive these people out.\u201d",
      "Aiding the work on the front lines, especially for those countries with fewer resources, are a handful of small nonprofit groups with very limited funds.",
      "In a nondescript Mae Sot home, Miller\u2019s organization receives escapees and a trickle of survivors who have made it across the river with comfortable couches, clean water, food and working phones to reach their families. She said today\u2019s unprecedented numbers are overwhelming the aid available across the river.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at numbers in the thousands, the ability to get them over to Thailand and process them and house them and feed them would be impossible for most governments,\u201d said Miller. \u201cIt really does require a kind of a global response.\u201d",
      "The recent abrupt halt to U.S. foreign aid funding has made it even harder to get help to released scam center workers.",
      "The United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration, for example, previously funded care for victims of trafficking in scam compounds in one shelter in Cambodia, but was forced to halt that work by the Trump Administration\u2019s funding freeze announced in January, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. The halt to funding has also impacted a network of civil society groups that worked to stop human trafficking and rescue survivors in Thailand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really heartbreaking to see that there\u2019s such an immense amount of people that are in need of assistance,\u201d said Saskia Kok, Head of Protection Unit in Thailand for the IOM.",
      "In a statement, U.S. officials acknowledged the high pressure impasse.",
      "\u201cThe United States remains deeply concerned about online scam operations throughout Southeast Asia, which affect thousands of Americans and individuals from many other countries,\u201d said a State Department spokesperson in a statement sent to the AP.",
      "While advocates estimate some 50 million people are living in modern slavery, mass rescues of enslaved workers are rare. In 2015, more than 2,000 fishermen were rescued from brutal conditions at sea, liberated after an Associated Press investigation exposed their plight. That same year hundreds of Indians were rescued from brick factories in India. And last year Brazilian prosecutors rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in \u201cslavery-like\u201d conditions at an electric vehicle factory construction site in northeastern Brazil.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing at the Thai-Myanmar border now is the result of years of inaction on a trafficking crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people, many of whom were simply seeking better economic prospect, but were lured to these compounds on false pretenses,\u201d said Amnesty International Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.",
      "Being forced to commit a crime under threat of violence should not be criminalized, said Freeman. \u201cHowever, in general we are aware of countries in the region repatriating their nationals from scam compounds only to then charge them with crimes.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much of an effect these releases will have on the criminal groups that run the scam centers.",
      "February marked the third time the Thais have cut internet or electricity to towns across the river. Each time, the compounds have managed to work around the cuts. Large compounds have access to diesel-powered generators, as well as access to internet provider Starlink, experts working with law enforcement say.",
      "\u201cThe resources is the one thing that they are not lacking and they\u2019ve been able to bring them to bear in the past,\u201d said Benedikt Hoffman, acting representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the region.",
      "The armed groups that staged the crackdown have also been accused of helping to run scam compounds in Myawaddy. The head of the Kayin Border Guard Force, General Saw Chit Thu, has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking, respectively. Compounds in the DKBA\u2019s control are less well-documented in the public record, but activists say they also control a fair number.",
      "\u201cThere is clearly a lot of pressure on the Border Guard Force to take action and helping people to leave is one of the most visible ways to do so,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThat said, it likely also reflects an adjustment to the business model, reducing the number of people involved \u2014 and with less attention, continuing lower key operations.\u201d",
      "It will take simultaneous pressure exerted in multiple areas to truly shut down the compounds, said Hoffman.",
      "In this crackdown, there have been no major prosecutions or compounds shut down.",
      "\u201cThis doesn\u2019t affect anything,\u201d said a 23-year-old Pakistani man who had hoped to be freed only to be trapped in an army camp. The bosses, he said, are \u201crich as hell\u201d and can buy anything they need to keep the lucrative operations going. Meanwhile, he said, conditions are worsening.",
      "\u201cMy friends are in really bad condition, we can\u2019t survive here,\u201d he said, requesting anonymity out of fear for retribution from his guards. He asks a question that's been haunting him day in and day out for weeks: \u201cIs anyone coming for us?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Syria\u2019s Druze minority is trying to navigate a new, uncertain Syria",
      "JARAMANA, Syria -- Syria\u2019s Druze minority has a long history of cutting their own path to survive among the country\u2019s powerhouses. They are now trying again to navigate a new, uncertain Syria since the fall of longtime autocrat Bashar Assad.",
      "Members of the small religious sect find themselves caught between two forces that many of them distrust: the new, Islamist-led government in Damascus and Syria\u2019s hostile neighbor, Israel, which has used the plight of the Druze as a pretext to intervene in the country.",
      "Syria\u2019s many religious and ethnic communities are worried over their place in the new system. The transitional government has promised to include them, but has so far kept authority in the hands of the Islamist former insurgents who toppled Assad in December -- Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. That and HTS\u2019s past affiliation with Sunni Muslim extremist al-Qaida, has minorities suspicious.",
      "The most explosive hostilities have been with the Alawite religious minority, to which Assad\u2019s family belongs. Heavy clashes erupted this week between armed Assad loyalists and government forces, killing at least 70, in the coastal regions that are the Alawites\u2019 heartland.",
      "In contrast, the Druze -- largely centered in southern Syria -- have kept up quiet contacts with the government. Still, tensions have broken out.",
      "Last week in Jaramana, a suburb of Damascus with a large Druze population, unknown gunmen killed a member of the government\u2019s security forces, which responded with a wave of arrests in the district.",
      "Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and military officials weighed in by threatening to send forces to Jaramana to protect the Druze. Druze leaders quickly disavowed the offer. But soon after, someone hung an Israeli flag in Sweida, an overwhelmingly Druze region in southern Syria, prompting residents to quickly tear it down and burn it.",
      "Many fear another flare-up is only a matter of time.",
      "Multiple Druze armed militias have existed for years, originally set up to protect their communities against Islamic State group fighters and drug smugglers coming in from the eastern desert. They have been reluctant to set down their arms. Recently a new faction, the Sweida Military Council, proclaimed itself, grouping several smaller Druze militias.",
      "The result is a cycle of mistrust, where government supporters paint Druze factions as potential separatists or tools of Israel, while government hostility only deepens Druze worries.",
      "On the outskirts of Sweida, a commander in Liwa al-Jabal, a Druze militia, stood on a rooftop and scanned the hills with binoculars. He spoke by walkie-talkie with a militiaman with an assault rifle below. They were watching for any movement by militants or gangs.",
      "\u201cOur arms are not for expansionist purposes. They're for self-defense and protection,\u201d said the commander, who asked to be identified only by his nickname Abu Ali for security reasons. \u201cWe have no enemies except those who attack us.\u201d",
      "Abu Ali, who is a metal worker as his day job, said most Druze militiamen would merge with a new Syrian army if it\u2019s one that \u201cprotects all Syrians rather than crushes them like the previous regime.\u201d",
      "The Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. Over half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.",
      "In Syria, the Druze take pride in their fierce independence. They were heavily involved in revolts against Ottoman and French colonial rule to establish the modern Syrian state.",
      "During Syria\u2019s civil war that began in 2011, the Druze were split between supporters of Assad and the opposition. The Sweida region stayed quiet for much of the war, though it erupted with anti-government protests in 2023.",
      "Assad reluctantly gave Druze a degree of autonomy, as they wanted to avoid being involved on the frontlines. The Druze were exempted from conscription into the Syrian army and instead set up local armed factions made of workers and farmers to patrol their areas.",
      "Druze say they want Syria\u2019s new authorities to include them in a political process to create a secular and democratic state.",
      "\u201cReligion is for God and the state is for all\u201d proclaimed a slogan written on the hood of a vehicle belonging to the Men of Dignity, another Druze militia patrolling the outskirts of Sweida.",
      "Many Druze quickly rejected Israel\u2019s claims to protect the minority. Hundreds took to the streets in Sweida to protest Netanyahu\u2019s comments.",
      "\u201cWe are Arabs, whether he or whether the Lord that created him likes it or not. Syria is free,\u201d said Nabih al-Halabi, a 60-year-old resident of Jaramana.",
      "He and others reject accusations that the Druze want partition from Syria.",
      "But patience is wearing thin over what many see as arbitrary layoffs of public sector workers, shortage of economic opportunities, and the new authorities\u2019 lack of more than token inclusion of Syrians from minority communities. For the first time, a protest took place in Sweida on Thursday against Damascus' new authorities.",
      "Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has promised to create an inclusive system, but the government is made up mostly of his confidantes. The authorities convened a national dialogue conference last week, inviting Syrians from different communities, but many criticized it as rushed and not really inclusive.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing from the state today, in our opinion, does not achieve the interests of all Syrians,\u201d said retired nurse Nasser Abou-Halam, discussing local politics with other residents in Sweida's public square where near-daily protests took place. \u201cIt\u2019s a one-color government, with leadership appointed through factions rather than through elections.\u201d",
      "Al-Sharaa \u201chas a big opportunity to be accepted just to be Syrian first and not Islamist first. Being inclusive will not hurt him,\u201d said Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat currently based in Washington. \u201cOn the contrary, it will give him more power.\u201d",
      "Syria\u2019s new leaders have struggled to convince the United States and its allies to lift Assad-era sanctions. Without the lifting of sanctions, it will be impossible for the government to rebuild Syria\u2019s battered infrastructure or win over minority communities, analysts say.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m scared sanctions won\u2019t be lifted and Syria won\u2019t be given the chance,\u201d said Rayyan Maarouf, who heads the activist media collective Suwayda 24. He has just returned to Sweida after fleeing to Europe over a year ago because of his activism.",
      "\u201cSyria could go back to a civil war, and it would be worse than before,\u201d he said.",
      "Outside Sweida, Abu Ali was helping train new volunteers for the militia. Still, he said he hopes to be able to lay down his weapons.",
      "\u201cThere is no difference between the son of Sweida or Jaramana and those of Homs and Lattakia,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are tired of war and bloodshed \u2026 weapons don\u2019t bring modernism.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for this fight. But Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThe Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\u201d",

      "Panama has released dozens of migrants deported from the United States who were held for weeks in a remote camp on the condition that they would leave the Central American nation in 30 days",
      "PANAMA CITY -- After weeks of lawsuits and human rights criticism, Panama on Saturday released dozens of migrants who were held for weeks in a remote camp after being deported from the United States, telling them they have 30 days to leave the Central American nation.",
      "It thrust many like Hayatullah Omagh, a 29-year-old who fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the Taliban took control, into a legal limbo, scrambling to find a path forward.",
      "\u201cWe are refugees. We do not have money. We can not pay for a hotel in Panama City, we do not have relatives,\u201d Omagh told the Associated Press in an interview. \u201cI can\u2019t go back to Afghanistan under any circumstances ... It is under the control of the Taliban, and they want to kill me. How can I go back?\"",
      "Authorities have said deportees will have the option of extending their stay by 60 days if they need it, but after that many like Omagh don\u2019t know what they will do.",
      "Omagh climbed off a bus in Panama City alongside 65 migrants from China, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Nepal and other nations after spending weeks detained in poor conditions by the Panamanian government, which has said it wants to work with the Trump administration \u201cto send a signal of deterrence\u201d to people hoping to migrate.",
      "Human rights groups and lawyers advocating for the migrants were waiting at the bus terminal, and scrambled to find the released migrants shelter and other resources. Dozens of other people remained in the camp.",
      "Among those getting off buses were migrants fleeing violence and repression in Pakistan and Iran, and 27-year-old Nikita Gaponov, who fled Russia due to repression for being part of the LGBTQ+ community and who said he was detained at the U.S. border, but not allowed to make an asylum claim.",
      "\u201cOnce I get off the bus, I'll be sleeping on the ground tonight,\" Gaponov said.",
      "Others turned their eyes north once again, saying that even though they had already been deported, they had no other option than to continue after crossing the world to reach the U.S.",
      "The deportees, largely from Asian countries, were part of a deal stuck between the Trump administration and Panama and Costa Rica as the U.S. government attempts to speed up deportations. The administration sent hundreds of people, many families with children, to the two Central American countries as a stopover while authorities organize a way to send them back to their countries of origin.",
      "Critics described it as a way for the U.S. to export its deportation process.",
      "The agreement fueled human rights concerns when hundreds of deportees detained in a hotel in Panama City held up notes to their windows pleading for help and saying they were scared to return to their own countries.",
      "Under international refugee law, people have the right to apply for asylum when they are fleeing conflict or persecution.",
      "Those that refused to return home were later sent to a remote camp near Panama's border with Colombia, where they spent weeks in poor conditions, were stripped of their phones, unable to access legal council and were not told where they were going next.",
      "Lawyers and human rights defenders warned that Panama and Costa Rica were turning into \u201cblack holes\u201d for deportees, and said their release was a way for Panamanian authorities to wash their hands of the deportees amid mounting human rights criticism.",
      "Those who were released Saturday night, like Omagh, said they could not return home.",
      "As an atheist and member of an ethnic minority group in Afghanistan known as the Hazara, he said returning home under the rule of the Taliban \u2014 which swept back into power after the Biden administration pulled out of the country \u2014 would mean he would be killed. He only went to the U.S. after trying for years to live in Pakistan, Iran and other countries but being denied visas.",
      "Omagh was deported after presenting himself to American authorities and asking to seek asylum in the U.S., which he was denied.",
      "\u201cMy hope was freedom. Just freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn't give me the chance. I asked many times to speak to an asylum officer and they told me \u2018No, no, no, no, no.\u2019\u201d",
      "Still, he said that leaving the camp was a relief. Omagh and other migrants who spoke to the AP detailed scarce food, sweltering heat with little relief and aggressive Panamanian authorities.",
      "In one case, Omagh and others said, a Chinese man went on a week-long hunger strike. In another, a small riot broke out because guards refused to give a migrant their phone. The riot, they said, was suppressed by armed guards.",
      "Panamanian authorities denied accusations about camp conditions, but blocked journalists from accessing the camp and cancelled a planned press visit last week.",
      "While international aid organizations said they would organize travel to a third country for people who didn\u2019t want to return home, Panamanian authorities said the people released had already refused help.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian special forces walked kilometers (miles) inside a gas pipeline to strike Ukrainian units from the rear in the Kursk region, Ukraine\u2019s military and Russian war bloggers reported, as Moscow moves to recapture parts of its border province that Kyiv seized in a shock offensive.",
      "Ukraine launched a daring cross-border incursion into Kursk i n August, in what marked the largest attack on Russian territory since World War II. Within days, Ukrainian units had captured 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of territory, including the strategic border town of Sudzha, and taken hundreds of Russian prisoners of war. According to Kyiv, the operation aimed to gain a bargaining chip in future peace talks, and force Russia to divert troops away from its grinding offensive in eastern Ukraine.",
      "But months after Ukraine\u2019s thunder run, its soldiers in Kursk are weary and bloodied by relentless assaults of more than 50,000 troops, including some from Russia's ally North Korea. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers run the risk of being encircled, open source maps of the battlefield show.",
      "According to Telegram posts by a Ukrainian-born, pro-Kremlin blogger, Russian operatives walked about 15 kilometers (9 miles) inside the pipeline, which Moscow had until recently used to send gas to Europe. Some Russian troops had spent several days in the pipe before striking Ukrainian units from the rear near the town of Sudzha, blogger Yuri Podolyaka claimed.",
      "The town had some 5,000 residents before the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and houses major gas transfer and measuring stations along the pipeline, once a major outlet for Russian natural gas exports through Ukrainian territory.",
      "Another war blogger, who uses the alias Two Majors, said fierce fighting was underway for Sudzha, and that Russian forces managed to enter the town through a gas pipeline. Russian Telegram channels showed photos of what they said were special forces operatives, wearing gas masks and moving along what looked like the inside of a large pipe.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s General Staff confirmed on Saturday evening that Russian \u201csabotage and assault groups\u201d used the pipeline in a bid to gain a foothold outside Sudzha. In a Telegram post, it said the Russian troops were \u201cdetected in a timely manner\u201d and that Ukraine responded with rockets and artillery.",
      "\u201cAt present, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. The enemy\u2019s losses in Sudzha are very high,\u201d the General Staff reported.",

      "Valentino paraded high fashion inside a public toilets setting in one of the most unexpected backdrops of the season, especially for a house as classical as Valentino",
      "Valentino paraded high fashion inside public toilets in one of the season\u2019s most provocative backdrops, especially for a house as classical as Valentino \u2014 upending traditional notions of luxury.",
      "Yet at time when restrooms remain a cultural and political flashpoint in debates around gender identity, access, and self-presentation, the show\u2019s setting \u2014 one the designer described as \u201cproudly political\u201d \u2014 also felt like a deliberate challenge.",
      "The set was a meticulous recreation, down to the tiling, soap dispensers, mirrors and endless rows of stalls, all bathed in an unsettling, almost seedy red light.",
      "Partly inspired by David Lynch, the space set the tone for Alessandro Michele\u2019s bold new vision. With a background in costume design, Michele infuses his collections with inspirations from theater and film, crafting narratives as much as he does garments.",
      "It was one of the standout shows in Paris this season, drawing a front row as eclectic as the collection itself. Chappell Roan, Parker Posey, Jared Leto and Barry Keoghan sat amid the crimson glow, their presence adding to the surreal energy of the day.",
      "Michele often selects venues with deep historical or cultural significance \u2014 think palaces \u2014 so this public toilet setting was a clever subversion, even of his own signature style. The result? A show that explored the boundaries between public and private, intimacy and exposure, and the ever-blurred lines of identity in contemporary fashion.",
      "Models emerged from toilet cubicles, some stopping to inspect their faces in the mirrors, blurring the line between personal and performative. The clothes were pure theatricality: caps, hoods, and dark shades concealing the face, while sheer nude tops exposed breasts and the intimacy of the body, a direct contrast between covering up and revealing.",
      "Michele\u2019s designs are characterized by a kaleidoscopic mix of times and cultures, blending elements from different historical periods to create a unique aesthetic. He considers himself an \u201cart archaeologist,\u201d exploring how adornment and embellishment have evolved over the centuries.",
      "One striking example: intricately embroidered lingerie with an opulent silken bust and stiff Victorian collar, its crotch flap left provocatively undone, as if the model had to rush to the restroom. Baroque motifs and 18th-century ruffles clashed with oversized, washed-out denim jeans, while his signature maximalist mix of leopard print, faux fur, and tweed created a tension\u2014like the most opulent thrift store imaginable.",
      "There were so many styles, they defied description. And that was the point. The overloaded looks were intentional, a singular vision of excess that defines Michele\u2019s aesthetic and cements his legacy as a designer who refuses to conform.",
      "The audience buzzed with excitement. \u201cHe\u2019s upending Valentino in the same way Demna did at Balenciaga,\u201d one front-row guest remarked. The applause was loud, the reaction immediate. This wasn\u2019t just a collection, it was a statement, disruptive and irreverent, pulling a classical house into new, unexpected territory.",
      "For Michele, the public toilet was more than a backdrop \u2014 it was a space where boundaries dissolve, a setting charged with meaning. He described it as a \u201ccounter-place\u201d that blurs distinctions between public and private, intimacy and exposure, transforming the mundane into something profoundly symbolic.",
      "But as Michele put it, it was also a \u201cproudly political\u201d space, one designed to upend convention and provoke thought. Though he never explicitly linked the setting to gender politics, the casting spoke volumes. Androgynous models stood alongside male and female counterparts, all moving fluidly through the space, reinforcing the idea that identity is unfixed, and fashion, like the world it reflects, defies rigid categorization. At a time when restrooms remain at the heart of cultural and political debates on gender identity, access, and self-expression, the show\u2019s setting was impossible to ignore.",
      "With this, Michele made it clear that his vision for Valentino extends far beyond clothing. It is about identity in motion, the interplay of concealment and revelation. And above all, fashion as a stage for storytelling at its most provocative."

      "Pope Francis is participating in the Vatican\u2019s spiritual retreat from a Rome hospital as he continues his recovery from double pneumonia",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis is participating in the Vatican\u2019s weeklong spiritual retreat from a Rome hospital as he continued his recovery on Monday from double pneumonia and looks ahead to the 12th anniversary of his election amid questions about what the future of his papacy might look like.",
      "Francis followed the opening of the retreat by videoconference on Sunday: He could see and hear the Rev. Roberto Pasolini, preacher of the papal household, but the priests, bishops and cardinals in the Vatican auditorium couldn\u2019t see or hear him.",
      "Pasolini delivered a meditation on \u201cThe hope of eternal life,\u201d a theme that was chosen well before Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 with a complex lung infection.",
      "The retreat, which is an annual gathering that kicks off the Catholic Church\u2019s solemn Lenten season leading to Easter, continues through the week. The Vatican has said Francis would participate \u201cin spiritual communion\u201d with the rest of the hierarchy, from afar.",
      "In its early update Monday, the Vatican said Francis was resting after a quiet night.",
      "At the time of his hospitalization last month, the 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, had what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future.",
      "He has now remained in stable condition for over a week, with no fever, respiratory crises and good oxygen levels in his blood for several days, doctors reported.",
      "The doctors said that such stability was in itself a positive thing and showed he was responding well to therapy. But they kept his prognosis as \u201cguarded,\u201d meaning that he\u2019s not out of danger. Doctors were expected to provide a medical update later Monday.",
      "On Thursday, the Vatican will mark the 12th anniversary of Francis\u2019 election, the first with the pope out of sight but still very much in charge. Francis was elected the 266th pope, the first Jesuit pope and first from Latin America, on March 13, 2013 following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI.",
      "On Sunday, Francis met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin and the chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, for the third time at the hospital. Such meetings are the routine way the pope governs, and shows Francis is still keeping up with essential business.",
      "While Francis has previously praised Benedict for his courage and humility in resigning, he has indicated more recently that he believes the job of pope is for life and said as recently as last year that he had no plans of stepping down.",
      "Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Australia's prime minister cautioned that the fallout from a vicious tropical storm over the weekend was \u201cfar from over\u201d as parts of two states remained inundated with perilous floodwaters on Monday, even as the initial threat from the deluge continued to recede.",
      "One person was killed and several others injured after heavy rain lashed Australia's east coast on Saturday, toppling trees and power lines and inundating some parts of Queensland and New South Wales with record downpours. The two states escaped the level of chaos forecast from the tropical low weather system, which was earlier expected to make landfall as the first tropical cyclone to hit south east Queensland in 51 years \u2014 before weakening as it approached.",
      "Still, 200,000 homes and businesses were without power in the region on Monday afternoon \u2014 after the storm prompted the biggest blackout in Queensland's history \u2014 and more than 700 schools were closed for the day.",
      "Those living near rivers and creeks were urged to evacuate or stay indoors as water levels continued to rise in some areas \u2014 with more rain forecast triggering further warnings during the day. Disaster was declared for the city of Ipswich, west of Brisbane, where a river was expected to flood overnight. People in surrounding suburbs were ordered to leave their homes.",
      "Meanwhile, in other towns where floodwaters began to recede a cleanup began as power was restored for tens of thousands of people. The scale of the damage was not immediately clear.",
      "Workers whose livelihoods were hampered by the storm will be eligible for welfare payments for up to 13 weeks beginning Tuesday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters on Monday.",
      "In the city of Lismore in New South Wales, two military trucks helping with the rescue efforts on Saturday rolled over, injuring 13 of the 36 personnel travelling in them. One remained in hospital on Monday with injuries that were not life-threatening, Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles said.",
      "The single casualty of the crisis was a 61-year-old man who disappeared in a flooded river near the New South Wales town of Dorrigo, police said. His body was recovered on Saturday.",
      "Albanese warned residents of the two stricken states not to be \u201ccomplacent\u201d as flood warnings lingered.",
      "\u201cIf it's flooded, forget it,\u201d he said, referring to traveling in or entering inundated areas.",
      "Cyclones are common in Queensland\u2019s tropical north but are rare in the state\u2019s temperate and densely populated southeast corner that borders New South Wales. Tropical Cyclone Alfred was last week expected to become the first cyclone since 1974 to cross the Australian coast near Queensland's state capital of Brisbane, Australia\u2019s third-most populous city.",
      "But it weakened Saturday to a tropical low, defined as carrying sustained winds of less than 63 kph (39 mph).",
      "Authorities had feared similar scenes to those eastern Australia experienced during massive floods in 2011 and in a series of 2022 events \u2014 in which more than 20 people died.",

      "Detroit-based Rocket expects the acquisition will save the company $140 million in costs by eliminating duplicative operations and other expenses.

      "NUUK, Greenland -- When U.S. President Donald Trump first suggested buying Greenland in 2019, people thought it was just a joke. No one is laughing now.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland, restated vigorously soon after he returned to the White House in January, comes as part of an aggressively \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy platform that includes demands for Ukraine to hand over mineral rights in exchange for continued military aid, threats to take control of the Panama Canal, and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Increasing international tensions, global warming and the changing world economy have put Greenland at the heart of the debate over global trade and security, and Trump wants to make sure that the U.S. controls this mineral-rich country that guards the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America.",
      "Greenland is a self-governing territory of Denmark, a long-time U.S. ally that has rejected Trump\u2019s overtures. Denmark has also recognized Greenland\u2019s right to independence at a time of its choosing.",
      "Amid concerns about foreign interference and demands that Greenlanders must control their own destiny, the island\u2019s prime minister called early an parliamentary election for Tuesday.",
      "The world\u2019s largest island, 80% of which lies above the Arctic Circle, is home to about 56,000 mostly Inuit people who until now have been largely ignored by the rest of the world.",
      "Climate change is thinning the Arctic ice, promising to create a northwest passage for international trade and reigniting the competition with Russia, China and other countries over access to the region\u2019s mineral resources.",
      "\u201cLet us be clear: we are soon entering the Arctic Century, and its most defining feature will be Greenland\u2019s meteoric rise, sustained prominence and ubiquitous influence,\u2019\u2019 said Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative.",
      "\u201cGreenland \u2014 located on the crossroads between North America, Europe and Asia, and with enormous resource potential \u2014 will only become more strategically important, with all powers great and small seeking to pay court to it. One is quite keen to go a step further and buy it.\u201d",
      "The following are some of the factors that are driving U.S. interest in Greenland.",
      "Following the Cold War, the Arctic was largely an area of international cooperation. But climate change, the hunt for scarce resources and increasing international tensions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are once again driving competition in the region.",
      "Greenland sits off the northeastern coast of Canada, with more than two-thirds of its territory lying within the Arctic Circle. That has made it crucial to the defense of North America since World War II, when the U.S. occupied Greenland to ensure that it didn\u2019t fall into the hands of Nazi Germany and to protect crucial North Atlantic shipping lanes.",
      "The U.S. has retained bases in Greenland since the war, and the Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Force Base, supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO. Greenland also guards part of what is known as the GIUK (Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom) Gap, where NATO monitors Russian naval movements in the North Atlantic.",
      "Greenland has large deposits of so-called rare earth minerals that are needed to make everything from computers and smartphones to the batteries, solar and wind technologies that will power the transition away from fossil fuels. The U.S. Geological Survey has also identified potential offshore deposits of oil and natural gas.",
      "Greenlanders are keen to develop the resources, but they have enacted strict rules to protect the environment. There are also questions about the feasibility of extracting Greenland\u2019s mineral wealth because of the region\u2019s harsh climate.",
      "Greenland\u2019s retreating ice cap is exposing the country\u2019s mineral wealth and melting sea ice is opening up the once mythical Northwest Passage through the Arctic.",
      "Greenland sits strategically along two potential routes through the Arctic, which would reduce shipping times between the North Atlantic and Pacific and bypass the bottlenecks of the Suez and Panama canals. While the routes aren\u2019t likely to be commercially viable for many years, they are attracting attention.",
      "In 2018, China declared itself a \u201cnear-Arctic state\u201d in an effort to gain more influence in the region. China has also announced plans to build a \u201cPolar Silk Road\u201d as part of its global Belt and Road Initiative, which has created economic links with countries around the world.",
      "Then U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected China\u2019s move, saying: \u201cDo we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a new South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?\u201d A Chinese backed rare earth mining project in Greenland stalled after the local government banned uranium mining in 2021.",
      "The legislation that extended self-government to Greenland in 2009 also recognized the country\u2019s right to independence under international law. Opinion polls show a majority of Greenlanders favor independence, though they differ on exactly when that should occur. The potential for independence raises questions about outside interference in Greenland that could threaten U.S. interests in the country."

      "To billionaire Elon Musk and his cost-cutting team at the Department of Government Efficiency, Karen Ortiz may just be one of many faceless bureaucrats",
      "NEW YORK -- To billionaire Elon Musk and his cost-cutting team at the Department of Government Efficiency, Karen Ortiz may just be one of many faceless bureaucrats. But to some of her colleagues, she is giving a voice to those who feel they can't speak out.",
      "Ortiz is an administrative judge at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission -- the federal agency in charge of enforcing U.S. workplace anti-discrimination laws that has undergone tumultuous change since President Donald Trump took office. Like millions of other federal employees, Ortiz opened an ominous email on Jan. 28 titled \u201cFork in the Road\" giving them the option to resign from their positions as part of the government\u2019s cost-cutting measures directed by Trump and carried out by DOGE under Musk, an unelected official.",
      "Her alarm grew when her supervisor directed administrative judges in her New York district office to pause all their current LGBTQ+ cases and send them to Washington for further review in order to comply with Trump's executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \u201cimmutable\u201d sexes \u2014 male and female.",
      "Ortiz decried management\u2019s lack of action in response to the directive, which she said was antithetical to the EEOC\u2019s mission, and called upon some 185 colleagues in an email to \u201cresist\u201d complying with \u201cillegal mandates.\u201d But that email was \u201cmysteriously\u201d deleted, she said.",
      "The next day, after yet another frustrating \u201cFork in the Road\u201d update, Ortiz decided to go big, emailing the EEOC's acting chair Andrea Lucas directly and copying more than 1,000 colleagues with the subject line, \u201cA Spoon is Better than a Fork.\" In it, Ortiz questioned Lucas's fitness to serve as acting chair, \u201cmuch less hold a license to practice law.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know I take a great personal risk in sending out this message. But, at the end of the day, my actions align with what the EEOC was charged with doing under the law,\u201d Ortiz wrote. \u201cI will not compromise my ethics and my duty to uphold the law. I will not cower to bullying and intimidation.\u201d",
      "Ortiz is just one person, but her email represents a larger pushback against the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping changes to federal agencies amid an environment of confusion, anger and chaos. It is also Ortiz\u2019s way of taking a stand against the leadership of a civil rights agency that last month moved to dismiss seven of its own cases representing transgender workers, marking a major departure from its prior interpretation of the law.",
      "Right after sending her mass email, Ortiz said she received a few supportive responses from colleagues -- and one calling her unprofessional. Within an hour, though, the message disappeared and she lost her ability to send any further emails.",
      "But it still made it onto the internet. The email was recirculated on Bluesky and it received more than 10,000 \u201cupvotes\u201d on Reddit after someone posted it with the comment, \u201cWow I wish I had that courage.\u201d",
      "\u201cAN AMERICAN HERO,\u201d one Reddit user deemed Ortiz, a sentiment that was seconded by more than 2,000 upvoters. \u201cWho is this freedom fighter bringing on the fire?\" wrote another.",
      "The EEOC did not feel the same way. The agency revoked her email privileges for about a week and issued her a written reprimand for \u201cdiscourteous conduct.\u201d",
      "Contacted by The AP, a spokesperson for the EEOC said: \u201cWe will refrain from commenting on internal communications and personnel matters. However, we would note that the agency has a long-standing policy prohibiting unauthorized all-employee emails, and all employees were reminded of that policy recently.\u201d",
      "A month later, Ortiz has no regrets.",
      "\u201cIt was not really planned out, it was just from the heart,\u201d the 53-year-old told The Associated Press in an interview, adding that partisan politics have nothing to do with her objections and that the public deserves the EEOC's protection, including transgender workers. \u201cThis is how I feel and I\u2019m not pulling any punches. And I will stand by what I wrote every day of the week, all day on Sunday.\u201d",
      "Ortiz said she never intended for her email to go beyond the EEOC, describing it as a \u201clove letter\u201d to her colleagues. But, she added, \u201cI hope that it lights a fire under people.\u201d",
      "Ortiz said she has received \u201ca ton\u201d of support privately in the month since sending her email, including a thank-you letter from a California retiree telling her to \u201ckeep the faith.\u201d Open support among her EEOC colleagues beyond Reddit and Bluesky, however, has proven more elusive.",
      "\u201cI think people are just really scared,\u201d she said.",
      "William Resh, a University of Southern California Sol Price School of Public Policy professor who studies how administrative structure and political environments affect civil servants, weighed in on why federal workers may choose to say nothing even if they feel their mission is being undermined.",
      "\u201cWe can talk pie in the sky, mission orientation and all these other things. But at the end of the day, people have a paycheck to bring home, and food to put on a table and a rent to pay,\u201d Resh said.",
      "The more immediate danger, he said, is the threat to one's livelihood, or inviting a manager's ire.",
      "\u201cAnd so then that\u2019s where you get this kind of muted response on behalf of federal employees, that you don\u2019t see a lot of people speaking out within these positions because they don\u2019t want to lose their job,\u201d Resh said. \u201cWho would?\u201d",
      "Richard LeClear, a U.S. Air Force veteran and EEOC staffer who is retiring early at 64 to avoid serving under the Trump administration, said Ortiz\u2019s email was \u201cspot on,\u201d but added that other colleagues who agreed with her may fear speaking out themselves.",
      "\u201cRetaliation is a very real thing,\u201d LeClear said.",
      "Ortiz, who has been a federal employee for 14 years and at the EEOC for six, said she isn\u2019t naive about the potential fallout. She has hired attorneys, and maintains that her actions are protected whistleblower activity. As of Friday, she still had a job but she is not a lifetime appointee and is aware that her health care, pension and source of income could all be at risk.",
      "Ortiz is nonetheless steadfast: \u201cIf they fire me, I\u2019ll find another avenue to do this kind of work, and I\u2019ll be okay. They will have to physically march me out of the office.\u201d",
      "Many of Ortiz\u2019s colleagues have children to support and protect, which puts them in a more difficult position than her to speak out, Ortiz acknowledged. She said her legal education and American citizenship also put her in a position to be able to make change.",
      "Her parents, who came to the United States from Puerto Rico in the 1950s with limited English skills, ingrained in her the value of standing up for others. Their firsthand experience with the Civil Rights Movement, and her own experience growing up in mostly white spaces in Garden City on Long Island, primed Ortiz to defend herself and others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in my DNA,\u201d she said. \u201cI will use every shred of privilege that I have to lean into this.\u201d",
      "Ortiz received her undergraduate degree at Columbia University, and her law degree at Fordham University. She knew she wanted to become a judge ever since her high school mock trial as a Supreme Court justice.",
      "Civil rights has been a throughline in her career, and Ortiz said she was \u201csuper excited\u201d when she landed her job at the EEOC.",
      "\u201cThis is how I wanted to finish up my career,\" she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if that happens.\u201d",

      "BERLIN -- Flight cancellations at Hamburg Airport after a surprise strike by workers affected more than 40,000 passengers on Sunday, a day before a planned wider protest across Germany amid new contract negotiations.",
      "Only 10 of more than 280 scheduled flights went as planned early Sunday, the airport said. Many service desks sat empty as would-be passengers lined up to seek information about the cancellations. One big electronic departure board overhead had \u201ccanceled\u201d in red next to the list of all flights.",
      "The surprise walkout, which reportedly took place with only about a half-hour advance notice, came before a broader series of preannounced strikes across 13 airports in Germany on Monday, organized by the ver.di union.",
      "The union, whose members work in areas including passenger services and cargo and goods screening, called for Sunday's strike by security control staff to put pressure on company representatives amid collective bargaining talks.",
      "\u201cThe behavior of the trade union ver.di is dishonorable: The strike without notice hits Hamburg Airport at the start of the vacation season,\" airport spokeswoman Katja Bromm said in a statement. She said that on Monday, arrivals would be possible, and that \u201cconsiderable disruptions and cancellations\u201d were expected.",
      "Bromm said that Sunday's walkouts were \"excessive and unfair to tens of thousands of travelers who have nothing to do with the disputes.\u201d",
      "For months, ver.di has been negotiating a new agreement that aims to improve occupational health and safety, provide more vacation days, an increase in the annual bonus to 50% and the freedom to choose a doctor for employees\u2019 regular, mandatory medical exams, among other things.",
      "Lars Stubbe, a trade union official, said that \u201ca strike must cause economic damage.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe know that it is a massive burden for passengers. Our colleagues know that too. But they have said we have to go on strike. It must be effective, so that we have a reasonable offer to negotiate,\u201d he said.",
      "Some would-be passengers didn't hide their frustration.",
      "\u201cI also wonder why it\u2019s like this, because it was supposed to be a big strike tomorrow (Monday) \u2014 and why is it today?\u201d said Alva Wetzel, who had hoped to travel. \u201cIt\u2019s just stupid.\u201d",

      "Germany\u2019s Greens say they won't support the prospective next government\u2019s plans to loosen debt rules for defense spending and draw up a huge infrastructure investment fund",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's Greens, whose support is needed for the prospective next government's plans to loosen debt rules for defense spending and draw up a huge infrastructure investment fund, said Monday that they won't support the package as things stand.",
      "Conservative leader Friedrich Merz, who won last month's German election, is trying to put together a coalition with outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left Social Democrats. Last week, the two sides said they would seek to exempt some defense spending from the nation's tight self-imposed rules on running up debt, an issue of growing urgency as doubts increase about the U.S. commitment to European allies.",
      "They also want to set up a 500 billion euro ($533 billion) fund, financed by borrowing, to invest in Germany\u2019s creaking infrastructure over the next 10 years and help restore the economy to growth.",
      "Their plans will need a two-thirds majority in parliament because Germany's \u201cdebt brake\u201d \u2014 which allows new borrowing worth only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product \u2014 is anchored in the constitution. And they are trying to get them through the outgoing parliament next week, rather than the newly elected one, because parties that for different reasons are unlikely to agree to the plans have just over one-third of the seats in the new chamber.",
      "Since Merz's Union bloc and the Social Democrats don't have enough seats to pass the plans on their own, they need support from the environmentalist Greens.",
      "The leadership of the Greens' parliamentary group decided Monday to recommend that their lawmakers reject the plans, co-leader Katharina Dr\u00f6ge said. She said the Greens have long sought a reform of the \u201cdebt brake\u201d to ease investment in the economy and measures against climate change, while Merz had insisted before the election that there was no need to finance such investments through borrowing.",
      "Dr\u00f6ge argued that the prospective coalition partners' proposed infrastructure fund wouldn't actually target useful investments, but instead serve as a \u201ctreasure chest\u201d for measures such as tax cuts.",
      "Asked about the Greens' comments, the general secretary of Merz's Christian Democratic Union, Carsten Linnemann, said talks would be held with the Greens \u201cand then we will see how far we get.\u201d His party also plans to talk to the pro-business Free Democrats, but that party has strongly criticized running up more debt.",

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Praised by the ancient Greek giants Homer and Euripides for its superb quality nearly 3,000 years ago, Cyprus\u2019 Commandaria is the world\u2019s oldest recorded and named wine.",
      "Despite its rich heritage, the sweet wine has struggled to find its niche in the global market. Now a number of micro-wineries in this east Mediterranean island nation are reviving traditional wine-making techniques and giving Commandaria a chance at a long-awaited comeback.",
      "Makers hope to tap rich legends around the ruby red wine.",
      "It\u2019s said to have won the world's first known wine competition during the 13th century rule of French King Philippe Augustus. English King Richard the Lionheart is said to have served it to guests at his 1191 wedding in Cyprus. And 14th century Mayor of London Henry Picard reputedly indulged the leaders of England, France, Scotland, Denmark and Cyprus in the Feast of the Five Kings.",
      "The wine, known as \u201cnama\u201d in antiquity, was renamed by the medieval Knights Hospitaller, who set up headquarters during the Third Crusade at an estate known for its wine production that they named Grande Commanderie.",
      "The island\u2019s Orthodox Church later adopted Commandaria as its communion wine during Byzantine times.",
      "Production peaked when Venice ruled Cyprus in the 15th and 16th centuries and prized the wine for its sweetness and complex bouquet.",
      "Now bottles are sold for around 20 euros ($20) to up to 150.",
      "The wine's notes of honey, raisin, walnut, fig, carob, cinnamon, coffee and caramel are attributed to the island\u2019s rich volcanic soil, said Christakis Nicolaou, community leader of Zoopigi village, home to the Commandaria museum.",
      "Annual production of the wine in recent years hovered at around 200,000 bottles because demand tapered off, according to Savvas Constantinou, a beverage inspector with Cyprus\u2019 agriculture and environment ministry.",
      "One factor is the exclusion of some 800,000 Commandaria-loving Russian tourists as a result of sanctions imposed following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Constantinou said a bid to expand into the massive Chinese market made headway five years ago but wavered after producers couldn\u2019t meet demand.",
      "Wine expert Demetri Walters, who holds the prestigious title of Master of Wines, said Commandaria sales haven\u2019t gained much traction abroad primarily because of a lack of marketing. For instance, the island\u2019s main producer KEO have been slow to understand the potential of the wine, particularly their older vintages.",
      "\u201cA shame, as their Commandaria wines are very good,\u201d Walters told the Associated Press. \u201cThe unique and antique history, the extraordinary quality across the two styles and the terrific value for money...Everyone who tastes it for the first time with me is blown away by the complexity of the wine.\u201d",
      "Walters said although sweet wines are \u201cout of fashion\u201d except in the specialist trade, this is slowly changing for Commandaria. He said the wine was entered the UK market in recent years, but as a niche offering.",
      "Wineries such as Revecca in the mountain village of Ayios Mamas have found a steady domestic and foreign following, with sales on an upward swing since it opened in 2015.",
      "Its Commandaria last year won top prize at the national wine competition. The winery employs three people and produces 3,000 bottles a year.",
      "Winery curator Nikolas Christodoulides said he\u2019s experimenting with bespoke varieties catering to clients' tastes.",
      "\u201cOur focus is on improving quality rather than being fixated on quantity,\u201d Christodoulides said. The approach has worked for one Israeli couple who, according to Christodoulides, flies to Cyprus just to replenish their stock.",
      "Commandaria is made with dark Mavro and white Xynisteri grapes that are indigenous to Cyprus. They are left in the sunshine after harvest for seven to 12 days to bring out the distinctive sweetness.",
      "The wine is matured in reused oak barrels for at least two years in line with strict production laws to conform with the European Union\u2019s protected designation of origin. That means authentic Commandaria comes only from 14 villages on the southern face of the Troodos mountain range, where they\u2019re exposed to sunlight throughout the day.",
      "Some wineries produce a darker, sweeter version made strictly from the Mavro grapes. That version is preferred at the Karseras winery in the village of Doros, with an annual average production of 40 tons.",
      "Manager Philippos Karseras is encouraged by an upswing in domestic consumption, though it isn\u2019t quite enough to make up for the loss of the Russian market.",
      "But those running the Revecca winery believe that these small wineries will gradually win back consumers.",
      "\u201cWe have ensure the consistency of our product\u2019s quality first and win over the domestic market before we can make a collective push to market Commandaria abroad,\u201d Christodoulides said."

      "Asked about the Atlanta Fed's warning of an economic contraction in the first quarter of the year, Trump seemingly acknowledged that his plans could affect U.S. growth. Still, he claimed, it would ultimately be \"great for us.\u201d",
      "When questioned whether he was expecting a recession in 2025, Trump responded: \u201cI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing.\u201d He then added, \u201cIt takes a little time.

      "\u201cWill there be distortions? Of course,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cForeign goods may get a little more expensive. But American goods are going to get cheaper, and you\u2019re going to be helping Americans by buying American.\u201d"

      "Tens of thousands of people have packed into Mexico\u2019s City main plaza to celebrate with President Claudia Sheinbaum a decision by the U.S. to postpone tariffs on many of the country\u2019s goods",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Tens of thousands of people packed into Mexico\u2019s City main plaza on Sunday to celebrate with President Claudia Sheinbaum a decision by the U.S. to postpone tariffs on many of the country\u2019s goods.",
      "The crowd clutched large Mexican flags and yelled, \u201cMexico is to be respected!\u201d as they cheered on Sheinbaum.",
      "\u201cFortunately, dialogue and respect have prevailed,\u201d she told the crowd.",
      "The celebration comes just days after U.S. President Donald Trump postponed 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico for a month, saying Sheinbaum had made progress on drug smuggling and illegal immigration.",
      "Sheinbaum had planned to announce any retaliatory measures on Sunday, but instead held a mass celebration.",
      "While threats persist, the president said she was optimistic tariffs would not be applied to Mexico and that she would continue to act with a \u201ccool head\u201d in the face of Trump.",
      "Among Sheinbaum's supporters was Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez, a 68-year-old computer scientist who raised a sign that read \u201cwe are united Mexicans.\"",
      "\u201cThe unity of the country is very important,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez, adding that is the only way Mexico would be able to \u201cface one of the largest powers in the world.\"",
      "Also cheering on the president was Mariana Rivera, a 40-year-old social activist who held up a massive Mexican flag as high as her arms allowed.",
      "Despite the dark clouds hanging over the country, the activist said she was convinced that \u201cthe president will overcome everything.\u201d",
      "Analysts say they don\u2019t expect the jubilant ceremony to alleviate the climate of uncertainty that threatens new investments and the Mexican economy, but that it would help Sheinbaum consolidate internal support against Trump, who is setting the pace of bilateral relations with his powerful rhetoric.",
      "\u201cThis is an event designed more for internal politics,\u201d said political scientist and academic Javier Rosiles Salas, stating that Sheinbaum will seek to strengthen her image and leadership with Sunday\u2019s event.",
      "Rosiles Salas told The Associated Press that despite concerns in Mexico about the economic impacts that a tariff war with the United States \u2014 its main trading partner and destination of more than 80% of Mexican exports \u2014 could unleash, the confrontation with Trump has been \u201cvery profitable for Claudia Sheinbaum\u201d and has allowed her to achieve popular support of over 60% five months into her term.",
      "Although the 62-year-old president appears strong now, it is not clear whether her political support would weaken if the Mexican economy deteriorates because of tensions with the U.S.",
      "For now, the projections of specialists and rating agencies are not favorable. Most analysts agree that if general tariffs are imposed, Mexico could face a contraction of more than 1% of the Gross Domestic Product.",
      "A prolonged climate of uncertainty doesn\u2019t favor Mexico, according to Samuel Ortiz Vel\u00e1squez, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
      "After phone conversations with his counterparts in Mexico and Canada, Trump decided last Thursday to pause until April 2 the general tariffs for products that are under a trilateral trade agreement. In early February, Trump also suspended tariffs after Sheinbaum promised to send 10,000 national guards to the northern border to contain drug trafficking.",
      "Despite the agreements, Trump\u2019s decision on the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum from Mexico and Canada, which are scheduled to come into effect on March 12, remains in limbo.",

      "In President Donald Trump\u2019s idealized framing, the United States was at its zenith in the 1890s",
      "WASHINGTON -- In President Donald Trump's idealized framing, the United States was at its zenith in the 1890s, when top hats and shirtwaists were fashionable and typhoid fever often killed more soldiers than combat.",
      "It was the Gilded Age, a time of rapid population growth and transformation from an agricultural economy toward a sprawling industrial system, when poverty was widespread while barons of phenomenal wealth, like John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan, held tremendous sway over politicians who often helped boost their financial empires.",
      "\u201cWe were at our richest from 1870 to 1913. That\u2019s when we were a tariff country. And then they went to an income tax concept,\" Trump said days after taking office. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s OK. But it would have been very much better.\u201d",
      "The desire to recreate that era is fueled by Trump's fondness for tariffs and his admiration for the nation\u2019s 25th president, William McKinley, a Republican who was in office from 1897 until being assassinated in 1901.",
      "Though Trump's early implementation of tariffs has been inconsistent \u2014 with him imposing them, then pulling many back \u2014 he has been steadfast in endorsing the idea of 21st century protectionism. There have even been suggestions that higher import tariffs on the country's foreign trading partners could eventually replace the federal income tax.",
      "Experts on the era say Trump is idealizing a time rife with government and business corruption, social turmoil and inequality. They argue he's also dramatically overestimating the role tariffs played in stimulating an economy that grew mostly due to factors other than the U.S. raising taxes on imported goods.",
      "And Gilded Age policies, they maintain, have virtually nothing to do with how trade works in a globalized, modern economy.",
      "\u201cThe most astonishing thing for historians is that nobody in the Gilded Age economy \u2014 except for the very rich \u2014 wanted to live in the Gilded Age economy,\u201d said Richard White, a history professor emeritus at Stanford University.",
      "Trump says high tariffs and low interest rates, like those the U.S. had after the Civil War, can hastily pay down today's federal debt and fatten government coffers while boosting domestic manufacturers and enticing foreign producers to move to the U.S.",
      "It's not a new theme for him.",
      "\u201cI am a Tariff Man,\" Trump declared in a 2018 online post. Campaigning for a second term last fall, Trump said of the McKinley era, \u201cWe were a very wealthy country, and we\u2019re going to be doing that now.\u201d Today, he says \u201ctariff\u201d is his favorite word and represents \"a very powerful weapon that politicians haven\u2019t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form.\u201d",
      "The White House has rushed to raise tariffs on imports from China and on aluminum and steel made abroad while promising that import levies will soon increase on the European Union, as well as new, foreign-made cars, microchips and pharmaceuticals. Trump also increased tariffs on Canada and Mexico, though he later delayed most of them.",
      "He has similar plans for potentially every country the U.S. does business with, saying broad \u201creciprocal\u201d import taxes are coming April 2nd and will be consistent with levies other countries charge U.S. manufacturers to export their goods.",
      "Dartmouth College economics professor Douglas Irwin said Trump advocating for modern tariffs by pointing to the 1890s is flawed.",
      "\u201cWe did grow rapidly in the late 19th century,\" he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a stretch to attribute it to tariffs.\u201d",
      "\"The president is more accurate when he paints with a broader brush and says, \u2019Look, this entire period with fiscal surpluses we grew rapidly.' That\u2019s true of this 40-year period,\u201d added Irwin, author of \u201cClashing over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut, when you dig down to the details and say, \u2018We raised tariffs in this instance,\u2019 that\u2019s where things go awry. Or the story doesn\u2019t quite hold together as well,\" Irwin said.",
      "The Gilded Age featured extraordinary wealth for a small class of people that largely obscured rampant poverty for many other Americans. The name comes from a 1873 novel, co-written by Mark Twain, which satirized the greed and deceit of the era's government and politicians.",
      "Many contemporary leaders were openly influenced by the famed robber barons, builders of monopolies who stoked industrialization while shaping the way millions of other Americans lived and worked.",
      "Rockefeller became the exemplar of the era when his Standard Oil empire made him the world's first billionaire. Morgan was an investment banker and legendary financier of industrial interests. Cornelius Vanderbilt amassed a breathtaking fortune through shipping and railroads, while steel magnate Andrew Carnegie was also a dedicated philanthropist who argued the rich had a moral responsibility to use their wealth to better a deeply unequal society.",
      "Overall, the U.S. economy grew rapidly between 1870 and 1913, though there were dips and recessions, too.",
      "Some historians call it the second industrial revolution because of major increases in manufacturing and factory output. New industries like steel, electricity and petrochemicals boomed, as did sectors including construction and machinery.",
      "But White said those years were marked by erratic economic growth, and those upturns were mostly fueled by millions of immigrants joining the U.S. workforce. Indeed, the number of U.S. residents jumped from 38.5 million-plus in 1870 to more than 106 million by 1920.",
      "Another factor was the seizing of land from Native Americans during U.S. expansion west. That meant exploiting natural resources along the way \u2014 including gold, silver, timber, grazing and farmland, as well as coal, copper and oil, especially after the discovery of the Spindletop geyser in Texas in 1901.",
      "Average wages rose, but so did inequality, with almost no social safety net. Working conditions were often so abhorrent, meanwhile, that the labor movement began gaining strength, as did progressive politicians clamoring for breaking up monopolies.",
      "\u201cThis is the height of antimonopoly, political turmoil, the rise of labor in the United States,\u201d said White, author of \u201cThe Republic for Which it Stands: The United States during Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, 1865-1896.\u201d \u201cAnd the reason was, people did not regard this as a particularly healthy economy.\u201d",
      "In fact, despite the growth, standards of living fell, including life expectancy and key health indicators, White said.",
      "The modern federal income tax came into fruition with the ratification of 16th Amendment in 1913, ending the 43-year era when Trump says the country was wealthiest. He has not expressly detailed plans to end a national income tax since retaking the White House, and he can't do so without an act of Congress and upending the federal budget in almost incalculable ways.",
      "In fiscal year 2024, the federal government collected about $4 trillion in individual income tax and tax withholdings, according to the Treasury Department, compared with customs duties accounting for around $76.4 billion.",
      "But the president nonetheless signed a Day 1 executive order calling for the creation of the External Revenue Service to \u201ccollect tariffs, duties, and other foreign trade-related revenues.\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested Trump's goal there was \"to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay.\u201d",
      "Republican strategist Karl Rove, author of \u201cThe Triumph of William McKinley: Why the Election of 1896 Still Matters,\u201d has defended the notion of low, reciprocal tariffs on U.S. foreign trading partners.",
      "But Rove also says that tariffs can't realistically replace a federal income tax. He noted in a February op-ed that from 1863 to 1913 tariffs brought in nearly half the U.S. government\u2019s revenue but last year they accounted for less than 2% of federal revenue.",
      "In his inaugural address, Trump called McKinley a \"great president\u201d and \u201cnatural business man,\u201d who he said \u201cmade our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.\u201d Hours later, he signed an executive order overturning an Obama administration directive and renaming America\u2019s tallest peak Mount McKinley.",
      "But today's economy is immeasurably different than in McKinley's time.",
      "Global communication is now virtually instantaneous. Back then, communication was cumbersome and products were often fully assembled before being exported. Shipping could take months. Today's goods often contain raw material components or parts that need to be assembled that are sourced all over the world and then built in places different from where they are ultimately sold.",
      "The disruption of such carefully calibrated, multinational logistical systems by the coronavirus pandemic was a key reason why everything from leather couches to flooring to microchips for new cars suddenly became scarce. And that helped feed record inflation beginning in 2021 that continues to dog the U.S. economy today.",
      "Robert W. Merry, author of \u201cPresident McKinley: Architect of the American Century,\u201d said McKinley was the leading voice on tariffs at a time when they dominated policy discussions because they were the federal government's chief source of revenue, given that no income tax existed.",
      "But Trump differs with McKinley in using tariffs as a \u201cbludgeon to get other countries to do our bidding on efforts that have nothing to do with revenue, or economic matters or trade.\" The president has done that with Canada and Mexico, using tariff threats to try to force those countries to take harder lines against drug smuggling and illegal immigration.",
      "\"Nobody would have even considered such a thing in McKinley\u2019s day,\u201d Merry said.",
      "McKinley grew up in Canton, in northeast Ohio, son of an iron foundries owner who was especially sensitive to overseas competition. He won a seat in Congress representing a steel-producing district and so promoted tariffs that one humor magazine used a cartoon on its cover to unflatteringly dub him the \u201cNapoleon of Protectionism.\"",
      "As chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, McKinley championed the Tariff Act of 1890, which set the then-highest import tax in U.S. history, raising taxes to 49.5% on 1,500-plus items \u2014 everything from glass to tin plates to cayenne pepper. The results were quickly poor for the economy and for Republicans.",
      "\u201cIt led to an increase in prices, a kind of inflation, even before the bill took effect,\u201d Merry said. \u201cThe argument was, it was carte blanche for retailers and industrialists who basically jacked up their prices unnecessarily.\u201d",
      "Americans dealt Republicans landslide congressional defeats during the 1890 midterms, voting scores of incumbents out of office \u2014 including McKinley. The tariff fallout also helped Grover Cleveland win the White House for Democrats in 1892, after he lost his reelection the previous cycle.",
      "McKinley rebounded, though. He was elected Ohio governor and eventually won the presidency in 1896 on a campaign slogan Trump has repeated: \u201cI am a tariff man standing on a tariff platform.\u201d His campaign also got boosts from big donations by major industrialists like Rockefeller, who were strongly opposed to McKinley's populist Democratic opponent, William Jennings Bryan.",
      "Just as in McKinley's time, today's business titans have worked to ingratiate themselves to Trump. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was among the technology leaders who traveled to Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, was already a fixture, before Inauguration Day.",
      "Meta, Google and Microsoft joined other major firms donating $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, while Amazon Prime Video is set to distribute a documentary about first lady Melania Trump. Some business interests are hoping Trump will usher in a new era of antitrust, in which the government does less to block highly profitable corporate consolidation.",
      "Ignoring some of the political problems tariffs created for Republicans in his favored era, Trump instead has focused on repeating how import taxes after the Civil War helped the U.S. pay off debts it incurred during the fighting \u2014 and eventually achieve government budget surpluses.",
      "From 1866 to 1893, the U.S. ran nearly three straight decades of budget surpluses, fueled largely by tariffs and high domestic taxes on things like alcohol and tobacco, as well as the sale of federal lands. Paying down debt helped lower interest rates.",
      "Trump has even begun trumpeting what he calls the \u201cgreat tariff commission of 1887,\u201d which the president says was tasked with helping the government spend all those surpluses.",
      "Irwin said there was a tariff commission, but it was actually convened five years earlier in 1882. It also recommended reducing tariffs, which Congress didn\u2019t do.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say it was a political success. It\u2019s hard to say it was an economic success,\u201d Irwin said. \u201cBecause we spent a lot of the 1890s with double digit unemployment.\u201d",
      "That's because federal budget surpluses eventually began to effectively decrease the U.S. money supply and cause deflation. Meanwhile, higher tariffs increased the cost of living for many Americans, which, coupled with a financial crisis in Great Britain, helped trigger the Panic of 1893.",
      "That resulted in railroad bankruptcies, a stock market crash and a crushing recession in which unemployment reached 25% nationally. Then-President Cleveland's lack of solutions was a key factor in voters turning on him and the Democrats and toward McKinley three years later.",
      "Trump has used his opening weeks back in office to champion U.S. expansionism in ways unseen in the modern era.",
      "He\u2019s refused to rule out U.S. military forces seizing back control of the Panama Canal and suggested buying Greenland from Denmark, making Canada the 51st state and even working with Israel to put American developers in charge of turning the Gaza Strip into a seaside \u201cRiviera.\u201d",
      "There are echoes of McKinley there, because, as president, he moved to expand the reach of the U.S. The Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico became American territories as part of the treaty that ended the Spanish-American War in December 1898.",
      "But the comparison is not so easy. McKinley was also skeptical of U.S. expansionism, even writing himself a note at the start of the war and carrying it as a reminder, Merry said.",
      "\u201cWhile we are conducting war, and until its conclusion, we must keep all we get,\" the note said. \"When the war is over, we must keep what we want.\u201d",
      "Shortly after winning reelection in 1900, meanwhile, McKinley began rethinking tariffs, as a stronger and still-growing U.S. manufacturing base made him more appreciative of foreign markets.",
      "\u201cMcKinley began to see that, if we were going to be able to sell our goods overseas \u2014 as we were going to need to do because we would have more goods than we\u2019d have a market for \u2014 we were going to have to accept goods as well,\u201d Merry said.",
      "He said that McKinley gave a speech in Buffalo, New York, outlining \u201cthis concept of reciprocity, which was: I\u2019m prepared to bring down tariffs. Even me. Even William McKinley.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was his first big initiative after being reelected,\u201d Merry said.",
      "In that speech on Sept. 5, 1901, McKinley said, \u201cA policy of goodwill and friendly trade relations will prevent reprisals. Reciprocity treaties are in harmony with the spirit of the times. Measures of retaliation are not.\u201d",
      "Trump is now promising that similar, reciprocal tariffs will take effect next month. But actually successfully pulling that off will be another difference from McKinley, who never got the chance.",
      "The day after his Buffalo speech, McKinley was shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz. He died on Sept. 14, 1901.",

      "Canada\u2019s governing Liberals are set to choose a replacement for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau",
      "TORONTO -- Canada's governing Liberals will announce a replacement for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday as the country deals with U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats and as a federal election looms.",
      "Liberal Party members look set to pick former central bank governor Mark Carney as the new party leader and Canada's next prime minister in a vote to be announced on Sunday evening.",
      "Carney, 59, navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.",
      "The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. Trudeau announced his resignation in January, but remains prime minister until a successor is chosen and sworn in. Election laws mandate a general election before the fall, but one is expected this spring.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.",
      "The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party\u2019s chances in a parliamentary election expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving steadily in opinion polls.",
      "After decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada\u2019s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.",
      "Carney has picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister, but he lacks political experience.",
      "The other top Liberal leadership candidate is former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. Trudeau told Freeland in December that he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.",
      "The new leader is expected to trigger an election shortly afterward. Either the new Liberal party leader will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month."

      "Carney ran the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 and the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020. After helping Canada manage the worst impacts of the 2008 financial crisis, he was recruited to become the first non-Brit to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694.",
      "In 2020, he began serving as the United Nations' special envoy for climate action and finance.",
      "Carney is a former Goldman Sachs executive. He worked for 13 years in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. He has no experience in politics.",
      "Carney received a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from Harvard University in 1988, and master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in economics from Oxford University. Like many Canadians, he played ice hockey, serving as a backup goalie for Harvard.",
      "Carney has Canadian, U.K. and Irish citizenship. He has moved to eventually have solely Canadian citizenship, which is not required by law but seen as politically wise.",
      "His wife Diana is British-born and he has four daughters.",
      "His chances of remaining prime minister for more than a few weeks seem to be improving. In a mid-January poll by Nanos, the Liberals trailed the opposition Conservatives and their leader Pierre Poilievre 47% to 20%. This week the latest poll has Liberals at 34% and the Conservatives at 37%.",

      "BRUSSELS -- European Union leaders are trumpeting their endorsement of a plan to free up hundreds of billions of euros to inject into their defense budgets after the Trump administration warned that the continent must look after its own security, including Ukraine, in future.",
      "After more than 12 hours of talks on Thursday, the 27 leaders signed off on a scheme that would ease budget restrictions for defense spending, funnel some of the EU\u2019s unused funds toward security priorities and provide 150 billion euros ($162 billion) in loans for military purchases.",
      "As a priority, the funds would be spent on air and missile defense, artillery systems, ammunition, drones and air transport, as well as cyber systems, artificial intelligence and electronic warfare.",
      "The three-year war in Ukraine was also top of the agenda, but no obvious short-term solutions were found to keep the country in the fight, after the U.S. halted military support and intelligence sharing. No new weapons were pledged, no ready cash identified.",
      "Hungary also vetoed a joint statement on support to Ukraine, notably the stance of the 26 other member countries that their war-ravaged partner can only achieve \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d",
      "All 27 leaders agreed that the EU\u2019s executive branch, the European Commission, should loosen budget restrictions so countries that are willing can increase their military spending. The commission monitors whether members are keeping their debt under control.",
      "It estimates that around 650 billion euros ($702 billion) could be freed up that way, and could allow each country to spend at least 3% of their gross domestic product on defense. NATO\u2019s current guideline is that allies should spend at least 2%.",
      "Seven EU countries fall short of that figure, including heavyweights Italy and Spain.",
      "It remains to be seen whether countries that pledged to hit 2% more than a decade ago and still haven\u2019t are now willing, or even able, to dig deeper into their pockets.",
      "The commission also tabled a proposal for an offer of loans worth 150 billion euros ($162 billion) to buy new military equipment, with material priorities to be based on lessons learned from the battlefield in Ukraine. Air and missile defenses are right up there.",
      "The European Commission said it would raise the money on financial markets, and that around 20 member countries would benefit from the more favorable rates that it could generate.",
      "But the leaders did not welcome the idea with open arms. Instead, they invited EU headquarters staff \u201cto examine this proposal as a matter of urgency.\u201d",

      "Hungary\u2019s population totals around 9.5 million, a fraction of the EU\u2019s 450 million people.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dined with the leaders. He welcomed their security plans and expressed hope that some new spending could strengthen Ukraine\u2019s defense industry.",
      "Ukraine can make weapons more cheaply than elsewhere in Europe, and closer to the battlefields where they are needed.",
      "\u201cWe are very thankful that we are not alone, and these are not just words. We feel it. It\u2019s very important,\u201d Zelenskyy said, looking more relaxed among Europe\u2019s leaders in Brussels than when he received a verbal lashing from Trump in Washington last week.",
      "But the EU offered no new weapons, a day after Zelenskyy\u2019s hometown was bombed again, even though the leaders might argue that this was not the main goal of their summit.",
      "No discussion was held on whether to unblock the estimated 183 billion euros ($196 billion) in frozen Russian assets held in a Belgian clearing house, a pot of ready cash that could be seized if Europe was willing.",

      "The Trump administration has stalled at least $60 million in funding intended largely for affordable housing developments nationwide, throwing hundreds of projects into a precarious limbo, according to information and documents obtained by The Associated Press",
      "The move is part of a flurry of funding freezes, staffing cuts and contract cancellations by the Trump administration at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, changes that have instilled widespread uncertainty in the affordable housing industry.",
      "The some $60 million is intended to go to small community development nonprofits in small grants. The money is often used as seed funding for affordable housing projects, turning a concept into a viable development and consequently drawing in more public and private investment.",
      "Congress chose three nonprofits to distribute the grants, but HUD said in letters that it was cancelling contracts with two of the organizations which together were to distribute the $60 million. That's pushed millions in funding already promised to small nonprofits, or yet to be awarded, into the twilight zone.",
      "\u201cMany of those organizations have already committed funds to pay workers, such as HVAC technicians, local contractors, homeownership counselors,\u201d said Shaun Donovan, CEO of Enterprise Community Partners, one of the two groups whose contract was cancelled.",
      "\u201cThey will have to stop that work immediately. That will cost local jobs, hobble the creation of affordable homes, and stall opportunity in hundreds of communities.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for HUD said the program, called Section 4, will continue and is not being cut, but that \u201cthe department is consolidating some grants, while others remain.\"",
      "It remains unclear how or when the funding will arrive to the small nonprofits, which has thrown their work into disarray.",
      "\u201cNot knowing for me means we assume that the money is not coming, and that means that I have to pivot,\" said Jonathan Green, executive director of a nonprofit in Mississippi that's building a 36-unit affordable housing development in Biloxi.",
      "Green said about $20,000 in grant dollars are now in limbo, money that was meant to pay for an environmental review that could cost upwards of $10,000, and licenses and permits. That threatens discussions Green is having with potential partners and investors who want to see all the up-front work done first.",
      "\u201cMy fear is that, if the project stops altogether, we may never get it started again,\u201d he said.",
      "The development is supposed to be in East Biloxi, where lots still remain empty after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Before an ounce of dirt has been moved on the project, Green's organization has received enough calls from people eager to become tenants that they\u2019ve started a waiting list.",
      "That's the position hundreds of other small nonprofits have found themselves in, with not just their grant funds in question but investments on the line. For every dollar in grants disbursed by Enterprise Community Partners, the local nonprofits leverage another $95 in other capital, CEO Donovan said.",
      "Congress gave the national nonprofits the job of administering the grants, fielding and assessing hundreds of applications, so that the government doesn\u2019t have to, Donovan said.",
      "In one of the contract termination letters obtained by the AP, HUD said the contracts were cancelled at the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency. It said the group's operations \u201cwere not in compliance\" with Trump's executive order targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The letter also allows the organizations to appeal the termination.",
      "The Local Initiatives Support Corporation is the other group whose contract was cancelled.",
      "\u201cWithout access to this seed capital, housing projects for hardworking, families will stall, worsening shortages and pushing distressed neighbors into overcrowded conditions or homelessness,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Habitat for Humanity International is the third nonprofit disbursing the grants, but the organization has not responded to repeated requests for comment or said if their contract was cancelled.",

      "But Trump is still pressing ahead with other tariffs scheduled to take effect April 2. And the dizzying back-and-forth moves on tariffs is amping up uncertainty. U.S. businesses are already saying they\u2019re confronting \u201cchaos\u201d because of all the uncertainty coming out of Washington. while households are bracing for higher inflation.",

A solid job market so far, along with the solid spending by U.S. households that it\u2019s allowed, have been linchpins in preventing a recession. Economists are expecting to see an acceleration in hiring for February.",

      "Macy\u2019s on Thursday reported slightly weaker revenue for the end of 2024 than analysts expected, though its profit topped expectations. It also gave a forecast for profit in 2025 that fell short of analysts\u2019. Its shares fell 0.7%.",

      "German stocks rallied 1.5% as the market continues to feel reverberations from an agreement by the two parties that will form the country\u2019s next government to loosen constitutional limits on borrowing.

      "Former central banker Mark Carney looks set to become Canada\u2019s next prime minister after the governing Liberals announce a replacement for Justin Trudeau on Sunday",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Canada looks set to pick a measured former central banker to deal with the threats President Donald Trump's tariffs pose against a pillar of Western free trade.",
      "Mark Carney, 59, could become the next prime minister when the governing Liberal Party of Canada announces a replacement for Justin Trudeau in a leadership vote Sunday.",
      "The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. Trudeau announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until a successor is chosen. Election laws mandate a vote before October but one is expected sooner.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are cancelling trips south and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.",
      "The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party\u2019s chances in Parliamentary elections that are expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving steadily in opinion polls.",
      "After decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada\u2019s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.",
      "Carney navigated crises when he was the head of Canada\u2019s central bank and when he became the first non-citizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694.",
      "His appointment won bipartisan praise in Britain after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.",
      "Carney is credited with keeping money flowing through the Canadian economy by acting quickly in cutting interest rates to their lowest level ever of 1%, working with bankers to sustain lending through the crisis and, critically, letting the public know rates would remain low so they would keep borrowing.",
      "And it wasn\u2019t just that he had good policies \u2014 he sold them to the public in a way everyone could understand. He was the first central banker to commit to keep them at a historic low for a definite time, a step the U.S. Federal Reserve would follow.",
      "Carney has picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January.",
      "The other top Liberal leadership candidate is former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. Trudeau told Freeland in December he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.",
      "Three points turned the leadership race into a runaway for Carney. Freeland had a long association with the unpopular Trudeau. Carney worked hard to gather support from Liberal members of Parliament members. And Trump\u2019s tariff fixation was also pivotal, said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.",
      "\u201cLiberal backbenchers feared losing their seats and knew that Carney was more electable as their leader than Freeland,\u201d Wiseman said.",
      "The Liberal Party members will pick a new leader in a secret vote by about 140,000 members that will be announced on Sunday. The new leader is expected to trigger an election shortly afterward. Either the new Liberal party leader will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote this month.",
      "Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Carney\u2019s calm demeanor and outstanding resume make him a reassuring figure to many Canadians at a time when Trump is going after their country\u2019s economy and sovereignty.",
      "B\u00e9land said that style and profile stands in strong contrast to the Conservative Party's Pierre Poilievre, whom he called a true career politician who has embraced a populist rhetoric not unlike Trump's.",
      "Poilievre, 45, for years the party\u2019s go-to attack dog, is a firebrand populist who says he will to put \u201cCanada first.\u201d He attacks the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada\u2019s public broadcaster and cut taxes.",
      "\u201cThat works with his base but that is not welcomed by other Canadians, especially considering what the U.S. president is now saying about, and doing to, their country,\u201d B\u00e9land said.",
      "Poilievre urged Trump on Friday stop the attacks on Canada and \u201cthe monthly melodrama that is hurting our economies on both side of the border.\""

    "summary": "A union representing Transportation Security Administration workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision to end the collective bargaining agreement with them an &ldquo;unprovoked attack.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "A union representing Transportation Security Administration workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision to end the collective bargaining agreement with them an \u201cunprovoked attack.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the tens of thousands of frontline employees at the Transportation Security Administration, marking a major effort to dismantle union protections under the Trump administration. The TSA union called it on \u201cunprovoked attack\u201d and vowed to fight it.",
      "The department, in a statement announcing the termination, criticized the union whose staffers are responsible for keeping weapons off airplanes and protecting air travel. The department said that poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \u201cto safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from a top Democrat in Congress and the union.",
      "\u201cThis action will ensure Americans will have a more effective and modernized workforces across the nation\u2019s transportation networks,\" the agency said in a statement. \u201cTSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\u201d",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees is the union representing the TSA workers. The federation and the TSA's then-administrator, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement in May of last year. It came amid a push by Homeland Security to improve the pay for the frontline workers, whose pay has historically lagged behind that of other government employees. Pekoske has credited the pay increases, which went into effect in 2023, as helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "The union said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \u201ccompletely fabricated.\u201d",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers. AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\u201cOur union has been out in front challenging this administration\u2019s unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \u201cNow our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\u201d",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers\u2019 collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cvision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\u201d Stahl wrote. \u201cThis determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\u201d",
      "Stahl said the agency \u201cwill establish alternative procedures\u201d to address employee concerns and grievances \u201cin a fair and transparent manner.\u201d",
      "The end of the collective bargaining agreement was immediately slammed by the top Democrat on the Homeland Security committee in Congress, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, who praised the work of TSA staffers in protecting air travel.",
      "\u201cAttempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSince the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA\u2019s attrition rates have plummeted.\u201d",
      "Thompson also criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \u201cflat out wrong anti-union talking points.\u201d He said the real aim was \u201cdiminishing\u201d the workforce so \u201cthey can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\u201d",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

      "NFL MVP Josh Allen was rewarded with a contract extension worth $330 million, with an NFL record $250 million of it guaranteed, which makes him among the league\u2019s highest-paid players",
      "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- NFL MVP Josh Allen was rewarded Sunday with a contract extension worth $330 million, including an NFL record $250 million of it guaranteed, which makes him among the league\u2019s highest-paid players.",
      "The Buffalo Bills announced the agreement, while two people with knowledge of the deal revealed the contract's value to The Associated Press. The people spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because the Bills did not release that figure, which was first reported by ESPN.com.",
      "The new deal adds two years to Allen\u2019s contract and locks the 28-year-old in through the 2030 season.",
      "Cleveland quarterback DeShaun Watson's five-year contract signed in 2022 set the previous record in featuring $230 million in guarantees, per Spotrac.com. The total value of Allen's new contract ranks second behind Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes, who signed a 10-year, $450 million in 2020.",
      "Meanwhile, Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott tops the NFL list in averaging $60 million per season after signing a four-year, $240 million contract extension last summer.",
      "Allen's new contract follows his seventh NFL season in which he became the Bills third player to earn NFL MVP, and first since running back Thurman Thomas did so in 1991. The new deal eclipses Allen\u2019s previous contract, a six-year $258 million deal he signed with Buffalo in August 2021.",
      "Allen has established himself as one of the league\u2019s elite quarterbacks and rewritten nearly every franchise single-season passing and scoring record at his position. In doing so, he\u2019s overcome the many questions and criticisms he faced for being considered a raw and inaccurate player when Buffalo selected him with the No. 7 pick in the 2018 draft out of Wyoming.",
      "Just as important, Allen has solidified what had been an unsettled position in Buffalo since Hall of Famer Jim Kelly retired following the 1996 season. The Bills under Allen have won five consecutive AFC East titles and are on a six-year playoff run.",
      "Allen\u2019s MVP honor came during a season in which he essentially did more with what was considered less receiving talent around him. Adopting an \u201cEverybody Eats\u201d motto, Buffalo ran away with the AFC East by clinching the division with five games still left in a 13-win season and after the team traded top receiving option Stefon Diggs to Houston and lost No. 2 receiver Gabe Davis in free agency.",
      "Though Allen failed to top 4,000 yards for the first time since 2019, the quarterback enjoyed his most efficient season with a career-low six interceptions, a year after throwing a career-worst 18. Allen finished with 28 touchdowns passing, scored another 12 rushing and was credited with a touchdown receiving after completing a pass to Amari Cooper, who then lateralled the ball back to the quarterback.",
      "The only thing missing for Allen is a Super Bowl appearance. The Bills have reached the AFC championship game in 2020 and this past season only to lose both times to Kansas City.",
      "The new deal also follows a significant development in Allen\u2019s personal life. The quarterback proposed to actress and singer Hailee Steinfeld during the team\u2019s bye week in mid-November. Their relationship began in the spring of 2023, when pictures emerged of the two having dinner in New York City.",
      "Allen credited Steinfeld for playing a major supporting role in his career development.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s been a huge part. The morale, the support. When I get home, she\u2019s my biggest fan, my biggest supporter. She\u2019s just the best,\u201d Allen told the AP in December.",
      "The new contract is also expected to provide Buffalo much-needed savings under the salary cap entering the league\u2019s new business year, which opens Wednesday. The team was projected to be close to the cap limit after releasing veteran edge rusher Von Miller earlier in the day.",
      "And the deal follows GM Brandon Beane spending the past weeks locking in the young core of the team by signing fourth-year edge rusher Greg Rousseau and third-year players linebacker Terrel Bernard and receiver Khalil Shakir to four-year contract extensions.",
      "A two-time All-Pro, Allen\u2019s 76 wins, 262 total touchdowns and 30,595 total yards are the most by any NFL player through their first seven seasons in the league.",
      "From a team perspective, Allen holds the top two single-season passing yards records topped by his 4,544 in 2020 and last season he passed Kelly for most total touchdowns with 262. Among the single-season team records he holds are most TD passes (37 in 2020), most completions (646 in 2021), best completion rate (69.2 percent in 2020).",

      "An F1 title fight can often come down to developing and refining a car throughout the year. Mid-season upgrades were crucial to McLaren winning the constructors' title for the first time in 26 years in 2024, while Red Bull's late tweaks helped Max Verstappen defend his drivers' title.",
      "The problem is that teams that start 2025 poorly could choose to abandon development work on the current car and focus all energy on next year, which brings sweeping changes to cars and engines alike.",
      "A head start could yield big gains for years to come.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very, very busy year for us,\u201d said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who is balancing Verstappen's bid for a fifth consecutive title in 2025, the team's 2026 project, and a new Ford engine for next year. F1's spending cap means \u201cit\u2019s the same money for everybody, but you will apply your resource accordingly,\u201d Horner said.",
      "Red Bull was the undisputed winner the last time there was a big regulation change, even though it had just won the drivers' title with Verstappen.",
      "Red Bull's 2022 car embraced ground-effect aerodynamics far better than the opposition, and especially its 2021 title rival Mercedes, whose design was visually striking but way off the pace. Red Bull has won 47 races since then, Mercedes just five.",
      "Even the standings enforce future suffering as the price for present success. The worst-performing teams are allowed extra time to develop aerodynamics in vast and costly wind tunnels. The champion gets the least.",
      "Red Bull was third in the constructors' standings last season, largely because of Sergio Perez's run of poor form, so it gets a little more wind tunnel time this season than McLaren or Ferrari.",

      "A group of Ukrainian war veteran amputees have been in Oregon learning a form of adaptive skiing for people with one leg",
      "HOODOO SKI AREA, Ore. -- Ukrainian war veteran Oleksandr Shvachka lost his left leg to Russian tank fire outside Kyiv. Three years on, the latest step in his physical and mental rehabilitation recently unfolded under a brilliant blue sky on a snow-covered mountain more than 5,000 miles (8,047 kilometers) away.",
      "Shvachka, 38, was one of five Ukrainian veterans who came to the Pacific Northwest for ski lessons this month with Oregon Adaptive Sports, an organization working to make sports more accessible to people with disabilities.",
      "On a recent day, he listened attentively to an instructor before launching himself down a slope at Hoodoo Ski Area in central Oregon, leaning on two hand-held \u201coutriggers,\u201d which resemble forearm crutches with short skis at the ends, for turns and balance as he picked up speed.",
      "Shvachka was wounded in the village of Makariv outside the capital of Kyiv in March 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine the previous month. He said skiing on the mountain was an \u201camazing emotion.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a new experience, and I\u2019m so happy,\u201d he said.",
      "The Oregon city of Corvallis has been sister cities with Uzhhorod in western Ukraine for over 30 years. Its sister city association is hosting the veterans, some of whom have been recovering in Uzhhorod\u2019s rehabilitation hospital, as well as two Ukrainian ski coaches, association co-founder Carol Paulson said.",
      "The ski program's goal is to improve the veterans\u2019 physical and mental health and teach the Ukrainian ski coaches how to use adaptive ski equipment so they can share that knowledge with the war-torn country\u2019s thousands of amputees. The group had four days of lessons over the course of two weeks.",
      "\u201cIt reminds them that they can participate fully in life,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cThe best thing is the feeling that they get not only of independence, but just of well-being.\u201d",
      "In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Paulson taught adaptive skiing to Vietnam War veterans who had lost limbs. She saw how being active on the mountain improved their mood and wanted to offer the same experience to Ukrainian war veterans.",
      "\u201cThe peacefulness of skiing compared to other sports, too, is special,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet. You have the pristine snow and the breeze of the wind.\u201d",
      "For Shvachka, adaptive sports have been key in his physical and mental rehabilitation, while the other veterans provide motivation, he said.",
      "In 2023, with his prosthetic leg, Schvachka ran a 10K race organized by the U.S. Marine Corps in Washington, D.C., and competed with other Ukrainian veteran amputees in Arnold Classic Europe, an offshoot of a fitness and body-building competition founded by Arnold Schwarzenegger.",
      "In that multi-sport event, a group of eight veterans used ropes to pull four semitruck cabs weighing 35 tons (31.7 metric tons) over 65 feet (20 meters) in a little more than 30 seconds, according to the event's Instagram page, which described it as a strongman world record.",
      "Pat Addabbo, executive director of Oregon Adaptive Sports, said the ski lessons highlight the transformative power of sport.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing here today is a great example of that \u2014 people from across the world, coming to our little ski area here in Oregon, to learn these life-changing skills that they hopefully can take home with them and teach others,\" Addabbo said.",
      "The Ukrainian veterans and ski instructors will take outriggers with them back to Ukraine so they can start teaching three-track skiing using one full-size ski and two outriggers to others who have lost limbs.",
      "\u201cI think we are starting a new era of our war veteran rehabilitation program,\u201d said Kristian Minai, one of the Ukrainian instructors.",
      "Minai also coaches Ukraine's national deaf ski team and is working on developing a national Paralympics ski team.",
      "\u201cMaybe, some day, we will see them from the podium in the Paralympic Games,\" he added with a smile."

      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When artificial intelligence-backed tractors became available to vineyards, Tom Gamble wanted to be an early adopter. He knew there would be a learning curve, but Gamble decided the technology was worth figuring out.",
      "The third-generation farmer bought one autonomous tractor. He plans on deploying its self-driving feature this spring and is currently using the tractor's AI sensor to map his Napa Valley vineyard. As it learns each row, the tractor will know where to go once it is used autonomously. The AI within the machine will then process the data it collects and help Gamble make better-informed decisions about his crops \u2014 what he calls \u201cprecision farming.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to completely replace the human element of putting your boot into the vineyard, and that\u2019s one of my favorite things to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be able to allow you to work more smartly, more intelligently and in the end, make better decisions under less fatigue.\u201d",
      "Gamble said he anticipates using the tech as much as possible because of \u201ceconomic, air quality and regulatory imperatives.\u201d Autonomous tractors, he said, could help lower his fuel use and cut back on pollution.",
      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce. New agricultural tech like AI can help farmers to cut back on waste, and to run more efficient and sustainable vineyards by monitoring water use and helping determine when and where to use products like fertilizers or pest control. AI-backed tractors and irrigation systems, farmer say, can minimize water use by analyzing soil or vines, while also helping farmers to manage acres of vineyards by providing more accurate data on the health of a crop or what a season\u2019s yield will be.",
      "Other facets of the wine industry have also started adopting the tech, from using generative AI to create custom wine labels to turning to ChatGPT to develop, label and price an entire bottle.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anybody losing their job, because I think that a tractor operator\u2019s skills are going to increase and as a result, and maybe they\u2019re overseeing a small fleet of these machines that are out there, and they\u2019ll be compensated as a result of their increased skill level,\u201d he said.",
      "Farmers, Gamble said, are always evolving. There were fears when the tractor replaced horses and mules pulling plows, but that technology \u201cproved itself\u201d just like AI farming tech will, he said, adding that adopting any new tech always takes time.",
      "Companies like John Deere have started using the AI that wine farmers are beginning to adopt. The agricultural giant uses \u201cSmart Apply\u201d technology on tractors, for example, helping growers apply material for crop retention by using sensors and algorithms to sense foliage on grape canopies, said Sean Sundberg, business integration manager at John Deere.",
      "The tractors that use that tech then only spray \u201cwhere there are grapes or leaves or whatnot so that it doesn\u2019t spray material unnecessarily,\u201d he said. Last year, the company announced a project with Sonoma County Winegrowers to use tech to help wine grape growers maximize their yield.",
      "Tyler Klick, partner at Redwood Empire Vineyard Management, said his company has started automating irrigation valves at the vineyards it helps manage. The valves send an alert in the event of a leak and will automatically shut off if they notice an \u201cexcessive\u201d water flow rate.",
      "\u201cThat valve is actually starting to learn typical water use,\u201d Klick said. \u201cIt\u2019ll learn how much water is used before the production starts to fall off.\u201d",
      "Klick said each valve costs roughly $600, plus $150 per acre each year to subscribe to the service.",
      "\u201cOur job, viticulture, is to adjust our operations to the climatic conditions we\u2019re dealt,\u201d Klick said. \u201cI can see AI helping us with finite conditions.\u201d",
      "Angelo A. Camillo, a professor of wine business at Sonoma State University, said that despite excitement over AI in the wine industry, some smaller vineyards are more skeptical about their ability to use the technology. Small, family-owned operations, which Camillo said account for about 80% of the wine business in America, are slowly disappearing \u2014 many don\u2019t have the money to invest in AI, he said. A robotic arm that helps put together pallets of wine, for example, can cost as much as $150,000, he said.",
      "\u201cFor small wineries, there\u2019s a question mark, which is the investment. Then there\u2019s the education. Who\u2019s going to work with all of these AI applications? Where is the training?\u201d he said.",
      "There are also potential challenges with scalability, Camillo added. Drones, for example, could be useful for smaller vineyards that could use AI to target specific crops that have a bug problem, he said \u2014 it would be much harder to operate 100 drones in a 1,000 acre vineyard while also employing the IT workers who understand the tech.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think a person can manage 40 drones as a swarm of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a constraint for the operators to adopt certain things.\u201d",
      "However, AI is particularly good at tracking a crop\u2019s health \u2013 including how the plant itself is doing and whether it\u2019s growing enough leaves \u2013 while also monitoring grapes to aid in yield projections, said Mason Earles, an assistant professor who leads the Plant AI and Biophysics Lab at UC Davis.",
      "Diseases or viruses can sneak up and destroy entire vineyards, Earles said, calling it an \u201celephant in the room\u201d across the wine industry. The process of replanting a vineyard and getting it to produce well takes at least five years, he said. AI can help growers determine which virus is affecting their plants, he said, and whether they should rip out some crops immediately to avoid losing their entire vineyard.",
      "Earles, who is also cofounder of the AI-powered farm management platform Scout, said his company uses AI to process thousands of images in hours and extract data quickly \u2014 something that would be difficult by hand in large vineyards that span hundreds of acres. Scout's AI platform then counts and measures the number of grape clusters as early as when a plant is beginning to flower in order to forecast what a yield will be.",
      "The sooner vintners know how much yield to expect, the better they can \u201cdial in\u201d their wine making process, he added.",
      "\u201cPredicting what yields you\u2019re going to have at the end of the season, no one is that good at it right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really important because it determines how much labor contract you\u2019re going to need and the supplies you\u2019ll need for making wine.\u201d",
      "Earles doesn\u2019t think the budding use of AI in vineyards is \u201cfreaking farmers out.\u201d Rather, he anticipates that AI will be used more frequently to help with difficult field labor and to discern problems in vineyards that farmers need help with.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve seen people trying to sell them tech for decades. It\u2019s hard to farm; it\u2019s unpredictable compared to most other jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe walking and counting, I think people would have said a long time ago, \u2018I would happily let a machine take over.\u2019\u201d",

      "The driverless technology from Nissan Motor Corp., which uses 14 cameras, nine radars and six LiDar sensors installed in and around the vehicle, highlights Japan's eagerness to catch up with players like Google\u2019s Waymo that have taken the lead in the U.S.",
      "Japan, home to the world\u2019s top automakers, has not kept pace with the global shift to autonomous driving, so far led by China and the U.S. But momentum is building.",
      "Waymo is going to land in Japan this year. Details haven't been disclosed, but it has a partnership with major cab company Nihon Kotsu, which will oversee and manage their all-electric Jaguar I-PACE sport-utility vehicles, first in the Tokyo area, still with a human cab driver riding along.",
      "During Nissan's demonstration, the streets were bustling with other cars and pedestrians. The vehicle stayed within the maximum speed limit in the area of 40 kph (25 mph), its destination set with a smartphone app.",

      "\u201cHow the sensors must be adapted to the car\u2019s movements, or to monitor sensors and computers to ensure reliability and safety requires an understanding of the auto system overall,\u201d he said during a recent demonstration that took reporters on a brief ride.",
      "Nissan\u2019s technology, being tested on its Serena minivan, is still technically at the industry's Level Two because a person sits before a remote-control panel in a separate location outside the vehicle, in this case, at the automaker's headquarters, and is ready to step in if the technology fails.",
      "Nissan also has a human sitting in the front passenger seat during the test rides, who can take over the driving, if needed. Unless there is a problem, the people in the remote control room and the passenger seat are doing nothing.",
      "Nissan plans to have 20 such vehicles moving in the Yokohama area in the next couple of years, with the plan to reach Level Four, which means no human involvement even as backup, by 2029 or 2030.",

      "So far, Japan has approved the use of so-called Level Four autonomous vehicles in a rural area in Fukui Prefecture, but those look more like golf carts. A Level Four bus is scuttling around a limited area near Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport. But its maximum speed is 12 kmph (7.5 mph). Nissan's autonomous vehicle is a real car, capable of all its mechanical workings and speed levels.",

      "University of Tokyo Professor Takeo Igarashi, who specializes in computer and information technology, believes challenges remain because it\u2019s human nature to be more alarmed by accidents with driverless vehicles than regular crashes.",
      "\u201cIn human driving, the driver takes responsibility. It\u2019s so clear. But nobody is driving so you don\u2019t know who will take responsibility,\u201d Igarashi told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIn Japan, the expectation for commercial services is very high. The customer expects perfect quality for any service \u2014 restaurants or drivers or anything. This kind of auto-driving is a service form a company, and everybody expects high quality and perfection. Even a small mistake is not acceptable.\u201d",

      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "The threat to a rare whale species from getting tangled in fishing gear has prompted Monterey Bay Aquarium in California to caution against eating a variety of lobster that New England fishermen have harvested for centuries.",
      "Seafood Watch, a conservation program operated by the aquarium, placed lobster from the U.S. and Canada on its do-not-eat \u201cred list\u201d in 2022. Some retailers pulled lobster from stores after the recommendation.",
      "Judge John Woodcock ruled last month that the fishermen made a case that they suffered damage to their industry's reputation as a result of the red-listing, after the aquarium made a bid in U.S. District Court in Maine to have the 2023 lawsuit tossed. A spokesperson for the aquarium said Monday the institution filed an appeal, but Woodcock's ruling means the lawsuit is moving forward.",
      "\u201cReputation and goodwill cannot be adequately replaced through awarding damages and this injury lingers as long as the \u2018red listing\u2019 does,\u201d Woodcock wrote.",
      "The lobster industry, based largely in Maine, is one of the most lucrative fisheries in the U.S., valued at more than half a billion dollars at the docks last year. Entanglement in lobster gear is also one of the most significant threats to the North Atlantic right whale, which numbers less than 400.",
      "The aquarium has a right to communicate its recommendations to the public, said Emerson Brown, the spokesperson for the aquarium. Brown said the aquarium appealed \"to protect our ability to share critical information with the public.\u201d",

      "Two pioneers in the field of reinforcement learning, Andrew Barto and Richard Sutton, are the winners of this year's A.M. Turing Award, the tech world's equivalent of the Nobel Prize.",
      "Research that Barto, 76, and Sutton, 67, began in the late 1970s paved the way for some of the past decade's AI breakthroughs. At the heart of their work was channeling so-called \u201chedonistic\u201d machines that could continuously adapt their behavior in response to positive signals.",
      "Reinforcement learning is what led a Google computer program to beat the world's best human players of the ancient Chinese board game Go in 2016 and 2017. It's also been a key technique in improving popular AI tools like ChatGPT, optimizing financial trading and helping a robotic hand solve a Rubik's Cube.",
      "But Barto said the field was \"not fashionable\u201d when he and his doctoral student, Sutton, began crafting their theories and algorithms at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.",
      "\u201cWe were kind of in the wilderness,\u201d Barto said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWhich is why it\u2019s so gratifying to receive this award, to see this becoming more recognized as something relevant and interesting. In the early days, it was not.\u201d",
      "Google sponsors the annual $1 million prize, which was announced Wednesday by the Association for Computing Machinery.",
      "Barto, now retired from the University of Massachusetts, and Sutton, a longtime professor at Canada's University of Alberta, aren't the first AI pioneers to win the award named after British mathematician, codebreaker and early AI thinker Alan Turing. But their research has directly sought to answer Turing's 1947 call for a machine that \u201ccan learn from experience\u201d \u2014 which Sutton describes as \u201carguably the essential idea of reinforcement learning.\u201d",
      "In particular, they borrowed from ideas in psychology and neuroscience about the way that pleasure-seeking neurons respond to rewards or punishment. In one landmark paper published in the early 1980s, Barto and Sutton set their new approach on a specific task in a simulated world: balance a pole on a moving cart to keep it from falling. The two computer scientists later co-authored a widely used textbook on reinforcement learning.",
      "\u201cThe tools they developed remain a central pillar of the AI boom and have rendered major advances, attracted legions of young researchers, and driven billions of dollars in investments,\u201d said Google\u2019s chief scientist Jeff Dean in a written statement.",
      "In a joint interview with the AP, Barto and Sutton didn't always agree on how to evaluate the risks of AI agents that are constantly seeking to improve themselves. They also distinguished their work from the branch of generative AI technology that is currently in fashion \u2014 the large language models behind chatbots made by OpenAI, Google and other tech giants that mimic human writing and other media.",
      "\u201cThe big choice is, do you try to learn from people\u2019s data, or do you try to learn from an (AI) agent\u2019s own life and its own experience?\u201d Sutton said.",
      "Sutton has dismissed what he describes as overblown concerns about AI's threat to humanity, while Barto disagreed and said \u201cYou have to be cognizant of potential unexpected consequences.\u201d",
      "Barto, retired for 14 years, describes himself as a Luddite, while Sutton is embracing a future he expects to have beings of greater intelligence than current humans \u2014 an idea sometimes known as posthumanism.",

      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- A federal judge has denied Elon Musk's request for a court order blocking OpenAI from converting itself to a for-profit company but said she could expedite a trial to consider Musk's claims against the ChatGPT maker and its CEO.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled late Tuesday that \u201cMusk has not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits\u201d in his request for a preliminary injunction. She offered to hold a trial in her California courtroom as soon as this fall, \u201cgiven the public interest at stake and potential for harm if a conversion contrary to law occurred.\u201d",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker and CEO Sam Altman a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit.",
      "He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was unfairly stifling business competition.",
      "He and a group of investors more recently made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy a controlling stake in the nonprofit \u2014 a move that undermined Musk\u2019s \u201cclaim of irreparable harm,\u201d the judge wrote.",

      "Gonzalez Rogers in a hearing last month called it a \u201cstretch\u201d to claim \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Musk, and she called the case \u201cbillionaires vs. billionaires.\u201d She questioned why Musk invested tens of millions in OpenAI without a written contract. Toberoff responded that it was because the relationship between Altman and Musk at the time was \u201cbuilt on trust\u201d and the two were very close.",
      "\u201cThat is just a lot of money\u201d to invest \u201con a handshake,\u201d the judge said.",
      "The dispute has roots in a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "Emails disclosed by OpenAI show Musk had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers, appointed by then-President Barack Obama in 2011, has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple\u2019s fight with Epic Games, though she said last month that Musk\u2019s case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one.

Monarchs from east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada overwinter there.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Commission for National Protected Areas (CONANP) said that this year, butterflies covered 4.4 acres (1.79 hectares) compared to only 2.2 acres (0.9 hectares) the year before. Last year\u2019s figure represented a 59% drop from 2023, the second lowest level since record keeping began.",
      "After wintering in Mexico, the iconic butterflies with black and orange wings fly north, breeding multiple generations along the way for thousands of miles. The offspring that reach southern Canada begin the trip back to Mexico at the end of summer.",
      "Gloria Tavera Alonso, the Mexican agency\u2019s director general of conservation, said the improved numbers owed to better climatic factors and humidity. Drought along the butterflies\u2019 migratory route had been listed as a factor in last year\u2019s decline.",
      "The impact of changes in weather year after year mean fluctuations are expected. For that, Jorge Rickards, Mexico director general for the World Wildlife Fund, said \u201cyou can't let down your guard\u201d and must continue to expand conservation efforts.",
      "Tavera Alonso credited ongoing efforts to increase the number of plants the butterflies rely on for sustenance and reproduction along their flyway.",

The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced in February that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023.

      "Experts say that monarchs face risks across North America in large part due to the reduction in milkweed where the monarchs lay their eggs. The plant has been disappearing due to drought, wildfires, herbicides and urbanization.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Early humans were regularly using animal bones to make cutting tools 1.5 million years ago.",
      "A newly discovered cache of 27 carved and sharpened bones from elephants and hippos found in Tanzania's Olduvai Gorge site pushes back the date for ancient bone tool use by around 1 million years. Researchers know that early people made simple tools from stones as early as 3.3 million years ago.",
      "The new discovery, published Wednesday in Nature, reveals that ancient humans \u201chad rather more complex tool kits than previously we thought,\u201d incorporating a variety of materials, said William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the research.",
      "The well-preserved bone tools, measuring up to around 16 inches (40 centimeters), were likely made by breaking off the thick ends of leg bones and using a stone to knock off flakes from the remaining bone shaft. This technique was used to create one sharpened edge and one pointed tip, said study co-author Ignacio de la Torre, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council.",
      "The bone tools were \u201cprobably used as a hand axe\u201d \u2013 a handheld blade that\u2019s not mounted on a stick \u2013 for butchering dead animals, he said.",
      "Such a blade would be handy for removing meat from elephant and hippo carcasses, but not used as a spear or projectile point. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe they were hunting these animals. They were probably scavenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Some of the artifacts show signs of having been struck to remove flakes more than a dozen times, revealing persistent craftsmanship.",
      "The uniform selection of the bones \u2013 large and heavy leg bones from specific animals \u2013 and the consistent pattern of alteration makes it clear that early humans deliberately chose and carved these bones, said M\u00edrian Pacheco, a paleobiologist at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The bone show minimal signs of erosion, trampling or gnawing by other animals \u2014 ruling out the possibility that natural causes resulted in the tool shapes, she added.",
      "The bone tools date from more than a million years before our species, Homo sapiens, arose around 300,000 years ago.",
      "At the time the tools were made, three different species of human ancestors lived in the same region of East Africa, said Briana Pobiner, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The tools may have been made and used by Homo erectus, Homo habilis or Paranthropus boisei. \u201cIt could have been any of these three, but it\u2019s almost impossible to know which one,\u201d said Pobiner.",

      "Extinction is still forever",
      "WASHINGTON -- Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts \u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Since then, the company has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \u201cengineer them into living animals,\u201d said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you\u2019re not bringing back the ancient past,\u201d said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \u201cColossal woolly mouse.\u201d",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\u201d said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \u201cmake it a lot more efficient and easier,\u201d said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \u201cpresent already in some living mice,\u201d said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \u201cwe put them all together in a single mouse.\u201d",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \u201ca lot of processes and red tape\u201d before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \u201cde-extinction.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it\u2019s not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It\u2019s changing an Asian elephant,\u201d said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal\u2019s technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of how we monetize our business,\u201d said Lamm.",

      "Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have to wait until their replacements arrive at the International Space Station next week before they can check out later this month.",
      "They\u2019ll be joined on their SpaceX ride home by two astronauts who launched by themselves in September alongside two empty seats.",
      "During a news conference Tuesday, Wilmore said that while politics is part of life, it did not play into his and Williams' return, moved up a couple weeks thanks to a change in SpaceX capsules. President Donald Trump and SpaceX's Elon Musk said at the end of January that they wanted to accelerate the astronauts' return, blaming the previous administration.",
      "But Williams, in response to a question, did take issue with Musk's recent call to dump the space station in two years, rather than waiting until NASA's projected deorbit in 2031. She noted all the scientific research being performed at the orbiting lab.",
      "\u201cThis place is ticking. It's just really amazing, so I would say we're actually in our prime right now,\u201d said Williams, a three-time space station resident. \u201cI would think that right now is probably not the right time to say quit, call it quits.\u201d",
      "Williams said she can't wait to be reunited with her Labrador retrievers. The hardest part about the unexpected extended stay, she added, was the wait by their families back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,\" she said. \u201cWe're here. We have a mission. We're just just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched last June aboard Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule, making its crew debut after years of delay. The Starliner had so many problems getting to the space station that NASA ruled it too dangerous to carry anyone and it flew back empty.",
      "Their homecoming was further delayed by extra completion time needed for the brand new SpaceX capsule that was supposed to deliver their replacements.",
      "Last month, NASA announced the next crew would launch in a used capsule instead, pushing up liftoff to March 12. The two crews will spend about a week together aboard the space station before Wilmore and Williams depart with NASA\u2019s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency\u2019s Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Wilmore and Williams \u2014 retired Navy captains and repeat space fliers \u2014 have insisted over the months that they are healthy and committed to the mission as long as it takes. They took a spacewalk together in January.",
      "They will wear generic SpaceX flight suits for the ride back, not the usual custom-made outfits bearing their names because their trip home in a Dragon capsule was unplanned. That's fine with them, although Wilmore hinted he might use a pen to write his name on his suit.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just Butch and Suni,\" Williams said. \u201cEverybody knows who we are by now.\"",

      "China is denying the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s accusations against 12 Chinese nationals charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Twelve Chinese nationals \u2014 including mercenary hackers, law enforcement officers and employees of a private hacking company \u2014 have been charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities, the Justice Department says.",
      "A set of criminal cases filed in New York and Washington add new detail to what U.S. officials said Wednesday is a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem in China, in which private companies and contractors are paid by the Chinese government to target victims of particular interest to Beijing in an arrangement meant to provide Chinese state security forces cover and deniability.",
      "The indictments come as the U.S. government has warned of an increasingly sophisticated cyber threat from China, such as a hack last year of telecom firms called Salt Typhoon that gave Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, including U.S. government officials and prominent public figures.",
      "One indictment charges eight leaders and employees of a private hacking company known as I-Soon with conducting a sweeping array of computer breaches around the world meant to suppress speech, locate dissidents and steal data from victims. Among those charged is Wu Haibo, who founded I-Soon in Shanghai in 2010 and was a member of China's first hacktivist group, Green Army, and who is accused in the indictment of overseeing and directing hacking operations.",
      "Earlier reporting by The Associated Press on leaked documents from I-Soon mainly showed I-Soon was targeting a wide range of governments such as India, Taiwan or Mongolia, but little on the United States.",
      "But the indictment contains new revelations about I-Soon\u2019s activities targeting a wide range of Chinese dissidents, religious organizations and media outlets based in the U.S., including a newspaper identified as publishing news related to China and opposed to the Chinese Communist Party. Other targets included individual critics of China living in the U.S., the Defense Intelligence Agency and a research university.",
      "The targets were in some cases directed by China's Ministry of Public Security \u2014 two law enforcement officers were charged with tasking certain assignments \u2014 but in other instances the hackers acted at their own initiative and tried to sell the stolen information to the government afterward, the indictment says.",
      "The company charged the Chinese government the equivalent of between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully hacked, officials said.",
      "Phone numbers listed for I-Soon on a Chinese corporate registry rang unanswered, and I-Soon representatives did not immediately respond to an AP email requesting comment Wednesday.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday denied the charges, calling the U.S. \u201chypocritical\" and pointing to U.S. cyberattacks on China.",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes the groundless accusation made by the US and urges the US to immediately stop abusing sanctions,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference in Beijing.",
      "A separate indictment charges two other Chinese hackers, identified as Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, in a for-profit hacking campaign that targeted victims including U.S. technology companies, think tanks, defense contractors and health care systems. Among the targets was the U.S. Treasury Department, which disclosed a breach by Chinese actors late last year in what it called a \u201cmajor cybersecurity incident.\u201d",
      "The Treasury Department announced sanctions Wednesday in connection with the hacking, and the State Department announced multimillion-dollar rewards for information about the defendants.",
      "I-Soon is part of a sprawling industry in China, documented in an AP investigation last year, of private hacking contractors that steal data from other countries to sell to the Chinese authorities.",
      "Over the past two decades, Chinese state security\u2019s demand for overseas intelligence has soared, giving rise to a vast network of these private hackers-for-hire companies that have infiltrated hundreds of systems outside China.",
      "China\u2019s hacking industry rose in the early days of the internet, when Wu and other Chinese hackers declared themselves \u201cred hackers\u201d \u2014 patriots who offered their services to the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast to the anti-establishment ethos popular among many coders.",
      "The indictment \u201cproved the close ties and interaction among China\u2019s first generation patriotic hackers,\u201d said Mei Danowski, a cybersecurity analyst who wrote about I-Soon on her blog, Natto Thoughts. They \u201call turned to entrepreneurs now \u2014 doing businesses with the governments and making profits through other means.\u201d",
      "Since I-Soon documents were leaked online last year, the company has been suffering but is still in operation, according to Chinese corporate records. They've downsized and moved offices.",
      "\"Apparently i-SOON companies have been struggling to survive,\" Danowski wrote on her blog. \u201cTo Chinese state agencies, a company like i-SOON is disposable.\u201d",

      "The justices acted on an unusual Republican effort to file suit in the Supreme Court over the Democratic states' use of their own state courts to sue fossil fuel companies for deceiving the public about the risks of their products contributing to climate change.",
      "The Supreme Court typically hears only appeals, but the Constitution gives the court authority to hear original lawsuits states file against each other.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is signaling that the Trump administration has finished its six-week dismantling of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development",
      "WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday the Trump administration had finished its six-week purge of programs of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development, and said he would move the 18% of aid and development programs that survived under the State Department.",
      "Rubio made the announcement in a post on X. It marked one of his relatively few public comments on what has been a historic shift away from U.S. foreign aid and development, executed by Trump political appointees at State and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency teams.",
      "Rubio in the post thanked DOGE and \u201cour hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform\u201d in foreign aid.",
      "President Donald Trump on Jan. 20 issued an executive order directing a freeze of foreign assistance funding and a review of all of the tens of billions of dollars of U.S. aid and development work abroad. Trump charged that much of foreign assistance was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.",
      "Rubio's social media post Monday said that review was now \u201cofficially ending,\" with some 5,200 of USAID's 6,200 programs eliminated.",
      "Those programs \u201cspent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States,\u201d Rubio wrote.",
      "\u201cIn consultation with Congress, we intend for the remaining 18% of programs we are keeping ... to be administered more effectively under the State Department,\u201d he said. Democratic lawmakers and others call the shutdown of congressionally-funded programs illegal, saying such a move requires Congress' approval.",
      "The State Department in one of multiple lawsuits it is battling over its rapid shutdown of USAID had said earlier this month it was killing more than 90% of USAID programs. Rubio gave no explanation for why his number was lower, and no details of what programs were spared or how the State Department would run them.",
      "The dismantling of USAID that followed Trump's order upended decades of policy that humanitarian and development aid abroad advanced U.S. national security by stabilizing regions and economies, strengthening alliances and building goodwill.",
      "In the weeks after Trump's order, one of his appointees and transition team members, Pete Marocco, and Musk pulled USAID staff around the world off the job through forced leaves and firings, shut down USAID payments overnight and terminated aid and development contracts by the thousands.",
      "Contractors and staffers running efforts ranging from epidemic control to famine prevention to job and democracy training stopped work. Aid groups and other USAID partners laid off tens of thousands of their workers in the U.S. and abroad.",
      "Lawsuits brought by some of the nonprofit groups and businesses that had partnered with USAID say the form-letter contract terminations purge eliminated even programs that Rubio had said he wanted to save, violated the contract terms and stiffed aid groups and businesses of billions of dollars.",
      "The shutdown has left many USAID staffers and contractors and their families still overseas, many of them awaiting U.S.-paid back payments and travel expenses back home.",

      "For decades, the Presidential Management Fellows program was seen as a building block for the civil service with the expectation that the few who earned the position would one day become leaders in the federal workforce. Now the road ahead is uncertain. Hundreds of the fellows have been terminated or placed on administrative leave amid a nationwide slashing of the federal workforce.",
      "One of President Donald Trump's executive orders ended the program, which was created in 1978 to entice highly qualified workers with advanced degrees to join the federal government.",
      "Trump's Republican administration had ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers in one fell swoop. That included recent classes of the fellows program, which has a two-year probationary period.",
      "Fellows had persevered through an intense selection process that included multiple tests and evaluations as well as a blind interview. The agency website said about 10% of applicants are accepted, although that number has been recently as low as just 3%.",
      "Charles Conyers, an Office of Personnel Management retiree who was a fellow in the class of 2003, said he was saddened and puzzled about the administration eliminating a program that brought to the government some of the \"brightest minds in America.\u201d He said losing their skills and ending a program that attracted and groomed exceptional future leaders was tragic.",

All would welcome, if given a chance, the opportunity to get back to work and use their expertise.",

      "On Feb. 19, during the week finalists would have been named, the Trump administration announced an executive order cutting the program.",
      "Kauffman, 45, said she was crushed by the decision and worries that the mass layoffs and dissolution of the fellows program will forever change public service.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to decimate something but so much harder to rebuild,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I worry that the incredibly talented people who may have been my cohort or colleagues are going to go elsewhere, and there will be an incredible brain drain. It\u2019s such a loss for the American people.\u201d",
      "Sydney Smith, 28, said many of the fellows were shocked at being let go because they came in to the government with ideas on how to make it more efficient.",
      "Smith studied chemistry as an undergraduate student at Willamette University in Oregon before going on to study accounting at George Washington University. She heard about the presidential fellows program but was skeptical she would get in because of the low acceptance rate.",
      "After she made it as a finalist in 2023, she started working for the U.S. Forest Service as an accountant. She\u2019s a backpacker who loves the outdoors and is passionate about making public lands accessible. It was a perfect fit.",

      "McKenzie Hartman, 26, was an economist for the IRS research division in Ogden, Utah, when she received an email Feb. 19 that she should return to the office with all her equipment.",

      "Hartman lost access to her office's video conferencing software and couldn't join her colleagues for her own goodbye gathering. She had to call in instead. Her termination letter came the following weekend.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to get a letter terminating you for performance when everyone around you is saying incredible things about your performance,\u201d Hartman said.",
      "Since then, she has been applying for jobs and embarked on a road trip with her partner through several national parks, where she\u2019s seen protests against the Trump administration\u2019s cuts.",

      "In President Donald Trump\u2019s idealized framing, the United States was at its zenith in the 1890s",
      "WASHINGTON -- In President Donald Trump's idealized framing, the United States was at its zenith in the 1890s, when top hats and shirtwaists were fashionable and typhoid fever often killed more soldiers than combat.",
      "It was the Gilded Age, a time of rapid population growth and transformation from an agricultural economy toward a sprawling industrial system, when poverty was widespread while barons of phenomenal wealth, like John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan, held tremendous sway over politicians who often helped boost their financial empires.",
      "\u201cWe were at our richest from 1870 to 1913. That\u2019s when we were a tariff country. And then they went to an income tax concept,\" Trump said days after taking office. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s OK. But it would have been very much better.\u201d",
      "The desire to recreate that era is fueled by Trump's fondness for tariffs and his admiration for the nation\u2019s 25th president, William McKinley, a Republican who was in office from 1897 until being assassinated in 1901.",
      "Though Trump's early implementation of tariffs has been inconsistent \u2014 with him imposing them, then pulling many back \u2014 he has been steadfast in endorsing the idea of 21st century protectionism. There have even been suggestions that higher import tariffs on the country's foreign trading partners could eventually replace the federal income tax.",
      "Experts on the era say Trump is idealizing a time rife with government and business corruption, social turmoil and inequality. They argue he's also dramatically overestimating the role tariffs played in stimulating an economy that grew mostly due to factors other than the U.S. raising taxes on imported goods.",
      "And Gilded Age policies, they maintain, have virtually nothing to do with how trade works in a globalized, modern economy.",
      "\u201cThe most astonishing thing for historians is that nobody in the Gilded Age economy \u2014 except for the very rich \u2014 wanted to live in the Gilded Age economy,\u201d said Richard White, a history professor emeritus at Stanford University.",
      "Trump says high tariffs and low interest rates, like those the U.S. had after the Civil War, can hastily pay down today's federal debt and fatten government coffers while boosting domestic manufacturers and enticing foreign producers to move to the U.S.",
      "It's not a new theme for him.",
      "\u201cI am a Tariff Man,\" Trump declared in a 2018 online post. Campaigning for a second term last fall, Trump said of the McKinley era, \u201cWe were a very wealthy country, and we\u2019re going to be doing that now.\u201d Today, he says \u201ctariff\u201d is his favorite word and represents \"a very powerful weapon that politicians haven\u2019t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form.\u201d",
      "The White House has rushed to raise tariffs on imports from China and on aluminum and steel made abroad while promising that import levies will soon increase on the European Union, as well as new, foreign-made cars, microchips and pharmaceuticals. Trump also increased tariffs on Canada and Mexico, though he later delayed most of them.",
      "He has similar plans for potentially every country the U.S. does business with, saying broad \u201creciprocal\u201d import taxes are coming April 2nd and will be consistent with levies other countries charge U.S. manufacturers to export their goods.",
      "Dartmouth College economics professor Douglas Irwin said Trump advocating for modern tariffs by pointing to the 1890s is flawed.",
      "\u201cWe did grow rapidly in the late 19th century,\" he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a stretch to attribute it to tariffs.\u201d",
      "\"The president is more accurate when he paints with a broader brush and says, \u2019Look, this entire period with fiscal surpluses we grew rapidly.' That\u2019s true of this 40-year period,\u201d added Irwin, author of \u201cClashing over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut, when you dig down to the details and say, \u2018We raised tariffs in this instance,\u2019 that\u2019s where things go awry. Or the story doesn\u2019t quite hold together as well,\" Irwin said.",
      "The Gilded Age featured extraordinary wealth for a small class of people that largely obscured rampant poverty for many other Americans. The name comes from a 1873 novel, co-written by Mark Twain, which satirized the greed and deceit of the era's government and politicians.",
      "Many contemporary leaders were openly influenced by the famed robber barons, builders of monopolies who stoked industrialization while shaping the way millions of other Americans lived and worked.",
      "Rockefeller became the exemplar of the era when his Standard Oil empire made him the world's first billionaire. Morgan was an investment banker and legendary financier of industrial interests. Cornelius Vanderbilt amassed a breathtaking fortune through shipping and railroads, while steel magnate Andrew Carnegie was also a dedicated philanthropist who argued the rich had a moral responsibility to use their wealth to better a deeply unequal society.",
      "Overall, the U.S. economy grew rapidly between 1870 and 1913, though there were dips and recessions, too.",
      "Some historians call it the second industrial revolution because of major increases in manufacturing and factory output. New industries like steel, electricity and petrochemicals boomed, as did sectors including construction and machinery.",
      "But White said those years were marked by erratic economic growth, and those upturns were mostly fueled by millions of immigrants joining the U.S. workforce. Indeed, the number of U.S. residents jumped from 38.5 million-plus in 1870 to more than 106 million by 1920.",
      "Another factor was the seizing of land from Native Americans during U.S. expansion west. That meant exploiting natural resources along the way \u2014 including gold, silver, timber, grazing and farmland, as well as coal, copper and oil, especially after the discovery of the Spindletop geyser in Texas in 1901.",
      "Average wages rose, but so did inequality, with almost no social safety net. Working conditions were often so abhorrent, meanwhile, that the labor movement began gaining strength, as did progressive politicians clamoring for breaking up monopolies.",
      "\u201cThis is the height of antimonopoly, political turmoil, the rise of labor in the United States,\u201d said White, author of \u201cThe Republic for Which it Stands: The United States during Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, 1865-1896.\u201d \u201cAnd the reason was, people did not regard this as a particularly healthy economy.\u201d",
      "In fact, despite the growth, standards of living fell, including life expectancy and key health indicators, White said.",
      "The modern federal income tax came into fruition with the ratification of 16th Amendment in 1913, ending the 43-year era when Trump says the country was wealthiest. He has not expressly detailed plans to end a national income tax since retaking the White House, and he can't do so without an act of Congress and upending the federal budget in almost incalculable ways.",
      "In fiscal year 2024, the federal government collected about $4 trillion in individual income tax and tax withholdings, according to the Treasury Department, compared with customs duties accounting for around $76.4 billion.",
      "But the president nonetheless signed a Day 1 executive order calling for the creation of the External Revenue Service to \u201ccollect tariffs, duties, and other foreign trade-related revenues.\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested Trump's goal there was \"to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay.\u201d",
      "Republican strategist Karl Rove, author of \u201cThe Triumph of William McKinley: Why the Election of 1896 Still Matters,\u201d has defended the notion of low, reciprocal tariffs on U.S. foreign trading partners.",
      "But Rove also says that tariffs can't realistically replace a federal income tax. He noted in a February op-ed that from 1863 to 1913 tariffs brought in nearly half the U.S. government\u2019s revenue but last year they accounted for less than 2% of federal revenue.",
      "In his inaugural address, Trump called McKinley a \"great president\u201d and \u201cnatural business man,\u201d who he said \u201cmade our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.\u201d Hours later, he signed an executive order overturning an Obama administration directive and renaming America\u2019s tallest peak Mount McKinley.",
      "But today's economy is immeasurably different than in McKinley's time.",
      "Global communication is now virtually instantaneous. Back then, communication was cumbersome and products were often fully assembled before being exported. Shipping could take months. Today's goods often contain raw material components or parts that need to be assembled that are sourced all over the world and then built in places different from where they are ultimately sold.",
      "The disruption of such carefully calibrated, multinational logistical systems by the coronavirus pandemic was a key reason why everything from leather couches to flooring to microchips for new cars suddenly became scarce. And that helped feed record inflation beginning in 2021 that continues to dog the U.S. economy today.",
      "Robert W. Merry, author of \u201cPresident McKinley: Architect of the American Century,\u201d said McKinley was the leading voice on tariffs at a time when they dominated policy discussions because they were the federal government's chief source of revenue, given that no income tax existed.",
      "But Trump differs with McKinley in using tariffs as a \u201cbludgeon to get other countries to do our bidding on efforts that have nothing to do with revenue, or economic matters or trade.\" The president has done that with Canada and Mexico, using tariff threats to try to force those countries to take harder lines against drug smuggling and illegal immigration.",
      "\"Nobody would have even considered such a thing in McKinley\u2019s day,\u201d Merry said.",
      "McKinley grew up in Canton, in northeast Ohio, son of an iron foundries owner who was especially sensitive to overseas competition. He won a seat in Congress representing a steel-producing district and so promoted tariffs that one humor magazine used a cartoon on its cover to unflatteringly dub him the \u201cNapoleon of Protectionism.\"",
      "As chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, McKinley championed the Tariff Act of 1890, which set the then-highest import tax in U.S. history, raising taxes to 49.5% on 1,500-plus items \u2014 everything from glass to tin plates to cayenne pepper. The results were quickly poor for the economy and for Republicans.",
      "\u201cIt led to an increase in prices, a kind of inflation, even before the bill took effect,\u201d Merry said. \u201cThe argument was, it was carte blanche for retailers and industrialists who basically jacked up their prices unnecessarily.\u201d",
      "Americans dealt Republicans landslide congressional defeats during the 1890 midterms, voting scores of incumbents out of office \u2014 including McKinley. The tariff fallout also helped Grover Cleveland win the White House for Democrats in 1892, after he lost his reelection the previous cycle.",
      "McKinley rebounded, though. He was elected Ohio governor and eventually won the presidency in 1896 on a campaign slogan Trump has repeated: \u201cI am a tariff man standing on a tariff platform.\u201d His campaign also got boosts from big donations by major industrialists like Rockefeller, who were strongly opposed to McKinley's populist Democratic opponent, William Jennings Bryan.",
      "Just as in McKinley's time, today's business titans have worked to ingratiate themselves to Trump. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was among the technology leaders who traveled to Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, was already a fixture, before Inauguration Day.",
      "Meta, Google and Microsoft joined other major firms donating $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, while Amazon Prime Video is set to distribute a documentary about first lady Melania Trump. Some business interests are hoping Trump will usher in a new era of antitrust, in which the government does less to block highly profitable corporate consolidation.",
      "Ignoring some of the political problems tariffs created for Republicans in his favored era, Trump instead has focused on repeating how import taxes after the Civil War helped the U.S. pay off debts it incurred during the fighting \u2014 and eventually achieve government budget surpluses.",
      "From 1866 to 1893, the U.S. ran nearly three straight decades of budget surpluses, fueled largely by tariffs and high domestic taxes on things like alcohol and tobacco, as well as the sale of federal lands. Paying down debt helped lower interest rates.",
      "Trump has even begun trumpeting what he calls the \u201cgreat tariff commission of 1887,\u201d which the president says was tasked with helping the government spend all those surpluses.",
      "Irwin said there was a tariff commission, but it was actually convened five years earlier in 1882. It also recommended reducing tariffs, which Congress didn\u2019t do.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say it was a political success. It\u2019s hard to say it was an economic success,\u201d Irwin said. \u201cBecause we spent a lot of the 1890s with double digit unemployment.\u201d",
      "That's because federal budget surpluses eventually began to effectively decrease the U.S. money supply and cause deflation. Meanwhile, higher tariffs increased the cost of living for many Americans, which, coupled with a financial crisis in Great Britain, helped trigger the Panic of 1893.",
      "That resulted in railroad bankruptcies, a stock market crash and a crushing recession in which unemployment reached 25% nationally. Then-President Cleveland's lack of solutions was a key factor in voters turning on him and the Democrats and toward McKinley three years later.",
      "Trump has used his opening weeks back in office to champion U.S. expansionism in ways unseen in the modern era.",
      "He\u2019s refused to rule out U.S. military forces seizing back control of the Panama Canal and suggested buying Greenland from Denmark, making Canada the 51st state and even working with Israel to put American developers in charge of turning the Gaza Strip into a seaside \u201cRiviera.\u201d",
      "There are echoes of McKinley there, because, as president, he moved to expand the reach of the U.S. The Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico became American territories as part of the treaty that ended the Spanish-American War in December 1898.",
      "But the comparison is not so easy. McKinley was also skeptical of U.S. expansionism, even writing himself a note at the start of the war and carrying it as a reminder, Merry said.",
      "\u201cWhile we are conducting war, and until its conclusion, we must keep all we get,\" the note said. \"When the war is over, we must keep what we want.\u201d",
      "Shortly after winning reelection in 1900, meanwhile, McKinley began rethinking tariffs, as a stronger and still-growing U.S. manufacturing base made him more appreciative of foreign markets.",
      "\u201cMcKinley began to see that, if we were going to be able to sell our goods overseas \u2014 as we were going to need to do because we would have more goods than we\u2019d have a market for \u2014 we were going to have to accept goods as well,\u201d Merry said.",
      "He said that McKinley gave a speech in Buffalo, New York, outlining \u201cthis concept of reciprocity, which was: I\u2019m prepared to bring down tariffs. Even me. Even William McKinley.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was his first big initiative after being reelected,\u201d Merry said.",
      "In that speech on Sept. 5, 1901, McKinley said, \u201cA policy of goodwill and friendly trade relations will prevent reprisals. Reciprocity treaties are in harmony with the spirit of the times. Measures of retaliation are not.\u201d",
      "Trump is now promising that similar, reciprocal tariffs will take effect next month. But actually successfully pulling that off will be another difference from McKinley, who never got the chance.",
      "The day after his Buffalo speech, McKinley was shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz. He died on Sept. 14, 1901.",

      "At 83 years old, Bernie Sanders has emerged as an unlikely leader of the Democratic resistance to Donald Trump",
      "WARREN, Mich. -- Bernie Sanders is standing alone on the back of a pickup truck shouting into a bullhorn.",
      "He's facing several hundred ecstatic voters huddled outside a suburban Detroit high school \u2014 the group that did not fit inside the high school's gym or two overflow rooms. The crowd screams in delight when he tells them that a combined total of 9,000 people had shown up for the rally.",
      "\u201cWhat all of this tells me, is not just in Michigan or in Vermont, the people of this country will not allow us to move toward oligarchy. They will not allow Trump to take us into authoritarianism,\u201d Sanders yelled. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to fight. And we\u2019re going to win.\u201d",
      "At 83 years old, Sanders is not running for president again. But the stooped and silver-haired democratic socialist has emerged as a leader of the resistance to Donald Trump's second presidency. In tearing into Trump's seizure of power and warning about the consequences of firing tens of thousands of government workers, Sanders is bucking the wishes of those who want Democrats to focus on the price of eggs or \u201croll over and play dead.\u201d",
      "For now, at least, Sanders stands alone as the only elected progressive willing to mount a national campaign to harness the fear and anger of the sprawling anti-Trump movement.",
      "He drew a crowd of 4,000 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Friday night. He faced another 2,600 or so the next morning a few hours away in Altoona, Wisconsin, a town of less than 10,000 residents. And his crowd of 9,000 in suburban Detroit exceeded his own team's expectations. By design, each stop was in a swing U.S. House district represented by a Republican.",
      "Sanders, who was just elected to his fourth Senate term from Vermont, conceded that this is not the role he expected to play at this stage of his career.",
      "In fact, his team intentionally waited in the early weeks of the Trump presidency to launch what they are now calling his \u201cstop oligarchy tour\u201d to see if a high-profile Democrat would fill the leadership void. Instead, Sanders \u2014 who is not a Democrat himself despite allying with Senate Democrats and running twice for the party's presidential nomination \u2014 has people wondering if he's considering another White House bid.",
      "\u201cThis is like presidential campaign rallies, isn\u2019t it? But I\u2019m not running for president, and this is not a campaign,\u201d Sanders told The Associated Press. \u201cYou gotta do what you gotta do. The country\u2019s in trouble and I want to play my role.\u201d",
      "Since losing the White House, Democrats across Washington have struggled to coalesce behind a consistent message or messenger to stop Trump's aggressive moves to slash the government workforce, weaken federal oversight and empower tech titan Elon Musk to execute his vision.",
      "There has been no centralized movement to organize the anti-Trump resistance.",
      "\u201cYou look around \u2014 who else is doing it? No one,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said of Sanders' efforts. \u201cMy hope is that the dam will break in terms of Democrats going on the offense ... We need to take the argument directly to the people.\u201d",
      "Ocasio-Cortez, a longtime Sanders ally, said she would join him on the road in the coming weeks. She's also planning solo appearances in Republican-held congressional districts in Pennsylvania and New York \u2014 and perhaps others in places where Republicans have declined to hold in-person town halls where they might face protests.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about whether Bernie should or shouldn\u2019t be doing this. It\u2019s about that we all should,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he is unique in this country, and so long as we are blessed to have that capacity on our side, I think we should be thankful for it.\u201d",
      "Beyond Sanders' tour, angry voters have so far relied on grassroots groups like Indivisible to organize a series of local protests. They have been effective in pressuring Trump's allies in some cases. A number of House Republicans facing angry questions have criticized Musk or questioned the cuts being carried out at his allies' behest.",
      "Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, who has been critical of many Democratic leaders, praised Sanders for stepping up.",
      "\u201cI wish more Democrats were traveling the country, including to red states, to rally the the majority against Musk and Project 2025,\u201d Levin said. \u201cSure as hell beats (House Democratic leader Hakeem) Jeffries traveling the country for his children\u2019s book tour during a constitutional crisis.\u201d",
      "During last month's congressional recess, Jeffries made two appearances to promote a children's book about democracy. He has also traveled to support House Democrats. This past weekend, he was in Selma, Alabama, to mark the 60th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.",
      "The truth is that few, if any, Democratic leaders have the capacity to draw such crowds on short notice or organize the related logistics on a national scale. The party\u2019s nascent class of 2028 presidential prospects, a group that includes California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, have limited national profiles and they have been reluctant to step too far into the national spotlight so far.",
      "Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, among the more outspoken Trump critics in Congress, said that Democrats must be better organized.",
      "\u201cPeople are desperate to be plugged into action right now. People see the threat. They are anxious and angry and motivated and they want to be sent in a direction to help,\u201d he said.",
      "Murphy acknowledged that Sanders still has plenty of detractors within the Democratic Party who view him and his progressive policy ideas \u2014 replacing private and job-based health insurance with a government-funded \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan, free public college, and the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d on climate policy \u2014 as too radical.",
      "Indeed, it was just five years ago when Democrats coalesced around Joe Biden to effectively block Sanders from winning the party's 2020 presidential nomination.",
      "\u201cThere still are a lot of folks who view Bernie as a danger to the party,\" Murphy said, \"whereas I see his message as the core of what we need to build on.\u201d",
      "Sanders was a staunch supporter of Biden over the last four years but criticized the Democratic Party in the aftermath of Kamala Harris' loss last fall, declaring that Trump's victory was possible only because Democrats had \u201cabandoned\u201d the working class.",
      "United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who introduced Sanders in Michigan, said more Democrats need to \"follow his lead to focus on working-class people and working-class issues.\"",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve got to take a hard look in the mirror, in my opinion, and decide who the hell they want to represent,\" Fain said of Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear as a union, if they aren\u2019t looking out for working-class people, we\u2019re not going to be there for them.\u201d",
      "The voters who packed venues across Wisconsin and Michigan over the weekend composed a diverse group, including some who did not support Sanders\u2019 past presidential campaigns. Most said that Democratic leaders have not done enough to stop Trump.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m afraid for our country. The last six weeks have been horrible,\u201d said Diana Schack, a 72-year-old retired lawyer who attended her first Sanders rally on Saturday. \u201cI am becoming a more avid Bernie fan, especially in light of the work he\u2019s doing traveling around the country. These are not normal times.\u201d",
      "In Kenosha the night before, Amber Schulz, a 50-year-old medical worker, demanded that her party \u201cstep up and do something.\u201d",
      "\u201cBernie is the only politician I trust,\u201d she said.",
      "Tony Gonzales, 56, an independent from Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, said he's worried that Trump will \u201cdismantle historic American standards\u201d and try to stay in office beyond this term. The Constitution bars presidents from serving more than two terms, even as Trump has suggested he deserves a third.",
      "\u201cIt's a dangerous time right now,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cWhat Bernie has to say \u2014 and the turnout \u2014 is important. His voice is still being heard.\u201d",
      "Sanders delivered the same fiery populist message over the weekend that he has for decades, seizing on the nation's economic inequality to call for free health care, free public higher education and stronger social safety net programs. Sanders was especially focused on the team of billionaires Trump has appointed to serve as leaders in his administration, including Musk and a half dozen others.",
      "\u201cThey want to dismantle the federal government and cut programs that working people desperately need,\" Sanders warned.",
      "\u201cYes, the oligarchs are enormously powerful. They have endless amounts of money. They control our economy. They own much of the media, and they have enormous influence over our political system,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut from the bottom of my heart, I believe that if we stand together, we can beat them.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear how long that Sanders, an octogenarian who was hospitalized for a heart condition during his 2020 campaign, will continue in this role. A spokesperson said Sanders hasn't had any health issues since the 2019 episode.",
      "He is not expected to slow down anytime soon. Sanders is leaning on his 2020 presidential campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, to organize his stops, backed by a handful of former presidential campaign staffers working on a contract basis.",
      "Shakir, who lost his bid to become the new chair of the Democratic National Committee, acknowledged strategic differences within the party about how best to combat Trump.",
      "Last month, veteran political strategist James Carville penned an opinion piece calling for Democrats to \u201croll over and play dead,\u201d betting that Trump and his party would ultimately suffer a political backlash from voters for going too far.",
      "\u201cOne theory is you can play dead; you can strategically retreat,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cOr, you play alive, and you go out to people and you talk to them with conviction and integrity.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "On \"This Week,\" Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., discussed the Democratic agenda.",
      "Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said on Sunday that he took issue with the Democratic response in the chamber to President Donald Trump\u2019s wide-ranging address to Congress last week.",
      "\"I think the lack of a coordinated response in the State of the Union was a mistake, and frankly, it took the focus off of where it should have been, which is on the fact that the president spoke for an hour and 40 minutes and had nothing to say about what he would do to bring down costs for American families that were watching that lengthy address sitting at the kitchen table, hoping that he would offer something to help them afford a new home or pay the rent to afford health care or child care,\" Schiff said on \u201cThis Week.\"",
      "Democratic lawmakers participated in various protests during Trump\u2019s speech. Some female members of Congress wore hot pink to show resistance. Other Democratic members held signs that called out Elon Musk. Some decided to boycott the speech or leave early.",
      "Schiff refuted Democratic strategist James Carville's recent proposal in a New York Times op-ed that Democrats should \u201croll over and play dead\u201d and wait for Republicans \"to crumble beneath their own weight,\" with the California senator instead saying that the right approach is focusing on \"the economic well-being of Americans.\"",
      "\"We need to have our own broad, bold agenda ... to answer really the central question which is, if you're working hard in America, can you still earn a good living?\" said Schiff. \"We need to be advancing policies and making the arguments about what we have to offer, not simply standing back and letting them collapse of our own corrupt weight. We need to effectively use litigation as we are. We need to effectively use communication to talk to new people in new ways as we are.\"",
      "Schiff also expressed frustration and disapproval of Trump\u2019s whiplash tariff agenda.",
      "Trump on Tuesday imposed a 25% tariff on goods coming from Canada or Mexico. The following day, he issued a one-month delay for auto parts. By Friday, Trump signed an executive order that extended the delay to all products under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA, which is a free trade agreement signed during Trump\u2019s first term. Roughly half of Mexican imports fall under USMCA and about 38% of imports from Canada fall under the agreement.",
      "Schiff said that Democrats have to start responding to Trump\u2019s tariffs and economic policies more effectively.",
      "\"This is deeply destructive, what they're doing,\" he said. \"We need to make that case to the American people, because they're going to feel it. But, you know, taking our eye off the ball, I think, is very dangerous, and so let's be focused on what matters most to Americans. Let's point out all the destructive harms they're doing with you know, the cutting of services, the slashing of Medicaid, and what that's going to mean for increased health costs and less access for people.\"",

      "In this first episode of a new podcast published Thursday, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, an LGBTQ ally, broke with his party, saying that transgender athletes playing in female sports is \"deeply unfair.\"",
      "\"I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair,\" Newsom said on his podcast, \"This is Gavin Newsom.\"",
      "Newsom's comments came during a conversation with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who leads conservative group Turning Point USA and played a critical role in garnering youth support for President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Newsom, sometimes viewed as a 2028 presidential hopeful, also agreed that the political ad that hurt former Vice President Kamala Harris the most in her presidential campaign was her previous support for providing taxpayer-funded gender transition-related medical care for detained immigrants and federal prisoners. Trump's campaign had played back her remarks in a widely-circulated ad.",
      "\"She didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating,\" Newsom said.",
      "Newsom also pointed to his own work in expanding LGBTQ rights, while referencing current law in the state of California that allows transgender athletes to participate in school sports that reflect the gender they identify with.",
      "Newsom himself was a trailblazer in expanding LGBTQ rights: in 2004, as mayor of San Francisco, he allowed same-sex marriages to proceed even though they were not yet allowed nationwide.",
      "He referenced that moment while discussing his alignment with Kirk's views on transgender athletes in women's sports.",
      "\"I've been a leader in the LGBTQ places, as, you know, back in 2004 [I] was marrying same sex couples. And I know we have [a] difference [of] opinion on marriage equality, and so I've been at this for years and years, I take a backseat to no one,\" Newsom said, before discussing how he heard people talking about transgender athletes.",
      "On the podcast, Newsom also called for compassion toward transgender individuals, even while discussing the sports issue: \"There's also humility and grace. You know, that, these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well.\"",
      "LGBTQ rights groups criticized Newsom's remarks, saying that they came amid national backlash to transgender individuals and their rights.",
      "The Human Rights Campaign, a major national LGBTQ rights advocacy and lobbying group, said in a statement shared on social media that with discussions nationwide in legislatures about restricting same-sex marriage or transgender rights, \"this is not a moment to sit politely in the face of authoritarian bullies or throw people under the bus for political posturing.\"",
      "\"Singling out trans kids to score political points is never going to help someone pay their rent, keep Medicaid or get a job, but it will make it seem like Gov. Newsom believes our civil rights are up for grabs,\" the organization wrote. \"Californians - and ALL Americans - need leaders who have courage in their convictions, and who will show up for them, in the faces of people who want to see us all back in the closet.\"",
      "The organization also pointed to a 2013 law in California that allowed students to be part of sport teams matching their own gender identity. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the law in 2013 as \"ensuring transgender youth have the opportunity to fully participate and succeed in schools across the state.\"",
      "Newsom briefly referenced the law in his discussion with Kirk, highlighting that it was passed before he became governor.",

      "\"Sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not,\" they wrote. \"We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks. All students deserve the academic and health benefits of sports activity, and until Donald Trump began obsessing about it, playing on a team consistent with one's gender has not been a problem since the standard was passed in 2013.\"",
      "Newsom's remarks came just a month after Trump signed an executive order intending on banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. The White House has said the action is meant to protect women in sports from harm and from facing opponents who they say have an unfair advantage.",
      "LGBTQ advocacy groups have criticized the administration's action and general rhetoric as discriminatory and as having razor-sharp focus on issues of transgender rights to the exclusion of economic and other issues.",

      "Democrats want to force President Donald Trump's administration to rehire veterans who were laid off as part of large-scale efforts by Trump and Elon Musk to reshape the federal government and its workforce, ABC News has exclusively learned.",
      "Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Andy Kim of New Jersey plan to introduce the Protect Veteran Jobs Act in the Senate on Monday. The bill would compel the Trump administration to reinstate veterans impacted by recent mass layoffs, according to a copy of the proposal obtained by ABC News.",
      "It would also require the Trump administration to provide a quarterly report to Congress on the number of veterans removed from the federal workforce -- and the justification for their firing.",
      "\"Veterans who choose to continue their service to our country in the federal workforce deserve our utmost gratitude, but instead this Administration has kicked thousands of our heroes to the curb and left them without a paycheck,\" Duckworth said in a statement. \"The message of our bill is simple: Give our heroes their jobs back. If Republicans really care about our Veterans, they should stop enabling Trump and Musk's chaos and support our legislation.\"",
      "In the coming weeks of floor activity and ahead of government funding votes, Democrats hope to get Republicans on the record over layoffs impacting a reliably Republican -- and Trump-supporting -- group of voters.",
      "The party also attempted to draw attention to the firings by inviting veterans who lost their government jobs to Trump's joint address to Congress on March 3.",
      "Veterans make up roughly 30% of the federal workforce of more than 2 million civilian government employees, according to September data from the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "Roughly 75,000 federal workers have accepted offers for deferred buyouts, and another roughly 20,000 government employees have been fired in the first months of Trump's second term.",
      "The Trump administration has not said how many veterans have been impacted by the cuts, though Democrats have estimated that several thousand veterans have been fired across the administration.",
      "OPM has since directed some agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to rehire veteran workers and to exempt veterans and military spouses from other workforce policy changes.",
      "But many veterans have still lost their jobs in recent weeks.",

      "Lennox was one of the veterans who attended Trump's joint address to Congress last week. He was a guest of Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who delivered the Democratic rebuttal to the speech.",

      "Donald Trump's style of diplomacy is a whole lot like a high-stakes business deal, and his No. 1 goal is to come out of the transaction on top",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump, the real estate developer turned commander in chief, is laying bare his style of diplomacy in the early weeks of his new term: It\u2019s a whole lot like a high-stakes business deal, and his No. 1 goal is to come out of the transaction on top.",
      "The tactics are clear in his brewing trade war with Canada and Mexico, in his approach to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and in his selection of the first country he will visit in his second term.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump approaches diplomacy and engages in a very transactional manner, with economics as the foundation and driving force behind international affairs,\" retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the president's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, explained at an event in Washington this past week.",
      "For Trump, it\u2019s about leverage, not friendship; dollars as much as values; and hard power versus soft.",
      "It's not just a matter of negotiating style. At stake is the post-World War II international order as Trump's actions raise doubts about American leadership around the globe.",
      "He's shaping a foreign policy that's more inward looking and conscious of the bottom line, dismissing American soft-power levers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development as dubious and riddled by waste and suggesting that the United States might not defend fellow NATO members that aren't meeting defense spending benchmarks set by the alliance.",
      "Politics and presidents to a certain degree are all transactional. But Trump, who helped make himself a household name by burnishing an image as an intrepid real estate dealmaker, is taking it to another level as he navigates an increasingly complicated world.",
      "The Republican president, in his previous life as a real estate titan, saw every deal as one in which there were clear winners and losers. In his return to the White House, he is more demonstrably injecting a what's-in-it-for-me approach to his dealings with both friend and foe.",
      "Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian who has studied the American presidency, said Trump's \u201cledger\u201d approach might not be the most practical way to conduct diplomacy.",
      "Frantz observed that Trump, 78, a baby boomer and football fan, seems inspired in his foreign policymaking by the ethos of legendary pro football coach Vince Lombardi, who famously said, \u201cWinning isn't everything. It's the only thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut diplomacy, especially in a more complicated world, might be more like soccer,\u201d Frantz said. \"Sometimes you just need a tie. Sometimes you need to just survive and move on.\u201d",
      "Trump on Thursday told reporters that he has decided to make Saudi Arabia the first overseas visit of his new term because the oil-rich kingdom has agreed to make a huge investment in the United States over the next four years.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve gotten richer, we\u2019ve all gotten older. So I said, \u2019I\u2019ll go if you pay a trillion dollars, $1 trillion to American companies,\u2019\u201d Trump said. He also made the kingdom his first overseas stop during his first White House term after the Saudis promised $450 billion in U.S. investment.",
      "Trump acknowledged that the United Kingdom, one of America's oldest allies, has traditionally been the first stop for U.S. presidents. But money talks.",
      "In his dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump has highly focused on who has the leverage. Putin has \u201cthe cards\u201d and Zelenskyy does not, Trump has said repeatedly.",
      "Zelenskyy appeared to be making some strides in assuaging Trump after their recent rocky meeting in the Oval Office ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticizing the Ukrainian leader for what they said was insufficient gratitude for the tens of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance provided in the three years since Russia invaded.",
      "Zelenskyy said later that how that meeting went down was \u201cregrettable.\" He also made clear he was ready to sign off on a minerals deal with the U.S. \u2014 even without the explicit American security guarantees sought by the Ukrainians \u2014 that Trump wants.",
      "In his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress, Trump acknowledged Zelenskyy\u2019s fence-mending efforts. Trump also announced plans to send top advisers to Saudi Arabia this week for talks with Ukrainian officials.",
      "But soon Trump was back to criticizing Zelenskyy, saying he does not have the leverage to keep fighting the war with Russia.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine, and they don\u2019t have the cards,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia, which is surprising, because they have all the cards.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s push on Zelenskyy \u2014 and pivot toward Moscow \u2014 marks a significant departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward Russia since the Cold War.",
      "Others before Trump, including Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have tried resets with Russia, but perhaps never at a time as fraught. Deep skepticism toward Moscow, even in the best moments in the relationship, has been the standard operating posture in both Republican and Democratic administrations.",
      "But Trump, who ran on a promise to quickly end the war, has veered from Democratic President Joe Biden's approach of making no major decision that could impact Ukraine without Kyiv's involvement.",
      "At the same time, the new Republican administration has taken steps toward a more cooperative line with Putin, for whom Trump has long shown admiration.",
      "Trump has ordered a pause on U.S. military aid for and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, halted offensive cyberoperations against Russia by U.S. Cyber Command and disbanded a program aimed at seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs as a means to punish the Kremlin for its invasion.",
      "Kellogg, who also served in Trump's first White House, recalled seeing Trump's \u201ctransactional diplomacy approach\u201d early in the first term. Kellogg said that the president's first question in meetings with foreign leaders was often the same.",
      "\"As I found the very first time we were in the Cabinet room when a foreign official came in, the comment was, \u2019What is the trade imbalance between our two nations?''' Kellogg recalled, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations event.",
      "The trade ledger has been top of mind for Trump as he argues that for too long America has been played by friends and adversaries, including neighbors Canada and Mexico.",
      "Trump last week announced 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war. He then postponed most of them.",
      "The White House insists the pending tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of fentanyl. Trump has also at times suggested that the tariffs could be resolved by fixing the trade deficit.",
      "The president on Friday was back to excoriating Canada, this time complaining about policies he said are hurting American dairy farmers and the lumber industry. He said he will act soon to even the ledger with Canada through reciprocal tariffs.",
      "\"Canada has been ripping us off for years on lumber and on dairy products,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whom Trump has taken to belittling as the governor of America's 51st state, said his country will not be backing down from Trump's trade war.",
      "The episode has underscored Trump's willingness to embrace hard power to resolve differences, even if it means testing one of the world\u2019s most durable and amicable alliances.",
      "The center-left Trudeau was so flummoxed by Trump's move that he found himself quoting the sharply conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page to make the point that this fight was unnecessary.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal,\" Trudeau said. \"But Donald, they point out that even though you\u2019re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Conservatives have long talked about cutting government, but Republicans in Congress have shied away from approving deep reductions because of fear of how voters would react",
      "DENVER -- For decades, conservatives in Congress have talked about the need to cut government deeply, but they have always pulled back from mandating specific reductions, fearful of voter backlash.",
      "Now, President Donald Trump's administration is trying to make major cuts in government through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, run by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 an initiative led by an unelected businessman who's unlikely to ever run for office and was appointed by a termed-out president who no longer needs to face voters again.",
      "The dynamic of cutting government while also cutting out those who answer to voters has alarmed even some fiscal conservatives who have long pushed for Congress to reduce spending through the means laid out in the Constitution: a system of checks and balances that includes lawmakers elected across the country working with the president.",
      "\u201cSome members of the Trump administration got frustrated that Congress won't cut spending and decided to go around them,\u201d said Jessica Reidl of the conservative think tank The Manhattan Institute. Now, she said, \u201cno one who has to face voters again is determining spending levels.\u201d",
      "That may be changing.",
      "On Thursday, facing mounting court challenges to the legality of Musk ordering layoffs, Trump told his Cabinet that Musk could only make recommendations about government reductions. And there were more signs that Congress, after sitting on the sidelines for nearly the first two months of Trump's administration, is slowly getting back into the game.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican senators told Musk that he needed to ask Congress to approve specific cuts, which they can do on an up-or-down, filibuster-free vote through a process known as recission.",
      "Senators said Musk had never heard of the process before. That was a striking admission given that it's the only way for the executive branch to legally refuse to spend money that Congress has given it.",
      "\u201cTo make it real, to make it go beyond the moment of the day, it needs to come back in the form of a rescission package,\u201d said Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a longtime advocate of spending reductions who said he introduced the idea of recission to Musk during the lunch meeting of the GOP caucus.",
      "Of course, letting Congress have the final word may be constitutional, but it would open up the process to individual representatives or senators balking at cuts because of home-state interests or other concerns, as some have already. But Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and an economist in George W. Bush's administration, said that \u201cmessy\u201d process is a superior one.",
      "\u201cThere's always this instinct in people to insulate decisions from politics,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cIt's a mistake in a democracy. It's really messy. You're not going to get the cleanliness of a corporate reorganization.\u201d",
      "Riedl noted she has advocated for deep cuts for decades, but there's a reason Congress has balked.",
      "\u201cIf Congress won't pass certain spending cuts, it's because the American people don't want it enough,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I want spending levels to be cut, it's my job to persuade the people of America to agree with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his supporters argue they did just that in the last presidential election when he promised to shake up Washington: \u201cThe people elected me to do the job and I\u2019m doing it,\u201d Trump said during his address to Congress last week.",
      "A corporate-style approach to government has long been the goal of conservatives, especially one segment that has recently called for a more CEO-style leader who is less tied down by democratic commitments to voters. Musk has embodied that, bringing the same disruptive, cost-cutting zeal he brought to his private companies. Some of his DOGE moves mirrored steps he took to slash the social media site Twitter, including the email offering buyouts, both times called \u201cFork in the Road.\u201d",
      "Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, said the effort seems more destructive than just an attempt to shrink government in ways conservatives have long advocated.",
      "\u201cIt is usurping the role of Congress on spending and program design, using cuts as a backdoor way to impound and close agencies created by Congress,\u201d Moynihan said. \u201cIt is implementing an unprecedented scale of disruption.\u201d",
      "Grover Norquist, an anti-tax activist whose pledge to make government small enough to \u201cdrown it in a bathtub\u201d has made him an icon for small-government conservatives, cheered the DOGE project. He said Congress has to authorize any real reductions, but hoped that DOGE's cuts show the legislative branch that voters will not panic when government is shrunk.",
      "\u201cIf we do something for three years, they'll make it the law,\u201d Norquist said of Congress. \u201cThey'll see it's safe, they'll see it's successful. They'll come in and put their name on it.\u201d",
      "Norquist acknowledged that Congress has repeatedly balked at the level of cuts that he would like to see, even under unified Republican control. He asserted that \u201c95%\u201d of Republicans support such reductions but \u201cthat wasn't enough to get it across the finish line\u201d in an era where the majority party usually only has a razor-thin margin of control in either chamber.",
      "The past nearly half-century of politics has been defined by conservatives pledging to cut government spending, only to see it continue to grow. Republican Ronald Reagan swept into the presidency in 1980 pledging to cut government, but when he left eight years later its size had increased. The trend continued through Trump\u2019s first term and during Democrat Joe Biden's presidency.",
      "Now, however, Trump will not face voters again, despite occasional quips about seeking a constitutionally prohibited third term. He has been open about his grudge against the federal bureaucracy, which he blames for many of his troubles during his initial four years in office.",
      "\u201cI don't think previous presidents have had the same animus towards the federal government this one has,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said.",
      "He noted that Trump has launched a second cost-cutting initiative through traditional channels \u2014 his own Office of Management and Budget, which asked agencies to prepare for mass layoffs. That, Holtz-Eakin said, makes those coming reductions likelier to stick than DOGE cuts.",
      "Holtz-Eakin said there are initial signs of voter discontent over the pace, depth and chaos of the cuts. \"The usual way you visit that on a president is you wipe out his party in the midterms,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cYou never evade the voters.\u201d"

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabia is to host talks on Tuesday between the United States and Ukraine in a new diplomatic push after an argument erupted during President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Feb. 28 visit to the White House.",
      "The oil-rich kingdom may seem like an unusual venue for talks aimed at smoothing over relations after the blowup. But Saudi Arabia under its assertive Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been positioning itself as an ideal location for possible peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow \u2014 and even the first face-to-face talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about why this meeting is taking place and Saudi Arabia's role:",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials will meet after the Oval Office meeting between Zelenskyy, Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance descended into an extraordinary 10-minute argument before journalists.",
      "Trump at one point admonished Zelenskyy by angrily saying: \"You\u2019re gambling with World War III, and what you\u2019re doing is very disrespectful to the country.\" Zelenskyy ended up leaving the White House without signing a deal that included granting the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals. Kyiv hoped that deal would ensure the continued flow of U.S. military support that Ukraine urgently needs as it battles Russia in the war that began after Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry in a statement on Friday identified the location for the talks as Jeddah, a port city on the Red Sea. It's not clear why the kingdom picked Jeddah as opposed to Riyadh, the Saudi capital where the initial Russia-U.S. talks took place on Feb. 18. However, Jeddah has hosted other diplomatic engagements in the past and is home to royal palaces.",
      "The Foreign Ministry said the kingdom would continue to pursue \u201ca lasting peace to end the Ukrainian crisis.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe kingdom has continued these efforts over the past three years by hosting many meetings on this matter,\u201d the ministry said.",
      "Zelenskyy plans to visit Saudi Arabia on Monday ahead of the talks. He earlier delayed a trip to the kingdom after traveling to the neighboring United Arab Emirates, which also has been considered as a possible venue for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe continue working on the relevant steps with our partners who want peace, who want it just as much as we do,\u201d Zelenskyy said Friday. \u201cThere will be a lot of work here in Europe, with America in Saudi Arabia \u2014 we are preparing a meeting to accelerate peace and strengthen the foundations of security.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy wrote online that a team including his chief of staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov traveling with him to Saudi Arabia will take part in the talks. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead the American team for the Ukrainian talks and meet with Prince Mohammed.",
      "Sybiha also spoke on Friday with Rubio ahead of the talks. Sybiha described it as a \u201cconstructive call.\" A two-sentence readout from the State Department said Rubio \u201cunderscored President Trump is determined to end the war as soon as possible and emphasized that all sides must take steps to secure a sustainable peace.\u201d",
      "Trump himself sounded upbeat on Air Force One on Sunday when speaking to journalists.",
      "\u201cI think you\u2019re gonna have eventually \u2014 and maybe not in the distant future \u2014 you\u2019re gonna have some pretty good results coming out of Saudi Arabia this week,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked on Monday about the talks, said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what we\u2019re expecting. It matters what the United States is expecting.\"",
      "Since assuming power in Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed took an aggressive posture both at home and abroad. His public image reached its nadir with the 2018 slaying of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, believed by the United States and others to be at the prince\u2019s orders.",
      "In the last two years, however, Prince Mohammed instead has reached a d\u00e9tente with Iran, hosted Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit and been involved in negotiations over the wars in Sudan and the Gaza Strip. Riyadh also maintained ties to Russia through the OPEC+ oil cartel while Western nations levied sanctions against it. That's reasserted the role the kingdom long has perceived itself as having \u2014 being the leader of the Sunni Muslim world and a dominant force in the Middle East.",
      "Hosting Russia-U.S. talks, possibly drawing Trump to the kingdom for his first foreign trip in this term through investments and other possible meetings only raise Saudi Arabia's profile further as a neutral territory for high-stakes negotiations. Saudi Arabia's autocratic government, compliant media and distance from the war also allows for talks to take place in a tightly controlled country with relative privacy.",
      "Trump remains focused on reaching some kind of peace deal to stop the war. His approach toward Ukraine so far has relied far more on stick than carrot \u2014 limiting their access to intelligence and weaponry. While conciliatory toward Putin, Trump recently also threatened new sanctions against Russia over its ceaseless attacks on Ukrainian cities.",
      "If Ukraine and the U.S. reach some sort of understanding acceptable to Trump, that could accelerate his administration\u2019s push to talks. However, the rest of Europe remains skeptical as they have been sidelined from the talks. The European Union last week agreed to boost the continent\u2019s defenses and to free up hundreds of billions of euros for security.",

      "A new law in South Dakota prohibiting the use of eminent domain to acquire land for carbon capture pipelines challenges the viability of a proposed project snaking through five Midwest states",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- A new law in South Dakota prohibiting the use of eminent domain to acquire land for carbon capture pipelines raises questions about the viability of a proposed 2,500 mile (4,023-kilometer) project snaking through five Midwest states.",
      "Summit Carbon Solutions, the company behind the estimated $8.9 billion pipeline, vowed to keep pursuing the project despite South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden's announcement Thursday that he had signed a bill into law that will make routing the line much more difficult. The law bans Summit from forcing South Dakota landowners to allow the pipeline through their property.",
      "Plans call for the pipeline to carry greenhouse gas emissions from more than 50 ethanol plants in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota to a spot in North Dakota, where it would be permanently stored underground.",
      "It's unclear whether Summit will pursue legal action but the company said in a statement that \u201call options are on the table\" and the project \u201cmoves forward\u201d in other states. The company promised it would have more news soon.",
      "Large pipeline projects typically rely on eminent domain, with companies arguing that even if most landowners agree to grant access to their property, a project can be scuttled if only a few refuse.",
      "Summit says the company, which has secured over 2,700 easements across the region, has approval for routes in Iowa and North Dakota and a leg in Minnesota.",
      "The current proposed route would cut through nearly 700 miles (1,126.5 kilometers) of South Dakota before entering North Dakota, so rerouting to the east through Minnesota would be a big challenge.",
      "A Summit spokesperson did not respond to questions Friday about whether the company would consider a new route.",
      "The sponsor of the South Dakota bill, Republican Rep. Karla Lems, said Summit could either reroute its pipeline through Minnesota into North Dakota or \u201cnegotiate with landowners in South Dakota\u201d and go around opponents.",
      "Gov. Rhoden said the South Dakota law wasn't intended to kill the project and suggested Summit see it as \u201can opportunity to reset.\u201d",
      "Minnesota is a relatively small part of Summit\u2019s overall project. The only segment approved in the state is a 28-mile (45-kilometer) leg from an ethanol plant near Fergus Falls to the North Dakota border. Summit\u2019s project also includes two legs in southern Minnesota that would go into Iowa.",
      "A Minnesota Public Utilities Commission spokesperson did not respond to phone or email messages.",
      "The country's transition to electric vehicles has been slower than many people expected, but most think a shift away from internal combustion engines will eventually happen.",
      "Nearly 40% of the nation's corn crop is brewed into ethanol, which is blended into most gasoline sold in the U.S. Midwest farmers and the ethanol industry therefore see it as essential to have new markets as less of the fuel additive goes to power cars.",
      "They see passenger jet fuel as a potentially huge new market for ethanol. However, under current rules the process for turning ethanol into aviation fuel would need to emit less carbon dioxide to qualify for tax breaks intended to reduce greenhouses.",
      "The carbon capture pipeline is a key part of achieving those goals, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said.",
      "Walt Wendland, who runs an ethanol plant in Onida, South Dakota, said the \u201cethanol industry is a margin business\u201d and the new state law will put South Dakota ethanol producers at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cEver since I built a plant, I never wanted an advantage, just don\u2019t put me at a disadvantage,\u201d Wendland said.",
      "It has been four years since Summit proposed building the pipeline, along with two other companies that later abandoned their plans. It has been a challenging process for Summit, which dealt with lawsuits in Nebraska and elsewhere, opposition before a regulatory commission in Iowa and now the eminent domain ban in South Dakota.",
      "In its statement, Summit expressed optimism about the future but didn't offer specifics about how it could build a pipeline without eminent domain authority in South Dakota.",
      "Since the pipeline was proposed, the federal government\u2019s approach to climate change also has changed dramatically. Democratic President Joe Biden increased tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to encourage carbon capture as an effort to slow climate change.",
      "However, Republican President Donald Trump has emphasized the need for more oil and gas drilling and coal mining, and has put far less emphasis on alternative energy. Trump has not indicated whether his views will lead to changing federal policy regarding carbon capture pipelines.",

      "Trump\u2019s overture comes as both Israel and the United States have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels \u2014 something only done by atomic-armed nations.",
      "Tehran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb. Tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and with Israel as a shaky ceasefire holds in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Iranian statement Sunday, while allowing for talks on concerns about militarization, stressed that Tehran would not negotiate away what it stresses is its peaceful nuclear program.",
      "\u201cHowever, should the aim be the dismantlement of Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear program to claim that what Obama failed to achieve has now been accomplished, such negotiations will never take place,\u201d Iran\u2019s mission said."

      "Pipkin called 911 and then drove to the crash site, where he recorded video of black smoke billowing from the plane\u2019s mangled wreckage and multiple cars engulfed in flames in a parking lot at Brethren Village. He said the plane narrowly missed hitting a three-story building at the sprawling retirement community about 75 miles (120 kilometers) west of Philadelphia.",
      "A fire truck from the airport arrived within minutes, and more first responders followed quickly.",
      "\u201cIt was so smoky and it was so hot,\u201d Pipkin said. \u201cThey were really struggling to get the fire out.\u201d",
      "A dozen parked cars were damaged and Brethren Village residents were briefly asked to shelter in place as a precaution, Fisher said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I'd consider it a miracle, but the fact that we have a plane crash where everybody survives and nobody on the ground is hurt is a wonderful thing,\" the police chief added.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed there were five people aboard the Beechcraft Bonanza. Its planned flight and destination were not released soon after the crash.",
      "The conditions of the five also were not immediately known and authorities didn't elaborate on how they survived the crash.",
      "Air traffic control audio captured the pilot reporting that the aircraft \u201chas an open door, we need to return for a landing.\u201d An air traffic controller is heard clearing the plane to land, before saying, \u201cPull up!\u201d Moments later, someone can be heard saying the aircraft was \u201cdown just behind the terminal in the parking lot street area.\u201d",
      "The FAA said it will investigate.",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said state police were assisting local authorities. \u201cAll Commonwealth resources are available as the response continues, and more information will be provided as it becomes available,\u201d Shapiro said on social media.",
      "The crash comes about a month after seven people were killed when an air ambulance burst into flames after crashing onto a busy Philadelphia street."

      "WASHINGTON -- The leaders of both Canada and Mexico got on the phone with President Donald Trump this past week to seek solutions after he slapped tariffs on their countries, but China\u2019s president appears unlikely to make a similar call soon.",
      "Beijing, which unlike America's close partners and neighbors has been locked in a trade and tech war with the U.S. for years, is taking a different approach to Trump in his second term, making it clear that any negotiations should be conducted on equal footing.",
      "China\u2019s leaders say they are open to talks, but they also made preparations for the higher U.S. tariffs, which have risen 20% since Trump took office seven weeks ago. Intent on not being caught off guard as they were during Trump's first term, the Chinese were ready with retaliatory measures \u2014 imposing their own taxes this past week on key U.S. farm imports and more.",
      "\u201cAs Washington escalates the tariff, Beijing doesn\u2019t see other options but to retaliate,\u201d said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean Beijing doesn\u2019t want to negotiate, but it cannot be seen as begging for talks or mercy.\u201d",
      "As the world's second-largest economy, China aspires to be a great power on both the regional and global stage, commanding respect from all countries, especially the United States, as proof that the Communist Party has made China prosperous and strong.",
      "After the U.S. this past week imposed another 10% tariff, on top of the 10% imposed on Feb. 4, the Chinese foreign ministry uttered its sharpest retort yet: \u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end.\u201d",
      "The harsh rhetoric echoed similar comments in 2018, when Trump launched his first trade war with China and it scrambled to line up tit-for-tat actions. Beijing\u2019s leaders have since developed a toolkit of tariffs, import curbs, export controls, sanctions, regulatory reviews and measures to limit companies from doing business in China.",
      "All are designed to inflict pain on the U.S. economy and businesses in response to the American measures.",
      "That allowed the Chinese government to react swiftly to Trump\u2019s recent across-the-board doubling of new tariffs on Chinese goods by rolling out a basket of retaliatory measures, including taxing many American farm goods at up to 15%, suspending U.S. lumber imports and blacklisting 15 U.S. companies.",
      "Beijing showed restraint in its response to leave room for negotiation, analysts say.",
      "Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership of the ruling Communist Party spans both of Trump\u2019s terms, giving Beijing more continuity in its planning. He is the one who decided it's not yet time to speak with Trump, said Daniel Russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not a scheduling issue, it\u2019s leverage for China,\u201d said Russel, who previously served as the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. \u201cXi won\u2019t walk into a call if there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll be harassed or humiliated and for both political and strategic reasons, Xi won\u2019t play the role of a supplicant.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, China is hitting back promptly \u2014 but judiciously \u2014 to each set of tariffs,\u201d Russel said.",
      "At his annual press conference Friday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that \u201cno country should fantasize that it can suppress, contain China while developing good relations with China.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch two-faced acts not only are bad for the stability of bilateral relations but also will not build mutual trust,\" Wang said. He added that China welcomes cooperation with the U.S., but noted that \u201cif you keep pressuring, China will firmly retaliate.\u201d",
      "Scott Kennedy, a trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Chinese this time are \u201cnot psychologically shocked\u201d by Trump\u2019s \u201cshock-and-awe\u201d tactics.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve seen this before,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThese are the kind of things that they\u2019ve anticipated.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s economy has slowed but is still growing at nearly a 5% annual pace, and under Xi, the party is investing heavily in advanced technology, education and other areas. It has stronger trade ties with many other countries than during Trump's first term and has diversified where it gets key products, for example, buying most of its soybeans from Brazil and Argentina instead of the U.S.",
      "In turn, the percentage of Chinese goods sold to the U.S. has fallen.",
      "\u201cThey are better prepared to absorb the effect of the shocks, compared to several years ago,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 80% of Mexico's exports go to the U.S., and Canada sends 75% of its exports here.",
      "China has learned from its previous dealings with Trump, Russel said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum are facing a reversal of Trump\u2019s previous trade policies, with tariffs imposed and then postponed twice on at least some goods.",
      "\u201cBeijing has seen enough to know that appeasing Trump doesn\u2019t work,\" Russel said. In the first go-around, Trudeau and Sheinbaum \"bought a little time, but the pressure only came roaring back stronger.\u201d",
      "Trudeau flew to Mar-a-Lago to meet Trump in December after the president-elect threatened tariffs. But in announcing retaliatory tariffs Tuesday, Trudeau sternly warned: \u201cThis is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners.\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum also has said that \u201cno one wins with this decision.\u201d"

      "Teixeira pleaded guilty last year to six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act, following his arrest in the most consequential national security breach in years.",
      "In his court-martial, Teixeira faces charges of disobeying orders and obstructing justice. At a hearing last year, military prosecutors said a court-martial is appropriate given that obeying orders is the \u201cabsolute core\u201d of the military. But Teixeira\u2019s lawyers argued that further action would amount to prosecuting him twice for the same offense.",

Teixeira also admitted posting information about a U.S. adversary\u2019s plans to harm U.S. forces serving overseas.",
      "Before he was sentenced in November in U.S. District Court in Boston, Teixeira showed little emotion as he stood in court and apologized for his actions.

      "Facing spiking energy demand, U.S. states are pressing for ways to build new power plants faster as policymakers try to protect residents from higher electric bills and keep their economies on track",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Facing projections of spiking energy demand, U.S. states are pressing for ways to build new power plants faster as policymakers increasingly worry about protecting their residents and economies from rising electric bills, power outages and other consequences of falling behind Big Tech in a race for electricity.",
      "Some states are dangling financial incentives. Others are undoing decades of regulatory structures in what they frame as a race to serve the basic needs of residents, avoid a catastrophe and keep their economies on track in a fast-electrifying society.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything quite like this,\u201d said Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents independent power plant owners.",
      "The spike in demand for electricity is being driven, in large part, by the artificial intelligence race as tech companies are snapping up real estate and seeking power to feed their energy-hungry data centers. Federal incentives to rebuild the manufacturing sector also are helping drive demand.",
      "In some cases, Big Tech is arranging its own power projects.",
      "But energy companies also are searching for ways to capitalize on opportunities afforded by the first big increase in electricity consumption in a couple of decades, and that is pitting state political leaders against each other for the new jobs and investment that come with new power plants.",
      "Moves by states come as a fossil fuel - friendly President Donald Trump and Republican-controlled Congress take power in Washington, D.C., slashing regulations around oil and gas, boostingdrilling opportunities and encouraging the construction of pipelines and refineries that can export liquefied natural gas.",
      "States are seeking action, with the National Governors Association asking Congress to make it easier and faster to build power plants and criticizing the U.S. as among the slowest developed nations in approving energy projects.",
      "But there may be less that the federal government can do right away about a looming power shortage, since greenlighting power plants to feed the electric grid is largely the province of state regulators and regional grid operators.",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wants to establish an agency to fast-track the construction of big power plants and dangle hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects providing electricity to the grid.",
      "The state, and the country, needs more power plants to win the artificial intelligence race and provide reliable and affordable power to residents, said Shapiro, who suggested Pennsylvania may leave the regional grid operated by PJM Interconnection in favor of \u201cgoing it alone.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has proven over the last number of years too darn hard to get enough new generation projects off the ground because of how slow PJM\u2018s queue is,\u201d Shapiro told a news conference on Feb. 27.",
      "Indiana, Michigan and Louisiana are exploring ideas to attract nuclear power while Maryland lawmakers are floating ideas about commissioning the construction of a new power plant there.",
      "In Ohio, a lawmaker wants to restrict the influence of electric utilities in hopes of giving independent power producers more incentive to build power plants to feed the state's fast-growing tech sector.",
      "The bill, which awaits a vote, won the support of the Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel, the state's residential ratepayer watchdog, and business groups whose members care about electric prices. However, it split the energy sector between companies operating in competitive markets and those operating under state utility monopolies.",
      "In Missouri, utilities including Ameren and Evergy, as well as the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, labor unions and the state's top utility regulator are backing legislation to repeal a nearly half-century old law preventing utilities from charging customers to build a power plant until it is operational.",
      "The law was approved in a 1976 voter referendum when states were looking to hedge against utilities saddling ratepayers with financing upfront, potentially bloated, inefficient or, worse, aborted power projects.",
      "Consumer and environmental groups protested the bill, saying it would result in new natural gas plants that are likelier to be more costly to ratepayers.",
      "Last year, similar legislation passed almost unanimously in Kansas, along with companion legislation extending tax breaks to new power plants.",
      "Within months, Evergy announced alongside the state's leaders that it would build two 705-megawatt natural gas plants and said the legislation will \u201chelp Kansas compete with other states for investment and ultimately save customers money.\u201d",
      "John Coffman, the utility consumer counsel for the Consumers Council of Missouri, said utilities are playing the two states, Missouri and Kansas, against each other and were planning to build the power plants anyway.",
      "But, he said, \u201cThey're just looking for opportunities to squeeze more money out of the process.\"",
      "Snitchler said action is being spurred by states realizing that longstanding power reserves are dwindling, especially as coal-fired and nuclear power plants retire, and now all sorts of power companies are leaping at the chance to make money.",

      "Yaw, a Republican, has no misgivings about Pennsylvania helping finance power plants. Even by conservative estimates, the state will need dozens more power plants to meet projections of rising demand, he said.",
      "\u201cAnd what do we have underway or planned right now? Nothing,\" Yaw said. \"And we haven\u2019t built anything since 2019. So we\u2019ve got to do something to encourage people to come here and build in Pennsylvania just to maintain the status quo.\"",

    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is signaling that the Trump administration has finished its six-week dismantling of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development",
      "WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday the Trump administration had finished its six-week purge of programs of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development, and said he would move the 18% of aid and development programs that survived under the State Department.",
      "Rubio made the announcement in a post on X. It marked one of his relatively few public comments on what has been a historic shift away from U.S. foreign aid and development, executed by Trump political appointees at State and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency teams.",
      "Rubio in the post thanked DOGE and \u201cour hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform\u201d in foreign aid.",
      "President Donald Trump on Jan. 20 issued an executive order directing a freeze of foreign assistance funding and a review of all of the tens of billions of dollars of U.S. aid and development work abroad. Trump charged that much of foreign assistance was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.",
      "Rubio's social media post Monday said that review was now \u201cofficially ending,\" with some 5,200 of USAID's 6,200 programs eliminated.",
      "Those programs \u201cspent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States,\u201d Rubio wrote.",
      "\u201cIn consultation with Congress, we intend for the remaining 18% of programs we are keeping ... to be administered more effectively under the State Department,\u201d he said. Democratic lawmakers and others call the shutdown of congressionally-funded programs illegal, saying such a move requires Congress' approval.",
      "The State Department in one of multiple lawsuits it is battling over its rapid shutdown of USAID had said earlier this month it was killing more than 90% of USAID programs. Rubio gave no explanation for why his number was lower, and no details of what programs were spared or how the State Department would run them.",
      "The dismantling of USAID that followed Trump's order upended decades of policy that humanitarian and development aid abroad advanced U.S. national security by stabilizing regions and economies, strengthening alliances and building goodwill.",
      "In the weeks after Trump's order, one of his appointees and transition team members, Pete Marocco, and Musk pulled USAID staff around the world off the job through forced leaves and firings, shut down USAID payments overnight and terminated aid and development contracts by the thousands.",
      "Contractors and staffers running efforts ranging from epidemic control to famine prevention to job and democracy training stopped work. Aid groups and other USAID partners laid off tens of thousands of their workers in the U.S. and abroad.",
      "Lawsuits brought by some of the nonprofit groups and businesses that had partnered with USAID say the form-letter contract terminations purge eliminated even programs that Rubio had said he wanted to save, violated the contract terms and stiffed aid groups and businesses of billions of dollars.",
      "The shutdown has left many USAID staffers and contractors and their families still overseas, many of them awaiting U.S.-paid back payments and travel expenses back home.",

    "story": [
      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When artificial intelligence-backed tractors became available to vineyards, Tom Gamble wanted to be an early adopter. He knew there would be a learning curve, but Gamble decided the technology was worth figuring out.",
      "The third-generation farmer bought one autonomous tractor. He plans on deploying its self-driving feature this spring and is currently using the tractor's AI sensor to map his Napa Valley vineyard. As it learns each row, the tractor will know where to go once it is used autonomously. The AI within the machine will then process the data it collects and help Gamble make better-informed decisions about his crops \u2014 what he calls \u201cprecision farming.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to completely replace the human element of putting your boot into the vineyard, and that\u2019s one of my favorite things to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be able to allow you to work more smartly, more intelligently and in the end, make better decisions under less fatigue.\u201d",
      "Gamble said he anticipates using the tech as much as possible because of \u201ceconomic, air quality and regulatory imperatives.\u201d Autonomous tractors, he said, could help lower his fuel use and cut back on pollution.",
      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce. New agricultural tech like AI can help farmers to cut back on waste, and to run more efficient and sustainable vineyards by monitoring water use and helping determine when and where to use products like fertilizers or pest control. AI-backed tractors and irrigation systems, farmer say, can minimize water use by analyzing soil or vines, while also helping farmers to manage acres of vineyards by providing more accurate data on the health of a crop or what a season\u2019s yield will be.",
      "Other facets of the wine industry have also started adopting the tech, from using generative AI to create custom wine labels to turning to ChatGPT to develop, label and price an entire bottle.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anybody losing their job, because I think that a tractor operator\u2019s skills are going to increase and as a result, and maybe they\u2019re overseeing a small fleet of these machines that are out there, and they\u2019ll be compensated as a result of their increased skill level,\u201d he said.",
      "Farmers, Gamble said, are always evolving. There were fears when the tractor replaced horses and mules pulling plows, but that technology \u201cproved itself\u201d just like AI farming tech will, he said, adding that adopting any new tech always takes time.",
      "Companies like John Deere have started using the AI that wine farmers are beginning to adopt. The agricultural giant uses \u201cSmart Apply\u201d technology on tractors, for example, helping growers apply material for crop retention by using sensors and algorithms to sense foliage on grape canopies, said Sean Sundberg, business integration manager at John Deere.",
      "The tractors that use that tech then only spray \u201cwhere there are grapes or leaves or whatnot so that it doesn\u2019t spray material unnecessarily,\u201d he said. Last year, the company announced a project with Sonoma County Winegrowers to use tech to help wine grape growers maximize their yield.",
      "Tyler Klick, partner at Redwood Empire Vineyard Management, said his company has started automating irrigation valves at the vineyards it helps manage. The valves send an alert in the event of a leak and will automatically shut off if they notice an \u201cexcessive\u201d water flow rate.",
      "\u201cThat valve is actually starting to learn typical water use,\u201d Klick said. \u201cIt\u2019ll learn how much water is used before the production starts to fall off.\u201d",
      "Klick said each valve costs roughly $600, plus $150 per acre each year to subscribe to the service.",
      "\u201cOur job, viticulture, is to adjust our operations to the climatic conditions we\u2019re dealt,\u201d Klick said. \u201cI can see AI helping us with finite conditions.\u201d",
      "Angelo A. Camillo, a professor of wine business at Sonoma State University, said that despite excitement over AI in the wine industry, some smaller vineyards are more skeptical about their ability to use the technology. Small, family-owned operations, which Camillo said account for about 80% of the wine business in America, are slowly disappearing \u2014 many don\u2019t have the money to invest in AI, he said. A robotic arm that helps put together pallets of wine, for example, can cost as much as $150,000, he said.",
      "\u201cFor small wineries, there\u2019s a question mark, which is the investment. Then there\u2019s the education. Who\u2019s going to work with all of these AI applications? Where is the training?\u201d he said.",
      "There are also potential challenges with scalability, Camillo added. Drones, for example, could be useful for smaller vineyards that could use AI to target specific crops that have a bug problem, he said \u2014 it would be much harder to operate 100 drones in a 1,000 acre vineyard while also employing the IT workers who understand the tech.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think a person can manage 40 drones as a swarm of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a constraint for the operators to adopt certain things.\u201d",
      "However, AI is particularly good at tracking a crop\u2019s health \u2013 including how the plant itself is doing and whether it\u2019s growing enough leaves \u2013 while also monitoring grapes to aid in yield projections, said Mason Earles, an assistant professor who leads the Plant AI and Biophysics Lab at UC Davis.",
      "Diseases or viruses can sneak up and destroy entire vineyards, Earles said, calling it an \u201celephant in the room\u201d across the wine industry. The process of replanting a vineyard and getting it to produce well takes at least five years, he said. AI can help growers determine which virus is affecting their plants, he said, and whether they should rip out some crops immediately to avoid losing their entire vineyard.",
      "Earles, who is also cofounder of the AI-powered farm management platform Scout, said his company uses AI to process thousands of images in hours and extract data quickly \u2014 something that would be difficult by hand in large vineyards that span hundreds of acres. Scout's AI platform then counts and measures the number of grape clusters as early as when a plant is beginning to flower in order to forecast what a yield will be.",
      "The sooner vintners know how much yield to expect, the better they can \u201cdial in\u201d their wine making process, he added.",
      "\u201cPredicting what yields you\u2019re going to have at the end of the season, no one is that good at it right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really important because it determines how much labor contract you\u2019re going to need and the supplies you\u2019ll need for making wine.\u201d",
      "Earles doesn\u2019t think the budding use of AI in vineyards is \u201cfreaking farmers out.\u201d Rather, he anticipates that AI will be used more frequently to help with difficult field labor and to discern problems in vineyards that farmers need help with.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve seen people trying to sell them tech for decades. It\u2019s hard to farm; it\u2019s unpredictable compared to most other jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe walking and counting, I think people would have said a long time ago, \u2018I would happily let a machine take over.\u2019\u201d"

      "SELMA, Ala. -- Charles Mauldin was near the front of a line of voting rights marchers walking in pairs across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 1965.",
      "The marchers were protesting white officials\u2019 refusal to allow Black Alabamians to register to vote, as well as the killing days earlier of Jimmie Lee Jackson, a minister and voting rights organizer who was shot by a state trooper in nearby Marion.",
      "At the apex of the span over the Alabama River, they saw what awaited them: a line of state troopers, deputies and men on horseback. They kept going. After they approached, law enforcement gave a two-minute warning to disperse and then unleashed violence.",
      "\u201cWithin about a minute or a half, they took their billy clubs, holding it on both ends, began to push us back to back us in, and then they began to beat men, women and children, and tear gas men, women and children, and cattle prod men, women and children viciously,\u201d said Mauldin, who was 17 at the time.",
      "Selma on Sunday marked the 60th anniversary of the clash that became known as Bloody Sunday. The attack shocked the nation and galvanized support for the U.S. Voting Rights Act of 1965. The annual commemoration pays homage to those who fought to secure voting rights for Black Americans and brought calls to recommit to the fight for equality.",
      "For those gathered in Selma, the celebration comes amid concerns about new voting restrictions and the Trump administration\u2019s effort to remake federal agencies they said helped make America a democracy for all",
      "Speaking at the pulpit of the city\u2019s historic Tabernacle Baptist Church, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said what happened in Selma changed the nation. He said the 60th anniversary comes at a time when there is \u201ctrouble all around\u201d and some \u201cwant to whitewash our history.\u201d But he said like the marchers of Bloody Sunday, they must keep going.",
      "\u201cAt this moment, faced with trouble on every side, we\u2019ve got to press on,\u201d Jeffries said to the crowd that included the Rev. Jesse Jackson, multiple members of Congress and others gathered for the commemoration.",

      "Sewell, a Selma native, noted the number of voting restrictions introduced since the U.S. Supreme Court effectively abolished a key part of the Voting Rights Act that required jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination to clear new voting laws with the Justice Department. Other speakers noted the Trump administration's push to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and a rollback of equal opportunity executive orders that have been on the books since the 1960s.",
      "In 1965, the Bloody Sunday marchers led by John Lewis and Hosea Williams walked in pairs across the Selma bridge headed toward Montgomery.",
      "\u201cWe had steeled our nerves to a point where we were so determined that we were willing to confront. It was past being courageous. We were determined, and we were indignant,\u201d Mauldin recalled.",
      "He said the \u201ccountry was not a democracy for Black folks\u201d until voting rights. \"And we\u2019re still constantly fighting to make that a more concrete reality for ourselves.\u201d",
      "Kirk Carrington was just 13 on Bloody Sunday and was chased through the city by a man on a horse wielding a stick. \u201cWhen we started marching, we did not know the impact we would have in America,\" he said.",

      "Ontario leader Doug Ford confirmed the move in a news conference on Monday morning, saying it will increase costs about $10 (\u00a37.75) per megawatt-hour for US customers.",
      "Roughly 1.5 million American homes in the northern border states of New York, Michigan and Minnesota will be impacted.",
      "Ford said that the surcharge on energy will remain until the threat of tariffs from the US \"is gone for good.\"",
      "\"President Trump's tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They're making life more expensive for American families and businesses,\" Ford said in a statement on Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Mark Carney's elevation to the top job in Canada is of particular significance at this moment when his country is at the frontline of a North American trade war. He becomes the \"anti-Trump\" on the US president's doorstep.",
      "The former Bank of England governor chose to lean strongly into resisting Donald Trump's policies at his acceptance speech. He said the US president had brought \"dark days\" from \"a country we can no longer trust\" and that he was \"proud\" of Canadians resisting the US \"with their wallets\".",
      "While on trade specifically Mr Carney vowed to keep the retaliatory tariffs \"until Americans show us respect\", it was clear that the general threats against Canadian sovereignty are equally as important in his thinking.",
      "Trump has repeatedly said he will use economic power to encourage Canada to become the 51st state of the US, but Carney hit back. \"The Americans want our resources, our land, our water, our country\u2026 Canada will never be part of America in any way, shape or form,\" he said.",
      "Behind the scenes, Carney has been encouraging a very robust response to Mr Trump. As he told me last month in his only UK interview during his campaign to succeed current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, it was necessary to \"stand up to a bully\".",
      "He ridiculed Trump's allegations of Canada's involvement in fentanyl trade, and the US president's suggestion that Canada has ripped off the US. Canada's trade deficit is caused \"entirely\" by its exports of subsidised oil, Carney told me, and \"perhaps we should ask for that subsidy back\".",

      "Carney talks tough on Trump threat - but can he reset relations?",
      "How Britain's former top banker became Canada's next prime minister",
      "He follows in the footsteps of former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi as a former top central banker who became a G7 leader. It is an otherwise rare path, but it may be good timing when Canada's nearest neighbour has suggested using economic power to take over.",
      "Carney has experience in this area having dealt with a number of acute political-economic crises, such as the banking crash, the eurozone crisis, sterling's sharp slide after Brexit, and the start of the pandemic.",
      "He has also regularly attended G20 meetings at leader level, including in the presence of Trump, as chair of the Financial Stability Board, an international economic body. At one such meeting, the Trump team threatened to leave the International Monetary Fund.",
      "Carney believes that Trump only respects power. Of any attempt to mollify Trump, he said \"good luck with that\". He will focus further tariff retaliation on bringing inflation and interest rate rises to Canada's \"southern neighbour\".",
      "The Canadian election is due by October, but Carney might call an earlier one. Depending on that, he is on course to host Trump in Canada at the G7 Summit in June.",
      "His rise to the top job raises the stakes for the UK. On the one hand, a more robust approach from an allied G7 leader stands in contrast to the UK's attempt to hug the White House closely.",
      "On the other hand, Carney also hinted at wanting to diversify trade towards \"more reliable\" partners, which would include the UK and EU. Canada might send its subsidised energy to Europe, rather than the US.",
      "The bigger strategic point is that Carney's background means a focus on international solidarity, and defence of the existing multilateral system. He says Canada can \"stand on its own feet\" but sees merit in creating a more coherent international alliance to focus the minds of Congress and tariff-sceptics in the Trump administration.",
      "Canada's new leadership expects support from its Commonwealth ally, the UK. After my recent interview with him, Carney turned the camera to the portrait on the wall of the office from which he was talking to me: King Charles. The message was clear. Canada and the UK should be on the same side in this new world era."

    "story": [
      "The cost of reducing energy bills for people who live near pylons will be paid for by increasing average annual bills across the country by 80p, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has told the BBC.",
      "Under the government's plans, households in Great Britain within 500m of new or upgraded pylons will get discounts of up to \u00a32,500 over 10 years, equivalent to \u00a3250 a year.",
      "Miliband said the costs of the scheme were \"more than offset\" by the benefits of the new infrastructure.",
      "He added that the idea was not about buying people off but \"recognising the service\" they were doing for the whole country.",
      "However, rural campaign groups said it was \"impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape\".",
      "A government-commissioned report found hundreds of miles of new pylons will be needed to meet its clean energy targets.",
      "But new infrastructure proposals have sparked fierce opposition from residents in parts of the country like Norfolk and Suffolk, with campaigners arguing they will destroy the countryside.",
      "The bill discounts, which will be funded by electricity suppliers, are expected to be in place from 2026.",
      "Suppliers are expected to recoup costs by passing them on to other customers.",
      "Miliband told the BBC: \"At the moment, we're having to switch off offshore wind farms because we haven't got the transmission infrastructure.",
      "\"So everybody benefits from this. Everybody gets lower bills, and those who live near pylons are given a recognition of what they're doing.\"",
      "The idea forms part of the government's Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which is due to be published this week.",
      "The legislation aims to speed up the building of new homes and infrastructure by cutting red tape and simplifying the planning process.",
      "The government has put the changes at the heart of its push for economic growth.",

      "The government said this would mean communities could get \u00a3200,000 worth of funding per km of overhead electricity cable in their area, and \u00a3530,000 per substation.",
      "Initial analysis estimates both bill discounts and community funds could see a total additional cost of between \u00a31-2 a year for the average customer over 10 years.",
      "The government is also looking at how communities near onshore wind farms and other energy infrastructure can receive benefits.",
      "The plans were welcomed by RenewableUK, which represents the sector.",
      "The group's head of policy, James Robottom, said bill discounts would \"help to enable the roll-out of much-needed new grid infrastructure at a faster pace, so that we can make the most of the vast amounts of clean power we're producing\".",
      "However, Jackie Copley, campaign lead at CPRE, the countryside charity, said: \"Investing in local green spaces or improving community infrastructure would be a better way to spend this money.",
      "\"Paying individuals comes with many problems, including questions of fairness, likely legal challenges, and the fact that it's impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape.\"",
      "The idea of giving people living near new pylons money off their energy bills was also proposed under the previous Conservative government.",
      "A government survey in 2024 suggested 78% of people would find an energy infrastructure project more acceptable if they were offered discounts on their bills.",
      "Some energy companies already offer bill discounts to customers who live near infrastructure like wind turbines, while grants are also available for local communities affected.",
      "The bill also includes measures that would allow \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served\" process.",
      "The government says the existing system is being \"clogged up\" by speculative projects creating 10 year waits for \"viable infrastructure\".",
      "Meanwhile, the government has announced the number of bodies which get a say in planning decisions could be cut.",
      "Officials will consult on removing Sport England, the Theatres Trust and the Garden History Society from the list of \"statutory consultees\", who are legally required to provide advice on decisions.",
      "The government said in some cases organisations were slowing down building, giving the example of a housing development in Bradford which was delayed because the application was thought to have not adequately considered the speed of cricket balls from a nearby club.",

    "summary": "An unexpected nationwide strike by airport workers over pay has caused disruption at major transport hubs.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of flights have been cancelled across Germany as airport workers stage a nationwide strike over pay, posing a major disruption for air travellers.",
      "The industrial action, led by the trade union Verdi, began unexpectedly on Sunday at Hamburg Airport, before expanding to a nationwide strike.",
      "Passengers at Frankfurt, Munich, Berlin and other major hubs have been urged not to travel to airports, with operations severely disrupted. Frankfurt, Germany's busiest airport, said passengers would be unable to board flights and transfer would \"almost certainly\" be affected.",
      "Verdi, which represents public sector and transport workers, is in an ongoing dispute over wages and working conditions.",
      "German media reports thousands of flights could be cancelled across the day, disrupting travel for more than 500,000 passengers.",
      "The Lufthansa group, whose main hub is in Frankfurt, confirmed \"delays and extensive cancellations\" across all its airlines.",
      "Meanwhile, Munich Airport warned of a \"greatly reduced flight schedule\". This includes flights by Eurowings, Austrian Airlines and Swiss Air.",
      "Katja Bromm, spokeswoman for Hamburg Airport, where all 143 departures scheduled on Monday have already been cancelled, said Verdi was \"dishonourable\" to call a strike without notice at the start of the holiday season.",
      "She said that Sunday's walkouts were \"excessive and unfair to tens of thousands of travellers who have nothing to do with the disputes\".",
      "A spokesman for Verdi accepted that the strike would affect many, but said the travel disruption was necessary to extracting a better pay offer.",
      "Lars Stubbe, the union's Hamburg representative, told the BBC: \"The workers are aware that disruptions do happen, and they are uncomfortable with that, but in any case, it is the employer that caused these strikes because they haven't put a negotiable offer on the table.\"",
      "Many of Frankfurt Airport's 1,770 scheduled flights have already been cancelled, while the majority of Munich's 820 flights are expected to be cancelled.",
      "Hundreds more cancellations are anticipated across Stuttgart, Dusseldorf, Cologne and Berlin.",
      "Many passengers had already checked in their luggage and were having problems getting it returned, according to public broadcaster NDR.",
      "ADV, which represents major German airports, said the strike had \"almost completely paralysed air traffic\".",
      "Verdi's demands include an 8% pay rise, or at least \u20ac350 (\u00a3294) more per month, for all workers - and three extra days of holiday, plus one additional day for union members.",
      "Stubbe said that while airport wages range were above minimum wage, ranging from \u20ac13-\u20ac25 per hour, workers in different roles - particularly security staff - received less annual leave than others.",
      "\"There have been two rounds of negotiations in which the employers have not yet offered one penny,\" he added.",
      "\"It is quite usual that we don't get any offers in the first round, but now even in the second round, the employers have basically said, 'No, we're not going to give you an offer because we don't have any money'.\"",
      "BDLS, the body which sets security workers' pay, said in a statement: \"The damage caused by this strike is almost exclusively to companies that are not at the negotiating table.\"",
      "It called on the government to outlaw short-notice strikes, adding that air transport was \"essential for Germany as a business location\" which \"must not be exploited\" in collective pay disputes.",
      "Ralph Beisel, ADV's general manager, said the strike was having an impact on European and global air traffic, leading to missed connections due to a \"domino effect\".",
      "He called for reforms to German strike laws concerning \"critical\" infrastructure.",
      "The so-called \"warning strike\", an established tactic in German wage negotiations, concerns two separate pay disputes: one relating to airport security workers, and a broader disagreement over pay for federal and municipal government employees.",
      "Verdi has also called for strikes in waste collection across several German cities, including Berlin, Essen and Kiel, where bins have gone unemptied since last week.",
      "Pay talks for government workers are set to restart on Friday in Potsdam, while the next round of talks for airport security staff is scheduled to begin on 26 March.",
      "Niklas Benrath, of the VKA, which regulates pay and conditions for municipal workers, also criticised the strikes, saying Verdi's demands would cost nearly \u20ac15bn.",
      "\"With a total municipal debt of around \u20ac160bn, these demands are not financially viable,\" he added."

    "summary": "The NHS is looking into claims that a software flaw at Medefer left patient data vulnerable.",
    "story": [
      "The NHS is \"looking into\" allegations that patient data was left vulnerable to hacking due to a software flaw at a private medical services company.",
      "The flaw was found last November at Medefer, which handles 1,500 NHS patient referrals a month in England.",
      "The software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years.",
      "Medefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised.",
      "The flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered.",
      "In late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems.",
      "An NHS spokesperson said: \"We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate.\"",
      "Medefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data.",
      "However, the software bug, discovered in November, made Medefer's internal patient record system vulnerable to hackers, the engineer said.",
      "The software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered.",
      "\"When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'.\"",
      "The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.",
      "The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.",
      "He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.",
      "\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.",
      "On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.",
      "Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.",
      "It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was \"extremely open\".",
      "Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.",
      "The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.",
      "In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"",
      "He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.",
      "\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"",
      "The security agency will complete its review later this week.",
      "Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"",
      "Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.",
      "\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.",
      "\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added.",
      "Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.",
      "\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.",
      "Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across England.",
      "In a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector.",
      "\"Individual NHS organisations must ensure they meet their legal responsibilities and national data security standards to protect patient data when appointing suppliers, and we offer them support and training nationally on how this should be done.\""

    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will give more detail about the government's plans for the economy.",
    "story": [
      "The chancellor will give an update on her plans for the UK economy when she gives a statement alongside an economic forecast on 26 March.",
      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are made on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029/30 financial year, has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts.",
      "It is understood welfare spending is in the firing line, but other government departments will also see budgets pruned.",
      "The government already had concerns about the rising number of benefit claimants and Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system.",
      "The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty over the outcome of conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East, for raising government borrowing costs.",
      "Possible other announcements that are being reported include:",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares",
      "Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish - not shrinking, but not growing as desired.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, according to the latest official figures.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

      "Meat, dairy and sugar grown in a lab could be on sale in the UK for human consumption for the first time within two years, sooner than expected.",
      "The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is looking at how it can speed up the approval process for lab-grown foods.",
      "Such products are grown from cells in small chemical plants.",
      "UK firms have led the way in the field scientifically but feel they have been held back by the current regulations.",
      "Dog food made from meat that was grown in factory vats went on sale in the UK for the first time last month.",
      "In 2020, Singapore became the first country to authorise the sale of cell-cultivated meat for human consumption, followed by the United States three years later and Israel last year.",
      "However, Italy and the US states of Alabama and Florida have instituted bans.",
      "The FSA is to develop new regulations by working with experts from high-tech food firms and academic researchers.",
      "It says it aims to complete the full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the two-year process it is starting.",
      "But critics say that having the firms involved in drawing up the new rules represents a conflict of interest.",
      "The initiative is in response to concerns by UK firms that they are losing ground to competition overseas, where approvals processes take half the time.",
      "Prof Robin May, the FSA's chief scientist, told BBC News that there would be no compromise on consumer safety.",
      "\"We are working very closely with the companies involved and academic groups to work together to design a regulatory structure that is good for them, but at all costs ensures the safety of these products remains as high as it possibly can,\" he said.",
      "But critics such as Pat Thomas, director of the campaign group Beyond GM, are not convinced by this approach.",
      "\"The companies involved in helping the FSA to draw up these regulations are the ones most likely to benefit from deregulation and if this were any other type of food product, we would be outraged by it,\" she said.",
      "The science minister, Lord Vallance, took issue with the process being described as \"deregulation\".",
      "\"It is not deregulation, it is pro-innovation regulation,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"It is an important distinction, because we are trying to get the regulation aligned with the needs of innovation and reduce some of the bureaucracy and duplication.\"",
      "Lab-grown foods are grown into plant or animal tissue from tiny cells. This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier.",
      "The government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth.",
      "The UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures.",
      "Ivy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.",
      "The firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.",
      "\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"",
      "Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet.",
      "It doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.",
      "In this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.",
      "\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me.",
      "\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"",
      "The FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods.",
      "Prof May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right.",
      "\"It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them.\"",
      "But Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold.",
      "\"Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "There is a cheerful red awning and a newly painted cream wooden shopfront on the market square in Macclesfield.",
      "A new bakery cafe has just opened, offering ciabatta and sourdough loaves as well as hot cross buns, syrupy cakes, vegetable quiches and of course coffee.",
      "Like towns around the UK, Macclesfield has struggled with retailers closing, leaving empty stores, so there is a buzz around the new arrival.",
      "But Gail's, a brand that started in London more than 20 years ago, is controversial. It draws crowds and inspires social media memes, but attracts fierce criticism too.",
      "A recent spate of national media coverage has even asked why some people \"hate\" Gail's so much, focusing on everything from who owns it to what it does with unsold pastries.",
      "Its arrival isn't universally popular here either.",
      "\"We don't need another coffee shop,\" says Linda Willdig. She is out shopping with her friend Nicola Tomlinson, who agrees. \"There are too many,\" says Nicola.",
      "In fact, from a table outside the new Gail's you could easily throw a cinnamon bun and hit both a Caffe Nero and a Costa. Greggs is just around the corner too.",
      "So something different might have been better, says Jane Kent, a community nurse.",
      "\"People will be larding out on all the bakery stuff,\" she says. \"We don't need more pastries.\"",
      "At heart, though, the objections to Gail's are not about what it sells, but that it doesn't really belong, that it will push up prices and put independent cafes out of business.",
      "But Stephanie Lamb, a teacher on maternity leave, is more welcoming.",
      "\"I don't know Gail's, so it's not necessarily a chain to me,\" she says. \"I'm just happy to have something extra in town.\"",
      "She likes a latte and a croissant and somewhere she can read a book for an hour.",
      "At Gail's prices that would set her back \u00a36.50. Yes, it's pricey, she says, but she is still planning to \"give it a whirl\".",
      "Gail's - a name that suggests a traditional, single-owner, cafe - favours attractive old buildings, often ones vacated as bank branches close, especially if it is a corner site that means it's more visible to passers by.",
      "It has 170 outlets mostly clustered in London and the south east. But this year it plans to open around 40 more, including Ely, Cambridgeshire later this month, Bath in April, and Buxton, Derbyshire in May.",
      "At Friday's opening in Macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square.",
      "Even in the wake of the cost of living crisis, we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat. Nearly two-thirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week, according to World Coffee Portal, spending more than \u00a36 per visit on average.",
      "So coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses. There are now 11,450 branded chain outlets across the UK, up from 9,800 five years ago.",
      "Speciality chains like Black Sheep Coffee, Coffee#1 and Blank Street are springing up in city centres, while the giants like Costa and Starbucks are opening drive-throughs and outlets in retail parks.",
      "Caffe Nero has bought up several smaller chains, in different parts of the country, and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties.",
      "With enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood.",
      "Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key.",
      "He's hoping to roll Gail's out to many more neighbourhoods, including less affluent ones.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be posh,\" he insists.",
      "But for now they pick very carefully where to open, using an algorithm to help select the most promising postcodes.",
      "It flags up things like whether there is a local butcher, bookshops, a park, schools, churches or a farmers' market.",
      "\"I prefer a place that's evolving and growing rather than some place that's too established,\" he says.",
      "If the algorithm homes in on a particular High Street it is a vote of confidence in that town's future.",
      "But retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that Gail's is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification, increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents.",
      "\"Gail's is moving into areas with strong local identities. And when that happens, there will always be a reaction,\" says Kate Hardcastle, founder of Insight with Passion.",
      "\"It's not just about a bakery opening, I think it's also about what it represents.",
      "\"Some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation, while others worry it's another step back to our High Streets looking like carbon copies of each other,\" she says.",
      "In Flour, Water, Salt - a direct rival to Gail's selling sourdough bread, bagels, coffee-iced buns and sausage rolls - that is just yards from the new shop, some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer.",
      "\"Gail's isn't welcome here,\" says Karen Pearson, a businesswoman who lives just outside Macclesfield. She and her friends are worried that the arrival of Gail's means the town is \"on the up\", when in fact they would rather it \"stayed like it is\".",
      "They're not keen on big corporations coming into the town, concerned they might squeeze out independents.",
      "But firefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison, reckons Gail's is no match for a place like Flour, Water, Salt. \"It's just a posh Greggs,\" he says.",
      "Independents may not be as under threat as people fear, says Graham Soult, a retail consultant from the north of England.",
      "Local owners can offer a more personal touch, respond to local tastes and demands,  he says, while it can be hard for chains to deviate from their given formula.",
      "\"I think a lot of independents are really adept at navigating all the things that are thrown at them,\" he says.",
      "Despite difficult times, the number of independent coffee shops has risen over the last five years from 11,700 to around 12,400 now.",
      "Flour, Water, Salt's manager Toby Johnstone isn't worried. It could mean more footfall, with more people trying his shop too.",

      "Trolleys are weighed before checkout to identify any items customers who have used Scan as you Shop might have missed or scanned twice.",
      "But some shoppers are unsure whether the new technology will take off with some likening it to airport security. \"Am I at border control or Tesco?\" one Reddit user posted, while another joked \"No clubcard? Deported!\"",
      "Others questioned whether the scales were aimed at cracking down on self-scan shoplifters or cutting back on checkout staff. Tesco declined to comment.",
      "Tesco Clubcard members already have the option to use Scan as you Shop handsets as they fill their trolleys then check out and pay at the end.",
      "Now in the Gateshead Trinity Square Extra store, shoppers can push their trolley on to the scales and if the weight matches the items they've scanned they pay as normal. If there is a discrepancy a staff member will do a manual rescan of the whole trolley.",
      "'Treated like a thief'",
      "Although some Reddit users who commented on the photo of the scales were positive with one saying \"they are 10x more convenient and faster\", many were more critical of their introduction.",
      "\"More and more the honest shopper is treated like a thief,\" one said, while another wrote \"the point of all this is to save on staff\".",
      "Business retail consultant Ged Futter told the BBC this was about loss prevention and staffing costs.",
      "\"There is no way this is about making it quicker for the shopper. It's supposed to be scan and go - this is scan and stop while your trolley is weighed.\"",
      "He said self-scan had increased the rate of shoplifting but instead of putting staff back on tills, supermarkets were trying to use even more technology to stop thefts.",
      "\"This is supermarkets saying, 'we know there are thefts so what we are going to do is treat every customer in exactly the same way to reduce theft'.",
      "\"They're forgetting that trust is the most important thing for all of the retailers and it works both ways. If customers don't feel trusted or think they're being treated like thieves they will go somewhere else.\"",
      "The British Retail Consortium has said shoplifting is \"out of control\" after its annual crime survey found incidents of customer theft reported by retailers in the UK rose by 3.7 million to 20.4 million, and cost retailers \u00a32bn.",
      "Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics revealed shoplifting offences reported by police in England and Wales rose by 23% to more than 492,000 over the same period.",
      "That is the highest figure since current recording practices began in 2003.",
      "Retail criminologist Prof Emmeline Taylor told the BBC she had seen similar trolley scales used in European supermarkets and there was \"definitely an element of trying to control loss\" but added \"let's not forget a lot of scan and go loss can be accidental\".",
      "A random audit of 20,000 scan and go baskets found 43% had at least one error, a 2022 global study on self-checkout found.",
      "Prof Taylor said Tesco's scales were \"quite foreboding and reminiscent of security scanners\".",
      "\"They don't want to give the impression that they are pointing the finger at their honest customer,\" she said.",
      "\"They will need to balance how they respond when there is a weight discrepancy because you can lose a customer for life if they feel they've been wrongly accused of something.\"",
      "She said she could see customers getting frustrated using the scales.",
      "\"You've left your handbag in the trolley, you've got to take your child out of the seat, you might be queueing behind someone who has been stopped and you can't get through so the trial needs to focus on minimising friction points in the customer experience.\"",
      "The scales are the latest example of supermarkets turning to technology to streamline time and costs. The ratio of self-scan to staffed tills continues to be fiercely debated. Some shoppers love the speed and convenience while others are fed up of hearing \"unexpected item in the bagging area\".",
      "In August upmarket north of England supermarket chain Booths got rid of self-scan altogether, while Asda and Morrisons said they would put more staff back on manned tills."

      "The government spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), will not be including the impact of these new rules on the government finances in their assessment of the government finances this March.",

      "China is reported to be helping to sustain Russia's war effort with large volumes of dual-use technology, which it denies.",
      "The White House administration cannot have failed to notice the chorus of criticism that all the pressure for a peace deal is being piled on just Ukraine, not Russia. So it is possible that Trump's threat is an attempt to present itself as being more even-handed.",
      "The problem is, we simply do not know what was discussed and what was agreed in that \"lengthy and highly productive\" 90-minute phone call that Donald Trump suddenly announced he had held last month with the Russian president.",
      "So far, Vladimir Putin has played a clever hand, sitting back and doubtless enjoying watching the transatlantic alliance come apart at the seams.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's decision to establish official government cryptocurrency reserves in the US has drawn criticism from industry watchers.",
      "He has signed an executive order creating what he calls a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as well as a Digital Asset Stockpile, which will consist of other forms of digital currency.",
      "The funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings.",
      "White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks likened them to a \"a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency\", drawing comparison to the Kentucky military base that stores a significant portion of US gold assets.",
      "However, some crypto enthusiasts have criticised the government for not being bolder, while others have raised question marks about the lack of transparency over the process.",
      "Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal government's existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (\u00a313.6bn) at today's prices.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the White House ahead of a special crypto summit on Friday, Sacks said that it was a \"real shame that we did not maximise value for the American taxpayer.\"",
      "\"What we want to do is make sure that with the remaining Bitcoin that we have,\" he added.",
      "Nonetheless, Charles Edwards of the Capriole Fund, a Bitcoin and digital assets hedge fund, called Thursday's announcement \"a pig in lipstick\" in response to Sacks' post on X.",
      "\"No active buying means this is just a fancy title for Bitcoin holdings that already existed with the government,\" he said.",
      "Trump's executive order says that the Treasury and Commerce secretary will come up with strategies for acquiring more government Bitcoin, provided these are \"budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers\".",
      "That meant, Sacks told reporters, they are only \"allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt.\"",
      "Jason Yanowitz, Co-Founder of crypto firm Blockworks, agrees with the idea of a Bitcoin reserve but says the inclusion of other coins sets a \"horrible precedent\" and \"makes no sense.\"",
      "\"Without a clear framework, we risk arbitrary asset selections, which would distort the markets and drive a loss of public trust,\" he suggested.",
      "Other analysts though have been more positive.",
      "\"This approach makes much more sense than buying the assets,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.",
      "\"It would surely be bizarre for the US to sell dollars to buy crypto, when the dollar is the globe's reserve currency and therefore a source of enormous influence.\"",
      "'Won't cost a dime'",
      "Further details are expected when the president speaks to the first crypto summit at the White House.",
      "It is unclear how a crypto reserve would benefit Americans, but Sacks told reporters it \"will not cost taxpayers a dime\".",
      "It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.",
      "The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset. While the reserve will exclusively contain Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies will go into a separate stockpile.",
      "His implication that the US government would not buy Bitcoin led prices of the world's largest cryptocurrency to fall by more than 5%.",
      "Some countries maintain strategic reserves of national assets to diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risk.",

      "Meanwhile, he said it is \"galvanising a response from Europe, especially Germany, so we've seen a more positive reaction to European markets\".",
      "In signing the orders, Trump dismissed the suggestion that he was walking back the measures because of concerns about the stock market.",

      "The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), one of the largest buyers of alcohol in the world, removed US-made alcoholic drinks from its shelves on Tuesday.",
      "Brown-Forman boss Lawson Whiting said the Canadian response was \"disproportionate\" to the 25% levies on Canadian goods imposed by the Trump administration.",
      "\"I mean, that's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves,\" Mr Whiting said.",
      "In response to the tariffs, Canada has retaliated with 25% levies on goods imported from the US, including beer, spirits, and wine.",
      "Some provinces also took action themselves, including Ontario and Nova Scotia.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the LCBO sells nearly $1bn of US alcohol per year. \"As of today, every single one of these products is off the shelves,\" Mr Ford said on Tuesday.",
      "The LCBO is the exclusive wholesaler in Ontario, which means other retailers, bars and restaurants in the province will no longer be able to restock US products, Mr Ford said.",
      "Nevertheless, Mr Whiting said Canada makes up only 1% of Brown-Forman's total sales, so the firm can withstand the hit.",
      "Canadians are being advised by the LCBO to buy products made in Canada. Some Canadians have been turning to local goods anyway in response to the Trump tariffs.",

    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but his experience managing global economic crises will help.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, will be Canada's next prime minister, at least for now. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect it to be called as early as this month.",

      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working for Goldman Sachs in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University.",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "In his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Carney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "His political ambitions have been rumoured for years, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister."

      "Not directly, of course. Rather, it was the two Nordic nations' response to the invasion that turned fear into hope.",
      "Both countries applied for membership of the Western defence alliance Nato in May 2022, some three months after the winter invasion.",
      "Less than three years later, they're both full members and already reaping the benefits, in terms of both national security and economics.",
      "\"We're no longer a country that cannot be trusted,\" observes Micael Johansson, chief executive of Swedish defence company Saab, in reference to the nation's previous historic neutrality.",
      "He points out that in the year since Sweden joined Nato in March 2024, Saab has already negotiated framework agreements with the Nato Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). The NSPA is the body that organises Nato's ordering from defence firms.",
      "Mr Johansson adds it is now much easier to gain insights into what's going on inside the alliance. \"We couldn't access NSPAs before,\" he says.",
      "Jukka Siukosaari, Finland's Ambassador to the UK, agrees. \"Being part of Nato brings us on an equal footing with all the other allies. It enlarges the possibilities for Finnish companies in the defence sector and beyond.\"",
      "Private companies will benefit from pledges by Nato member states to increase defence spending.",
      "Presently, only 23 of the organisation's 32 member states currently meet a defence spending target of 2% of GDP, but ambitions have grown in recent months, only to surge in recent weeks and days amidst plenty of turbulence within the alliance.",
      "Amidst uncertainty about what Nato might look like in future, there is no doubt that these higher spending commitments will remain and perhaps even strengthen if Europe was to decide it could no longer rely on the USA.",
      "Nato's newest members' spending commitments are already ahead of those expressed by several existing members. Last year, Finland spent 2.4% and Sweden 2.2% of their respective GDP on defence, and both aim to raise this to between 2.6% and 3% in the next three years.",
      "Examples of new Nato initiatives on Europe's northern flank include the establishment of new Nato bases, and efforts to establish joint defence forces, in northern Finland.",
      "Plus the formation of The Joint Nordic Air Command, which brings together Finland's, Sweden's, Norway's and Denmark's 250 front-line combat aircraft under a joined up command structure, with flexible basing and backed by shared intelligence.",
      "In addition, substantial investments will be required to replenish stockpiles of advanced weapons systems, including missiles and anti-tank systems, Mr Johansson points out.",

      "Aerial surveillance programmes and underwater systems are also increasingly in demand as the returning tension between Russia and the West brings a new chill to the Arctic region.",
      "In these areas Saab's boss is eager to promote its own solutions, such as the GlobalEye airborne early warning and control platform, and its Sea Wasp, a remotely-controlled underwater vehicle that can neutralise explosive devices.",
      "Yet given Donald Trump's strong emphasis on \"America first\", it is unlikely that he will be happy with European Nato members choosing Saab, or indeed any other European defence firm over US rivals.",
      "Europe will need to balance its desire to reduce its reliance on the US with its obvious need to retain American support.",
      "European members will also need to consider Nato's defence systems' complexities and interdependencies. They often combine technologies and machines, weaponry and ammunition, vehicles, crafts and vessels, that are produced in several different Nato countries.",
      "In a sense, then, the alliance is held together by complex supply chains and contractual agreements that could not possibly be untangled overnight.",
      "\"Europe's Trans-Atlantic relationship will always remain important,\" says Mr Johansson, though he also points to a \"growing realisation in Europe that we have to do more on our own\".",
      "\"The US really protects its own defence industry, and we should do the same in Europe,\" he says, as he welcomes \"fierce competition\" between commercial defence companies.",
      "Much of this competition may be between relative newcomers to the defence industry, however.",
      "Finnish government agency Business Finland has published a guidebook that offers advice to companies on how to do business with Nato.",
      "Its authors predict that the armed forces on both sides of the Atlantic will have \"significant new needs for services and equipment, both hi-tech and low-tech\".",
      "Many of these needs will need to be met by start-ups and established small to medium-sized companies, says the guide, rather than exclusively by large, established defence companies.",
      "Johan Sj\u00f6berg, security and defence policy advisor at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, says Nato membership has opened doors for Swedish companies, not least because \"the perspective of other countries and companies [towards them] has changed\".",
      "Mr Sj\u00f6berg adds that he favours a \"holistic view, that security is good for business, as increased security and stability provide long-term credibility\".",
      "In Finland too, Nato membership has created new opportunities, especially for the plethora of small and medium-sized companies that Ambassador Siukosaari refer to as \"Nokia-spin-offs\".",
      "These are expected to increasingly provide cutting edge tech, such as drones, sensors and digital surveillance systems for programmes such as the Norway-to-Poland \"drone wall\" that six Nato members are developing to defend their borders with Russia.",
      "Indeed, as the nature of warfare changes, Europe's security may increasingly rely on cyber-defence and the protection of civilian installations such as systems-critical seabed pipelines and cables.",
      "But perhaps the most revolutionary idea to emerge from Nato's Nordic expansion is the region's \"Total Defence\" concept.",
      "Also applied by Norway and Denmark, it considers national infrastructure such as the internet and telephony, energy generation and distribution, road networks, and secure supplies of food, medicine as parts of a total defence system.",
      "Much of this may not be registered as defence spending in the statistics, but at the same time, none of it is free.",
      "Beyond the civilian infrastructure spending, national military service, for instance, sometimes takes people away from the economically productive parts of the economy, Ambassador Siukosaari points out.",
      "But perhaps what they deliver does more for the nation than mere provision of products and services?",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:01:51 GMT",
    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

    "summary": "A minister says nearly all key details have been finalised for a deal giving the US access to the country's minerals.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready to sign a deal with the US on the joint development of his country's mineral deposits at \"any time and in any convenient format\".",
      "It comes days after an acrimonious visit to Washington, during which Zelensky clashed with Donald Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance in front of journalists and TV cameras.",
      "The deal was supposed to be signed during that visit, but was put on hold as the Ukrainian president left the White House early.",
      "Days later, in a social media statement which came hours after the US paused all military aid to Ukraine, Zelensky expressed his gratitude over American support for Ukraine and said he was ready to sign the deal.",
      "Trump said he appreciated the message, although it is not clear if or when the deal will be signed.",

      "What minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.",
      "This includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.",
      "It is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries.",
      "Other elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors.",
      "Deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant.",
      "Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",
      "Dr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.",
      "What we know about US-Ukraine minerals deal",
      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Trump has changed Ukraine conversation, Starmer says",
      "Zelensky willing to give up presidency in exchange for Nato membership",
      "Why does the US want Ukraine's minerals?",
      "Critical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.",
      "Additionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.",
      "In December, China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.",
      "How would a deal help Kyiv exploit its minerals?",
      "Some commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\", but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.",
      "According to the World Economic Forum, Ukraine has about 20,000 mineral deposits covering 116 types, but only about 15% of sites were being actively exploited at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "For instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.",
      "Developing these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine.",
      "She argues that if Ukraine can attract US investors to help develop its natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.",
      "\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"",
      "Trump has also suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act as a security guarantee to deter Russian aggression in the future, but Ukraine and European leaders have insisted that would not be enough."

      "Classrooms around Northern Ireland have filled up with spudulicious recreations of Matilda, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Harry Potter and more.",
      "One principal said it is a chance for parent-child connection and creativity, and brings the focus back to the book.",

      "Financial pressures",
      "Mrs Davidson said the decision was made given the financial pressures already facing parents.",
      "\"Due to the economic climate, instead of having families spend money on dressing up, we wanted to take a different approach.\"",
      "'Real success'",
      "Mrs Davidson told BBC News NI that the school's different approach to World Book Day has brought about a lot of excitement - from both the pupils and their parents.",
      "\"All the children have been eager and excited to talk about their favourite character and their favourite book.",
      "\"Even from the adults that I've spoken to today dropping their kids off to school with their potato have told me how much they enjoyed this project - and it's all come from using a simple spud!\"",
      "'Weird and wonderful'",
      "Emma McGuinness, Principal of Eglinton Primary School in Londonderry, said decorating potatoes has let pupils' creativity shine - with the added bonus of being more affordable for families.",
      "\"We're a rural farming community here at Eglington, so we thought potatoes are something the children would have easy access to.",
      "\"We have some weird and wonderful ideas here, they're amazing - the creative natures of the pupils have really shone.\"",
      "'Busy day'",
      "But at Eglinton, pupils are encouraged to dress up as well as dressing their potatoes.",
      "\"The children are dressing up, we're having a book swap so they can bring in books they no longer read and swap them for new ones, and we've also got parents and grandparents coming in and out to read stories to the different classes,\" Ms McGuinness said.",

    "story": [
      "Athol Fugard, who has died aged 92, was widely acclaimed as one of South Africa's greatest playwrights.",
      "The son of an Afrikaner mother, he was best known for his politically charged plays challenging the racist system of apartheid.",
      "Paying tribute to Fugard, South Africa's Arts and Culture Minister Gayton McKenzie hailed him as \"a fearless storyteller who laid bare the harsh realities of apartheid through his plays\".",
      "\"We were cursed with apartheid, but blessed with great artists who shone a light on its impact and helped to guide us out of it. We owe a huge debt to this late, wonderful man,\" McKenzie added.",
      "Fugard wrote more than 30 plays in a career that spanned 70 years, making his mark with The Blood Knot in 1961.",
      "It was the first play in South Africa with a black and white actor - Fugard himself - performing in a front of a multiracial audience, before the apartheid regime  introduced laws prohibiting mixed casts and audiences.",
      "The Blood Knot catapulted Fugard onto the international stage - with the play shown in the US, and adapted for British television.",
      "The apartheid regime later confiscated his passport, but it strengthened Fugard's resolve to keep breaking racial barriers and exposing the injustices of apartheid.",
      "He went on to work with the Serpent Players, a group of black actors, and performed in black townships, despite harassment from the apartheid regime's security forces.",
      "Fugard's celebrated plays included Boesman and Lena, which looked at the difficult circumstances of a mixed-race couple. Having premiered in 1969, it was made into a film in 2000 starring Danny Glover and Angela Bassett.",
      "His novel, Tsotsi, was made into a film, winning the 2006 Oscar for best foreign language movie.",
      "The premier of South Africa's Western Cape province, Alan Winde, said that Fugard had a \"penetrating, sharp wit\", and his \"acute understanding of our country's political and cultural make-up is unmatched\".",
      "\"He will be sorely missed,\" Winde added.",
      "Other well-known plays by him include Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and The Island, which he co-wrote with the actors John Kani and Winston Ntshona, in a powerful condemnation of life on Robben Island, where anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela was imprisoned.",
      "In a simple tribute on X, Kani posted: \"I am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend Athol Fugard. May his soul rest in eternal peace. Elder \ud83c\udf39\"",
      "Fugard won several awards for his work, and received a lifetime achievement honour at the prestigious Tony awards in 2011, while Time magazine described him in the 1985 as the greatest active playwright in the English-speaking world.",
      "\"Apartheid defined me, that is true... But I am proud of the work that came out of it, that carries my name,\" Fugard told the AFP news agency in 1995.",
      "Fugard feared that the end of apartheid in 1994 could leave him with little to do, but he still found enough material to write.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2010, he said that he shared the view of the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu that \"we have lost our way\" as a nation.",
      "\"I think the present society in South Africa needs the vigilance of writers, every bit as much as the old one did.",

    "summary": "Stars like Charli XCX have made see-through outfits all the rage at big events, but not everyone's a fan.",
    "story": [
      "Six months ago, a viral TikTok trend made us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks.",
      "At the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.",
      "She used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said. \"I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"",
      "The nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress.",
      "The love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo.",
      "At Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath.",
      "Rapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show.",
      "Naked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too.",
      "As Vogue wrote in January: \"For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season.\"",
      "Dior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes.",
      "Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as \"demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes\".",
      "The trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing \"a strappy white top with no bra\".",
      "Sheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again.",
      "The trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The \"free the nipple\" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014.",
      "Charli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. \"Stop policing women's bodies,\" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so \"why is society judging?\"",
      "But many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance.",
      "\"Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,\" one person wrote on social media.",
      "'Challenging fashion norms'",
      "Fashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a \"provocative statement\", but says it's a \"way to reclaim the right to govern one's body\".",
      "The controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds.",
      "Abhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend \"is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion\".",
      "The idea of freeing the nipple \"isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms\", he argues.",
      "\"Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers.\"",
      "It seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars.",
      "Shock value is surely a factor for some, too, though.",
      "At Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty.",
      "There were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress.",
      "\"This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,\" the New York Times noted.",
      "However, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because \"it's only women who do this\".",
      "\"It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,\" she wrote.",
      "Some men have been embracing the nearly naked trend, though. In 2022, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wore striking a backless red top at Venice Film Festival, and at the 2023 Grammys Harry Styles freed the nipple in a plunge harlequin jumpsuit.",
      "It's the women who will continue to cause more of a stir on runways and red carpets - and society will still be split on whether it's redefining conventional notions of modesty in fashion, a product of misogyny, or simply seeking attention.",

    "story": [
      "About 15 years ago, an Indian rapper of humble origins broke onto the country's then-infertile hip-hop music scene and transformed it forever.",
      "He teased, cajoled and vexed his listeners, daring them to explore the \"devilish\" contours of his mind, as he sang rash rhymes about parties, drugs and \"seducing\" women. His songs played in clubs and weddings, blaring from stereos at big parties and roadside tea stalls alike.",
      "Then, at the peak of his career, he vanished. Seven years later, Yo Yo Honey Singh is back - with a new album and an ongoing music tour, claiming to be a changed man after a prolonged battle with drug abuse and mental health struggles.",
      "The 41-year-old singer and producer was once one of India's biggest music stars, a figure who \"moved the cultural gravity of hip-hop music\", says music journalist Bhanuj Kappal in Famous, a recent Netflix documentary on Singh.",
      "But he was also deeply controversial - and, by his own admission, an \"aggressive and reckless man\", routinely accused of promoting vulgarity, debauchery and violence through his music.",
      "Many criticised Singh's lyrics for depicting violence against women and rape, an image that gained further traction in the press after his former wife and childhood sweetheart accused him of domestic violence in her divorce filing. Singh has denied the charge.",
      "Seven years later, the singer is no longer the defiant hitmaker who once ruled the charts with his provocative, foot-tapping anthems.",
      "A lot has changed in the intervening years, including Indian hip-hop, which has evolved into a thriving, dynamic space. Artists once inspired by his sound have now surpassed him as the genre's leading voices.",
      "Singh also seems different. From someone who described himself as \"the all-knowing master of the universe\", he now identifies as a God-fearing man who believes in good energies, the cyclic nature of life and \"scientific astrologers\".",
      "He claims his music is now more conscious, moving beyond drugs to something deeper. But loyal fans say it's lost its edge and his latest tracks haven't left a mark.",
      "\"He has a core audience that will stick with him forever... but his vision is old now. It's outdated,\" Kappal says.",
      "But Singh is not ready to be written off, yet.",
      "Instead of trying to conceal or defend his personal struggles with fame and drugs, he has made it the centrepiece of his comeback.",
      "Since his return, Singh has candidly admitted his struggles with addiction and mental health. \"Drugs destroyed me completely,\" he told Lallantop, a digital news platform. \"I lost myself to fame, money and women. I was like a devil, completely satanic.\"",
      "In interviews, he is witty and relaxed, speaking with the clarity of a tormented artist who, after battling his inner demons, seems to have unlocked a spiritual truth",
      "\"What goes around comes around, I really believe that,\" he said recently. \"It took a lot of time for me to get out from where I was stuck. But I am back now.\"",
      "Born Hridesh Singh in Punjab state, he grew up in a cramped Delhi neighbourhood. Those tough early years shaped his music and still echo in his work today.",

      "Singh always knew he wanted a career in music. He started as a college DJ, later moving into production full-time. \"I wanted to make beats and produce music, not sing or write,\" he says.",
      "But after years as a small-time producer in Punjab, he realised it wouldn't be enough. \"My sounds were too urban for the place. People didn't understand it. For that, I had to go beyond the state.\"",
      "So he went solo. In 2011, Singh released The International Villager, his breakout album. Blending Punjabi folk - its dhol beats and string melodies - with global hip-hop, he created something entirely new.",
      "For three months, it seemed the formula had failed. Then everything changed. Overnight, the songs went viral, topped charts, won awards - and catapulted Singh into Bollywood.",
      "Brown Rang, a song about a brown man's global ambition, became YouTube's most-watched video in 2012. Shot in Dubai on a million-dollar budget, it introduced many Indians to the bling of hip-hop - fast cars, baggy clothes, gem-studded watches and gold chains - set to slick, thumping beats.",
      "Despite mounting criticism over his misogynistic lyrics, Singh packed stadiums and churned out hits, breaking into Bollywood with songs for stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar.",
      "\"A lot of times, my lyrics were trash, even I knew that. But people were still listening to it because the sound was so good and fresh,\" he told Lallantop.",
      "But Singh's ascent to fame coincided with his personal downfall.",
      "\"I was drowning in drugs and alcohol, smoking 12-15 joints and downing bottles. I abandoned my family, lost control. This one time, I got so high I bit a friend on his stomach eight times,\" he told Lallantop.",
      "In 2017, Singh broke down mid-tour - a moment that shook him. He quit music and substances, returned to Delhi and began recovery with a global team of doctors and therapists. \"I told my family I was mentally unwell. I can't do anything till I get better.\"",
      "Singh says he's been sober for seven years, except for the occasional beer.",
      "\"I have been to hell and back,\" he says in Famous. \"Even now, I wake up hazy because of the medicines.\"",
      "Fans, however, appreciate Singh's raw honesty about his self-destructive tendencies - and his effort to overcome them.",
      "\"No-one's perfect. But at least Singh tries to be better. He may have left the scene briefly but his music never stopped playing,\" says Nandini Gupta, a Delhi-based  student.",
      "Others see his transformation as performative, noting his new music remains problematic. \"Though toned down, he is still objectifying women and talking only about money and fame,\" says listener Bushra Neyazi.",
      "No matter how you see it, Singh's redemption feels like another challenge to his audience - pushing them to accept his complicated past and give his music another chance.",
      "\"I was away for seven years, but I will drive everyone mad again in the next seven,\" he said recently.",

    "story": [
      "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star.",
      "Just ask Lady Gaga.",
      "Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.",
      "Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".",
      "And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".",
      "When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.",
      "On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.",
      "\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two.",
      "\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"",
      "Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.",
      "\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"",
      "The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.",
      "In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.",
      "But on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.",
      "\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.",
      "\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'",
      "\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"",
      "It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.",
      "\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal.",
      "\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"",
      "Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem.",
      "Called (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.",
      "She calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.",
      "Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.",
      "Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.",
      "\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.",
      "\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"",
      "'Angriest song'",
      "With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.",
      "On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".",
      "In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.",
      "There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created.",
      "It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.",
      "\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.",
      "\"It kind of took me down.\"",
      "How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?",
      "\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.",
      "\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.",
      "\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.",
      "\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"",
      "In previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.",
      "Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.",
      "\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.",
      "\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"",
      "From the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase.",
      "Last summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.",
      "It was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.",
      "\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.",
      "\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.",
      "\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"",
      "As an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.",
      "Back then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.",
      "Over the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.",
      "But the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.",
      "She puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".",
      "\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"",
      "With an air of finality, she adds: \"I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop.",

      "We see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken.",
      "It's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with \"keepsake packaging\").",

      "It's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains.",
      "Whether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides.",
      "It's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life.",
      "Instead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. \"Love is in the detail, gang,\" she says. And \"it's time to pop a bottle\" for a glass of champagne.",
      "Meghan dominates every moment of the 33-minute episodes of this lifestyle TV series, whether it's cooking, gardening, chatting, dancing. Or, as the series begins, beekeeping, as we see Meghan out harvesting honey, dressed in a beekeepers' outfit.",
      "And of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever. In the show a guest says \"Oh my God\" as he tries the raspberry jam, with the jam appearing through the series.",
      "It's also appearing for sale as \"raspberry spread\" in the As Ever food range, which so far doesn't have prices published alongside.",
      "Meghan is shown picking blackberries from rows of bushes: \"This is sort of what inspired my jam and preserve making,\" with picking fruit a \"daily task\".",
      "The hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with \"Wildflower honey with honeycomb\" going on sale.",
      "We see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower \"sprinkles\" are also part of the new range.",
      "Mindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan.",
      "\"When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life,\" said Kaling.",
      "\"But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special...\"'",
      "Meghan reveals she saved the number one jar for her mother, Doria Ragland as \"it felt like the right thing to do\".",
      "We learn about Meghan's fashion style. She likes \"high low\" fashion, mixing up high street fashions with expensive designers.",
      "There's also clarification that her name is Sussex now and not Markle, when she challenges Mindy Kaling over using her maiden name.",
      "\"I didn't know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go 'this is our family name, our little family name',\" says Meghan.",
      "There are occasional glimpses of another life. She mentions: \"I was a latchkey kid, so I grew up with a lot of fast food and TV tray meals.\" Even a domestic goddess had to grow up somewhere.",
      "She's shown wrapping a gift and says: \"I used to teach a gift-wrapping class when I was an auditioning actress.\"",
      "As a viewer, you want to pause and find out more about that. But the show rushes on. There's a toughness here.",
      "In the final episode we see Prince Harry briefly, congratulating her on launching her As Ever business. And she raises a toast to this \"new chapter\" which is \"part of that creativity that I've missed so much\".",
      "Does this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.",
      "Everything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more.",
      "This series will inevitably get attention because of Meghan's involvement. But will there be enough for either her fans or her detractors to get their teeth into? How strongly can you feel about a cake with a few raspberries on top? Opinions will be divided. As Ever.",

    "story": [
      "The NHS is \"looking into\" allegations that patient data was left vulnerable to hacking due to a software flaw at a private medical services company.",
      "The flaw was found last November at Medefer, which handles 1,500 NHS patient referrals a month in England.",
      "The software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years.",
      "Medefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised.",
      "The flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered.",
      "In late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems.",
      "An NHS spokesperson said: \"We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate.\"",
      "Medefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data.",
      "However, the software bug, discovered in November, made Medefer's internal patient record system vulnerable to hackers, the engineer said.",
      "The software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered.",
      "\"When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'.\"",
      "The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.",
      "The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.",
      "He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.",
      "\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.",
      "On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.",
      "Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.",
      "It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was \"extremely open\".",
      "Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.",
      "The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.",
      "In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"",
      "He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.",
      "\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"",
      "The security agency will complete its review later this week.",
      "Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"",
      "Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.",
      "\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.",
      "\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added.",
      "Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.",
      "\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.",
      "Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across England.",
      "In a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector.",
      "\"Individual NHS organisations must ensure they meet their legal responsibilities and national data security standards to protect patient data when appointing suppliers, and we offer them support and training nationally on how this should be done.\""

      "Such products are grown from cells in small chemical plants.",
      "UK firms have led the way in the field scientifically but feel they have been held back by the current regulations.",

      "It says it aims to complete the full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the two-year process it is starting.",
      "But critics say that having the firms involved in drawing up the new rules represents a conflict of interest.",
      "The initiative is in response to concerns by UK firms that they are losing ground to competition overseas, where approvals processes take half the time.",
      "Prof Robin May, the FSA's chief scientist, told BBC News that there would be no compromise on consumer safety.",
      "\"We are working very closely with the companies involved and academic groups to work together to design a regulatory structure that is good for them, but at all costs ensures the safety of these products remains as high as it possibly can,\" he said.",
      "But critics such as Pat Thomas, director of the campaign group Beyond GM, are not convinced by this approach.",
      "\"The companies involved in helping the FSA to draw up these regulations are the ones most likely to benefit from deregulation and if this were any other type of food product, we would be outraged by it,\" she said.",
      "The science minister, Lord Vallance, took issue with the process being described as \"deregulation\".",
      "\"It is not deregulation, it is pro-innovation regulation,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"It is an important distinction, because we are trying to get the regulation aligned with the needs of innovation and reduce some of the bureaucracy and duplication.\"",
      "Lab-grown foods are grown into plant or animal tissue from tiny cells. This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier.",
      "The government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth.",
      "The UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures.",
      "Ivy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.",
      "The firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.",
      "\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"",
      "Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet.",
      "It doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.",
      "In this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.",
      "\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me.",
      "\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"",
      "The FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods.",

    "story": [
      "When Branneisha Cooper was overweight, she felt both invisible and like she stood out.",
      "Her friends would get attention when they were out together, while she was overlooked. But she also had a sense that everyone was staring at her, scrutinising her.",
      "Everyday scenarios were daunting: fairground rides (would she fit in the seat?), working out (would it hurt?), clothes shopping (would she find attractive clothing in her size?).",
      "At the end of 2022, Branneisha, now 28 and working in Texas for a major retailer, began using weight-loss injection Mounjaro. She's lost about six stone (38kg).",
      "Things changed quickly. Suddenly, she could exercise without her body getting sore, colleagues made more small talk with her and she felt comfortable going on adventurous dates with her boyfriend. She was go-karting, dancing and going to arcades - activities that previously made her feel self-conscious.",
      "But despite feeling like she had a \"second chance at life\", weight loss was bittersweet.",
      "\"It was almost like I had stepped into a different world overnight,\" Branneisha recalls. \"People were suddenly more friendly, more attentive, and I was given opportunities and respect that didn't exist before.\"",
      "\"That rapid shift was jarring and really opened my eyes to just how deeply size bias is ingrained in our culture,\" she continues. \"Psychologically, it was a lot to process because while I was the same person, the way I was perceived had completely changed.\"",
      "Weight-loss transformations are nothing new. In the 90s and 00s, they filled the pages of tabloid newspapers, sold celebrity diet regimes and inspired popular TV series like The Biggest Loser, You Are What You Eat and Celebrity Fit Club.",
      "But in the 2020s, the advent of weight-loss injections like semaglutide and tirzepatide (marketed under brand names Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro) has meant people can lose huge amounts of weight rapidly, without undergoing invasive surgery. The jabs suppress people's appetites, causing them to feel fuller sooner.",
      "Wegovy has been available on the NHS in England, Wales and Scotland since September 2023 with strict eligibility criteria, but weight-loss drugs are expected to become more accessible when Mounjaro becomes available through NHS England later this year.",
      "The jabs, which are not suitable for everyone and can have severe side effects, are also available from pharmacies in the UK for people who can't get them prescribed by their GPs.",
      "So other than the physical difference, how does the way you're perceived change when you lose weight quickly and look different to the world?",
      "People who have used the injections have told BBC News that rapid weight loss has caused a massive shift in the way they are treated - by both strangers and loved ones - as well as a change in how they approach their lives.",
      "'Strangers are a lot more chatty'",
      "Branneisha's feeling of sticking out and being overlooked at the same time while overweight is one others can relate to.",
      "When you're overweight, people either avoid eye contact or \"really stare and glare at you\", says Jess Phillips, 29, a primary school teacher from Sittingbourne, Kent.",
      "She previously felt uncomfortable taking flights, travelling on public transport and eating at restaurants. Finding suitable seating worried her, as well as the feeling she was \"taking other people's space\".",
      "People had even shouted \"fat\" at her from cars and at a festival.",
      "A trip in 2023 to Sorrento, on the Italian coast, was a major catalyst for starting weight-loss injections last June.",
      "\"Everyone was staring at me the whole time,\" she says. \"They're just not used to people being that big out there.\"",
      "Since losing weight, Jess has noticed a big difference in how she's treated in public.",
      "\"Strangers seem to be a lot more chatty with me than they ever were before,\" she explains.",

    "story": [
      "LED technology has been used to address a number of skin issues, such as eczema, mild to moderate acne, psoriasis and sun damage in a medical setting.",
      "But the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from \u00a340 to \u00a31,500.",
      "The technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly.",
      "Mask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny?",
      "The LED market is set to be worth \u00a3600m globally by 2032 - which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will be worth at the same point.",
      "According to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).",
      "\"This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,\" he adds.",
      "A recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works.",
      "US space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration.",
      "Since then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists \"for many years\", according to Dr Kentley.",
      "But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.",
      "The main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.",
      "LED therapy masks are 'visually interesting'",
      "Dr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks \"sound promising\", mask wholesale manufacturers are \"speculating\" about their benefits.",
      "\"I don't believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident.",
      "\"So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest,\" she adds.",
      "Skincare makes up nearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry - and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year.",
      "This is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to be fuelled by social media trends.",
      "Dr Kluk says she has noticed \"that people's interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid\" and believes the \"visually interesting\" element of the at-home LED mask makes it such an eye-catching product to sell online.",
      "\"People sitting watching TV wearing a red LED mask increases people's curiosity.",
      "\"Every other consultation I've had for the last six months, has involved people asking me about LED masks,\" she adds.",
      "When you search LED masks on social media platforms such as TikTok, you will be met with hundreds of videos with users showing off their results after using one of these at-home devices.",
      "Natalie O'Neill, 29, tells the BBC she started to use a mask \"out of curiosity to see if I would notice any difference\" and did not use it to treat an existing skin condition like acne.",
      "The skincare content creator says:  \"I noticed a change in my skin after a couple of weeks and felt it prevented breakouts really well.\"",
      "She adds that the mask has helped to \"keep my skin tone looking more even\" and faded marks on her face more quickly.",
      "O'Neill was not paid to promote a particular mask and caveats all her content on this technology by saying she uses it alongside a consistent skincare routine.",
      "\"Getting red light or LED therapy in a clinic is not immediately transferable to a mask, which a lot of consumers don't realise - I'm OK with that because I have the right expectations,\" she adds.",
      "Part of the appeal of LED masks is that they are easy to use and therefore have a low barrier to entry for potential buyers.",
      "Laurence Newman is the chief executive of CurrentBody, whose at-home LED mask is one of the world's best sellers.",
      "He started selling professional equipment to clinics more than 25 years ago and began developing an at-home LED mask in 2009, bringing out the company's first device just under 10 years later.",
      "\"We see that people use it for 10 minutes and get an instant glow afterwards,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Newman says that women in particular \"are moving towards totally non-invasive skincare\" and looking for ways to improve their skin without botox and fillers.",
      "Newman says the masks his company sells have been developed using the same technology as medical devices, which have a minimum requirement light wavelengths.",
      "He emphasises that the at-home LED mask market and indeed at-home beauty technology market are in their infancy, with \"a real movement of education\" growing.",
      "'This is a lot of money to spend'",
      "Dr Kentley concludes that \"PBM is mostly considered safe, even at high levels\" so using any form of LED technology is unlikely to \"cause damage to cells\", however more research into how exactly PBM works is needed to understand what it can do.",
      "\"There have been many experimental and clinical studies into the use of PBM for various dermatologic conditions, however they have varied in the parameters of the device and treatment protocols,\" he adds.",
      "\"Many of these studies were small and unstandardised and often paid for by the manufacturers so it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions\".",
      "He says if someone is keen to buy a device they should make sure they choose one that has EU safety certifications and a high density of LED bulbs on the mask to ensure enough energy is being delivered to the skin.",
      "Dr Kluk also says that she does not \"want to discourage anyone\" who is intrigued by the technology but wants \"them to understand that this is a lot of money to spend on a device, which could potentially support a good skincare routine, or if it's severe like acne, a good prescription regimen and some lifestyle measures - but it's unlikely to do enough on its own.\"",

      "A new part of the immune system has been discovered and it is a goldmine of potential antibiotics, scientists have said.",
      "They've shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals.",
      "The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection.",
      "And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs.",
      "The discovery centres on the proteasome \u2013 a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body.",
      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",
      "It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them.",
      "Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening.",
      "\"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection.",
      "\"It's happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics.\"",
      "The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics.",
      "They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.",
      "And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.",
      "Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection.",
      "\"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\"",
      "But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time.",
      "More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.",
      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.",
      "Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists.",
      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.",
      "\"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\"",
      "She also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the \"safety side of it might be a lot easier\"."

    "story": [
      "A common vaginal condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) may actually be a sexually transmitted infection (STI), according to researchers.",
      "The NHS currently says BV is caused by \"a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an STI\", even though it can be triggered by sex.",
      "However, a study claims BV - which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility, premature births and newborn deaths - is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an STI.",
      "The Australian trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found treating sexual partners, not just the patient, can be vital to clear the infection.",
      "What is BV?",
      "BV is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell.",
      "The colour and consistency may change too, such as becoming greyish-white as well as thin and watery.",
      "Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though.",
      "Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching.",
      "It can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams.",
      "In the trial of 164 couples with BV, the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating BV as an STI, with both sexual partners - rather than just the woman - given antibiotics.",
      "The doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that BV recurrence was halved using this approach.",
      "One of the lead researchers, Prof Catriona Bradshaw, said: \"Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI.",
      "\"Part of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still don't know precisely which bacteria are the cause, but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery,\" she added.",
      "In the study, run by Monash University and Alfred Health researchers at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week, while the control group of men were given no treatment.",
      "Given the findings, the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners.",
      "The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the findings provided \"valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected \u2013 that BV-associated bacteria may be sexually transmitted, particularly in those who experience recurrent infections\".",

    "story": [
      "The UK was once ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care - but that's not the case any longer. And according to experts, the problem runs far deeper than money",
      "The people closest to Terry Leader remember him as a man who was always laughing. He emigrated to the UK from the Caribbean island of St Kitts as a child, and was sporty, representing the junior Great Britain martial arts team in the 1970s.",
      "Later he became a father of three and worked as a metal spinner and enjoyed spending time with friends and family. Then in 2021, shortly after he retired, everything changed. Terry discovered he had terminal stomach cancer.",
      "His final wish was to die at home, surrounded by family. But despite being referred for specialist end-of-life care support, Terry and Gillian, his partner of 27 years, were left to navigate his final months largely alone.",
      "Apart from medication from Terry's GP and a couple of visits from district nurses, \"there was nothing\", says Gillian.",
      "\"I couldn't understand why \u2013 we kept asking but it was hard to get to the bottom of it. I really didn't know what to do and was doing my best to care for him.\"",
      "\"He was in agony at times \u2013 crying out in pain and crawling around. It was so difficult to watch and feel helpless.\"",
      "As the months passed, Terry deteriorated and was eventually taken to hospital. \"I slept on a Z-bed bed next to him, trying my best to look after him,\" says Gillian.",
      "He died just over two weeks later. He was 67.",
      "\"It was not how he wanted to spend his last days,\" she tells me today. \"I want to see changes so others do not have to go through what we did.\"",
      "The 'inadequate' state of care",
      "Terry and Gillian's story is far from unique \u2013 and this has become a factor as MPs debate a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek to end their own lives.",
      "Some opponents of changing the law have highlighted what they describe as the inadequate state of palliative care - the services that provide support at the end of life to manage pain and other symptoms.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who is against the bill, has warned that people nearing the end of their lives may feel \"coerced\" by a lack of better alternatives.",
      "Like Terry, the overwhelming majority of people say they would like to die at home,  Office for National Statistics figures suggest, but in reality just over a quarter do. Instead, the most common place of death is in hospital.",
      "It is estimated that at least three-quarters of the 650,000 people who die every year in the UK require palliative care. But a recent report by end-of-life charity Marie Curie suggested more than a fifth of those who need it in England and Wales do not receive any.",
      "And overall, half of families said they were unhappy about the care their loved ones receive in their final months.",
      "But this hasn't always been the case - until recently the picture was very different.",
      "'It's not just about money'",
      "As recently as 2015, the UK was ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care by the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Association for Palliative Medicine president Dr Sarah Cox says: \"That's not the case any longer. We're not getting the funding we need. But it is not just about money \u2013 it is the way services are organised.\"",
      "There are many reasons people end up dying in hospital when they would have preferred to have done so at home. Palliative care staff I have spoken say when people are in their final weeks some decide they need to go to hospital as they become frightened or do not want to be a burden on their loved ones, while in other cases families believe that being in hospital will help prolong their relative's life.",
      "But, ultimately, the lack of palliative care is thought to be the crucial factor in most cases, experts say. And so accident and emergency departments in hospitals become the safety net.",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it''Focus on palliative care not assisted dying''We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it'",
      "'Focus on palliative care not assisted dying'",
      "'We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "The Marie Curie report found around half of people in England and Wales end up going to A&E at least once in their final three months, and one in eight spend 30 days or more in hospital. And a hospital death is not always in the relative comfort of a bed on a ward.",
      "Hospital palliative care doctor Dr Rachel Clarke says she can spend whole days in A&E trying her best to care for patients dying in resuscitation areas and in corridors. \"It's a travesty people end their lives like that.\"",
      "Specialist palliative care is actually provided by a range of different organisations. \"People receive it from hospitals, from community NHS teams, from social care and from hospices,\" says Dr Cox.",
      "\"But families tell us that there is a lack of coordination between the different parts of the system. People struggle to get the help they need and end up in hospital.\"",
      "This is exactly what happened to Terry, who was rushed to hospital in an ambulance because of a fluid build-up related to his cancer two weeks before he died and never returned home. With better support at home, it is quite possible he would never have needed to be admitted.",
      "On top of the financial pressures felt by the rest of the NHS, experts say that a combination of demographic changes, different parts of the system acting in isolation and cash being spent in the wrong places have all brought the palliative care system to this point.",
      "And the problems are becoming more acute each year. For the 30 years up to 2011, the number of people dying in the UK was falling but that has changed as the people born during the boom in births following World War Two have grown old. Over the next decade, the number of deaths a year is expected to increase by 12%.",
      "The difficulties faced by hospices",
      "Where it works well, palliative care makes all the difference to those who use it. Hospices are a major provider of care, supporting 300,000 people a year - mainly in the community, not just inside their own buildings, contrary to popular belief.",
      "St Christopher's Hospice in south London is helping more than 1,700 people with terminal illnesses across five London boroughs. It receives referrals from GPs, district nursing teams and hospitals.",
      "Palliative care nurse Grace Larder says she provides many types of support to her patients, who have a range of conditions from motor neurone disease and Parkinson's to liver failure. This includes pain control and care for other physical problems, along with helping them with psychological and financial needs.",
      "\"We really develop relationships with people,\" she says. \"There's one patient I've been working with for nearly two years. You want to do your best.\"",
      "Most people she cares for tell her that they want to die at home, she says \u2013 but that's only possible if they get the right care.",
      "But many hospice services are in financial difficulties. Only around a third of St Christopher's funding comes from the NHS; the rest comes from fundraising and charitable donations.",
      "Any drugs the hospice provides has to come from their own funds too so they try to anticipate what their patients will need in advance and work with the patient's GP to have them prescribed on the NHS.",
      "A parliamentary report warned the current approach to funding is not sustainable.",
      "\"What other health service has to get by like that?\" says Helen King, who manages the team of nurses at St Christopher's. She points out that they are fortunate to have an affluent local community that donates generously.",
      "\"[But] the fact remains we get more money from our shops - from selling second-hand clothing - than we do from the government.\"",
      "Training is 'virtually non-existent'",
      "The government has recognised there is a problem and provided an extra \u00a3100m of funding this year to the sector \u2013 although hospice services have said this will mostly go on the rising costs they are facing.",
      "As for hospitals offering palliative care, audits show that four in 10 hospitals, for example, do not have specialist services available seven days a week - despite this having been set as a national standard in 2004.",
      "In practice, that means there is no specialist palliative care support from doctors or nurses available during evenings and weekends either in person or on-call, says Dr Clarke. \"You would never have that for other specialities like cardiology or renal so why should it happen for palliative care?\"",
      "The 'Time Lords' racing to tackle the threat of GPS jamming",
      "In the US, DEI is under attack. But under a different name, it might live on",
      "After White House clash, Starmer faces decision about who he can trust",
      "This is compounded by the fact that palliative care training is \"virtually non-existent\" for the other staff who pick up the burden, who often lack the confidence to speak to patients and families about dying and prescribe the right drugs, she says.",
      "\"We will come into work and find patients really suffering \u2013 in pain, breathless, agitated or with nausea and vomiting. It is hard to over-state how lamentably badly-resourced palliative care services are.\"",
      "Meanwhile, in the community, GPs are left to pick up the pieces. But Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders from the Royal College of General Practicioners says that, given an \"unrelenting workload\" and staffing shortages, it is difficult to provide the care patients need, particularly home visits.",
      "\"Families and unpaid carers bear the brunt,\" she says.",
      "Money would help - but it won't fix it",
      "So what is the solution? More money would help, but it wouldn't fix everything.",
      "Earlier this year the Health Economics Unit and Nuffield Trust think-tank found that plenty was being spent on people in the final year of their life. Nearly \u00a312bn was going on their healthcare, the report found \u2013 that works out at in excess of \u00a318,000 per person for everyone who dies.",
      "But the overwhelming majority of that \u00a312bn \u2013 85% - goes on hospitals and emergency care, rather than support in the community.",
      "It is, essentially, a false economy, as support in hospital tends to be more expensive.",
      "Dr Sam Royston, executive director of research at the charity, says these findings go a long way to explaining why \"too many people are dying in places where they don't want or need to be\".",
      "He adds: \"There must be a clear long-term ambition for all UK governments to shift health expenditure on people at the end of life from hospital to community.\"",
      "According to Dr Royston, just shifting 20% of the money spent caring for dying people in hospital would be transformative for community services as it would double current spending.",
      "Is better coordination the solution?",
      "What would a better system look like? First of all, more could be done to identify people's needs before they are admitted to hospital, Dr Royston believes.",
      "He points to a service in Bradford called React which works in emergency departments to identify and assess patients and diverting them towards teams in the community who can support them instead.",
      "A study found it reduced average unplanned bed days in patients' final year of life from 38 to 18.",
      "But to reduce the number of people going to hospital in the first place, there needs to be greater co-ordination of services too, given the complexity of support and variety of providers, says Dr Cox.",
      "She says there need to be electronic records that detail the wishes of people who are at the end of life that health and care staff can access: \"These electronic systems are available in some areas but not others,\" she says.",
      "She also argues providing a central hub or phone line to help people navigate and coordinate care would be transformational.",
      "She points to a system that has been set up in Cambridgeshire between a local hospice service, NHS 111 and the local ambulance service. It provides people at the end of their life with access to a specialist nurse 24 hours a day, simply by calling the NHS 111 advice line.",
      "\"A service like this can make a huge difference, providing equipment, responsive visits as well as telephone advice and signposting to other services,\" adds Dr Cox.",
      "And better training for non-specialist staff is also essential, Dr Cox and Dr Clarke agree.",
      "\"My utopia would be that you don't actually need lots of specialist palliative care services because everybody is so good at supporting patients at the end of life,\" adds Dr Clarke.",
      "\"If we were able to support people in the community properly, it would be better for them and would actually cost the NHS less.\"",
      "She adds: \"We need to prioritise this - you only die once.\"",

      "Charity wants testing of men at high risk of prostate cancer",
      "What are the symptoms of prostate cancer?",
      "I'm more grateful for each day - Sir Chris Hoy",
      "For someone with no medical experience, the kits can be difficult to use.",
      "A disposable lancet must pierce the skin, before drops of blood can be sucked into a pipette, mixed with a chemical and placed in the test cassette.",
      "Of the five kits analysed by the BBC, one did not produce a readable result; three came back all clear; but one did show a solid dark line, indicating a PSA level above 4.0 ug/l.",
      "A private blood test taken the same day and sent to a laboratory showed a much lower reading of 0.27 ug/l.",
      "\"As your experience shows, these rapid tests appear to have questionable accuracy,\" says Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK.",
      "\"That's a big problem because they can falsely reassure people who really do have elevated levels of PSA and should seek further testing, or they can cause undue worry among people who are absolutely fine.\"",
      "Online reviews appear to bear that out.",
      "In one, a customer posted that he was \"really scared\" after two rapid home tests indicated a high PSA level. A later NHS test showed his reading was normal.",
      "In another one-star review, a woman wrote that her husband took two home tests for \"peace of mind\" and both were negative. An NHS blood test then showed high levels of PSA and he was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer.",
      "The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, which represents the blood testing industry, says that while home tests are appropriate in many circumstances, \"this particular type of [PSA] test may not give an accurate indication of prostate health when taken outside the NHS\".",
      "Instead it says men concerned they may have cancer should see their GP.",
      "In the NHS, doctors often use PSA testing as part of a wider consultation about prostate health, bringing in other risk factors like age, ethnicity and family history.",
      "Dr Sam Merriel, a GP and prostate cancer researcher at the University of Manchester, says a full NHS laboratory test can give a far more detailed picture than a cheap home kit that is either positive or negative.",
      "\"The actual PSA reading is really important to understand because, as a GP, if I saw a PSA of 4.0 I'd be treating that very differently from a PSA of 400,\" he adds.",
      "\"You just don't get that level of information from a fast home test, so patients might not get the full picture.\"",
      "'Dangerously outdated'",
      "Prostate Cancer UK describes the growth of home testing as \"the symptom of a wider problem\".",
      "\"Too many men still don't realise they can access tests through a GP and the guidelines for doctors are dangerously outdated,\" says Amy Rylance from the charity.",
      "Sir Chris Hoy has been calling for the age to be lowered at which those at higher risk, such as black men or those with a family history, can ask their GP for PSA testing.",
      "The government says current guidelines should not stop doctors from offering a test under the age of 50, but critics say the rules are unclear and there are huge variations in diagnosis rates between GP surgeries.",
      "Prostate Cancer UK has also been calling for a change to allow medics to proactively talk to higher risk patients about the pros and cons of testing instead of waiting for them to come forward.",
      "A spokesman for the Department of Health says it has asked the UK National Screening Committee, which advises the NHS, to review the evidence on testing, with a response expected later this year.",
      "\"Prostate cancer patients are waiting too long for diagnosis and treatment but through our National Cancer Plan we will transform the way we treat cancer,\" he added."

    "summary": "\u201cKasibba\u201d, who is non-verbal and had no family to speak for her, was one of hundreds wrongly detained.",
    "story": [
      "An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned.",
      "The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years.",
      "Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention.",
      "More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness.",
      "The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol.",
      "But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10% reduction.",
      "However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. \"Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we haven't seen the progress that was promised,\" he told us.",
      "Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibba's incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her.",
      "\"I hadn't ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised,\" Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba \"was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day\".",
      "Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibba's identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held.",
      "It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a children's home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital.",
      "Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as \"dangerous\" and an \"eye-gouger\".",
      "She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to these accusations of violence. Decades earlier, when Kasibba was 19 and before she was placed in long-term segregation, a fire alarm had gone off and the locked ward was being evacuated.",
      "Kasibba was distressed and, in the confusion, she was approached by another patient. She scratched her, causing a cut to the other patient's eye.",
      "\"That was how the incident was talked about ever since, 'she's an eye gouger and she caused so much harm to this other person',\" said Dr Staite. But \"it just didn't ring true\", she said, that a middle-aged woman with a learning disability who had lived in the hospital for decades could be that dangerous.",
      "After months of work, Dr Staite submitted a 50-page report to Camden Council - the local authority in north London which had originally placed Kasibba in the hospital. Dr Staite said it had already been accepted that Kasibba did not have a mental illness and her report concluded she was not dangerous and was safe to live in the community.",
      "A team of health and social care professionals was then set up in 2016, calling themselves \"the escape committee\". Their mission was to free Kasibba.",
      "Lucy Dunstan, from disability rights organisation Changing Our Lives, was appointed to be Kasibba's independent advocate and to build a compelling case for why it was safe for her to leave the hospital.",
      "But Kasibba's release could only be signed off by the Court of Protection, which makes decisions for people who do not have the mental capacity to make their own.",
      "Ms Dunstan said when she first met Kasibba, hospital staff simply introduced her as \"the eye-gouger\".",
      "She said she recalls looking at Kasibba through a small window in the door that kept her locked in. \"She was just lying on the the settee. It was a very empty room. Her life was completely impoverished,\" she said.",
      "It would be six years from first having met Kasibba before Ms Dunstan got a call to tell her that the Court of Protection had ruled she could leave hospital. \"I cried. Joy. Relief. Admiration for her. Pride,\" she said. \"It's not about me and what we did, but that she did it and she showed them.\"",
      "Now Kasibba lives in the community with the help of support workers, who engage with her and communicate with gentle touches, gestures and clear language. Her care manager said she loved fashion, was proud of her home and enjoyed social interaction.",
      "\"She has the most amazing sense of humour. She's a beautiful human being,\" the manager said. \"After about two weeks of working here she actually came up and gave me a hug. This is not an eye-gouger, you know.\"",
      "The Mental Health Bill going through parliament will mean autistic people and those with learning disabilities in England and Wales, who do not have a mental health condition, will no longer be able to be detained for treatment.",
      "But the government has said it will not bring in any changes until it is satisfied there is sufficient alternative support in the community. And it will still allow people to be detained in hospital legally for up to 28 days for assessment.",
      "Jess McGregor, executive director of adults and health at Camden Council, said it was a \"tragedy\" that Kasibba had spent most of her life held in hospital. \"I'm personally sorry,\" she said. \"She shouldn't have experienced what she did.\"",
      "The NHS mental health trust, which cannot be named to protect Kasibba's identity, said at no point had the care it delivered been brought into question and the service was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The trust told File on 4 Investigates that anyone assessed as needing long-term segregation had a self-contained property with their own bedroom, bathroom, living room and garden.",
      "The trust said from 2010 it had been working with local authorities to put plans in place to support the discharge of all long-term residents to more appropriate care, where possible within the community, but said they were prevented from doing so by a legal case brought by the families of other patients.",
      "It said its staff had then worked tirelessly for years supporting local authorities to put the necessary support in place in the community and they were able to successfully close the service in 2023."

    "story": [
      "More than half of all adults and a third of children, teenagers and young adults around the world are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050.",
      "The findings come in a new study of global data published in The Lancet journal, covering more than 200 countries.",
      "Researchers warn that obesity levels are predicted to accelerate rapidly during the remainder of this decade, particularly in lower-income countries.",
      "However, experts say that if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what they describe as a \"profound tragedy\".",
      "By 2021, almost half the global adult population  - a billion men and 1.11 billion women aged 25 or older - were overweight or obese.",
      "The proportion of both men and women living with these conditions has doubled since 1990.",
      "If trends continue, global rates of overweight and obese adults would rise to about 57.4% for men and 60.3% for women by 2050.",
      "In terms of raw numbers, China (627 million), India (450 million) and the USA (214 million) will be the countries with the biggest populations of overweight or obese people in 2050.",
      "However, population growth means that forecasters are predicting the number in sub-Saharan Africa will rise by more than 250% to 522 million.",
      "Nigeria, in particular, stands out, with the predicted number projected to more than triple - from 36.6 million in 2021 to 141 million in 2050. That would make it the country with the fourth-largest population of adults who are overweight or obese.",
      "The authors acknowledge the study does not take into account the impact that new weight loss medications might have - and they could play a significant role in the future.",
      "Experts say if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what could be a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems.",
      "The research was led by Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), at the University of Washington in the US.",
      "She said: \"[Governments] can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies.",
      "\"The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure,\" she added.",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "A surge in rates of obesity is happening right now, particularly among young people.",
      "Rates of obesity in children and younger teenagers (from 8.8% to 18.1%) and younger adults (those under 25 - from 9.9% to 20.3%) more than doubled between 1990 and 2021.",
      "However, by 2050 one in three young people will be affected.",

      "\"We have also identified large populations, particularly adolescent girls, in North America, Australasia, Oceania, North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America that are expected to tip over to obesity predominance and require urgent, multifaceted intervention and treatment.",

      "Corby's steel and iron industry expanded rapidly in the 1930s with the construction of Stewarts and Lloyds steelworks.",
      "By the 1970s, half the town worked in the mills, but when the steelworks closed in the 1980s, toxic waste from the demolition process was mishandled, leading to widespread contamination.",

      "Introducing... The Toxic Waste Scandal",
      "Hosted by George Taylor, 32, who was born with an upper limb defect linked to the case, the podcast features testimony and interviews with those directly impacted.",
      "Here are some of the key voices behind the story.",
      "'The first person you are going to blame is yourself'",
      "George Angus Taylor was born on 11 March 1992 to parents Fiona and Brian, in Corby.",
      "Brian had worked at Stewart and Lloyds, a job that left him covered in dust and debris at the end of each shift.",
      "Fiona, a former Boots No7 beauty consultant, vividly remembers George's birth, an event that would change their lives forever.",
      "Born \"navy blue\" as a result of pre-foetal circulation issues, he was immediately ventilated and placed in intensive care.",
      "It was then Fiona noticed something unusual.",
      "\"I remember just seeing his little hand; his pinkie ring finger and middle finger,\" she says.",
      "\"It was like a fist; you know how babies make a fist? Then his index finger; his thumb was sticking out.",
      "\"I just kept thinking, 'He's here because of me,' and you just look for blame. You look, and the first person you are going to blame is yourself.\"",
      "At 14, doctors discovered a tumour in George's hand so large that amputation became a real possibility.",
      "The surgery, experimental at the time, was gruelling. \"When I woke up, I was so full of morphine,\" he remembers.",
      "\"They said it was like climbing Everest with no practice \u2013 my body just shut down.\"",
      "The experience, particularly the smell, left lasting memories. \"They burn flesh as they [operate]: very quiet sizzling, like sausages in a pan. And that's the smell that still comes to you from time to time.\"",
      "Despite everything, George was determined to move forward. \"The first time I saw my hand, I wasn't shocked. I wasn't sad. It was better than before.\"",
      "But George was not alone. Other children in Corby were born with similar conditions.",
      "'Did I do this?'",
      "Lisa Atkinson was a security guard at the Corby steel mills, where her duties involved outside patrols, checking parking permits, and often having to move dust that had settled over everything.",
      "On 27 June 1989, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, at Kettering General Hospital.",
      "Simone was born with three fingers on each hand.",
      "Doctors reassured Lisa, saying the only thing she would not be able to do was play the piano.",
      "Just as Fiona Taylor did with George, Lisa initially questioned whether she was responsible for her daughter's condition.",
      "\"There was probably part of me that sat there and went, 'What did I do? Did I do this?'\" she says.",
      "\"Because I've had a couple of miscarriages before Simone... I always thought maybe I was lucky; maybe I was given Simone... but she wasn't quite perfect. But I was lucky to have had that baby and not the two previous ones.\"",
      "Despite her initial self-doubt, Lisa \"knew\" she had done nothing wrong, as she had neither drunk nor smoked during pregnancy.",
      "She recalls the lack of follow-up care or investigation into her daughter's condition.",
      "\"You're let out into the world with a child that's a little bit different,\" she says.",
      "\"But there was nowhere to go. There was no follow-up or anything, no 'We're going to look into it.' So you just deal with it. And you did, because you had to.\"",
      "Lisa quickly adjusted to life with Simone's condition, saying: \"It shocked other people more than it shocked me. I got used to it really, really quickly.\"",
      "Winning the subsequent legal case against the borough council brought with it overwhelming attention.",
      "\"I'm not famous, but I feel like that's how famous people must feel... It was crazy.\"",
      "Growing up, Simone, now 35, faced relentless bullying.",
      "\"I had a great family and friends... but [school] was hard. I wasn't a very confident child, and I was an easy target,\" she remembers.",
      "Simone coped by using humour. She would joke that her mum had chopped off her fingers or that she was part alien, turning her differences into something entertaining.",
      "\"It was a bit of a front, because if I make a joke about myself, nobody else can. Just accept that's who you are; it's not going to change.\"",
      "At 18, she was offered surgery to reshape her hands, but declined.",
      "\"They admitted they didn't really know if it would help. By then, I'd adapted. I live with daily pain, but I didn't want to risk making things worse.\"",
      "Meeting her now-husband, she initially hid her hands, subtly positioning herself to avoid detection.",
      "Eventually, she told him - through a long message and sending him a link to the 2020 Horizon documentary about the case.",
      "His response? \"It's really not a big deal.\"",
      "Today, she is grateful for the legal battle her family fought. \"It set me up for life,\" she says.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyd49dxyxxo",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Mar 2025 18:00:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Households near new pylons are set to get up to \u00a3250 a year off their energy bills, under government plans.",
    "story": [
      "The cost of reducing energy bills for people who live near pylons will be paid for by increasing average annual bills across the country by 80p, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has told the BBC.",
      "Under the government's plans, households in Great Britain within 500m of new or upgraded pylons will get discounts of up to \u00a32,500 over 10 years, equivalent to \u00a3250 a year.",
      "Miliband said the costs of the scheme were \"more than offset\" by the benefits of the new infrastructure.",
      "He added that the idea was not about buying people off but \"recognising the service\" they were doing for the whole country.",
      "However, rural campaign groups said it was \"impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape\".",
      "A government-commissioned report found hundreds of miles of new pylons will be needed to meet its clean energy targets.",
      "But new infrastructure proposals have sparked fierce opposition from residents in parts of the country like Norfolk and Suffolk, with campaigners arguing they will destroy the countryside.",
      "The bill discounts, which will be funded by electricity suppliers, are expected to be in place from 2026.",
      "Suppliers are expected to recoup costs by passing them on to other customers.",
      "Miliband told the BBC: \"At the moment, we're having to switch off offshore wind farms because we haven't got the transmission infrastructure.",
      "\"So everybody benefits from this. Everybody gets lower bills, and those who live near pylons are given a recognition of what they're doing.\"",
      "The idea forms part of the government's Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which is due to be published this week.",
      "The legislation aims to speed up the building of new homes and infrastructure by cutting red tape and simplifying the planning process.",
      "The government has put the changes at the heart of its push for economic growth.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said local people would still be \"part of the process\", but it would be \"streamlined\" so development was not \"continually blocked for years and years\".",
      "Battle lines drawn over 'monstrous' pylons and solar farm 'wastelands'",
      "Why more pylons could be headed your way",
      "Can electricity pylons ever be beautiful?",
      "Alongside money off bills, the government will publish new guidance on how developers should provide benefits to communities hosting transmission infrastructure, by funding projects like sports clubs, educational programmes or leisure facilities.",
      "The government said this would mean communities could get \u00a3200,000 worth of funding per km of overhead electricity cable in their area, and \u00a3530,000 per substation.",
      "Initial analysis estimates both bill discounts and community funds could see a total additional cost of between \u00a31-2 a year for the average customer over 10 years.",
      "The government is also looking at how communities near onshore wind farms and other energy infrastructure can receive benefits.",
      "The plans were welcomed by RenewableUK, which represents the sector.",
      "The group's head of policy, James Robottom, said bill discounts would \"help to enable the roll-out of much-needed new grid infrastructure at a faster pace, so that we can make the most of the vast amounts of clean power we're producing\".",
      "However, Jackie Copley, campaign lead at CPRE, the countryside charity, said: \"Investing in local green spaces or improving community infrastructure would be a better way to spend this money.",
      "\"Paying individuals comes with many problems, including questions of fairness, likely legal challenges, and the fact that it's impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape.\"",
      "The idea of giving people living near new pylons money off their energy bills was also proposed under the previous Conservative government.",
      "A government survey in 2024 suggested 78% of people would find an energy infrastructure project more acceptable if they were offered discounts on their bills.",
      "Some energy companies already offer bill discounts to customers who live near infrastructure like wind turbines, while grants are also available for local communities affected.",
      "The bill also includes measures that would allow \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served\" process.",
      "The government says the existing system is being \"clogged up\" by speculative projects creating 10 year waits for \"viable infrastructure\".",
      "Meanwhile, the government has announced the number of bodies which get a say in planning decisions could be cut.",
      "Officials will consult on removing Sport England, the Theatres Trust and the Garden History Society from the list of \"statutory consultees\", who are legally required to provide advice on decisions.",
      "The government said in some cases organisations were slowing down building, giving the example of a housing development in Bradford which was delayed because the application was thought to have not adequately considered the speed of cricket balls from a nearby club.",

    "story": [
      "A senior lawyer who was appointed by Reform UK to independently investigate allegations against MP Rupert Lowe and his team has denied she told the MP she was \"shocked\" about the process.",
      "The Great Yarmouth MP was suspended by Reform and referred to the police over accusations he made threats of violence against the party's chairman. The Metropolitan Police has confirmed they are assessing an allegation of \"verbal threats\".",
      "There have also been allegations of bullying in Lowe's offices, which are being investigated by the lawyer hired by the party.",
      "Lowe strongly denies all the claims, saying \"there is no credible evidence against me\", and says he is the victim of \"a political assassination because I dared to question Nigel Farage\".",
      "Farage defends suspending MP and criticises 'infighting'",
      "Reform UK refers MP Rupert Lowe to police",
      "Farage hits back at Reform MP's leadership criticism",
      "Last week, Lowe said he had spoken to the senior lawyer looking at the claims and said she had told him she was \"shocked\" at the process, and that no evidence had been given.",
      "On Sunday, the lawyer, a KC who has not been named by the party but whose credentials have been verified by the BBC, said: \"I have seen a number of statements made by Mr Lowe MP which are attributed to me and which describe my reactions to the process conducted by the party into the allegations made against both Mr Lowe MP and his constituency manager.",
      "\"I find myself in the unfortunate and regrettable position of having to make this statement to correct the record.\"",
      "The lawyer added: \"I have not expressed either 'dismay' or 'shock' at any time as to the process. Nor have I said 'there is zero credible evidence against [Mr Lowe]', let alone said this 'repeatedly'.\"",
      "'No credible evidence against me'",
      "On Friday, Lowe took issue with a statement issued by Reform, which set out that there would be an independent investigation into what had happened.",
      "He wrote: \"I have just spoken to the KC. She is dismayed that this statement has been made, and reiterated that no evidence against me has been sent to her.",
      "\"She stated that this has been issued before the investigation has even started.",
      "\"She is shocked at the process, shocked at the communication from the party, and shocked that no credible evidence has been given, despite her repeated requests.\"",
      "The BBC put the lawyer's statement to Lowe, who then issued his own statement in reply.",
      "\"Ever since this malicious attack on my reputation was launched, all I have asked for from both Reform and the KC is credible evidence against me. None has been provided. It still hasn't,\" he said.",
      "\"The KC has said she has been 'chasing' for that. I have received nothing. Because there is no credible evidence against me.\"",
      "He added: \"I have spoken with the KC at length, on the phone and through message. I've got to know her over the last week, and she has been very helpful, and is a charming lady who is trying to do her job in the very difficult position that Reform has put her in.\"",
      "'You have to stand up to bullies'",
      "He accused the party of an \"outright lie\" in claiming he had not co-operated with the investigation, a claim Reform made in a statement on Friday evening.",
      "\"I have been in discussions with my legal team this afternoon, and this will be followed by legal action in due course,\" Lowe told the BBC.",
      "\"I will not have my name dragged through the mud as part of a political assassination because I dared to question Nigel Farage. You have to stand up to bullies, and I am doing exactly that.\"",
      "He said the lawyer had told him on Friday night: \"I advised that you should simply say that the party was precipitous to state that these allegations had been made without also saying that the party has commissioned an independent investigation and the investigation has not yet got underway to look at all the evidence and evaluate its veracity.\"",
      "Lowe's suspension came after the Daily Mail published an interview with Lowe where he said Reform under Nigel Farage's leadership remained a \"protest party led by the Messiah\".",
      "Reform has removed the whip from Lowe, meaning he now sits as an independent MP.",
      "Reform spokeswoman Ann Widdecombe said the row was \"temporarily damaging\" to the party - but \"not damaging in the long term\".",
      "Widdecombe told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: \"The fact is all parties have these eruptions from time to time.",
      "\"But while the investigations are under way I think we should simply wait until they report, and then we will know where we are.\"",

      "This morning Sir Keir sought to make his arguments to civil servants directly, in an email sent to half a million officials.",
      "In the letter, the prime minister wrote that he wanted a \"more agile, mission-focused and more productive\" Civil Service.",
      "He continued: \"The Civil Service must once again become the engine room of delivery for every person in every part of the UK.",
      "\"Each one of you must be enabled to re-focus on your core purpose, away from the things that hamper your day to day work, delivering excellent, high-performing public services that improve people's lives.",

      "\"We are determined to empower you \u2013 not through words, but action \u2013 to maximise the collective power of the state.\"",
      "Crucially, the letter was also signed by Sir Chris Wormald, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service.",
      "In what may have been an attempt to reassure civil servants of his support for their work, the prime minister praised the \"talent, commitment and ideas\" of officials, adding: \"We are proud of what you do and thank you for your continued dedication.\"",

      "Higher number of digital and data apprenticeships",
      "The proposals will also see one in 10 civil servants employed in a digital or data role within five years, to be delivered through apprenticeships and retraining staff.",

      "But multiple sources said there have been no meetings between any Labour ministers and members of the foundation set up to oversee the funds since the general election last year.",
      "Sources close to the foundation said there was a deadlock and a political decision by a minister is needed to negotiate and sign off an agreement that can break the impasse.",
      "One source said: \"For three years, the government has been saying it's been working very hard to release the money. But they are not having meetings with the foundation. There has been no meeting with a minister since Labour took over, for example.\"",
      "The BBC understands the FCDO has acknowledged a request for a meeting between the foundation's board and Foreign Secretary David Lammy.",
      "Abramovich's representatives did not wish to comment, but those with knowledge of the situation acknowledged little contact or progress had been made on releasing the funds under the four prime ministers to have held power since the sale of the club.",
      "The issue has taken on new urgency after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced that part of the UK's overseas aid budget was being diverted to defence. In 2024/25, the UK is sending \u00a3282m in aid to Ukraine.",
      "The \u00a32.5bn - and the interest accrued on the funds - would make up for some of the money taken from the aid budget, which was \u00a315.3bn in 2023.",
      "Alison Griffin, of charity Save the Children, said: \"This money has been sitting gathering dust - and interest - when it could and should have been spent helping the children of Ukraine cope with the horrors of a full-scale war that has lasted over three years.\"",
      "The delay in releasing the funds centres on a disagreement between the UK government and Abramovich's lawyers.",
      "Abramovich was granted a special licence to sell Chelsea, providing he could prove he would not benefit from the sale.",
      "At the time, Abramovich said proceeds from the sale would be donated via a foundation \"for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine\", and his position has not changed.",
      "Abramovich - a Russian billionaire who made his fortune in oil and gas - cannot access the \u00a32.5bn under UK sanctions but the money still legally belongs to him.",
      "He is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, something he has denied.",
      "Sources said Abramovich's lawyers have insisted on using the money for all victims of the war in Ukraine including those outside the country, but the UK government has pushed back and argued the funds should only be spent on humanitarian efforts inside the war-torn country.",
      "Portugal has also had a say in the matter because Abramovich has Portuguese citizenship and has been sanctioned by the EU.",
      "Elusive resolution",
      "The Portuguese authorities issued an exemption to the EU sanctions to allow the Chelsea funds to be used for \"exclusively for humanitarian purposes in Ukraine\".",
      "\"The EU and the UK have worked closely together to ensure that the proceeds of this sale be used for humanitarian purposes in Ukraine, via a charitable organisation, in line with the conditions laid out in the derogation,\" said Olof Gill, a Commission spokesperson for financial services.",
      "\"The conditions under which the sale was authorised by the Portuguese authorities and which was accepted by the UK authorities must be respected and cannot be changed retroactively.",
      "\"The humanitarian needs in Ukraine remain extremely high.\"",
      "Members of the foundation, which is headed by Mike Penrose, the former boss of Unicef UK and Norwegian diplomat Jan Egeland, met former Foreign Secretary David Cameron and his deputy Andrew Mitchell in the spring last year.",
      "Those with knowledge of the situation said the outcome of the meeting left a positive impression that the stalemate could be ended by allowing some of the funds to be used on humanitarian causes outside Ukraine.",
      "The BBC understands the former foreign secretary believed a workable solution was in progress and a statement of intent about how the funds would be used was being drawn up by the foundation.",
      "Lord Cameron had spoken to the European Commission about the proposal and had sought buy-in from Downing Street to sign off the agreement.",
      "But there was no resolution to the dispute before last year's general election and there have been no meetings with any ministers since Labour took office.",
      "'Working hard'",
      "The foundation has a plan ready to roll out immediately once the funds have been unlocked.",
      "There have been talks about programmes to help orphans of Ukrainian soldiers and cover health, housing and education needs for those fleeing the war.",

      "This week, The Guardian reported ministers were preparing to take Abramovich to court to free up the money.",
      "Meanwhile, western countries are using the interest on frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine and there is talk of seizing them.",

      "\"The proceeds are currently frozen in a UK bank account while a new independent foundation is established to manage and distribute the money.",

    "story": [
      "More than 100 Labour MPs and peers have urged banks and investment firms to relax their rules on investing in defence companies.",
      "In an open letter, first reported by the Financial Times, they said \"ill considered\" ethical investment rules had been holding back their access to finance.",
      "They wrote that a change in approach would help the UK bolster its defences, and contribute to the government's drive to boost economic growth.",
      "It also reflects a trend in recent years to emphasise the national security element of defence investment since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Defence firms 'need reassuring' that big orders will be long-term",
      "Starmer cuts aid to fund increase in defence spending",
      "Leading weapons companies have seen sales and their share price surge in recent years, as countries seek to rearm after years of declining defence spending.",
      "The UK is among those countries committing to ramp up spending, with Sir Keir Starmer announcing plans last week to increase defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027, funded by cuts to overseas aid.",
      "However in their letter, the politicians argued that environmental, social and governance (ESG) rules adopted by some banks and fund managers are continuing to impact the sector's access to finance.",
      "They said ESG rules, which can prevent investment in oil, tobacco and other sectors deemed unethical, had generally driven \"positive change\" in the economy.",
      "But they added that financial institutions should \"rethink ESG mechanisms that often wrongly exclude all defence investment\".",
      "The letter was co-ordinated by the Labour Growth Group, a group of MPs formed last year in part to push the government to deliver major infrastructure projects.",
      "'Way of life'",
      "Some investment funds have adopted specific rules against investing in weapons manufacturers and others have broader rules obliging them to consider the risk that investment could lead to human rights breaches.",
      "But some analysts have pointed out that attitudes on the ethics of investing in the sector appear to have shifted in recent years, with the share of ESG funds holding shares in defence and aerospace firms on the up compared to 2022.",
      "The previous Conservative government had also sought to encourage defence investment, with former prime minister Rishi Sunak arguing there is \"nothing more ethical than defending our way of life\".",
      "The Investment Association, the trade body for UK investment managers, signed a statement last year stating that investment in \"good, high-quality, well-run defence companies\" was compatible with ESG considerations.",
      "Banking rules",
      "In their letter, the MPs and peers also argued that defence firms faced \"unnecessary barriers to doing business in the UK,\" echoing longstanding complaints from the sector about access to finance.",
      "ADS, the industry lobby group, has previously argued that defence firms face higher regulatory barriers when it comes to securing bank accounts and loans.",
      "These include rules obliging banks to run enhanced money laundering checks for defence and security companies, and to make sure they are not financing weapons banned under international treaties.",
      "The group has also said defence companies can often find it harder to provide relevant documents to banks because of national security considerations.",
      "Finance UK, a group representing British banks, acknowledged that compliance rules could prove \"complex\" but said banks provided a \"significant range of support\" to defence companies.",
      "David Raw, the group's managing director for commercial finance, added: \"We are continuing to engage with government and the defence sector to tackle any barriers that do arise.",
      "\"We do not see a tension between supporting ESG goals and supporting the defence sector.\"",
      "The UK-based Campaign Against the Arms Trade said it opposed any change to ESG rules on defence firms, adding it would benefit firms that \"make vast profits from death and destruction across the world\"."

    "story": [
      "A national policing unit has been criticised for telling local forces to block the release of information under laws designed to safeguard the public's right to know.",
      "The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has advised forces not to reveal information on topics including the use of banned surveillance software and the spread of super-strength drugs, the BBC has found.",
      "Campaign group Big Brother Watch said the NPCC team \u2013 known as the central referral unit (CRU) \u2013 was acting like an \"authoritarian censor\" rather than a public body.",
      "The CRU said it acted in line with legislation and only recommended how local forces should respond to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.",
      "The BBC was alerted to the unit's involvement in local forces' FOI responses while researching the spread of potent synthetic opioids.",
      "Sixteen forces - more than a third of the UK's total number - had given us details about crimes linked with the drugs, but then retracted their responses at the unit's request.",
      "The unit argued the information would undermine national security as it could be exploited by drug traffickers.",
      "Our subsequent investigation found the CRU had advised local forces on 1,706 occasions in the first three months of 2024 - equivalent to one in every 11 requests submitted to forces in that time.",
      "On another occasion, it cited concerns about \"negative press\" when advising forces to retract earlier responses and instead neither confirm nor deny if their officers had used the facial recognition search engine PimEyes, according to documents obtained by Liberty Investigates.",
      "The software has been banned by Scotland Yard.",
      "Jake Hurfurt, the head of research and investigations at Big Brother Watch, said pressurising police forces to retract data was \"the practice of an authoritarian censor not an accountable public body\".",
      "\"It is alarming that the NPCC is going beyond giving advice to individual forces and instead seemingly orchestrating how every force responds to sensitive transparency requests,\" he said.",
      "The CRU said it was legitimately discussing \"negative press\" or \"media attention\" when researching what information was already published, but those factors did not influence whether it favoured disclosure.",
      "It also said it had had a smaller volume of work in each year since 2020.",
      "What is Freedom of Information?",
      "FOI laws came into force in the UK in January 2005 and allow anyone to apply to government or public bodies to see information, such as crime statistics or details on expenditure.",
      "Using those laws, citizens can ask for information from people in power - sometimes including details they might prefer had stayed a secret.",
      "The Freedom of Information Act presumes each request should lead to information being disclosed, unless a legal exemption applies.",
      "Our investigation revealed the CRU did not follow the so-called \"applicant-blind principle\" when responding to FOI requests.",
      "The principle states everyone should get the same level and quality of response, regardless of whether it is their first request or they use the act regularly in their work.",
      "The CRU, however, recorded whether requesters were members of the media and their organisation.",
      "It said it was not subject to the applicant-blind principle because it was only an advisor, but would stop the practice from March 2025.",
      "It also said it could not share records of when it had conducted public interest tests or if and when it had favoured the disclosure of information that was in the spirit of FOI laws.",
      "Akiko Hart, director of human rights advocacy group Liberty, said: \"It's incredibly concerning that police have continually tried to downplay, hide and rescind information that is in the public interest.",
      "\"At a time when public trust in police is at an all-time low, transparency in their actions has never been more important. The police have a statutory duty to provide information held by them when requested by the public and journalists, and must not try to circumvent this.\"",
      "In 2022, an independent review was conducted into a separate government unit that advised other departments on their FOI responses. The review found poor practice and recommended the unit's replacement.",
      "The so-called Clearing House was part of the Cabinet Office. It was alleged to have profiled journalists and treated their FOI requests inappropriately.",
      "The review rejected its approach of circulating the names of requesters who had asked the same questions of several departments \u2013 a so-called round robin requester \u2013 to help it coordinate similar responses.",
      "The government's response was to say it would pilot a new system \"immediately\", but the BBC found the NPCC's CRU still matched names to round robin requests 18 months after the Clearing House recommendations were published.",
      "Claire Miller, former data journalism editor and an expert in FOI, said further investigation was needed as the CRU did not seem to be \"operating within the spirit of the FOI Act.\"",
      "\"It does not seem to have taken on board the criticisms of and recommendations for the Clearing House, which perhaps it should have done,\" she said.",
      "The NPCC declined to give an interview but instead issued a statement.",
      "Chief Constable Rob Carden, its digital, data and technology lead, said: \"Policing is firmly committed to being open and transparent. Compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is one important way we remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"We always strive to share as much as we can in our responses with a presumption to disclose.  However, there are circumstances where information cannot be disclosed and needs to be redacted, and on occasions withheld, to ensure police can continue to use tactics to protect the public or to prevent sensitive information being exploited by criminals to cause harm.  These instances are strictly sanctioned with clear parameters, as set out in legislation.\"",
      "He said complaints about how forces applied the FOI Act could be referred to the Information Commisioner's Office (ICO).",
      "A spokeperson for the ICO said the data watchdog had used its powers \"proactively numerous times\" in the last two years to ensure police forces were compliant.",
      "They said: \"We will continue to take action when necessary, including keeping under review whether any central co-ordination in this sector is having a negative impact on compliance with the law when we examine the complaints that come to us.\"",
      "Author Martin Rosenbaum, a former FOI lead for the BBC, said the performance of police forces when it came to handling FOI requests had \"seriously deteriorated\".",
      "\"The ICO has taken enforcement action against 15 police forces because of their FOI failings, which is more than one in three forces nationally, and is the worst record of any part of the public sector,\" he said.",
      "Surrey and South Yorkshire police were among the forces issued with enforcement notices in 2024 for failing to answer requests within the 20 days set out by law.",

      "The pastry can be produced in the town of Melton Mowbray and its surrounding region, including Nottingham to the north and Northampton to the south, but The Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association (MMPPA) applied for this area to be reduced.",

      "The pie's status is called Protected Geographical Indication (PGI).",
      "Matthew O'Callaghan, chairman of the MMPPA, said when the group originally applied for the protection - awarded in 2008 - they \"had historical evidence as to where the boundaries should go\".",
      "He said: \"In the south, the boundary was originally the road between Leicester and Stamford.\"",
      "But Defra suggested it be extended because a company in Wellingborough, which had been making the pork pies for decades, objected as it would have been outside the area, Mr O'Callaghan said.",
      "Mr O'Callaghan added: \"We agreed the area would be almost doubled so as to go down to the south to include this producer in Wellingborough.\"",
      "However, he said the producer - Saxby's - had closed and no pork pies had been made in that area for at least 10 years.",
      "Mr O'Callaghan said the association therefore thought it was reasonable to ask Defra to amend the region to the original proposal.",
      "\"It would not have affected anybody currently producing Melton Mowbray pork pies,\" he added.",
      "He said the association was \"disappointed\" the application was rejected \"because we think what people want when they buy a Melton Mowbray pork pie is a pie tied to a historic area\".",
      "Explaining the area they wanted the protection reduced to, he said it was between \"the Leicester to Stamford road - the A47 [to the south], the Great North Road the A1 [to the east], the River Trent in the north, including Nottingham, and then to the west, the River Soar\".",
      "Defra's notice rejecting the application said: \"The proposed amendment would reduce the geographical production area and exclude certain producers from using the PGI designation.",
      "\"This would directly affect market access and impose new trade restrictions, which is not permitted under the regulation.\"",
      "It added: \"The applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to show that the quality, reputation, or characteristics of the product are now exclusive to the proposed smaller area.\"",

    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will give more detail about the government's plans for the economy.",
    "story": [
      "The chancellor will give an update on her plans for the UK economy when she gives a statement alongside an economic forecast on 26 March.",
      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are made on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029/30 financial year, has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts.",
      "It is understood welfare spending is in the firing line, but other government departments will also see budgets pruned.",
      "The government already had concerns about the rising number of benefit claimants and Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system.",
      "The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty over the outcome of conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East, for raising government borrowing costs.",
      "Possible other announcements that are being reported include:",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares",
      "Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish - not shrinking, but not growing as desired.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, according to the latest official figures.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked \"several billion pounds\" in draft spending cuts to welfare ahead of her Spring Statement, according to the BBC.",
      "When asked about the welfare budget, the Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood said: \"Our current situation is unsustainable\u2026 we've seen a huge rise in that welfare budget.\"",
      "BBC Verify has examined this budget and where the cuts might fall.",
      "How big is the welfare budget?",
      "Before looking at where the welfare budget might be cut, it is necessary to understand the size of the budget and how it has grown.",
      "At the time of the October 2024 Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that total spending on health and disability benefits would rise from \u00a364.7bn in 2023-24 to \u00a3100.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "And the OBR projected that the biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, defined as those aged between 16 and 64.",
      "The OBR projected spending on this sector would rise from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "Why is the welfare bill growing?",
      "The OBR cited rising numbers of people coming on to incapacity and disability benefits as driving its latest forecasts.",
      "The forecaster is essentially assuming the trend of rising benefits claims in recent years will continue.",
      "In the five years after 2009-2010, more people were coming off incapacity benefits than on.",
      "But in recent years - and especially since the 2020-21 Covid pandemic - more people have been coming on to benefits than off them.",
      "And the OBR forecast the share of the working-age population in receipt of an incapacity benefit would rise from 7% in 2024 to a record high of 7.9% in 2029.",
      "The reasons for this are not totally clear.",
      "Some experts point to the damaging and lasting impact of the pandemic on physical health.",
      "Others reference the rise in mental ill health, especially among younger people.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that the number of people aged 18 to 24 who are not in education, employment or training (Neet) rose to 907,000 at the end of last year, a 30% increase on the level before the pandemic in 2020 (although the ONS also cautioned the survey used to collect the data was potentially unreliable).",
      "Other experts place the emphasis on financial incentives in the welfare system - where people can get higher payments for being on sickness benefits than from being unemployed or in low-paid, part-time work.",
      "The standard allowance for a single person on Universal Credit is \u00a3311.68 per month. If someone is deemed to have \"limited capacity for work-related activity\", the criteria to receive incapacity benefits, they are eligible for an extra \u00a3416.19 per month on top.",
      "But there is no consensus on what's causing the trend.",
      "\"It is not yet known what factors are driving this increase,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "\"Figuring out what is behind the recent rise must surely be a top priority for the government if it is going to be able to respond appropriately.\"",
      "Which elements of the welfare bill might be cut?",
      "Ministers have not said where they will seek cuts, but the largest element of the working-age welfare bill is incapacity or long-term sickness benefits - paid via Universal Credit or the legacy system of Employment and Support Allowance.",
      "If the government wants to make significant savings from the working-age welfare bill it will probably need to find some savings here.",
      "But the second largest single element of the working-age welfare bill is Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - a benefit for people under state pension age who need help with daily activities because of a long-term illness or disability. PIP claimants can be in work.",
      "In 2023-24, PIP totalled \u00a318bn and that's projected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30. That would mean the number of claimants rising from 2.7 million to 4.2 million.",
      "As with the rise in the overall welfare bill, there's no consensus among experts on what's driving rising PIP claims, but this is also somewhere the government might well look to make some savings.",
      "The previous Conservative government had explored making it harder for younger people with mental health conditions to claim PIP.",
      "Can significant savings be made?",
      "Many experts, such as the Resolution Foundation think tank and the Institute for Employment Studies, agree that more working-age people should be helped and encouraged into work, and that there is a case for reform of the working-age welfare system.",
      "But some argue that making sustainable, long-term savings requires upfront government investment in employment support programmes - schemes which aim to help people overcome barriers to getting into work.",
      "Analysts also warn that reducing spending on the welfare bill has been historically difficult.",
      "At the 2015 general election, the Conservative manifesto promised to cut \u00a312bn from the annual welfare budget.",
      "While some significant savings were initially found, ministers were forced to change policy after a political backlash over some of the cuts.",
      "The OBR later concluded \u00a34bn of the \u00a312bn a year promised cuts had not been achieved.",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 14:26:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The PM seizes the spotlight as Trump upends the world order - but he faces serious challenges in the UK.",
    "story": [
      "\"Trump may be the best thing to happen to Starmer,\" says a diplomat, suggesting the brash property tycoon busy upending the world order might be just what the strait-laced prime minister - who's been dragging in the polls - needs.",
      "One of Labour's business backers calls it \"the PM's finest hour\" - a Remainer leader putting Britain at the heart of international action as Trump rattles the Western world's cage.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has certainly been incredibly visible \u2013 in the White House, leading a European summit at Lancaster House last weekend, hugging Zelensky, plotting a peacekeeping path with Macron.",
      "It's hard for the Conservatives and other opponents to compete with the prime minister's international moves dominating the news.",
      "Moments of crisis like the one we're living through are often when the public tunes into politics and looks to their leaders. With a shaky global situation, does No 10 look more solid than before?",
      "Some of his colleagues are certain. One government source tells me all the international activity is \"almost Blair-esque\", or even a moment like Thatcher and the Falklands which enabled the 80s Conservative prime minister to burnish her reputation and win successive election victories.",
      "Another minister suggests other leaders \"get their knickers in a twist\" publicly reacting to Trump's unpredictable comments and actions - \"but Keir has spent his whole career dealing with extreme circumstances. What he is able to do is get people to focus on the things that really matter.\"",
      "But impressive-looking diplomacy doesn't mean the UK is getting what it wants \u2013 missiles are still falling, overnight again in Donetsk and Kharkhiv. Donald Trump's commitment to guaranteeing Ukraine's security, even NATO's future, is shaky too.",
      "So let's take a calm look. Polling suggests there has been a nudge upwards for Sir Keir's personal ratings and for Labour, after a dreadful start in office and a steep, fast drop in the polls.",
      "His government would not be the first to be swept away by the intensity and glamour of global diplomacy which, however difficult or worthy, doesn't necessarily translate into significant brownie points at home.",
      "Perhaps in these wild times, we're seeing the prime minister carve out a role as \"reassurer in chief\". In political circles it's long been common to find criticisms of Sir Keir Starmer for, frankly, being a bit dull, and not willing to play the minute-by-minute political game. But with Trump in the White House stoking drama the PM's colleagues believe his steadiness has become an asset.",
      "And he's shown willingness to take action \u2013 increasing defence spending, albeit after months of pressure, getting European leaders together and drawing up military plans for after a peace deal. A senior government source says: \"The global crisis means people looking at us again, and the government has been making an argument that people are responding to: that we have got their backs.\"",
      "But aligning yourself with an American president doesn't always work out. Tony Blair's chinos weren't the only thing that became uncomfortable about his relationship with George W Bush.",
      "So while there's evidence the public are looking at Sir Keir a touch more favourably since his White House trip, as one union leader warns, \"for it to count he has to show the same mojo at home\".",
      "Take the row over sentencing this week. Or forthcoming arguments over cutting welfare, which ministers have been falling over themselves to soften the ground for.",
      "But overshadowing everything, priority number one: the grisly state of the economy and getting it to grow.",
      "In around a fortnight Rachel Reeves will be on her feet in Parliament, probably announcing cuts to public spending running to billions. Government sources point to some better statistics on wages, and cuts to interest rates, but Reeves is under enormous pressure to explain how the economy is going to escape the doldrums it has been stuck in for ages.",
      "All the Kodak moments, and grip and grins with international leaders in the world won't change that. The PM \"can walk and talk at the same\" time, one ally says. But there are, they acknowledge, \"only so many hours in the day\".",
      "Helping Ukraine against Putin's Russia has a clear moral story the prime minister finds easy to tell, and compelling to try to shape. In contrast, \"how do you bring prosperity to the regions? That's a real puzzle.\"",
      "In the next few days, starting with the PM's right-hand man Pat McFadden in the studio tomorrow, you will see the government try to kick up the pace of what is happening at home. First up - perhaps not a box-office hit - they'll be looking at making the Whitehall machine work better, including making it easier to get rid of civil servants.",
      "Ministers tell me Downing Street is being run more effectively than before Christmas and has a clearer sense of direction, after early embarrassment over being far less prepared than promised.",
      "Sir Keir chairs regular meetings with individual cabinet ministers in charge of the government's \"missions\". I'm told he \"cross-examines\" them and their officials - and if their answers aren't up to snuff, they get called in for another meeting. \"He is a very nice man, but he is a hard man too,\" one of them confides.",
      "As well as slimming down parts of the civil service, there'll be more on the government's plans to cut billions off the welfare bill. Labour will argue it's for good reason, to help people stuck on benefits - while critics will say it's a way for the government to save money off the backs of some of the most vulnerable people in the country.",
      "On Thursday, the prime minister is expected to make his own speech in an attempt to weave it all together into a grand narrative about safety abroad and at home. One government source said the last few weeks had galvanised Sir Keir's thinking on this: when things are uncertain on the international stage, \"everything feels a bit wobbly\" and domestic security is amplified: you look around and feel your job isn't secure, your street isn't safe.",
      "This thinking has been a long time coming. \"Security\" was a word and concept used by Reeves and Sir Keir in opposition - but recently he's been making a more ideological argument than those close to him are used to hearing.",
      "As well as making the case that what happens around the world is inextricably linked to what happens at home, he holds that the old international consensus among Western leaders has failed for millions of voters.",
      "That argument was crystallised into a long memo he sent to his cabinet ministers and political team in the middle of February. In it he wrote: \"The government's challenge was to shape this new era. Not to defend institutions that are broken or old ideas that have failed, but to be the voice of working people who more than anything want security in their lives, and a country that is on the up again.\"",
      "He wrote that politicians were wrong to think markets had solutions for almost everything. \"We were cowed by the market - we came to act as if it always knew best and the state should sit it out.\"",
      "He also said governments had failed on immigration, failed to understand the public's concerns and also - to tell the truth. \"We ended up treating all immigration as an untrammelled good. Somehow, politics ended up being too scared to say what is obvious - that some people are genuine refugees and some aren't; that people coming here to work can be a positive, but that an island nation needs to control its borders.\"",
      "Some extracts from the letter have been revealed before. But what is notable, reading the whole document, is the prime minister closes his letter to colleagues with a call to provide \"security\" for the country, alongside renewing public services. He writes: \"Now is our moment to be bigger and bolder - to put pedal on metal on wholescale reform and change our politics and our country. Security and renewal are our twin tasks - we must now deliver them.\"",
      "You'll hear more of that argument from ministers in the coming days - we had a glimpse of it in the studio last Sunday morning too.",
      "The profound uncertainty Donald Trump's arrival in the White House has given the prime minister a moment to step into the spotlight on the world stage.",
      "And his government is now much more overtly weaving an argument that working to establish security round the world is fundamentally connected to sorting out security at home.",
      "There is a reason why, fresh from all the diplomatic handshakes, Sir Keir was back in the more familiar hi-vis and hard hat announcing defence jobs in Belfast.",
      "No 10 wants you to see and believe that crisis abroad can mean opportunity at home. This spasm in global security has given a prime minister sometimes accused of being a blank page a clearer story to tell.",
      "But in the end, for any prime minister, it is what happens on home turf, not foreign adventures that matter the most. A sceptical public will take a lot of convincing to believe government can improve their situation \u2013 make it easier to manage the bills, buy a house, or for their kids to find a decent job.",
      "As as a senior figure in the Labour movement concludes, \"he likes the statesman role but the bottom line is, change in people's lives will be the decider.\"",

      "Of course, he said, Americans were more our friends than Russians are. But the US too had interests. And one day their interests would clash with ours.",
      "In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more clairvoyant.",

      "In fact French presidents going back to de Gaulle himself have all hinted that some European countries might de facto already be under the umbrella. In 1964 de Gaulle said that France would consider itself threatened if, for example, the USSR attacked Germany.",
      "So in one way there is nothing new in Macron suggesting a European dimension to France's deterrent.",
      "What is new, according to defence analysts, is that for the first time other European countries are also asking for it.",
      "\"In the past when France has made overtures [about extending nuclear protection], other countries were reluctant to respond,\" says Pierre Haroche of the Catholic University of Lille.",
      "\"They didn't want to send out the signal that they did not have complete faith in the US and Nato.\"",
      "\"But Trump has clarified the debate,\" Mr Laroche says. \"It's not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent \u2013 let's be clear, that does not seem to be on the table right now.\"",
      "\"But the credibility of US nuclear dissuasion is not what it was. That has opened the debate, and led the Germans to look more favourably on the idea of coming under a French and/or British umbrella.\"",
      "Last month the likely next German chancellor Friedrich Merz surprised the country's partners by saying it might be the moment for discussion with Paris and London on the subject.",
      "How a French or Franco-British European nuclear deterrent might operate is still far from clear.",
      "According to Mr Haroche, one option might be to position French nuclear-armed planes in other countries, such as Germany or Poland. The decision to press the trigger would still rest entirely with the French president, but their presence would send a strong signal.",
      "Alternatively, French bombers could patrol European borders, in the same way they regularly do French borders today. Or airfields could be developed in other countries to which French bombers could quickly deploy in an emergency.",
      "Numbers are an issue. Are 300 French warheads enough against Russia's thousands? Maybe not \u2013 but in an alliance with the UK 300 become 550. Also (to repeat the point) the American nuclear deterrent is still in theory in place. There are US nuclear bombs in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.",
      "Another question is whether to reformulate the French nuclear doctrine so as to state unambiguously that \"vital interests\" cover European allies too.",
      "Some say there is no need, because the strategic vagueness that exists already is part of the very deterrent.",
      "But Mr Haroche says there is a political dimension to stating more clearly that France will use its arsenal to defend other European countries.",
      "\"If the US is to be less present, then European countries will be depending much more on each other. Our strategic world becomes more horizontal,\" he says.",
      "\"In this new world it is important to build trust and confidence among ourselves. For France to signal it is prepared to take on risk in support of others \u2013 that helps create a solid front.\"",

    "story": [
      "From speeches watched by millions to a position as her party's deputy leader at Westminster, Mhairi Black appeared to be one of politics rising stars.",
      "However, away from the House of Commons the SNP MP was \"flailing through life\" and became ill through depression and anxiety, she has told the BBC.",
      "Black believes it was only through a \"life-changing\" diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that she was able to regain control of her life.",
      "The former Paisley and Renfrewshire South representative also said her party's performance at last year's general election, where the party dropped from 48 MPs to eight, was due to \"self-inflected\" woes.",
      "Black stood down as an elected politician in 2024 after nine years, having first won her seat aged just 20.",
      "She said her decision came after years in a \"toxic\" and \"bullying\" environment that was \"consuming my entire life\", with her mental health suffering badly until she was diagnosed with ADHD around 2018.",
      "\"Everything was fried - my body, my mind was emotionally fried,\" she told the BBC's Scotcast podcast.",
      "The interview comes ahead of the release of a new BBC documentary, Mhairi Black: Being Me Again.",
      "She said: \"I couldn't go out without throwing up. I would have panic attacks everywhere I went.",
      "\"I didn't understand what was going on and why I was feeling like this, I'm just beating myself up more, because I'm thinking, well, everybody else is managing to get into work okay. Why are you the one that can't cope with it?\"",
      "The documentary - which will air on BBC Scotland at 21:00 on Sunday and is available on iPlayer from Friday -  shows her discussing the condition and her last year at Westminster.",
      "She describes how anxiety became depression, and saw her take time off from Westminster duties - a decision that brought criticism for her attendance record at parliament and holding a lack of surgeries in her constituency.",
      "\"Westminster didn't have a capacity for signing off, so it looked to the rest of the world like I've no been turning up, when in actual fact I was in the foetal position in my house,\" she says.",
      "For Black, the diagnosis of ADHD has had a \"life-changing\" impact on her life.",
      "She told Scotcast: \"It was massive because it felt as though someone had just handed me the instruction manual for my own brain, and suddenly I was able to think like, I'm not mad, I'm just wired differently.",
      "\"It allowed me to stop beating myself up so much because there were times when I would struggle to do things that other folk do effortlessly.\"",
      "Black compares the condition to the BBC's Sherlock series, where Benedict Cumberbatch's famous detective would use his \"mind palace\" to work out cases.",
      "\"It feels like there's constantly three conversations in my head \u2013 and a song,\" she laughs.",
      "However, Black told Scotcast she decided not to go public with her diagnosis at the time as it \"would get used against me\" in Westminster - an aggressive culture that her wife Katie was surprised by.",
      "She recalls: \"When she [Mhairi] started telling me about her experiences since being in parliament, I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing.",
      "\"It was very different to what I'd believed. I was surprised how isolated she was.\"",
      "Black recounts seeing punch-ups and bullying during her time as an MP, and although she raised concerns with her party, the support offered was not enough.",
      "She said: \"I think leadership at all levels have been aware of people who've been unhappy with how they've been treated, and I imagine most people would agree that we could be better at how we handle it.\"",
      "Elected as the SNP dominated the Scottish vote, her departure from Westminster came on a night when, in her own words, \"the SNP got an absolute doing\".",
      "Black felt the SNP's poor result happened due to \"in-fighting that was spilling out into the public domain\".",
      "She added that this was not helped by power being centred around leader Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell who was the party's chief executive.",
      "She said: \"The reason that I think it spilled out into the public was because a lot of people had hit their limit because they felt like their voices weren't being listened to within the party.",
      "\"There were a lot of folk who weren't comfortable with the idea of the chief executive and the leader of the party basically being a couple in one house.\"",
      "Black added she believed the SNP worked best when on the left politically, and that if the views of current deputy Kate Forbes became party policy there would be a \"mass exodus\" of members.",
      "Forbes is known for her conservative views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion and trans rights.",
      "Black was a headline act from her first days in Parliament, when her initial Commons speech saw her decry poverty and was viewed 10 million times within days.",
      "It came after a whirlwind time when she overturned Douglas Alexander's majority in 2015, as part of an SNP surge that saw the party take nearly every constituency in Scotland.",
      "Black had been energised by the independence referendum in 2014, which she calls a \"magical\" time.",
      "Defeat in the independence vote \"felt like a death\" she says, but within months she was standing for election - a time that saw social media posts she made as a teenager resurface, including declarations of love for Smirnoff Ice and views on football.",
      "\"The way it was twisted to make her out be a drunken, bigoted wee lout was one of the worst times of my life,\" recalls her father.",
      "It did not hurt her at the polls though,  and she carried that bluntness into her Westminster career.",
      "'I get death threats all the time'",
      "However, a vulnerability was underneath the surface - at one point the documentary shows a stuffed panda bear given to her by her mum to keep her company in London.",
      "In 2018 she spoke at length about the abuse she had suffered online, repeating some of the many foul-mouthed  slurs sent to her about her appearance and sexuality, including that you \"can't put lipstick on a pig\" and that she was \"too ugly to be raped\".",
      "\"It's difficult to describe how you can feel so alone and unsafe and under attack with nothing more than your phone sitting there,\" she reflects.",
      "\"I get death threats all the time but there was one in particular where the police came to my flat down in London and the house up in Scotland.",
      "\"It was like two in the morning and the phrase used was a 'an imminent death threat'.",
      "\"I don't know what I've done to make you viscerally hate me that much.\"",
      "Since politics she has performed a one-woman show at the Edinburgh festival and spent time talking about politics on various TV shows and podcasts.",
      "There does not appear to be any second guessing about her decision to stand down though, as she enjoys a walk with her dog in the new documentary.",
      "\"People deserve a representative that wants to be there and I don't think that's me anymore.  I've done my bit,\" she says.",

    "summary": "The briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant.",
    "story": [
      "The government briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant, in several different ways.",
      "First, it confirms what had been rumoured - that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent forecaster, believes that the chancellor's 'headroom' has been eliminated.",
      "This is the \u00a310bn worth of leeway which, as of last October, the OBR believed the government had before breaking its self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "Why has that headroom disappeared? The government's clear view is that this is because of global factors  - tariffs being imposed by President Trump, broader uncertainty emanating from the new US administration, persistent inflation in the UK and elsewhere, and the rising cost of government borrowing.",
      "But there will be a big political argument about this.",
      "The Conservatives will contend that the cost of government borrowing was rising even before President Trump took office and that the tax rises in Reeves's Budget in October were a major factor, as well as in stunting growth.",
      "Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions",
      "Labour ministers tread carefully as welfare reform looms",
      "What is the OBR and why does it matter?",
      "Relatedly, it is worth stressing that this month was not meant to be a big economic moment for the government.",
      "Over recent years, a fiscal rhythm has developed where there is one Budget a year and then a second (spring or autumn) statement which also contains significant tax and spend measures and is akin to a mini-budget.",
      "Reeves wanted to end that, with an autumn Budget and then a much more limited event in spring at which the OBR published updated forecasts but the government did not respond with major economic measures.",
      "Government sources say that this will not be a fiscal event because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "Yet the Charter for Budget Responsibility, recently updated by the Labour government, said that it was committed to one major fiscal event a year in order to \"give families and business more certainty\" not only about tax but \"spending changes\" too.",
      "The government did reserve the right to change that approach \"in the case of an economic shock\".",
      "Does that mean the government believes the effect of President Trump has been an economic shock?",
      "There are clear political sensitivities in where the cuts are likely to fall. The Labour Party has many factions and ideological nuances but all of its MPs are committed to a generous welfare state and many will be antsy at the prospect of welfare cuts.",
      "Those in government are adamant, though, that the numbers - which are rising fast - of claimants and the amount being spent by government are simply unsustainable.",
      "There will be reform as well as cuts  - Reeves has identified what she sees as \"perverse incentives\" in the system.",
      "In a preview of the potential rows to come, one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was critical, saying: \"There is always money for war, yet none left for the most vulnerable to lift them out of hardship.\"",
      "\"Austerity is a choice. Poverty is a political choice,\" they added.",
      "However others, including from the left of the party, said they recognised the welfare system was \"old fashioned\" and needed reform.",
      "\"We have people who can work but don't just automatically because the system is inflexible,\" one said.",
      "Notably the next target for cuts appears to be the civil service.",
      "Privately ministers and officials have been dismayed by the quality of the Whitehall machine.",
      "The government is expected to demand major reductions in the numbers of civil servants, though this is unlikely to take the form of a specific numerical target.",
      "Ministers are also understood to have discussed major changes to the machinery of government, namely how government departments are organised, though this work is considered unlikely to come to fruition this month."

    "summary": "The prime minister will soon need evidence to show he can be a bridge between Trump and Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's decision to pause military aid to Ukraine may well prove to be one of the most significant moments in the conflict since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion.",
      "As far as the UK is concerned, it will not change Sir Keir Starmer's approach, but makes the issues he has been focusing on for the past few days more acute and more urgent.",
      "The prime minister still views his core tasks as finding a way to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together, and drawing up the foundations of a workable peace deal that can be presented to the US.",
      "As we saw in the House of Commons on Monday, where MPs from different parties lined up to laud the prime minister for his sure-footed diplomacy, it is a strategy with broad support across the political spectrum.",
      "But how deep is that support? We may be about to find out.",
      "UK won't be derailed by Ukraine aid freeze - Rayner",
      "Ukraine's shock over US military aid pause",
      "It is one thing for the prime minister to vow to do all he can to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together.",
      "But to be a bridge between both countries, Sir Keir will in time need evidence that he has influence on both sides of that bridge.",
      "Towards the end of his statement in the Commons, the prime minister was asked about US media reports that Trump was considering withdrawing military aid.",
      "He replied that this was not his understanding of the US position. Evidently, this shortly turned out to be wrong.",
      "We now know that at some point later on Monday, Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone - their third phone call in four days.",
      "But we do not know whether Trump gave Starmer prior warning of his decision on military aid or not.",
      "It may be that Starmer tried to persuade Trump not to go ahead and failed. Or it may be that Trump did not tell Starmer what he was about to do.",
      "Neither of those scenarios would be especially positive for the prime minister.",
      "Vance comments row",
      "As it is, it seems Downing Street is still waiting on full details of the US administration's decision and how it will work.",
      "And it is worth stressing that this is a temporary pause in aid, not a permanent cessation. It may simply be another attempt by Trump to pressure Zelensky. The aid may resume.",
      "Or, this may be the clearest example that  - despite the unquestionable warmth Starmer has managed to foster with the US president - the fundamental frames through which they view this conflict and the western alliance more generally are irreconcilably different.",
      "Into this increasingly fraught transatlantic environment has come JD Vance, the US vice-president, scoffing at the idea Ukraine could be protected by \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".",
      "So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, and his comments were interpreted by many as having been a jibe at both countries.",
      "Vance has now insisted he was talking about other, unnamed countries - confining the diplomatic fallout for the time being.",
      "Yet even if Vance was referring to other countries which might be willing to take on some of the military burden of protecting Ukraine, it is hardly encouraging for the UK in its convening role in Europe if the response of the US vice-president is to mock their capabilities.",
      "Perhaps that is merely a more blunt-speaking approach from a new US administration determined to do away with niceties.",
      "After all, most European countries are now admitting themselves that their defence spending has been far too low for far too long.",
      "But all the signs suggest that before long, questions about Sir Keir Starmer's approach to Ukraine may give way to much more fundamental questions about Britain's place in a profoundly changed world."

      "The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is looking at how it can speed up the approval process for lab-grown foods.",
      "Such products are grown from cells in small chemical plants.",
      "UK firms have led the way in the field scientifically but feel they have been held back by the current regulations.",
      "Dog food made from meat that was grown in factory vats went on sale in the UK for the first time last month.",
      "In 2020, Singapore became the first country to authorise the sale of cell-cultivated meat for human consumption, followed by the United States three years later and Israel last year.",
      "However, Italy and the US states of Alabama and Florida have instituted bans.",
      "The FSA is to develop new regulations by working with experts from high-tech food firms and academic researchers.",
      "It says it aims to complete the full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the two-year process it is starting.",
      "But critics say that having the firms involved in drawing up the new rules represents a conflict of interest.",
      "The initiative is in response to concerns by UK firms that they are losing ground to competition overseas, where approvals processes take half the time.",
      "Prof Robin May, the FSA's chief scientist, told BBC News that there would be no compromise on consumer safety.",
      "\"We are working very closely with the companies involved and academic groups to work together to design a regulatory structure that is good for them, but at all costs ensures the safety of these products remains as high as it possibly can,\" he said.",
      "But critics such as Pat Thomas, director of the campaign group Beyond GM, are not convinced by this approach.",
      "\"The companies involved in helping the FSA to draw up these regulations are the ones most likely to benefit from deregulation and if this were any other type of food product, we would be outraged by it,\" she said.",
      "The science minister, Lord Vallance, took issue with the process being described as \"deregulation\".",
      "\"It is not deregulation, it is pro-innovation regulation,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"It is an important distinction, because we are trying to get the regulation aligned with the needs of innovation and reduce some of the bureaucracy and duplication.\"",
      "Lab-grown foods are grown into plant or animal tissue from tiny cells. This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier.",
      "The government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth.",
      "The UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures.",
      "Ivy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.",
      "The firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.",
      "\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"",
      "Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet.",
      "It doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.",
      "In this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.",
      "\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me.",
      "\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"",
      "The FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods.",
      "Prof May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right.",
      "\"It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them.\"",
      "But Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold.",
      "\"Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,\" he said.",

      "It was supposed to spend 10 days searching for water ice, but the position of its solar panels and the cold temperatures of the rocky region mean it cannot recharge.",
      "Intuitive Machines partnered with US space agency Nasa to explore whether humans can live on the Moon.",

      "It is unlikely that the instruments on board can now be used, including a drill to penetrate the lunar soil, a hopping robot to explore a shadowed crater, and the first lunar antenna.",

      "But the ambitious mission still achieved milestones in ongoing exploration of the Moon.",
      "Athena made it further south than any other lander, reaching the Mons Mouton region which is a flat-topped mountain about 100 miles (160km) from the South Pole.",
      "It is considered a difficult and risky area to land in.",
      "The sun is low in the sky and casts shadow that can confuse landers trying to touch down. And the amount of sunlight reaching the craft can limit how much electricity it produces in its solar panels.",

      "Nasa wants to send four astronauts to the Moon in 2027 in its Artemis programme. Its long-term goal is to take humans to Mars, using the Moon as a stepping stone.",
      "It is working with private companies to drive down the cost of space exploration, but that means accepting a higher risk of failure.",
      "\"In face of setbacks, it requires a steady hand on the tiller and the vision to see the bigger picture\", says Dr Barber, saying that knee-jerk responses to failures could \"cause damage and delay\"."

      "However, the researchers say butterflies may be able to recover if urgent conservation measures are taken.",

      "The results showed that 33% were in significant decline, with many exhibiting extreme losses - 107 species declined by more than 50%.",
      "\"While the results aligned with global trends, seeing the extent of the decline at such a large spatial scale was sobering,\" said Prof Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University.",

      "The West Coast lady, once a common backyard butterfly, has declined by 80%, raising alarm as even this highly adaptable species struggled.",

      "This is what UK scientists have discovered - identifying a genetic source of many labradors' - and some people's - tendency to overeat.",
      "Researchers found that changes in a particular gene, one of the building blocks of biological code that produces the blueprint for how our bodies work, alters the chemical signals that tell our brains we've had enough to eat.",
      "The scientists say their findings, published in the journal Science, reveal something \"powerful\" about the biology of obesity risk.",
      "\"By studying dogs, we've honed in on some interesting new biology here,\" explained lead researcher Dr Eleanor Raffan from the University of Cambridge's department of physiology, development and neuroscience.",
      "She added that the discovery showed that \"owners of slim dogs are not morally superior - and the same is true of slim people\".",
      "\"If you have a high genetic risk of obesity, you're prone to gaining weight unless you put a huge effort into not doing so. And those with low genetic risk just don't have to work so hard.\"",
      "This canine-human biological link came from the researchers' examination of the genetics of 250 labradors. The team looked for pieces of genetic code that were common in overweight dogs.",
      "They picked out one gene in particular - called DENND1B - that was associated with a higher body mass in the labradors. And when they searched through a library of genetic information from thousands of humans, they discovered that the same gene was associated with a higher body mass in people, too.",
      "Before this study of labrador genetics, Dr Raffan said, \"no one suspected that gene  had anything to do with obesity\".",

      "\"But it all speaks to the same important bit of biology, which is that obesity is not  about having low willpower.",

    "story": [
      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

      "The discovery centres on the proteasome \u2013 a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body.",
      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",
      "It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them.",
      "Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening.",
      "\"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection.",
      "\"It's happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics.\"",
      "The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics.",
      "They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.",
      "And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.",
      "Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection.",
      "\"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\"",
      "But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time.",
      "More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.",
      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.",
      "Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists.",
      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.",
      "\"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\"",
      "She also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the \"safety side of it might be a lot easier\"."

    "summary": "Households near new pylons are set to get up to \u00a3250 a year off their energy bills, under government plans.",
    "story": [
      "The cost of reducing energy bills for people who live near pylons will be paid for by increasing average annual bills across the country by 80p, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has told the BBC.",
      "Under the government's plans, households in Great Britain within 500m of new or upgraded pylons will get discounts of up to \u00a32,500 over 10 years, equivalent to \u00a3250 a year.",
      "Miliband said the costs of the scheme were \"more than offset\" by the benefits of the new infrastructure.",
      "He added that the idea was not about buying people off but \"recognising the service\" they were doing for the whole country.",
      "However, rural campaign groups said it was \"impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape\".",
      "A government-commissioned report found hundreds of miles of new pylons will be needed to meet its clean energy targets.",
      "But new infrastructure proposals have sparked fierce opposition from residents in parts of the country like Norfolk and Suffolk, with campaigners arguing they will destroy the countryside.",
      "The bill discounts, which will be funded by electricity suppliers, are expected to be in place from 2026.",
      "Suppliers are expected to recoup costs by passing them on to other customers.",
      "Miliband told the BBC: \"At the moment, we're having to switch off offshore wind farms because we haven't got the transmission infrastructure.",
      "\"So everybody benefits from this. Everybody gets lower bills, and those who live near pylons are given a recognition of what they're doing.\"",
      "The idea forms part of the government's Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which is due to be published this week.",
      "The legislation aims to speed up the building of new homes and infrastructure by cutting red tape and simplifying the planning process.",
      "The government has put the changes at the heart of its push for economic growth.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said local people would still be \"part of the process\", but it would be \"streamlined\" so development was not \"continually blocked for years and years\".",
      "Battle lines drawn over 'monstrous' pylons and solar farm 'wastelands'",
      "Why more pylons could be headed your way",
      "Can electricity pylons ever be beautiful?",
      "Alongside money off bills, the government will publish new guidance on how developers should provide benefits to communities hosting transmission infrastructure, by funding projects like sports clubs, educational programmes or leisure facilities.",
      "The government said this would mean communities could get \u00a3200,000 worth of funding per km of overhead electricity cable in their area, and \u00a3530,000 per substation.",
      "Initial analysis estimates both bill discounts and community funds could see a total additional cost of between \u00a31-2 a year for the average customer over 10 years.",
      "The government is also looking at how communities near onshore wind farms and other energy infrastructure can receive benefits.",
      "The plans were welcomed by RenewableUK, which represents the sector.",
      "The group's head of policy, James Robottom, said bill discounts would \"help to enable the roll-out of much-needed new grid infrastructure at a faster pace, so that we can make the most of the vast amounts of clean power we're producing\".",
      "However, Jackie Copley, campaign lead at CPRE, the countryside charity, said: \"Investing in local green spaces or improving community infrastructure would be a better way to spend this money.",
      "\"Paying individuals comes with many problems, including questions of fairness, likely legal challenges, and the fact that it's impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape.\"",
      "The idea of giving people living near new pylons money off their energy bills was also proposed under the previous Conservative government.",
      "A government survey in 2024 suggested 78% of people would find an energy infrastructure project more acceptable if they were offered discounts on their bills.",
      "Some energy companies already offer bill discounts to customers who live near infrastructure like wind turbines, while grants are also available for local communities affected.",
      "The bill also includes measures that would allow \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served\" process.",
      "The government says the existing system is being \"clogged up\" by speculative projects creating 10 year waits for \"viable infrastructure\".",
      "Meanwhile, the government has announced the number of bodies which get a say in planning decisions could be cut.",
      "Officials will consult on removing Sport England, the Theatres Trust and the Garden History Society from the list of \"statutory consultees\", who are legally required to provide advice on decisions.",
      "The government said in some cases organisations were slowing down building, giving the example of a housing development in Bradford which was delayed because the application was thought to have not adequately considered the speed of cricket balls from a nearby club.",

    "summary": "Government-backed heat pump installations in the UK reached record levels for 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

      "The NHS is \"looking into\" allegations that patient data was left vulnerable to hacking due to a software flaw at a private medical services company.",
      "The flaw was found last November at Medefer, which handles 1,500 NHS patient referrals a month in England.",
      "The software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years.",
      "Medefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised.",
      "The flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered.",
      "In late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems.",
      "An NHS spokesperson said: \"We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate.\"",
      "Medefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data.",
      "However, the software bug, discovered in November, made Medefer's internal patient record system vulnerable to hackers, the engineer said.",
      "The software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered.",
      "\"When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'.\"",
      "The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.",
      "The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.",
      "He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.",
      "\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.",
      "On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.",
      "Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.",
      "It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was \"extremely open\".",
      "Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.",
      "The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.",
      "In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"",
      "He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.",
      "\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"",
      "The security agency will complete its review later this week.",
      "Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"",
      "Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.",
      "\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.",
      "\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added.",
      "Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.",
      "\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.",
      "Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across England.",
      "In a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector.",

      "Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal government's existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (\u00a313.6bn) at today's prices.",

      "It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.",
      "The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset. While the reserve will exclusively contain Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies will go into a separate stockpile.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department said Chinese agencies paid as much as $75,000  (\u00a358,200) for each hacked email inbox.",
    "story": [
      "US prosecutors have charged 12 Chinese nationals for being part of an alleged hacking scheme, which sold data of US-based dissidents to the Chinese government.",
      "The \"state-sponsored\" operation also targeted government agencies including the Treasury, according to the Justice Department (DOJ).",
      "Hackers also allegedly targeted an American religious organisation, and a newspaper in Hong Kong, the statement added.",
      "China has not responded to these specific allegations, but have strongly denied other accusations in the past.",
      "In December, the Treasury Department reported a \"major\" breach by Chinese -sponsored hackers, saying they were able to access employee workstations and some unclassified documents.",
      "At that time, China denied any involvement, calling the accusation \"baseless\" and saying it \"consistently opposes all forms of hacking\".",
      "It is unclear when the latest DOJ charges were issued - but they were unsealed in a federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday.",
      "Who is being charged?",
      "Among the individuals charged were two officers of China's Ministry of Public Security.",
      "The DOJ said that hackers, which appeared to represent a private company, i-Soon, charged Chinese agencies between $10,000 and $75,000 for each \"exploited\" email inbox.",
      "They allegedly \"conducted computer intrusions\" under the direction of Chinese ministries and on their own initiative, and were \"paid handsomely for stolen data\".",
      "\"Today, we are exposing the Chinese government agents directing and fostering indiscriminate and reckless attacks against computers and networks worldwide,\" said Sue J Bai, who heads the DOJ's National Security Division.",
      "\"We will continue to fight to dismantle this ecosystem of cyber mercenaries and protect our national security,\" she added.",
      "Who was targeted?",
      "No further details on the targeted US-based dissidents were provided.",
      "The religious organisation hit by hackers was described as one which \"previously sent missionaries to China and was openly critical of the PRC government\". PRC is short for the People's Republic of China.",
      "A Hong Kong newspaper was also on the list. While it was not named, the statement said that it was \"considered as being opposed to the PRC government\".",
      "Besides US agencies, hackers were said to have targeted the foreign ministries of Taiwan, India, South Korea and Indonesia.",
      "Last October, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said hacks targeting two major US presidential campaigns were carried out by \"actors affiliated with the People's Republic of China\".",
      "Earlier last year, seven Chinese nationals were charged with running a hacking operation that lasted at least 14 years and targeted foreign critics of China.",
      "Operations linked by Western governments to China have also targeted the UK's Electoral Commission, and the UK and New Zealand parliaments.",
      "As part of its long-running rewards programme, the US State Department said it was offering up to $10m for information on i-Soon, its employees and Chinese officials \"engaged in malicious cyber activities highlighted in the Department of Justice's indictments\"."

    "summary": "Despite opposition investors are still looking at deep-sea mining technology.",
    "story": [
      "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.",
      "All the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.",
      "The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.",
      "Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.",
      "\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.",
      "The firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.",
      "The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.",
      "Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.",
      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",

      "The UK competition watchdog has ended its investigation into the partnership between Microsoft and the maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI.",

      "The CMA has concluded that, despite Microsoft investing billions of dollars into OpenAI and having exclusive uses of some of its AI products, the partnership remains the same, so is not subject to review under the UK's merger rules.",
      "Digital rights campaigners, Foxglove, said it showed the CMA had been \"defanged.\"",
      "The CMA opened the probe in December 2023, after Microsoft had put pressure on OpenAI to re-employ Mr Altman, days after he had been sacked.",
      "\"In view of Microsoft's potentially important role in securing Sam Altman's re-appointment, the CMA believed there was a reasonable chance that an investigation would reveal that Microsoft had increased its control over OpenAI's commercial policy,\" the watchdog said.",
      "But on Wednesday, it concluded Microsoft \"exerts a high level of material influence\" over OpenAI's commercial policy without fully controlling it.",
      "\"Because this change of control has not happened, the partnership in its current form does not qualify for review under the UK's merger control regime,\" CMA Executive Director for Mergers Joel Bamford posted in an article on LinkedIn.",

      "\"The CMA has sat on this decision for over a year, yet within just a few weeks of a former Amazon boss being installed as chair, it has decided everything was absolutely fine all along, nothing to see here,\" said Foxglove co-executive director Rosa Curling.",
      "\"This is a bad sign that Big Tech has successfully convinced the prime minister to defang our competition regulator and let Big Tech gobble up the current generation of cutting-edge tech \u2013 just like they did the last one,\" she told the BBC.",
      "When BBC News contacted the CMA for a response to these comments, they pointed us to Mr Bamford's LinkedIn post, where he said: \"We are not blind to the length of time that this investigation has taken... We know pace matters to business confidence and investment.\"",
      "He added the reason this investigation took so long was because the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI had been changing over that time.",
      "In 2024, while Mr Bokkerink was chair, the CMA also issued similar \"found not to qualify\" decisions on other AI partnerships it reviewed involving firms including Microsoft, Amazon and Google.",
      "In April of same year, the CMA's chief executive Sarah Cardell said the body had \"real concerns\" about an \"interconnected web\" of AI partnerships between big tech firms.",
      "But in a set of instructions to the CMA issued in February, the government said it should prioritise \"pro-growth and pro-investment interventions\".",
      "The same month the UK sided with the US in not signing an agreement on AI at a summit in Paris.",
      "US Vice President JD Vance had told delegates that too much regulation of AI could \"kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off\".",
      "\"The CMA will be taking a less interventionist approach to protecting competition and to merger control reviews, [but] this does not mean the CMA will approve every deal presented to it without question,\" said Chloe Birkett, competition lawyer at  law firm Freeths.",
      "\"The CMA's purpose is to help preserve competition in markets to ensure that consumers get a fair deal,\" she said.",
      "In a statement Microsoft said: \"Our OpenAI partnership and its continued evolution promote competition, innovation, and responsible AI development, and we welcome the CMA's conclusion, after careful and prudent consideration of the commercial realities, to close its investigation.\"",

      "\"We're going over there with an expectation that we're going to make substantial progress,\" Witkoff told Fox News. On whether a minerals deal was imminent, he said \"all the signs are very, very positive\".",
      "US President Donald Trump has stepped up pressure on his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky to accept his demands for a quick ceasefire with Moscow - but without any immediate pledge of a US security guarantee.",
      "Ten days ago the two publicly clashed at the White House, with Trump claiming Zelensky was not ready to end the fighting.",

      "A senior US state department official said that the Trump administration believes Ukraine's leadership is \"ready to move forward\" with the US's demand for a ceasefire process with Russia.",

      "The Ukrainian team will be represented by Zelensky's head of office Andriy Yermak, the country's national security adviser as well as foreign and defence ministers.",
      "Zelensky wrote on social media on Monday that Ukraine \"has been seeking peace since the very first second of the war, and we have always said that the only reason that the war is continuing is because of Russia\".",
      "A short while later, during a daily briefing, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that it was important to determine whether Ukraine really wanted peace or not. Zelensky has on numerous occasions been accused by US officials of not wanting peace.",
      "The Ukrainian leader has been under strong US pressure to make concessions ahead of any peace talks, while he has been pushing for firm security guarantees for Kyiv, stressing that Putin violated previous ceasefire deals.",
      "On Friday, Trump issued a rare threat of further sanctions against Moscow in a push for a deal. Russia is already heavily sanctioned by the US over the war.",
      "Trump said he was contemplating the move because \"Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now\".",
      "Soon after the White House row, Zelensky expressed regret about the incident and tried to repair relations with the US - the country's biggest military supplier.",
      "Witkoff later said that Trump had received a letter from Zelensky that included an \"apology\" and \"sense of gratitude\".",
      "The envoy said that in Saudi Arabia the US team wanted to discuss a \"framework\" for peace to try to end the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "A major minerals deal - derailed because of the row - is also reported to be back on the agenda in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Ukraine has offered to grant the US access to its rare earth mineral reserves in exchange for US security guarantees.",
      "Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko said he believed Zelensky needed to secure the US-Ukraine relationship \"at any cost\" during his trip to Saudi Arabia, while making clear \"what our red lines are\".",
      "\"Otherwise, if there is a deal outside of these terms, then we will just say no, that's all. Because it's our army fighting,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "The clash at the White House also resulted in the US pausing all military aid to Ukraine and stopping sharing intelligence.",
      "But when asked on Sunday whether he would consider lifting the intelligence pause, Trump answered: \"Well, we just about have. I mean, we really just about have and we want to do anything we can to get Ukraine to be serious about getting something done.\" He provided no further details.",
      "On 18 February - before the US-Ukraine row in Washington - Rubio held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Saudi Arabia. It was a follow-up to Trump's controversial phone conversation with Putin.",

      "Mark Carney's thumping victory in the race to succeed Justin Trudeau makes him not only leader of the Liberal Party but, by default, the next Canadian prime minister.",
      "It's an extraordinary result for a man with very little political experience. He has never been elected as an MP, let alone served in a cabinet post.",
      "What Carney does have though - as Governor of the Bank of Canada during the global financial crisis and Governor of the Bank of England during the Brexit negotiations - is a long track record in global finance during times of economic turbulence.",
      "And at a moment like this, Carney has been arguing, that could prove invaluable.",

      "Addressing a crowd of Liberal supporters after the result of the leadership contest was announced on Sunday evening, Carney promised to face down the threats from Trump, over the tariffs and the claims on Canada's sovereignty.",
      "\"Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape or form,\" he said. \"We didn't ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves.",
      "\"Americans should make no mistake\", he warned. \"In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\"",
      "He repeatedly referred to the US president by name and said his government would keep retaliatory tariffs in place until \"America shows us respect\".",
      "How he will translate his strong language on the stage in Ottawa into practical solutions to those twin challenges was, however, far less clear.",
      "Liberals might hope that Trudeau's exit from the stage will, in itself, help clear the air.",
      "Instead of the frequent mocking of Trudeau by Trump as a \"weak\" leader, they might dare to believe that Carney will at least be able to reset the personal chemistry.",
      "On the other hand, if he has to push hard in an attempt to win concessions, will he also risk incurring the wrath of a man who uses unpredictability as a political art form?",

      "Did he think Trump was being serious?",
      "\"You know, I don't know,\" he told me. \"Do you know? Does anyone know? I'm not a medical doctor or a psychiatrist. He changes his mind every two or three hours. So [for him] to be leader of the free world, it is preoccupying for everybody.\"",
      "While the US threat is dominating Canadian politics - Carney described the current situation as \"dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust\" - there are still domestic political matters to focus on too, not least the prospect of a general election.",
      "Once sworn in as prime minister in the coming days, Carney will have to decide whether to call a snap election. If he doesn't, the opposition parties in parliament could force one later this month through a no-confidence vote.",
      "Before Trudeau said he was stepping down, the Liberal Party was facing electoral oblivion.",
      "After nine years in power, he'd become a liability and a lightning rod for public anger over the rising cost of living despite record levels of government spending and a ballooning national debt.",
      "The stage appeared to be set for the Liberals to be swept from power by a Conservative Party under the stewardship of the young, populist leader Pierre Poilievre, who had turned lambasting Trudeau into something of a sport.",
      "Now, not only has he lost the advantage of a deeply unpopular opponent, his political style is at risk of appearing out of step. In the current environment, even a loose alignment with the politics of Trump is a potential liability with Canadian voters.",
      "The Republican president, for his part, recently said Canada's Conservative leader was not Maga enough.",
      "The Liberal Party is suddenly feeling a sense of rejuvenation - the gap in the opinion polls with the Conservatives, once a gulf, has narrowed dramatically. And you could feel that palpable sense of optimism in the room on Sunday evening.",
      "Aware of the danger, Poilievre accused Liberals of \"trying to trick Canadians\" to elect them to a fourth term. But his statement also highlighted how Trump is changing the political messaging on this side of the border.",
      "\"It is the same Liberal team that drove up taxes, housing costs, and food prices, while Carney personally profited from moving billions of dollars and thousands of jobs out of Canada to the United States,\" Poilievre wrote.",
      "\"We need a new Conservative government that will put Canada First - for a change.\"",
      "Trump's election has led Canada to rally to round its flag and has propelled a former central bank governor \u2013 an archetypal member of the country's political elite \u2013 to the highest office in the land.",
      "The Conservatives may still lead in the polls, but for the first time in a long time, the Liberals believe that, under Carney, they have a fighting chance again."

      "Constitutional court judges will meet on Tuesday afternoon to discuss Georgescu's appeal, and a final ruling should be issued by Wednesday evening.",
      "The BEC rejected his candidacy on Sunday after a 10-4 vote, saying it did not \"meet the conditions of legality\", as Georgescu \"violated the very obligation to defend democracy\".",
      "Last year, the court annulled November's first round of the vote - in which Georgescu came first - after intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him.",
      "In his appeal, Georgescu said that the \"BEC exceeded its legal powers\". He also argued that the constitutional court's decision on the November election should have no bearing on his candidacy for the upcoming vote in May.",
      "In a social media post, Georgescu also called the ban a \"direct blow to the heart of democracy worldwide\".",

    "story": [
      "Residents of Greenland head to the polls on Tuesday in a vote that in previous years has drawn little outside attention - but which may prove pivotal for the Arctic territory's future.",
      "US President Donald Trump's repeated interest in acquiring Greenland has put it firmly in the spotlight and fuelled the longstanding debate on the island's future ties with Copenhagen.",
      "\"There's never been a spotlight like this on Greenland before,\" says Nauja Bianco, a Danish-Greenlandic policy expert on the Arctic.",
      "Greenland has been controlled by Denmark \u2013 nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away \u2013 for about 300 years. It governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen.",
      "Now, five out of six parties on the ballot favour Greenland's independence from Denmark, differing only on how quickly that should come about.",
      "The debate over independence has been \"put on steroids by Trump\", says Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.",
      "The island's strategic location and untapped mineral resources have caught the US president's eye. He first floated the idea of buying Greenland during his first term in 2019.",
      "Since taking office again in January, he has reiterated his intention to acquire the territory. Greenland and Denmark's leaders have repeatedly rebuffed his demands.",
      "Addressing the US Congress last week, however, Trump again doubled down. \"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're gonna get it,\" he said, prompting applause and laughter from a number of politicians, including Vice-President JD Vance.",
      "In Nuuk, his words struck a nerve with politicians who were quick to condemn them. \"We deserve to be treated with respect and I don't think the American president has done that lately since he took office,\" Prime Minister Mute Egede said.",
      "Still, the US interest has stoked calls for Greenland to break away from Denmark, with much of the debate focused on when \u2013 not if \u2013 the process of independence should begin.",
      "Greenland's independence goal is not new, Nauja Bianco points out, and has been decades in the making.",
      "A string of revelations about past mistreatment of Inuit people by the Danes have hurt Greenlandic public opinion about Denmark. Earlier this year, PM Egede said the territory should free itself from \"the shackles of colonialism\".",
      "But it is the first time the subject has taken centre stage in an election.",
      "Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), the party of Prime Minister Mute Egede, favours gradual steps towards autonomy. \"Citizens must feel secure,\" he told local media.",
      "Arctic expert Martin Breum says Egede's handling of the challenge from Trump and strong words against Denmark over past colonial wrongdoings \"will give him a lot of votes\".",
      "Smaller rivals could also gain ground and potentially shake up alliances.",
      "Opposition party Naleraq wants to immediately kick-off divorce proceedings from Copenhagen and have closer defence dealings with Washington.",
      "Pointing to Greenland's EU departure and Brexit, party leader Pele Broberg has said that Greenland could be \"out of the Danish kingdom in three years\".",

      "Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?",
      "Talk of Trump and independence has overshadowed other key issues for voters, says newspaper editor Masaana Egede.",
      "\"It's an election where we should be talking about healthcare, care of the elderly and social problems. Almost everything is about independence.\"",
      "According to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back moves towards future statehood.",
      "About 44,000 people are eligible to vote, and given the low numbers and few polls, results are difficult to forecast.",
      "Even though a majority of Greenlanders favour independence, a survey has shown that half would be less enthusiastic about independence if that meant lower living standards.",
      "One poll found that 85% of Greenlanders do not wish to become a part of the United States, and nearly half see Trump's interest as a threat.",
      "One fear among some Greenlanders, says Masaana Egede, is how long the Arctic island could remain independent and whether it would break off from Denmark only to have another country \"standing on our coasts and start taking over\".",
      "Experts say it is this worry that could steer votes towards keeping the status quo.",
      "Although Greenland's right to self-determination is enshrined into law by the 2009 Self-Rule Act, there are several steps to take before the territory could break away from Denmark, including holding a referendum.",
      "This means getting full independence could take \"about 10 to 15 years,\" says Kaj Kleist, a veteran Greenlandic politician and civil servant who prepared the Self-Rule Act.",
      "\"There is lot of preparation and negotiations with the Danish government before you can make that a reality,\" he adds.",
      "Whatever the election's outcome, experts do not believe Greenland could become independent before Trump's second term is over in 2028.",
      "The results are expected in the early hours of Wednesday."

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of flights have been cancelled across Germany as airport workers stage a nationwide strike over pay, posing a major disruption for air travellers.",
      "The industrial action, led by the trade union Verdi, began unexpectedly on Sunday at Hamburg Airport, before expanding to a nationwide strike.",
      "Passengers at Frankfurt, Munich, Berlin and other major hubs have been urged not to travel to airports, with operations severely disrupted. Frankfurt, Germany's busiest airport, said passengers would be unable to board flights and transfer would \"almost certainly\" be affected.",
      "Verdi, which represents public sector and transport workers, is in an ongoing dispute over wages and working conditions.",
      "German media reports thousands of flights could be cancelled across the day, disrupting travel for more than 500,000 passengers.",
      "The Lufthansa group, whose main hub is in Frankfurt, confirmed \"delays and extensive cancellations\" across all its airlines.",
      "Meanwhile, Munich Airport warned of a \"greatly reduced flight schedule\". This includes flights by Eurowings, Austrian Airlines and Swiss Air.",
      "Katja Bromm, spokeswoman for Hamburg Airport, where all 143 departures scheduled on Monday have already been cancelled, said Verdi was \"dishonourable\" to call a strike without notice at the start of the holiday season.",
      "She said that Sunday's walkouts were \"excessive and unfair to tens of thousands of travellers who have nothing to do with the disputes\".",
      "A spokesman for Verdi accepted that the strike would affect many, but said the travel disruption was necessary to extracting a better pay offer.",
      "Lars Stubbe, the union's Hamburg representative, told the BBC: \"The workers are aware that disruptions do happen, and they are uncomfortable with that, but in any case, it is the employer that caused these strikes because they haven't put a negotiable offer on the table.\"",
      "Many of Frankfurt Airport's 1,770 scheduled flights have already been cancelled, while the majority of Munich's 820 flights are expected to be cancelled.",
      "Hundreds more cancellations are anticipated across Stuttgart, Dusseldorf, Cologne and Berlin.",
      "Many passengers had already checked in their luggage and were having problems getting it returned, according to public broadcaster NDR.",
      "ADV, which represents major German airports, said the strike had \"almost completely paralysed air traffic\".",
      "Verdi's demands include an 8% pay rise, or at least \u20ac350 (\u00a3294) more per month, for all workers - and three extra days of holiday, plus one additional day for union members.",
      "Stubbe said that while airport wages range were above minimum wage, ranging from \u20ac13-\u20ac25 per hour, workers in different roles - particularly security staff - received less annual leave than others.",
      "\"There have been two rounds of negotiations in which the employers have not yet offered one penny,\" he added.",
      "\"It is quite usual that we don't get any offers in the first round, but now even in the second round, the employers have basically said, 'No, we're not going to give you an offer because we don't have any money'.\"",
      "BDLS, the body which sets security workers' pay, said in a statement: \"The damage caused by this strike is almost exclusively to companies that are not at the negotiating table.\"",
      "It called on the government to outlaw short-notice strikes, adding that air transport was \"essential for Germany as a business location\" which \"must not be exploited\" in collective pay disputes.",
      "Ralph Beisel, ADV's general manager, said the strike was having an impact on European and global air traffic, leading to missed connections due to a \"domino effect\".",
      "He called for reforms to German strike laws concerning \"critical\" infrastructure.",
      "The so-called \"warning strike\", an established tactic in German wage negotiations, concerns two separate pay disputes: one relating to airport security workers, and a broader disagreement over pay for federal and municipal government employees.",
      "Verdi has also called for strikes in waste collection across several German cities, including Berlin, Essen and Kiel, where bins have gone unemptied since last week.",
      "Pay talks for government workers are set to restart on Friday in Potsdam, while the next round of talks for airport security staff is scheduled to begin on 26 March.",
      "Niklas Benrath, of the VKA, which regulates pay and conditions for municipal workers, also criticised the strikes, saying Verdi's demands would cost nearly \u20ac15bn.",
      "\"With a total municipal debt of around \u20ac160bn, these demands are not financially viable,\" he added."

      "The son of an Afrikaner mother, he was best known for his politically charged plays challenging the racist system of apartheid.",
      "Paying tribute to Fugard, South Africa's Arts and Culture Minister Gayton McKenzie hailed him as \"a fearless storyteller who laid bare the harsh realities of apartheid through his plays\".",
      "\"We were cursed with apartheid, but blessed with great artists who shone a light on its impact and helped to guide us out of it. We owe a huge debt to this late, wonderful man,\" McKenzie added.",
      "Fugard wrote more than 30 plays in a career that spanned 70 years, making his mark with The Blood Knot in 1961.",
      "It was the first play in South Africa with a black and white actor - Fugard himself - performing in a front of a multiracial audience, before the apartheid regime  introduced laws prohibiting mixed casts and audiences.",
      "The Blood Knot catapulted Fugard onto the international stage - with the play shown in the US, and adapted for British television.",
      "The apartheid regime later confiscated his passport, but it strengthened Fugard's resolve to keep breaking racial barriers and exposing the injustices of apartheid.",
      "He went on to work with the Serpent Players, a group of black actors, and performed in black townships, despite harassment from the apartheid regime's security forces.",
      "Fugard's celebrated plays included Boesman and Lena, which looked at the difficult circumstances of a mixed-race couple. Having premiered in 1969, it was made into a film in 2000 starring Danny Glover and Angela Bassett.",
      "His novel, Tsotsi, was made into a film, winning the 2006 Oscar for best foreign language movie.",
      "The premier of South Africa's Western Cape province, Alan Winde, said that Fugard had a \"penetrating, sharp wit\", and his \"acute understanding of our country's political and cultural make-up is unmatched\".",
      "\"He will be sorely missed,\" Winde added.",
      "Other well-known plays by him include Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and The Island, which he co-wrote with the actors John Kani and Winston Ntshona, in a powerful condemnation of life on Robben Island, where anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela was imprisoned.",
      "In a simple tribute on X, Kani posted: \"I am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend Athol Fugard. May his soul rest in eternal peace. Elder \ud83c\udf39\"",
      "Fugard won several awards for his work, and received a lifetime achievement honour at the prestigious Tony awards in 2011, while Time magazine described him in the 1985 as the greatest active playwright in the English-speaking world.",
      "\"Apartheid defined me, that is true... But I am proud of the work that came out of it, that carries my name,\" Fugard told the AFP news agency in 1995.",
      "Fugard feared that the end of apartheid in 1994 could leave him with little to do, but he still found enough material to write.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2010, he said that he shared the view of the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu that \"we have lost our way\" as a nation.",

    "summary": "Police allege organised criminals planted the caravan to provoke fear of an antisemitic attack.",
    "story": [
      "A caravan found packed with explosives in outer Sydney earlier this year was part of a \"fabricated terrorism plot\" concocted by criminals, Australian police have said.",
      "The caravan, which was found in north-western Sydney on 19 January, contained enough explosives to produce a 40m-wide blast, along with a note displaying antisemitic messages and a list of Jewish synagogues.",
      "Its discovery, following a spate of antisemitic attacks in Australia, triggered widespread panic.",
      "But on Monday, Australian Federal Police (AFP) revealed that they knew \"almost immediately\" that the caravan was \"essentially a criminal con job\".",
      "AFP's deputy commissioner of national security, Krissy Barrett, said investigators within the New South Wales Joint Counter Terrorism Team believed that the caravan was \"part of a fabricated terrorism plot\".",
      "Authorities arrived at that belief based on information they already had, the ease with which they found the caravan and the visibility of the explosives contained inside \u2013 as well as the fact that there was no detonator.",
      "Yet police refrained from telling the public that they believed the plot was fake \"out of an abundance of caution\", as they continued to receive tip-offs about other related terror plots. They are now confident that these tip-offs were also fabricated, Ms Barrett said.",
      "The fake caravan plot involved several people with different levels of involvement, according to police. Between them, they had planned to purchase a caravan, load it with explosives and antisemitic materials and leave it in a specific location, before informing law enforcement about \"an impending terror attack against Jewish Australians\".",
      "Ms Barrett described it as \"an elaborate scheme contrived by organised criminals, domestically and from offshore\", adding that the leader of the plot maintained a distance and hired alleged local criminals to carry out parts of the operation.",
      "That individual is a known organised crime figure, Ms Barrett confirmed. She also added that while no arrests had been made in relation to the incident, police have a number of ongoing targets both in Australia and offshore.",
      "\"Too many criminals are accused of paying others to carry out antisemitic or terrorism incidents to get our attention or divert our resources,\" Ms Barrett said. She also noted that police believe \"the person pulling the strings wanted changes to their criminal status\".",
      "Criminals in these kinds of scenarios often leverage the exchange of information into law enforcement for some kind of personal gain, mostly around sentence reduction, Ms Barrett explained.",
      "BBC News contacted AFP for more details on the suspected agenda of those behind the caravan hoax, but received no further comment.",
      "\"Regardless of the motivation of those responsible for this fake plot, this has had a chilling effect on the Jewish community,\" Ms Barrett said in her statement.",

      "The former Bank of England governor chose to lean strongly into resisting Donald Trump's policies at his acceptance speech. He said the US president had brought \"dark days\" from \"a country we can no longer trust\" and that he was \"proud\" of Canadians resisting the US \"with their wallets\".",

      "He ridiculed Trump's allegations of Canada's involvement in fentanyl trade, and the US president's suggestion that Canada has ripped off the US.

      "Carney talks tough on Trump threat - but can he reset relations?",
      "How Britain's former top banker became Canada's next prime minister",
      "He follows in the footsteps of former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi as a former top central banker who became a G7 leader. It is an otherwise rare path, but it may be good timing when Canada's nearest neighbour has suggested using economic power to take over.",
      "Carney has experience in this area having dealt with a number of acute political-economic crises, such as the banking crash, the eurozone crisis, sterling's sharp slide after Brexit, and the start of the pandemic.",
      "He has also regularly attended G20 meetings at leader level, including in the presence of Trump, as chair of the Financial Stability Board, an international economic body. At one such meeting, the Trump team threatened to leave the International Monetary Fund.",
      "Carney believes that Trump only respects power. Of any attempt to mollify Trump, he said \"good luck with that\". He will focus further tariff retaliation on bringing inflation and interest rate rises to Canada's \"southern neighbour\".",
      "The Canadian election is due by October, but Carney might call an earlier one. Depending on that, he is on course to host Trump in Canada at the G7 Summit in June.",
      "His rise to the top job raises the stakes for the UK. On the one hand, a more robust approach from an allied G7 leader stands in contrast to the UK's attempt to hug the White House closely.",
      "On the other hand, Carney also hinted at wanting to diversify trade towards \"more reliable\" partners, which would include the UK and EU. Canada might send its subsidised energy to Europe, rather than the US.",
      "The bigger strategic point is that Carney's background means a focus on international solidarity, and defence of the existing multilateral system. He says Canada can \"stand on its own feet\" but sees merit in creating a more coherent international alliance to focus the minds of Congress and tariff-sceptics in the Trump administration.",
      "Canada's new leadership expects support from its Commonwealth ally, the UK. After my recent interview with him, Carney turned the camera to the portrait on the wall of the office from which he was talking to me: King Charles. The message was clear. Canada and the UK should be on the same side in this new world era."

A regional official described it as a well-planned attack carried out by \"remnants of the Assad militias\", with reports that about 4,000 men were involved.",
      "To curb the rebellion, the authorities sent reinforcements, who were also joined by militias who were not necessarily responding to the orders from Damascus. The operation turned into revenge killings of a sectarian nature: after decades of brutality under the Assads in the mainly Sunni country, many associate Alawites with the old regime.",
      "A widely shared video showed the bodies of at least two dozen men in civilian clothing, piled in the yard of a house, in the Alawite town of Mukhtareyah. Elsewhere, accounts emerged of fighters searching for Alawite members and killing entire families on the spot.",
      "According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, more than 1,300 people have been killed in Latakia, Tartous, Hama and Homs provinces, a number that includes 973 civilians and hundreds of members of the Syrian security forces and Assad loyalists. The information could not be independently verified.",
      "Sharaa's office announced the creation of an independent committee to investigate the clashes and killings by both sides, saying that he would hold to account anyone who overstepped their authority. \"No-one will be above the law,\" he said in a video speech.",
      "The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research group, said former Assad regime members were likely to form the most effective insurgent cells against Syria's new rulers with the ability to co-ordinate attacks.",
      "\"[They] already have pre-existing networks that they can leverage to rapidly organise insurgent cells. These networks are military, intelligence, and political networks and criminal syndicates who were regime supporters and lost significant economic and political influence in the aftermath of Assad's fall,\" a report said.",

      "Turkish-backed groups are clashing with Kurdish forces that control large areas in north-east, while Israeli troops are occupying parts of the country's south-west. The authorities have also faced resistance from Druze forces in the south, although a deal was reached last week.",
      "However, Sharaa's challenges go beyond the task of trying to keep the country safe. As Western suspicions over his intentions continue, the authorities are struggling to get crippling sanctions imposed on Syria under the former regime lifted, a vital move to revive the economy of a country where nine in every 10 people are in poverty.

      "Four main parties will contest the next election - the Liberals, the Conservatives, the New Democrats (NDP) and the Bloc Quebecois.",
      "The Liberals have been in power since 2015, when Trudeau was voted in. They currently hold 153 seats.",
      "The Conservatives are the official opposition with 120 seats.",
      "The Bloc Quebecois, which only runs candidates in the province of Quebec, has 33 seats, and the NDP has 24.",
      "The Green Party hold two seats.",
      "During the latter stages of Trudeau's premiership, opinion polls consistently showed the Conservatives with a strong lead.",
      "But the numbers tightened after Trudeau stepped down. Trump has since taken office in the US and introduced steep tariffs against Canada, which has raised expectations of a closer vote.",
      "What do the polls say?",
      "When Trudeau resigned at the beginning of this year, he did so under significant pressure from his own party - it was felt that his personal unpopularity was damaging the party's hopes of winning the next election.",
      "National polling averages, shared by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), show how support for the Liberals waned throughout 2023 and 2024.",
      "At the same time, support for the Conservatives soared. On 20 January of this year - the day of Trump's inauguration - the Conservatives were polling 44.8% while the Liberals were on 21.9%.",
      "Since then, polls suggest that support for the Liberals has ticked back up. The latest averages indicate that 40.4% of Canadians back the Conservatives, while 30.8% support the Liberals.",
      "In the process of regaining some support, the Liberals have attempted to draw comparisons between Poilievre and Trump in the aftermath of the US president introducing 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports to the country.",
      "After being announced as Trudeau's successor, Carney said regarding the trade war that  \"Americans should make no mistake... Canada will win\".",

      "All the seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs during an election.",
      "Members of the Senate, the upper chamber, are appointed and do not run for election.",
      "Like the UK, Canada has a \"first-past-the-post\" electoral system.",
      "The candidate who gets the most votes in each riding wins that seat and become an MP. They do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Other parties win nothing in that area.",
      "The leader of the party with the largest number of elected MPs will normally form the government. The second-placed party usually forms the official opposition.",
      "If no party ends up with a majority seats - the result is known as a hung parliament or a minority government. Practically, it means the party will not be able to pass legislation without the help of other parties.",
      "Who can vote?",
      "To vote in a Canadian election,  someone must be a Canadian citizen, at least 18 years old, and have proof of identity and address."

      "\"There were also some Syrians with them but not from the official security. Some civilians also were among those who carried out the killing,\" he added.",
      "Mr Fares said he saw families killed in their own homes, and women and children covered in blood. Some families ran to their rooftops to hide but were not spared the bloodshed. \"It is horrific,\" he said.",
      "The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights documented more than 740 civilians killed in the coastal cities of Latakia, Jableh and Banias. A further 300 members of the security forces and remnants of the Assad regime are reported to have died in clashes.",
      "The BBC has not been able to independently verify the death toll.",

      "Some of these individuals, especially among the police, had nothing to do with the killing during Assad's regime. The new authorities also dismissed thousands of public employees from their work.",
      "With 90% of Syria's population living below the poverty line and thousands left without an income, it's fertile ground for a rebellion.",
      "There is a split in views in Syria over what is happening. The wider community condemns the killing of any civilians and demonstrations have been organised in Damascus to mourn the deaths and condemn the violence.",
      "But over the past two days, there were also calls for \"Jihad\" in different parts of Syria. Residents in Banias said that along with the factions, there were some civilians who were armed and joined forces in the killing.",
      "Syria's majority Sunnis have faced atrocities at the hands of the Assad regime's forces over the past 13 years. This fuelled sectarian hatred mainly towards the Alawite minority, where members of the community are affiliated with war crimes.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla facilities across the US are facing protests and vandalism in response to the political role Elon Musk, who owns the car manufacturer, has played in the Trump administration.",
      "Most \"Tesla Takedown\" protests have been peaceful, but a few have been destructive with fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week.",
      "That was followed by six arrests in New York over the weekend when hundreds of protesters occupied a Tesla showroom.",
      "There has also been a spike in Cybertruck vandalism across the US, and some car owners are defacing their own Teslas in protest of Musk.",
      "One woman showed up to a protest outside a Burbank Tesla on Sunday with an expletive and Musk's name scrawled in chalk across her white Model X sedan. Another car carried an \"Anti Elon Tesla Club\" sticker.",
      "The protests illustrate a growing unease over Musk's influence on the US government since President Donald Trump allowed him to create the cost-cutting task force Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "So far, Doge has fired or offered buyouts to about 100,000 federal employees and gained access to the sensitive personal and financial information of millions of Americans.",
      "Critics have resorted to calling the tech billionaire \"President Musk\", arguing that he has too much power in the White House. Some at the protest in Burbank held signs that said \"Deport Elon\" and \"Boycott Swasticar\" - with protesters attempting to connect the car to fascism.",
      "Tesla produced the must-have electric cars for many Americans with progressive views, but several protesters said they regretted their purchase after Musk involved himself with Trump and US politics.",
      "Karen Rabwin, a protester at the Burbank Tesla on Sunday, attended just two days after trading in her Tesla for a Cadillac. She had slapped a bumper sticker on her old vehicle that read \"Bought This Car Before We Knew\" in a veiled reference to Musk, but she felt that wasn't enough.",
      "\"It was embarrassing,\" she said of driving the Tesla. \"It wasn't what I stood for. How could I drive that car? I have principles.\"",
      "Singer Sheryl Crow donated her Tesla to National Public Radio last month. She posted a video to Instagram waving goodbye to the car as it was towed away.",
      "\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,\" Ms Crow wrote.",
      "Musk has responded to the protests by sharing a video on X - the social media platform he owns - of a Cybertruck customer in Texas marvelling at the vehicle's full self-driving mode.",
      "\"Heartfelt thanks to everyone supporting Tesla, despite many attacks against our stores and offices,\" Musk wrote.",
      "The social media platform has many posts of Tesla owners showcasing their electric cars. But there are also now videos showing a growing trend of Cybertrucks vandalized with swastikas, used as skate ramps or covered in garbage.",
      "During Mardi Gras in New Orleans, spectators booed an orange Cybertruck and pelted it with beads, calling the futuristic looking vehicle a \"Deplorean\" or other unfriendly monikers.",
      "Protesters on Sunday said they want to take down Telsa's value because they are concerned that Mr Musk is damaging the economy and the the country - and their efforts may be having an effect.",
      "While Tesla's share price surged after Trump was elected - with Musk by his side on election night in Florida - they have tumbled back to pre-election levels following the  backlash to Musk's political involvement.",
      "Some on Sunday also raised concerns that Musk's government involvement is benefiting his businesses.",
      "Critics note that the tech entrepeneur's companies have billions of dollar of contracts with the US government, primarily with Nasa and the Defense Department, which are increasingly reliant on Musk's SpaceX for satellite launches and space exploration.",
      "Last week, reports claimed the Musk had attempted to get the Federal Aviation Administration to cancel a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon to revamp the agency's telecommunications system and awarding it to Starlink, a company owned by SpaceX, instead.",

    "summary": "Across India anxiety is growing about the early onset of summer and its impact on the economy.",
    "story": [
      "A shorter winter has literally left Nitin Goel out in the cold.",
      "For 50 years, his family's clothing business in India's northwestern textile city of Ludhiana has made jackets, sweaters and sweatshirts. But with the early onset of summer this year, the company is staring at a washout season and having to shift gears.",
      "\"We've had to start making t-shirts instead of sweaters as the winter is getting shorter with each passing year. Our sales have halved in the last five years and are down a further 10% during this season,\" Goel told the BBC. \"The only recent exception to this was Covid, when temperatures dropped significantly.\"",
      "Across India as cool weather beats a hasty retreat, anxieties are building up at farms and factories, with cropping patterns and business plans getting upended.",
      "Data from the Indian Meteorological Department shows that last month was India's hottest February in 125 years. The weekly average minimum temperature was also above normal by 1-3C in many parts of the country.",
      "Above-normal maximum temperatures and heatwaves are likely to persist over most parts of the country between March and May, the weather agency has warned.",
      "For small business owners like Goel, such erratic weather has meant much more than just slowing sales. His whole business model, practised and perfected over decades, has had to change.",
      "Goel's company supplies clothes to multi-brand outlets across India. And they are no longer paying him on delivery, he says, instead adopting a \"sale or return\" model where consignments not sold are returned to the company, entirely transferring the risk to the manufacturer.",
      "He has also had to offer bigger discounts and incentives to his clients this year.",
      "\"Big retailers haven't picked up goods despite confirmed orders,\" says Goel, adding that some small businesses in his town have had to shut shop as a result.",
      "Nearly 1,200 miles away in Devgad town on India's western coast, the heat has wreaked havoc on India's much-loved Alphonso mango orchards.",
      "\"Production this year would be only around 30% of the normal yield,\" said Vidyadhar Joshi, a farmer who owns 1,500 trees.",
      "The sweet, fleshy and richly aromatic Alphonso is a prized export from the region, but yields across the districts of Raigad, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri, where the variety is predominantly grown, are lower, according to Joshi.",
      "\"We might make losses this year,\" Joshi adds, because he has had to spend more than usual on irrigation and fertilisers in a bid to salvage the crop.",
      "According to him, many other farmers in the area were even sending labourers, who come from Nepal to work in the orchards, back home because there wasn't enough to do.",
      "Scorching heat is also threatening winter staples such as wheat, chickpea and rapeseed.",
      "While the country's agriculture minister has dismissed concerns about poor yields and predicted that India will have a bumper wheat harvest this year, independent experts are less hopeful.",
      "Heatwaves in 2022 lowered yields by 15-25% and \"similar trends could follow this year\", says Abhishek Jain of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (Ceew) think tank.",
      "India - the world's second largest wheat producer - will have to rely on expensive imports in the event of such disruptions. And its protracted ban on exports, announced in 2022, may continue for even longer.",
      "Economists are also worried about the impact of rising temperatures on availability of water for agriculture.",
      "Reservoir levels in northern India have already dropped to 28% of capacity, down from 37% last year, according to Ceew. This could affect fruit and vegetable yields and the dairy sector, which has already experienced a decline in milk production of up to 15% in some parts of the country.",
      "\"These things have the potential to push inflation up and reverse the 4% target that the central bank has been talking about,\" says Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist with Bank of Baroda.",
      "Food prices in India have recently begun to soften after remaining high for several months, leading to rate cuts after a prolonged pause.",
      "GDP in Asia's third largest economy has also been supported by accelerating rural consumption recently after hitting a seven-quarter low last year. Any setback to this farm-led recovery could affect overall growth, at a time when urban households have been cutting back and private investment hasn't picked up.",
      "Think tanks like Ceew say a range of urgent measures to mitigate the impact of recurrent heatwaves needs to be thought through, including better weather forecasting infrastructure, agriculture insurance and evolving cropping calendars with climate models to reduce risks and improve yields.",
      "As a primarily agrarian country, India is particularly vulnerable to climate change.",
      "Ceew estimates three out of every four Indian districts are \"extreme event hotspots\" and 40% exhibit what is called \"a swapping trend\" - which means traditionally flood-prone areas are witnessing more frequent and intense droughts and vice-versa.",
      "The country is expected to lose about 5.8% of daily working hours due to heat stress by 2030, according to one estimate. Climate Transparency, the advocacy group, had pegged India's potential income loss across services, manufacturing, agriculture and construction sectors from labour capacity reduction due to extreme heat at $159bn in 2021- or 5.4% of its GDP.",
      "Without urgent action, India risks a future where heatwaves threaten both lives and economic stability.",

      "The landslide at the Kiteezi dump last August killed 30 people, including his friend Sanya Kezia.",
      "\"I think some people are still underneath the garbage,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Many of them eked out a living by washing and selling whatever discarded items they found that still had value - anything from fishing nets to plastic bottles, glass jars and the components of old electronic devices.",
      "A blame-game erupted after the fatal collapse, with Kampala's city council and central government accusing each other of negligence, while some of the dead still languished under tonnes of rubbish without the dignity of a burial.",
      "When government tractors did eventually dig up Kezia's body, there were injuries to the 21-year-old's face.",
      "It was horrifying for his friend to see him enveloped by stinking, rotting waste.",
      "\"We're not safe here. Unless they [repair] it, maybe level it. Otherwise, people are not safe,\" says Mr Prince, who before becoming a rubbish-picker had been studying law at the Islamic University of Uganda.",
      "Unable to afford tuition fees after his family became financially unstable, his daily routine is now a far cry from libraries and lecture halls.",
      "Youth unemployment is at crisis levels in Uganda, and there are many like Mr Prince who often risk their health and abandon their dreams just to make a living.",
      "\"I come here to the dump in the morning, collect polythene bags, take them for washing and sell them,\" says Mr Prince. \"I make 10,000 shillings [equivalent to $2.70 or \u00a32.10] a day.\"",
      "The collapse has left him in further financial distress as he used to live by the side of the dump - but has had to move because of safety concerns.",
      "The houses of others were also destroyed during rescue operations.",
      "Compensation money has been paid to the families of those who died, but not to around 200 people who lost their homes, local authorities have admitted to the BBC.",
      "Officials are \"waiting for the valuation and budget allocation\", says Dr Sarah Karen Zalwango, the new head of public health and the environment at the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA).",
      "Some argue that the Kiteezi collapse was inevitable because basic common sense was ignored.",
      "\"You can't take four million people, get all that waste, mingled - degradable and non-degradable - and take it to one dumping site. No, that's not how we [ought to] do it. But we've been doing it for over 20 years,\" Frank Muramuzi, a Kampala-based urban planner, tells the BBC.",
      "The Kiteezi landfill was built in 1996, with financing from the World Bank, to provide a single, major depository for solid waste generated by Kampala.",
      "As Kampala has grown, so too has its biggest rubbish dump.",
      "On the northern edge of the city, it now covers 15 hectares (37 acres) - an area the size of more than 22 football pitches - with its stench spreading further still.",
      "Birds of prey can be seen flying overhead.",
      "The city's residents and businesses generate an estimated 2,500 tonnes of waste every day, half of which ends up in dumping sites across the city - the biggest being Kiteezi.",
      "But the problem is that Kiteezi lacks the on-site recycling, sorting and incineration facilities that landfills are supposed to have.",
      "\"With each layer of trash piled up, the bottom layers become weaker, especially as the decay and decomposition of organic waste increases the temperature,\" Mr Muramuzi explains.",
      "\"Without vents, methane and other gases remain trapped at the bottom, further multiplying the fragility of the loosely held structure.\"",
      "Yet this can easily be fixed, he adds, so long as the government commits to periodic monitoring and audits which factor in environmental, social and economic needs.",
      "Had that already been in place, \"the havoc that happened in Kiteezi would have been avoided\", he says.",
      "So, if the solution is this simple, why is it not already happening?",
      "The answer seems to be a combination of power struggles and financial mismanagement.",
      "Ultimate responsibility for keeping Kampala \"clean, habitable, and sustainable environment\" lies with the KCCA, but Mayor Erias Lukwago, from the opposition Forum for Democratic Change party, says his office lacks the necessary power to enact the changes.",
      "The KCCA says it has repeatedly proposed plans to decommission Kiteezi but says the funds needed to do so - $9.7m - exceed the city's budget and have not been made available by central government.",
      "\"All the support we have been getting is courtesy of development partners and donors like Bill and Melinda Gates, GIZ, and WaterAid\u2026 but their capacity is very limited,\" the Kampala mayor said recently.",
      "\"If we were getting adequate funding from the central government, we would be very far right now.\"",
      "There is no word from the government on whether it will allocate funds for Kampala's biggest dump.",
      "It did pay $1,350 to each of the families of the deceased, saying any further money would only be forthcoming if government agencies were \"found to be responsible\".",
      "A month later, a report furnished by the country's police and crime investigation department led to President Yoweri Museveni - a noted political opponent of Kampala's mayor - sacking three senior KCCA officials, including the authority's executive and public health directors.",
      "James Bond Kunobere, Kampala's solid waste management officer, admits that last year's deadly collapse was a much-needed wake-up call.",
      "At present, the authorities in the Ugandan capital are drafting plans to turn organic waste into compost and reduce \"unnecessary waste\" coming into the city.",
      "But they want the public to take some responsibility too. At the moment people pay one of the seven private waste firms operating in Kampala to collect their rubbish, which is all bundled together with little thought given to recycling.",
      "\"We haven't changed the mindset of residents to sort waste,\" Mr Kunobere tells the BBC.",

    "story": [
      "Gurpreet Singh was handcuffed, his legs shackled and a chain tied around his waist. He was led on to the tarmac in Texas by US Border Patrol, towards a waiting C-17 military transport aircraft.",
      "It was 3 February and, after a months-long journey, he realised his dream of living in America was over. He was being deported back to India. \"It felt like the ground was slipping away from underneath my feet,\" he said.",
      "Gurpreet, 39, was one of thousands of Indians in recent years to have spent their life savings and crossed continents to enter the US illegally through its southern border, as they sought to escape an unemployment crisis back home.",
      "There are about 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US, the third largest group behind Mexicans and El Salvadoreans, according to the most recent figures from Pew Research in 2022.",
      "Now Gurpreet has become one of the first undocumented Indians to be sent home since President Donald Trump took office, with a promise to make mass deportations a priority.",
      "Gurpreet intended to make an asylum claim based on threats he said he had received in India, but - in line with an executive order from Trump to turn people away without granting them asylum hearings - he said he was removed without his case ever being considered.",
      "About 3,700 Indians were sent back on charter and commercial flights during President Biden's tenure, but recent images of detainees in chains under the Trump administration have sparked outrage in India.",
      "US Border Patrol released the images in an online video with a bombastic choral soundtrack and the warning: \"If you cross illegally, you will be removed.\"",
      "\"We sat in handcuffs and shackles for more than 40 hours. Even women were bound the same way. Only the children were free,\" Gurpreet told the BBC back in India. \"We weren't allowed to stand up. If we wanted to use the toilet, we were escorted by US forces, and just one of our handcuffs was taken off.\"",
      "Opposition parties protested in parliament, saying Indian deportees were given \"inhuman and degrading treatment\". \"There's a lot of talk about how Prime Minister Modi and Mr Trump are good friends. Then why did Mr Modi allow this?\" said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, a key opposition leader.",
      "Gurpreet said: \"The Indian government should have said something on our behalf. They should have told the US to carry out the deportation the way it's been done before, without the handcuffs and chains.\"",
      "An Indian foreign ministry spokesman said the government had raised these concerns with the US, and that as a result, on subsequent flights, women deportees were not handcuffed and shackled.",
      "But on the ground, the intimidating images and President Trump's rhetoric seem to be having the desired effect, at least in the immediate aftermath.",
      "\"No-one will try going to the US now through this illegal 'donkey' route while Trump is in power,\" said Gurpreet.",
      "In the longer term, this could depend on whether there are continued deportations, but for now many of the Indian people-smugglers, locally called \"agents\", have gone into hiding, fearing raids against them by Indian police.",
      "Gurpreet said Indian authorities demanded the number of the agent he had used when he landed back home, but the smuggler could no longer be reached.",
      "\"I don't blame them, though. We were thirsty and went to the well. They didn't come to us,\" said Gurpreet.",
      "While the official headline figure puts the unemployment rate at only 3.2%, it conceals a more precarious picture for many Indians. Only 22% of workers have regular salaries, the majority are self-employed and nearly a fifth are \"unpaid helpers\", including women working in family businesses.",
      "\"We leave India only because we are compelled to. If I got a job which paid me even 30,000 rupees (\u00a3270/$340) a month, my family would get by. I would never have thought of leaving,\" said Gurpreet, who has a wife, a mother and an 18-month-old baby to look after.",
      "\"You can say whatever you want about the economy on paper, but you need to see the reality on the ground. There are no opportunities here for us to work or run a business.\"",
      "Gupreet's trucking company was among the cash-dependent small businesses that were badly hit when the Indian government withdrew 86% of the currency in circulation with four hours notice. He said he didn't get paid by his clients, and had no money to keep the business afloat. Another small business he set up, managing logistics for other companies, also failed because of the Covid lockdown, he said.",
      "He said he tried to get visas to go to Canada and the UK, but his applications were rejected.",
      "Then he took all his savings, sold a plot of land he owned, and borrowed money from relatives to put together 4 million rupees ($45,000/\u00a336,000) to pay a smuggler to organise his journey, Gurpreet told us.",
      "On 28 August 2024, he flew from India to Guyana in South America to start an arduous journey to the US.",
      "Gurpreet pointed out all the stops he made on a map on his phone. From Guyana he travelled through Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, mostly by buses and cars, partly by boat, and briefly on a plane - handed from one people-smuggler to another, detained and released by authorities a few times along the way.",
      "From Colombia, smugglers tried to get him a flight to Mexico, so he could avoid crossing the dreaded Dari\u00e9n Gap. But Colombian immigration didn't allow him to board the flight, so he had to make a dangerous trek through the jungle.",
      "A dense expanse of rainforest between Colombia and Panama, the Dari\u00e9n Gap can only be crossed on foot, risking accidents, disease and attacks by criminal gangs. Last year, 50 people died making the crossing.",
      "\"I was not scared. I've been a sportsman so I thought I would be OK. But it was the toughest section,\" said Gurpreet. \"We walked for five days through jungles and rivers. In many parts, while wading through the river, the water came up to my chest.\"",
      "Each group was accompanied by a smuggler - or a \"donker\" as Gurpreet and other migrants refer to them, a word seemingly derived from the term \"donkey route\" used for illegal migration journeys.",
      "At night they would pitch tents in the jungle, eat a bit of food they were carrying and try to rest.",
      "\"It was raining all the days we were there. We were drenched to our bones,\" he said. They were guided over three mountains in their first two days. After that, he said they had to follow a route marked out in blue plastic bags tied to trees by the smugglers.",
      "\"My feet had begun to feel like lead. My toenails were cracked, and the palms of my hands were peeled off and had thorns in them. Still, we were lucky we didn't encounter any robbers.\"",
      "When they reached Panama, Gurpreet said he and about 150 others were detained by border officials in a cramped jail-like centre. After 20 days, they were released, he said, and from there it took him more than a month to reach Mexico, passing through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala.",
      "Gurpreet said they waited for nearly a month in Mexico until there was an opportunity to cross the border into the US near San Diego.",
      "\"We didn't scale a wall. There is a mountain near it which we climbed over. And there's a razor wire which the donker cut through,\" he said.",
      "Gurpreet entered the US on 15 January, five days before President Trump took office - believing that he had made it just in time, before the borders became impenetrable and rules became tighter.",
      "Once in San Diego, he surrendered to US Border Patrol, and was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).",
      "During the Biden administration, illegal or undocumented migrants would appear before an immigration officer who would do a preliminary interview to determine if each person had a case for asylum. While a majority of Indians migrated out of economic necessity, some also left fearing persecution because of their religious or social backgrounds, or their sexual orientation.",
      "If they cleared the interview, they were released, pending a decision on granting asylum from an immigration judge. The process would often take years, but they were allowed to remain in the US in the meantime.",
      "This is what Gurpreet thought would happen to him. He had planned to find work at a grocery store and then to get into trucking, a business he is familiar with.",
      "Instead, less than three weeks after he entered the US, he found himself being led towards that C-17 plane and going back to where he started.",
      "In their small house in Sultanpur Lodhi, a city in the northern state of Punjab, Gurpreet is now trying to find work to repay the money he owes, and fend for his family.",

    "summary": "Stars like Charli XCX have made see-through outfits all the rage at big events, but not everyone's a fan.",
    "story": [
      "Six months ago, a viral TikTok trend made us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks.",
      "At the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.",
      "She used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said. \"I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"",
      "The nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress.",
      "The love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo.",
      "At Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath.",
      "Rapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show.",
      "Naked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too.",
      "As Vogue wrote in January: \"For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season.\"",
      "Dior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes.",
      "Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as \"demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes\".",
      "The trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing \"a strappy white top with no bra\".",
      "Sheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again.",
      "The trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The \"free the nipple\" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014.",
      "Charli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. \"Stop policing women's bodies,\" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so \"why is society judging?\"",
      "But many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance.",
      "\"Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,\" one person wrote on social media.",
      "'Challenging fashion norms'",
      "Fashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a \"provocative statement\", but says it's a \"way to reclaim the right to govern one's body\".",
      "The controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds.",
      "Abhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend \"is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion\".",
      "The idea of freeing the nipple \"isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms\", he argues.",
      "\"Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers.\"",
      "It seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars.",
      "Shock value is surely a factor for some, too, though.",
      "At Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty.",
      "There were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress.",
      "\"This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,\" the New York Times noted.",
      "However, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because \"it's only women who do this\".",
      "\"It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,\" she wrote.",
      "Some men have been embracing the nearly naked trend, though. In 2022, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wore striking a backless red top at Venice Film Festival, and at the 2023 Grammys Harry Styles freed the nipple in a plunge harlequin jumpsuit.",
      "It's the women who will continue to cause more of a stir on runways and red carpets - and society will still be split on whether it's redefining conventional notions of modesty in fashion, a product of misogyny, or simply seeking attention.",
      "Brit Awards prompt 825 complaints about music stars to Ofcom",

The Broadway version is a stand-in for the city's corroded grandeur, and for the studio where, in 1996, a group of old, mostly forgotten Cuban musicians recorded the album.",
      "Justin Cunningham, as Juan de Marcos: \"What follows is the story of a band. Not ours, though we will do our best. Some of what follows is true. Some of it only feels true.\"",
      "The true part: the real person this actor is playing, Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, had already located and brought together the old musicians before music producers Ry Cooder and Nick Gold showed up in Havana. When their plan to make an album pairing Cuban and West African performers fell through, they went with Plan B, and recorded with the group Juan de Marcos had assembled.",
      "\"I was so happy, because they were my idols,\" Juan said. \"You know, I grew up with, you know, listening to their music. And then suddenly, I was the bandleader.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did any of the people involved, including you, have any idea that what became 'Buena Vista Social Club' would be something big?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"They became pop stars. It was like an unbelievable thing.\"",
      "The unexpected and irresistible phenomenon that resulted is the subject of the Oscar-nominated 1999 Wim Wenders documentary.",
      "\"It was just ubiquitous; I mean, you would hear this music everywhere,\" said music journalist and Substack contributor Judy Cantor-Navas, the author of \"Cuba on Record.\" \"To say that, 'Yes, we're listening to this old Cuban music that is suddenly selling millions of albums,' seemed like something that was very unlikely.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think people loved the music so much?\"",
      "\"Cuban music has really appealed to so many different kinds of people,\" said Cantor-Navas. \"They say that it has, you know, the perfect combination of the Afro-Cuban rhythms and the Spanish melodies that came together in Cuba. It's just this very infectious music that, like, gets in your soul.\"",
      "It wasn't just the music they loved. It was who the musicians were \u2013 the improbable last act of their careers. The album won a Grammy, and has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"And they were so happy, you know, because they came back to the stage,\" said Juan de Marcos. \"Because if you are a musician, and you are an artist, you are always an artist, you know? And even when you're retired, you have this small candle in your heart.\"",
      "Singer-dancer Omara Portuondo was 67; singer Ibrahim Ferrer was 70. Other band members were as old as 90. They began touring the world, even singing to me for a \"Sunday Morning\" story 25 years ago. \"I still have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not asleep and dreaming,\" Ferrer said then. \"I never thought I'd have so much success.\"",
      "From the archives: Buena Vista Social Club on its U.S. tour (2000)",
      "The play tells the imagined origin story of the musicians, their careers, and their personal struggles, with hints of romance, decades before their fame late in life.",
      "Marco Ramirez wrote the Broadway show. \"I'm Cuban American. I was born and raised in Miami, but my parents and my family's Cuban,\" he said. \"And so, for me what brought me to this was the music. It was music that I was raised around my entire life.",
      "He was 14 when the album came out: \"This was a moment of intense pride, of us realizing that the world cared about our music, and that these songs that I was used to hearing on my grandfather's little yellow Sony boom box above the washing machine, these were songs that suddenly the whole world cared about. That meant everything to me.\"",
      "Saheem Ali, the director of the show, grew up in Kenya. His father, an airline pilot, brought the album home. He became obsessed with it. \"I kept listening to it on repeat,\" he said. \"Something about the lyrics spoke to me. I learned the lyrics without knowing what I was talking about, 'cause Swahili's my first language.",
      "\"I knew nothing about their stories, absolutely nothing. The first time I knew about the stories was reading Marco's script. That's what excited me about this musical. People are gonna know about them now in a way that young people like me never had a chance to.\"",

It was shut down after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. The events of the Cuban Revolution lurk at the edges of the show.",
      "Playing yesterday's Cuban music on Broadway are some of today's finest Cuban musicians, most of whom now live outside Cuba, because making a living there is tough.",
      "Juan de Marcos said, \"The people going to see the real Cuba, they are going to get a piece of our country when they attend the musical. We have nothing in our country. We don't have oil, we don't have gold, but we have the music, beautiful ladies, good coffee, the best cigars, and the best rum. And the music, which is the most important thing, like food for us.\"",

Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch, saw its revenue fall by more than 10% after the campaign was released.",
      "\"It took a lot to not feel guilty about that experience because I felt like it was my fault.

      "\"Now, I don't know if you've been following the news but I've been keeping my ears open, and it seems like everyone everywhere is super-mad about everything all the time.\"",
      "But for his new job, the stand-up is sitting down. Mulaney is hosting a talk show on Netflix, complete with a couch and celebrity guests. And the whole thing is live, in part because he likes it better that way. \"It feels like there's more at stake,\" he said. \"I love that. It's the best.\"",
      "I asked, \"Explain that feeling \u2013 it's like coming up against a cliff and kind of dangling over it?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"It's dangling over it all the time.\"",
      "It began as an experiment during the Netflix Comedy Festival last year, called \"Everybody's in L.A.,\" talking about \"L.A. things,\" like earthquakes and coyotes. Now the show is back with a broader focus, and a new name, \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney.\" It will go live every Wednesday night, starting this week. \"It's a fun feeling to know that hopefully a lot of people are watching,\" he said, \"and it's live, globally, with no delays, and you could really damage your career!\"",
      "To watch a teaser for \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney,\" click on the video player below:",
      "And he knows all about live TV. For Mulaney, \"Saturday Night Live\" is home turf. He started as a writer there in 2008, and helped create some of the show's biggest characters, like Bill Hader's Stefon. Mulaney would often change the script at the last second to throw Hader off, like during this Halloween skit:",
      "Stefon: \"Have you heard of Blacula, the Black Dracula? Well, they have a Jewish Dracula.\"Seth Meyers: \"Oh, what's his name?\"Stefon: \"Sidney Applebaum!\"",
      "Seems like this was the thing John Mulaney was born to do. Raised in Chicago, Mulaney says he grew up feeling that comedy was his destiny. Asked if he has a memory of when he realized that he was funny, Mulaney said, \"Always interesting in these things, 'cause you don't want to sound egotistical, but I don't remember a time when I didn't think I was funny.\"",
      "Not long after graduating from Georgetown, he joined \"SNL,\" and a career was launched. He made his mark in New York, but he's fascinated with Southern California, where he now lives year-round.",
      "He took us record shopping at one of his favorite places, the legendary Amoeba Music in Hollywood.",
      "I asked, \"When you come out to places like this, do people come up to you? Or do they leave you alone?\"",
      "\"A little bit,\" he said. \"My joke is that I'm like Louis Farrakhan: I mean a lot to a small group of people.\"",
      "Truth is, Mulaney is a lot bigger than he'll admit. In his most recent special, \"Baby J,\" he played to a sold-out crowd and focused on his drug addiction, and recovery. He describes a 2020 intervention on his behalf staged by friends like Seth Meyers and Fred Armisen: \"Let me just call this out now, I don't mean to be weird, it was a star-studded intervention.\"",
      "It's funny now, of course: Mulaney says he's been clean for more than four years.",
      "Asked if sobriety is something he thinks about every day, Mulaney replied, \"Well, that's a good question. I don't think about cocaine, opioids, and benzodiazeprine every day. I'll acknowledge that I understand the vigilance I need. I do not think about it every day. I just don't. I do think about the ways that I can lead my life to perhaps never feel the kind of strain that got me there. So, yeah, sobriety maybe being, like, a bigger term than just abstaining from the chemicals, I definitely think about it every day.\"",
      "Mulaney credits his wife, actress Olivia Munn, with helping him navigate his recovery. You might remember her from Aaron Sorkin's \"The Newsroom,\" or \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" in which she played Psylocke. But she's a bit of a superhero in real life as well; she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023, and has shared her whole journey online, from the initial test to a double mastectomy. Other women have since credited her with saving their lives.",
      "Mulaney said, \"There's this lifetime risk assessment test that is really the only reason her cancer was discovered. And seeing so many women publicly and privately come to her that [say] they discovered how high their risk was from that, it's astonishing.\"",
      "She's also mom to their two young children, Malcom and Mei. \"I have this feeling a lot of times, I go, 'I can't believe I know this person, let alone am married to her,'\" he said.",
      "Fatherhood has given him not only new material, but also a whole new outlook on life.",
      "From his November 2024 monologue on \"Saturday Night Live\":",
      "\"My wife and I just welcomed a baby girl into our family. \u2026 My wife takes care of the five-week-old, and I take the two-year-old out. And that's not fair. That's not an equal distribution of labor at all. Saying, 'You have a five-week-old, I'll take a two-year-old,' that's like saying, 'I'll transport this convict across state lines. You hold a potato.'\"",
      "John Mulaney has made a good life making people laugh. Now, as a husband and father of two, he says he has something to live for.",
      "Asked how fatherhood has changed how he looks at the world, Mulaney replied, \"I'm in the world now that I'm a father. My head was my only home before that. When my son was born, the first thought I had was, I went, 'Oh, there you are.' And when my daughter was born, I had this \u2013 not to sound 'woo-woo' or anything \u2013 but when she was born, I went, 'Oh!' My thought was like, 'Oh, we've met before. I've collided with you some other time.' So, it's like these people came in that just, I don't know, make me like the world a lot more.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lindsey-vonn-on-skiing-the-comeback-trail/",
    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 09:58:42 -0400",
    "summary": "In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. Fast, fearless and resilient, Lindsey Vonn fought her way back after every crash, until she retired at 34. But now, with a titanium knee replacement, she is eyeing one more trip to the Olympics.",
    "story": [
      "For Lindsey Vonn, it was a reluctant farewell \u2013 the last run of her stellar career, at the Alpine World Ski Championships in Are, Sweden, in 2019. In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. She's won almost every major title, from World Cup Championships to Olympic medals, as the trophy case in her home proves.",
      "She says when she's racing, she doesn't think about the achievements: \"I think you just have a different perspective. You're focused on the next one, racing and performance, and you never really get to look back and say, 'Hey, good job,' you know?\"",
      "She was fast, reaching speeds of up to 85 mph. She was also fearless, and resilient. Crash after terrible crash, she always fought her way back. But 2013 was one of her hardest seasons. Vonn's right knee bore the brunt of a crash in the World Cup Super-G, and it was never the same. Flash forward almost six years, on the day of her last race \u2013 bum knee and all \u2013 she still managed to take home the bronze.",
      "At 34, Lindsey Vonn was retired.",
      "\"Skiing was always my sun, and everything in my life revolved around it: What time I woke up, what I ate, when I went to bed. It was all dictated around what's best for my skiing career,\" she said. \"And then, I woke up one day and my sun is gone.\"",
      "Ski racing is all Vonn ever wanted. Her dad, a former alpine skier himself, moved the family from Minnesota to Vail, Colorado, just so that Lindsey could train for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Those same slopes she now sees from her home in Park City, Utah.",
      "\"This is kind of just where I go to, you know, re-group and recharge my batteries,\" she said. \"And the dogs love it.\"",
      "In retirement, Vonn has kept many of her corporate sponsors, which helped her buy homes in Miami and Beverly Hills. She continued to wow red carpets, and not racing gave her more time to pour into her foundation, helping under-served girls achieve their own athletic dreams.",
      "But that knee kept getting worse. \"I just couldn't do the things I love to do anymore,\" she said. \"It was really bad. I couldn't straighten it all the way. I couldn't flex it all the way. And so, I was just stuck in this half-state that ended up causing hip pain, back pain, neck pain. It wasn't just my knee, unfortunately. It was kind of everything. It's like you get to the end of your rope and you gotta make a decision. So, I did.\"",
      "A knee replacement \u2013 the outer portion of her right knee is now titanium.",
      "But she didn't do it just to get back into skiing. \"I don't need to ski,\" she said. \"I am Lindsey. I am not a skier; I'm a person that loves to ski. And that's a really big distinction for me, in my mind, in my heart.\"",
      "I asked, \"How soon afterwards did you wonder how far you could push it?\"",
      "\"It was pretty quickly after!\" she laughed.",
      "Only four months, in fact. She took her coaches to New Zealand to acquaint her new knee with her old sport. \"It just was such a drastic difference that I thought, well, if I can do all of these things that used to hurt me before, where would that take me? And my mind starts to wander, and here we are.\"",
      "And where she is, is back on the U.S. ski team, hoping to qualify for one more trip to the Olympics: Italy 2026.",
      "\"I will be at a disadvantage,\" Vonn said. \"I am 40, and at that time next year I will be 41. But I know my skiing is there. I think I'm actually skiing better now than I was last few years of my career.\"",
      "She admits there has been some good-natured ribbing: \"For sure. There's one girl that calls me Grandma, which I don't exactly appreciate! But there's definitely some jokes around the team that, you know, I raced in my first Olympics before one of the girls was born.\"",
      "She knew there would be some raised eyebrows, but she got more than that, with some critics going so far as to question her sanity. \"These past few weeks have been tough,\" she posted on Instagram last month. \"I know they are only a few voices out of many\u2026 But it still hurts.\"",
      "A post shared by L I N D S E Y  \u2022  V O N N (@lindseyvonn)",
      "She told us, \"What I didn't expect was people to criticize me as a person and why I'm doing it, and that I can't handle life outside of ski racing.\"",
      "She dismisses most of it, choosing to concentrate on training smarter, not harder. \"It's not like I'm preparing for another ten years of my skiing career,\" she said. \"I'm just preparing for one year, for literally two races.\"",
      "She's put the rest of her life on hold for the moment \u2013 a single goal does require a singularity of focus, much like making her banana bread does. And there's a purpose to that: \"I need to put on weight, man,\" she said. \"I'm about 20 pounds less than when I was racing before.\"",
      "That brand of determination, she says, came from her mom, Lindy Lund. \"She would have given anything to play tennis, to play squash, to ride a bike, and she couldn't,\" Vonn said.",
      "Her mom suffered a stroke while pregnant with Lindsey in 1984. It was debilitating, but she soldiered on without complaint. When she was diagnosed with ALS (once known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), she \u2013 like her daughter \u2013 wasn't about to give up. \"She thought that she could beat the odds, and she could be the one that would live 20 more years, and she lasted one,\" Vonn said. \"Man, it was hard. I still got her number in my phone. I still message her.\"",
      "She said her mom would want her to be flying high once again, even though winning another downhill will be an uphill battle. In a sport measured in hundredths of a second, the difference between first and last can be miniscule. But on this second go-around, Lindsey Vonn is taking time to savor the view just as much as the chase.",
      "\"The fact that I'm even talking about going to the Olympics right now is something I never thought I would ever do,\" she said. \"So, I'm already winning!\"",

      "Daffodils",
      "Sprouting in beautiful shades of yellow, orange, peach, white, cream, and even pink, daffodils\u2014known by their botanical name Narcissus\u2014are an early sign that spring has sprung.",
      "Some tried-and-true cultivars are the 'Golden Ducat', 'Rip Van Winkle', and 'Petit Four'\u2014all examples of the double daffodil, featuring one or more flowers to a stem. Another common variety is the trumpet daffodil, which has a center that is as long or longer than its petals. Large-cupped daffodils are defined by their prominent cups, while small-cup iterations have short cups that are less than one-third the length of the petals.",
      "Don't worry about recognizing all the different varieties; just choose what you like from your local garden center or online resource. Because no matter the type, daffodils (and other small bulbs) are so rewarding. The blooms last for two or three weeks in the garden and bring such color to your landscape. They are also low maintenance.",
      "Here are some tips to help you make the most of these perennial crowd-pleasers.",
      "Daffodils are winter-hardy in zones 3 through 8 and will return to bloom again year after year so long as they are planted in full or partial sun and in any soil that's not soggy.If your goal is to have drifts of daffodils, include varieties recommended for naturalizing and forming carpets on lawns and into woodlands. That way, the 100 bulbs you plant this fall will gradually multiply to 300, then 600, then 1,000, and so on.When planting en masse, it helps to create a planting \"map\" in advance on paper that can be transferred onto the ground with granular lime, as Martha does (see photo).Daffodil bulbs should be planted about two to three times as deep as the bulbs are high, so if you have one that's 2 inches tall, plant it 4 to 6 inches below the top of the soil.When harvesting for arrangements, grasp the stem at the base and pull rather than cutting, as viruses in bulbs can be passed along to other plants when using pruners to trim stems.Don't cut back daffodils too soon. Once the flowers bloom and fade, allow the whole plant to die back to the ground to create food for the bulbs so they can multiply.After removing spent foliage, apply a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer over the entire area, and then add a layer of mulch. Fertilize the area again in the fall.",

      "It is nowhere you chose to be, and yet here you are. Papa steers your shoulders into the heart of the jack drive. Hundreds of rabbits stare at you through the wire around the fence posts. It feels like looking into the mirror. They do not want to be in this story either. Men have been working since dawn to herd the wild jacks into this pen. The town has gathered to solve the problem of the rabbits, who chew through rangeland and cropland, who eat the golden wheat your papa turns into money. Worse than the locusts, says Papa. Every hide brings a penny bounty. So many turnipy sweating bodies and a festive feeling in the air like a penny rubbed between two fingers, like blood shocked into a socket. A smell that reminds you of the room where babies are born. When you try to turn and run away, Papa grabs you. There's Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Waldowko, Mr. Zalewski, Mrs. Haage. You can't remember any more names. A hundred jointed arms come swinging into the pen that is alive with jackrabbits, the place of no escape. Now there is only madness. Terror of cudgels, terror of ax handles and hammers, terror of being trampled. \"Papa! Help! Stop!\" Rabbits run over your feet. \"Settle down, Harp\u2014\u00ad \" Papa is angry. He pours your name over your head like scalding water. The rabbits are angry. The rabbits are crying and dying, the clubs coming down, down, down. \"If you ain't gonna help, stay clear of us, boy\u2014\u00ad \" You are six today. Your family will have a party after supper. The cake was cooling when you left for town. You feel sick thinking about it. Cherries come slopping out of the rabbits. Gray skins are splitting, slipping under bootheels and wooden bats. Papa shows you what to target: the skulls and the spines of the screaming jacks. It's the fastest way to stop their screaming. There is another way, a voice cries out inside you. Smash it flat. You watch Papa click into his rhythm and begin to kill alongside the rest of the men.",
      "You meet your baby sister's gaze through the fan of her clean fingers. Lada is sitting on your mother's lap. Three girls you know are watching from outside the fence. The girls are allowed to squeal and shield their faces. You wish you were a girl with them. Down, down, down come the clubs and the planks. Your stomach bulges and flattens. You are screaming with the rabbits. Your birthday wish is to get to the end of this sound. Quiet comes at last. The men's arms rest against their sides like tools in a shed. Women are hanging the dead jacks to dry by their long ears. Every twitching rabbit's foot has stilled. Inside of you, the screaming continues. It goes on and on and on. Papa finds you where you have hidden your eyes behind your hands, your tears inside your palms. \"We can't let the jacks overrun the whole prairie. No one likes it, Son.\" This is a lie. Many had liked it. You shut your eyes along with the dead rabbits, because you did not want to see whose faces were smiling.",
      "\"Here,\" says Papa. \"One is still living. You cannot be softhearted, Harp.\"",
      "Your father puts the club in your hands. And after that, you are always afraid.",

      "An Oprah's Book Club pick, Eric Puchner's \"Dream State\" (Doubleday) is a sweeping saga that explores how choices \u2013 big and small \u2013 shape lives and families for decades.",
      "It starts, very charmingly, with the planning for a wedding at a summer house in Montana. Cece is about to marry Charlie, but then Charlie's best friend shows up, and their plans veer off in ways nobody expects.",

      "By the time it occurred to Cece that her mother was dying, she was dead. Even then, it seemed like possibly a mistake, like there was no way in hell her mother would have agreed to it. Cece hunched through the memorial service, unable to speak or move or smile. People hugged her, one after another, a series of random blows. At the national cemetery, she stood on the perfect lawn rolling down to a smudge of ocean in the distance, the tombstones a run of dominoes waiting to be tipped, feeling like she'd been beamed to an alien planet. She could not fathom her own fingers. It was a military burial, with guards of honor and a flag-folding ceremony and a lone bugler playing \"Taps.\" The long, sorrowful notes floated over the cemetery, turning everything into the tragic plot point in a movie: the gravesites and their wilting flowers, the guards of honor frozen like statues, the hole in the ground where her mother would be lowered and transformed into a skeleton. Such was the grace and beauty of the bugler's playing that Cece, returning to Earth for a moment, couldn't help being moved. It seemed to give form to the precious void inside her. Then the bugler stopped in midnote, as if he'd forgotten what song he was performing. He turned red with embarrassment. Finally, he took the bugle from his lips and shook it, and it played the lost note for a second, as if possessed by a ghost. It wasn't a real instrument at all, Cece realized, but a stereo made to look like one. The thing had run out of charge. A couple of the mourners giggled. Cece glanced behind her, startled. Later, in the middle of the eulogy, the bugle began playing again from its case.",
      "Strangeness and sorrow. Strangeness and sorrow. Cece went back to school, amazed that her life still existed.\u00a0My mother is dead,\u00a0she told herself, over and over, not immune to its dramatic value. It was precisely this sense of being in a play or a movie that made her death feel temporary. At any minute the play would end and her mother would be alive again, taking her to the beach like she used to every weekend; Cece would massage her head while they watched stupid shows together, dizzy with the smell of sweat and jojoba oil. (That smell! When Cece was little, she used to suck on her mother's hair, put strands of it in her mouth.) Cece missed her so much it howled through her like a wind. She stopped eating. On the soccer field she stood there shivering, staring at the grass. Her friends, understanding at first, eventually gave up on her, stopped asking her to parties and the Galleria, to bonfires at the beach. When her father wasn't home, Cece sometimes sneaked into his room and stripped the mattress, gazing at the orphaned sweat stain, pale as a shadow, where her mother used to sleep.",
      "Once, the phone rang and Cece picked it up: her mother's hair salon asking to confirm an appointment. \"She died,\" Cece said, perhaps too softly to be heard, because the woman on the phone said, \"I believe so, yes. A coloring. Missed the last one, so wanted to confirm.\" The next day, Cece drove to the hair salon and showed up for the appointment. The hairdresser didn't question who she was. He led her to a chair, then grabbed a book of color swatches and handed it to her. Cece flipped through the book\u2014a rainbow of tiny rabbit's feet\u2014and found one that matched her mother's hair. She smelled the swatch, but of course it smelled like nothing. She cried and cried, for the first time since the funeral. The hairdresser, perhaps used to such things, ignored her. He painted and foiled Cece's hair, then rinsed it out and revealed the hideous product of her grief.",

      "I have always longed to be known, truly known, by another human being. Sometimes we live for years with yearnings that we cannot name. Until a crack appears in the sky and widens and reveals us to ourselves, as the pandemic did, because it was during lockdown that I began to sift through my life and give names to things long unnamed. I vowed at first to make the most of this collective sequestering: if I had no choice but to stay indoors, then I would oil my thinning edges every day, drink eight tall glasses of water, jog on the treadmill, sleep long, luxurious hours, and pat rich serums on my skin. But, only days in, I was spiralling in a bottomless well. Words and warnings swirled and spun, and I felt as if all human progress was swiftly reversing to an ancient stage of confusion: don't touch your face; wash your hands; don't go outside; spray disinfectant; wash your hands; don't go outside; don't touch your face. Did washing my face count as touching? I always used a face towel, but one morning my palm grazed my cheek and I froze, the tap water still running. I was alone in my house in Maryland, in suburban silence, the eerie roads bordered by trees that themselves seemed stilled. No cars drove past. I looked out and saw a herd of deer striding across the clearing of my front yard. About ten deer, or maybe fifteen, nothing like the lone deer I would see from time to time chewing shyly in the grass. I felt frightened of them, their unusual boldness, as though my world was about to be overrun not just by deer but by other lurking creatures I could not imagine. My joints throbbed, and the muscles of my back, and the sides of my neck, as if my body knew too well that we are not made to live like this.",
      "In this new suspended life, I one day found a gray hair on my head. It appeared overnight, near my temple, tightly coiled, and in the bathroom mirror I first thought it was a piece of lint. A single gray hair with a slight sheen to it. I unfurled it to its full length, let it go, and then unfurled it again. I didn't pull it out. I thought: I'm growing old. I'm growing old and the world has changed and I have never been truly known. A rush of raw melancholy brought tears to my eyes. This is all there is, this fragile breathing in and out. Where have all the years gone, and have I made the most of life? But what is the final measure for making the most of life, and how would I know if I have?",

    "story": [
      "New Mexico officials have announced the cause of death for actor\u00a0Gene Hackman\u00a0and his wife Betsy Arakawa, a week after they were found dead\u00a0at their home in Santa Fe. Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor, and Arakawa died several days before him of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Chief Medical Investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell said Friday.",
      "Investigators had been trying to determine a cause of death for the couple since they died in their home last month.",
      "How did Gene Hackman die?",
      "Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, were found dead in their home in a gated community in Santa Fe on Feb. 26, but appear to have died earlier in the month.",
      "Hackman likely died around Feb. 18, when the last activity was detected on his pacemaker, Jarrell said during a Friday news conference.",
      "An autopsy determined that Hackman died of heart disease and also suffered from advanced Alzheimer's. He tested negative for hantavirus.",
      "\"He was in a very poor state of health,\" Jarrell said. \"He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that is what resulted in his death.\"",
      "Arakawa likely died first, with Feb. 11 being the last time that she was known to be alive, Jarrell said. People with hantavirus infections can initially feel flu-like symptoms for roughly three to six days and then start to have fluid in and around their lungs.",
      "\"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24-48 hours, roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said. \"It's not uncommon to find someone down on the floor as part of a terminal collapse, so to speak, and that may very well have been what happened.\"",
      "Asked if Hackman was aware of his wife's passing, Jarrell said: \"That question's difficult to answer, but I can tell you that he was in an advanced state of Alzheimer's and it's quite possible that he was not aware that she was deceased.\"",
      "There was no food in Hackman's stomach, meaning he had not eaten recently before he died, Jarrell said. She didn't find evidence of dehydration.",
      "Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said there was no indication of a caretaker at the home.",
      "What is hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are found worldwide, carried by rodents and transmitted from animals to humans, Dr. Erin Phipps, the state public health veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department, told reporters Friday. The hantavirus found in New Mexico is found throughout the state, primarily in deer mice but in other rodents too, Phipps said.",
      "The hantavirus strain in the Southwest has a mortality rate of about 38%-50%, Jarrell said. Hantavirus can be contracted from exposure to excrement from a mouse species that carries the virus.",
      "\"Avoiding contact with or breathing in aerosolized rodent urine or feces, especially in a poorly ventilated area, is key,\" Phipps said.",
      "The various strains in the U.S. aren't transmissible from person to person.",
      "A hantavirus infection is characterized by flu-like symptoms, including fever, muscle aches, cough and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea that can progress to shortness of breath and heart or lung failure, Jarrell said.",
      "The illness is rare, with the state Health Department reporting there were only seven confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in New Mexico in 2024. In the last 50 years, officials have identified 136 infections in New Mexico residents, including five in Santa Fe County.",
      "\"This is a serious disease \u2014 42% of these infections here in New Mexico were fatal,\" Phipps said. Most infections occur around the home or workplace, she said.",
      "State health investigators conducted a risk assessment of the couple's property Wednesday, Phipps said. While the main residence itself was deemed a low risk for hantavirus exposure, signs of rodent entry were found on other structures on the property, she said.",
      "Investigation into Hackman's and Arakawa's deaths",
      "Mendoza said last Friday there were no apparent signs of foul play in the deaths. The initial findings from the autopsies found no external trauma on either of the bodies, Mendoza said.",
      "Hackman's body was found in a mudroom near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses nearby, according to an affidavit for a search warrant.",
      "The sheriff's office found medication for blood pressure and thyroid issues as well as Tylenol during a search of the home, according to an inventory of the search filed in court. Some pills were scattered on a bathroom countertop near where Arakawa's body was found, according to the affidavit. Mendoza wouldn't say who was prescribed the medication, citing patient privacy laws.",
      "One of the couple's three dogs also was found dead in a crate near Arakawa, while their two other dogs were found alive. Phipps said the dog may have died from dehydration or starvation. Dogs don't get sick from hantavirus, she said.",
      "Investigators also collected two cellphones from the home and a monthly planner, Mendoza said. No surveillance cameras had been found at the home, according to the sheriff.",
      "\"I think everybody here understands that they were very private individuals and a very private family,\" Mendoza said.",
      "The sheriff's office said Tuesday that the company that provides natural gas service for the home made no significant findings after looking for gas leaks and carbon monoxide, the colorless, odorless gas that can be fatal by depriving people from getting enough oxygen. Mendoza said last Friday that both bodies tested negative for carbon monoxide.",
      "Hackman, who won Oscars for his performances in 1971's \"The French Connection\" and the 1992 Western \"Unforgiven,\" was honored at Sunday's Academy Awards in Los Angeles.",
      "\"He received two Oscars, but more importantly, he won the hearts of film lovers all over the world,\" actor Morgan Freeman said of Hackman at the awards ceremony. \"Gene always said, 'I don't think about legacy. I just hope people remember me as someone who tried to do good work.' So I think I speak for us all when I say, Gene, you'll be remembered for that and for so much more.\"",

      "Almost one-third of the more than 3,500 people surveyed by Gallup and West Health, a group of nonprofit health care organizations, said they're \"very concerned\" that a major health event would lead to medical debt despite most of them having some form of health care coverage.",
      "The survey results underscore how exposed individuals and families can be to financial hardship just to pay for essential health care services.",
      "\"What's very visible here is families are forced to take out loans and borrow to cover expensive care that is needed,\" Tim Lash, president of West Health, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These big numbers are concerning, but the humanity is lost in the billions and trillions as we reduce this down to what the lived experience is of the American individual and families.\"",
      "To avoid taking on debt, families sometimes make tradeoffs, such as purchasing fewer groceries or not paying rent in order to get the care they need, Lash added.",
      "Nearly one in five adults between the ages of 18 and 28 reported borrowing money to pay for health care, according to the survey. Only 9% of Americans between 50 and 64 and 2% of those 65 or older reported having to borrow money to obtain needed medical care.",
      "\"There are a lot of disparities in terms of who borrows,\" Lash said. That's in part because Medicare, which is available to people who are 65 or older, provides enrollees with relatively comprehensive coverage.",
      "As of mid-2024, U.S. residents owed at least $220 billion in medical debt, according to data from the American Hospital Association. Health care bills have for years been a leading cause of personal bankruptcies.",

      "\"I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news,\" Kennedy said.",

    "story": [
      "Despite a major federal investment to help egg and poultry producers bounce back from bird flu losses, finding eggs at a reasonable price \u2014 or any eggs at all \u2014 remains a tough task for shoppers across the U.S.",
      "In January, egg prices rose 15.2%, and economists say they expect prices to continue to rise this year.",
      "The increase is due to the limited number of hens laying eggs right now. There are fewer hens because of federal bird flu control measures. They require farmers to kill their chickens if they discover a bird flu case in a flock \u2014 a process known as \"culling\" \u2014 to try to prevent the viral disease from spreading.",
      "When farmers cull their flocks to prevent the spread of a disease like the bird flu, they are eligible for public money to help them replace the flocks.",
      "Since 2020, the Department of Agriculture has paid $1.1 billion to hundreds of egg producers who had to cull their flocks to stop bird flu from spreading, according to a CBS News analysis of federal data.",
      "Now, the USDA says it will\u00a0send $400 million more to farmers who need new chickens. The agency also says it will pay $500 million for biosecurity measures and $100 million \"for vaccine research, action to reduce regulatory burdens, and exploring temporary import options.\"",
      "Frank Singleton, a spokesperson for Wayne-Sanderson Farms \u2014 the third largest poultry producer in the nation \u2014 is glad the USDA is helping.",

      "Wayne-Sanderson Farms received more than $600,000 from the USDA's bird flu assistance program to replace three flocks the company culled after discovering bird flu cases in 2023 and 2024.",
      "Singleton says the checks are an important investment to help the farms his company sponsors get back on track.",
      "\"It's a partnership with the farmers, and the consumer, and our company, to make sure we can continue to feed America,\" he says. \"It would be very difficult to get a farmer to take a risk like that without a farm partner like Wayne-Sanderson Farms. So that's where we step in. We make sure that we do our part, our due diligence, help them get back up to speed, and work to make sure those funds are available to them.\"",
      "Culling flocks and shielding them from bird flu",
      "The process of culling is arduous. Singleton says his company sprays a foam agent over the affected chickens to kill them quickly.",
      "\"Different farms and different companies have different methods,\" he said. \"We use a humane method to euthanize all the birds. It's all supervised by regulatory folks and our teams.\"",
      "\"Ours is an approved, USDA-approved method where a foaming agent used, and it's very quick,\" Singleton continued. \"So, those birds have to be disposed of. The house itself has to be cleaned up and sanitized. So it's a long process, and it takes awhile for the farmer to get back up and running. So we work with them directly to make sure that happens.\"",
      "Singleton says there are several proactive measures his company is taking to protect farms from exposure in the first place.",
      "Biosecurity measures are so tight for Wayne-Sanderson Farms, our CBS News cameras were not allowed inside a farm or facility.",
      "\"It just takes one vector to infect a flock so, from the time people come to the farm, using disinfectant sprays, wearing coveralls, wearing personal protective gear, goggles, those kinds of things \u2014 limiting the type of people, the number of people,\" Singleton explained. \"We make sure our people have the equipment, they have the chemicals, the disinfectants, and they have the knowledge. ... It's very critical. Every individual has to do their part to make sure that this doesn't happen.\"",
      "His company supports a recent proposal from other egg and poultry industry leaders to allow broiler eggs \u2014 eggs typically used to hatch chicks \u2014 to be used in consumer products amid the national shortage of traditional eggs.",
      "After a law change in 2009 that stipulated that eggs must be refrigerated sooner if sold into the consumer market, broiler egg producers were no longer able to send excess broiler eggs to consumer companies needing them for things like cakes and pies, because broiler eggs are typically stored at a higher temperature during the first 48 hours prior to shipment.",
      "Singleton says his company throws out 560,000 broiler eggs a week \u2014 about 2% of the total 26 million broiler eggs Wayne-Sanderson Farms produces.",
      "If the Food and Drug Administration were to allow the broiler eggs to be used in consumer products, Singleton says, it would be a win-win.",
      "\"We certainly want to do our part to help feed the country and (solve) a need where a need is there; certainly (that) would help us from a waste standpoint and just from employees having to work on that particular aspect of it,\" Singleton said. \"So, it's really just a cost savings and an efficiency savings and putting food back into the marketplace for consumers.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Food and Drug Administration says it is still considering the proposal.",
      "A smaller farm's approach in the bird flu saga",
      "Another company currently able to fill the need is a small independent farm in the northern Alabama city of Madison called Southard Farms.",
      "It has been in co-owner Keith Southard's family for five generations. Southard turned the farm into a pasture-raised poultry, egg and pork production operation in 2019 and never dreamed his business would be booming so soon.",
      "He says over the last month, his phone has been ringing off the hook with restaurants seeking eggs.",
      "\"It's been it's been crazy. It's been busy. My phone rings constantly,\" Southard said. \"Huge, huge opportunity for growth, and people are searching now ... not just to find eggs but something different \u2014 to find good eggs, fresh, local, that they don't just depend on a store to provide them; they know where it's coming from.\"",
      "Southard's father grows grows crops on the farm and they in turn use the crops as feed for his chickens.",
      "He has 900 laying hens for eggs and 700 broiler chickens \u2014 or chickens used for meat.",
      "Right now, Southard's hens lay about 400 eggs a week. A few weeks ago, Southard signed a contract with a restaurant in Birmingham to sell it 500 dozen eggs a week. Southard says he expects his total egg production in the next few months will be just under 1,000 dozen a week to meet the demand.",
      "Unlike in traditional egg farms, where laying hens are kept in an indoor warehouse, Southard's chickens live an outdoor lifestyle, rotating regularly onto fresh grass to graze. He says the pasture-raised format keeps his chickens' immune systems stronger.",
      "\"No medicines needed to keep them going. So, we just use nature's benefits,\" Southard says.",
      "However, the outdoor living could make them more susceptible to coming into contact with wild birds that could be carrying the avian (bird) flu.",
      "\"There's always that risk,\" Southard says. \"We just hope that it doesn't affect us.\"",
      "Last year, Southard had to cull his flock after chickens got hit with a bacterial infection, different than bird flu, called mycoplasma. He says the experience was devastating.",
      "\"I noticed a few symptoms, and then within three days, we went from a normal amount of eggs per day to almost zero, and it was very similar symptoms to the avian flu, so (we) immediately took the hens to the state lab for testing ... and once we got the results in, there really wasn't any answer but to just cull the flock and start over,\" Southard recalled.",
      "He said he and his farmhand had to personally kill each chicken by cutting their throats to make it as quick and painless for the birds as possible.",
      "\"Nothing I want to see again, that's for sure,\" Southard said.",
      "Because mycoplasma is not considered a \"highly-pathogenic\" disease, he did not qualify for the USDA's program to receive a check to help him finance the replacement of his chickens.",
      "\"We just bared through it and kept going,\" Southard says.",
      "And kept going he did.",
      "Southard took us to Farm Burger in Huntsville, Alabama, one of the restaurants that uses his chicken meat and eggs. The staff affectionately calls out, \"The Chicken Man's here!\" upon his arrival to deliver his product in person each week.",
      "The restaurant's co-owner and manager says Southard has been a blessing to his business because Southard has kept his prices low at a time when other restaurants in neighboring states have seen egg prices more than double in the last few months.",
      "Low prices for the restaurant also mean costs don't have to be passed on to customers.",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal data found some farms received large checks from the USDA indemnity and reimbursement program after culling their flocks last year \u2014 one egg producer received $10 million.",
      "Asked his thoughts about the taxpayer expense, Southard said, \"I think there's probably, there's definitely a question there about when USDA should get involved or not. So, I think that should be looked into to some more, because obviously we see still these big supply problems. So, I don't think we have the right answer yet, but it should be looked into some more.\"",
      "With supply issues and high egg costs expected at least another year, Southard says it's important to protect small farms.",
      "\"Small farmers like us, family farms, play a key role, because it takes away the big consolidation that's happened and spreads out the risk where you have more farms across the state or country and more farmers,\" Southard says. \"So, if one gets hit, it's not as big of an effect on the whole supply chain.\"",

      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it is reinstating a plan to recover 100% of overpayments to beneficiaries, a policy the agency abandoned last year after an outcry over cases in which the practice led some Americans to receive shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars.",
      "In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The agency is required by law to claw back overpaid benefits.",
      "Because of public backlash over the 100% recovery policy, the agency last year had capped\u00a0the withholding rate for someone who had been overpaid at 10% of the person's monthly benefit. On Friday, the SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments, while the withholding rate for people with overpayments before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "\"People who are overpaid after March 27 will automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,\" the agency said.",
      "The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. In some cases, the bills were for tens of thousands of dollars. If beneficiaries were unable to immediately pay the bill, the agency could dock their entire monthly Social Security payment, leaving some people financially destitute, as reported by \"60 Minutes,\"\u00a0KFF Health News\u00a0and other media outlets,",
      "In many cases, the overpayments were the fault of SSA. A\u00a02022 report\u00a0by the agency's inspector general found that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "In the agency's new statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said it is the agency's \"duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding.\"",
      "He added, \"We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people.\"",
      "Raising the clawback rate to 100% from its current 10% will increase the amount of recovered funds by $7 billion over the next decade, the agency said. SSA pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year.",
      "The revised policy will lead to financial hardships for many people faced with Social Security overpayments, according to the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare.",
      "\"This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices \u2014 usually through no fault of their own,\" a spokesperson for the advocacy group said in a statement. \"Many overpayments are the result of errors on SSA's part.\"",
      "Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, noted the advocacy group supports the government recouping improper overpayments, but said an immediate 100% cut in benefits would take a toll on older Americans.",
      "\"The 'clawback' of payments is especially unfair to seniors who do not have external support to help manage their finances and track their benefits,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Many beneficiaries may not be aware of an overpayment and could suddenly find themselves without a check.\"",
      "Social Security cuts",
      "The reversal comes as the Social Security Administration is undergoing widespread job cuts and a reorganization under the Trump administration. With its staff already at a 50-year low, employees at the agency have told CBS News that the cuts could disrupt or delay services, including customer service delays and longer waits to qualify for some benefits.",
      "While on the campaign trail, President Trump vowed not to touch Social Security, a promise he repeated Sunday on Fox News, although he added that his administration wants to root out \"fraud\" from the benefit system.",
      "\"I'm not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we're going to get fraud out of there,\" he said. \"We have people 250 years old and all, you know, tremendous fraud,\" he added, referring to a false claim that people who are beyond the human lifespan are receiving benefits.\"",
      "The cuts to Social Security's workforce could mean that more beneficiaries are subject to overpayment errors, the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare said in the statement.",
      "\"Trump's SSA also is closing field offices across the country, meaning beneficiaries will have to wait longer and possibly travel farther to resolve their overpayment cases,\" the group said.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:47:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

      "Employers across the U.S. added 151,000 jobs in February, below economists' forecasts and pointing to a slowdown in the labor market amid signs of slowing economic growth.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast that the economy added 160,000 jobs last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate last month was 4.1%, slightly higher than the 4% rate forecast by economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Hiring has eased since December's blowout number of 323,000 new jobs, but the labor market has remained resilient at the start of 2025, experts say.",
      "What it means",
      "The February job figures suggest the labor market \"is showing signs of weakness with hiring across sectors,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual Of America Capital Management, in an email.",
      "He added, \"Deteriorating indicators like hiring intentions, new job listings and temporary staffing suggest a potential slowdown in employment growth.\"",
      "Notably, the widespread, ongoing cuts across the government sector also aren't reflected in today's report, according to Andy Stettner, an unemployment insurance expert at The Century Foundation. That's because unemployment claims for federal workers can take several weeks to appear in the official government data, he noted.",
      "Although the full impact of those cuts aren't yet visible in the data, federal employment declined by 10,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday. The U.S. has more than 2 million federal workers.",
      "Layoffs across the U.S.\u00a0spiked last month to their highest levels since 2020, led by firings of federal workers ordered by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency,\u00a0or DOGE,\u00a0 outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said on Thursday.",
      "Employers cut more than 172,000 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when nearly 263,000 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "What the experts say",
      "The slightly weaker-than-expected February jobs report could prompt the Federal Reserve to resume cutting its benchmark rate, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "The Fed in January hit the brakes on interest rate cuts, citing persistent inflation. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the central bank is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness, which could prompt additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed will receive one more piece of major economic data ahead of its next rate decision meeting, scheduled for March 19, with the Consumer Price Index set to be released on March 12. The CPI likely rose 2.9% last month, slightly easing from January's 3% pace, according to FactSet.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are expected to boost prices for consumers, although they aren't likely to show up in inflation data for several months as Mr. Trump on Thursday paused 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada until early April.",
      "\"Overall, this report is a sigh of relief for the Fed as they can continue to sit on the sidelines for the next couple meetings as they assess the potential inflation impacts resulting from U.S. tariff policy over the coming months,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, in an email.",

    "summary": "Powell says the Fed is in no hurry to change course, citing \"uncertainty\" over the impact of the Trump administration economic policies",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that the central bank can remain patient in adjusting its benchmark interest rate, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's economic policies.",
      "Powell said the Trump administration is making policy changes in several areas, including trade, taxes, government spending, immigration and regulation, and added that the \"net effect\" of those changes are what will matter for the economy and the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high,\" Powell said at a conference in New York. \"As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\"",
      "Most economists say that Trump's plans to slap tariffs on a wide array of imports, including 25% duties on goods from Canada and Mexico that he partially delayed Thursday, will push up prices and slow growth. But many also expect that tax cuts and deregulation could boost the economy.",
      "Powell's comments pushed some traders to pare back their forecasts for how many interest rate cuts the Fed may deliver this year. They had been banking on at least three following a stream of weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. But Powell reiterated the Fed is likely on hold for a while. That sent Treasury yields higher in the bond market.",
      "Rate reductions could help bring down borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans.",
      "President Trump in January pressed the Fed to ease borrowing costs, saying in a speech at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland that he planned to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Inflation expectations are key",
      "In a question and answer session, Powell acknowledged that typically tariffs would cause a \"one-time\" price increase, rather than persistent inflation, and the Fed could ignore such a temporary effect. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday made a similar argument: \"We could get a one-time price adjustment,\" Bessent said, before adding, \"I'm not worried about inflation.\"",
      "Yet Powell also said there were other considerations the Fed has to take into account when deciding whether to keep its rate unchanged, or even raise rates. For example, Powell suggested tariffs might have more than just a one-time impact \"if it turns into a series\" of tariff hikes, or \"if the increases are larger, that would matter.\"",
      "\"What really does matter is what is happening with long-term inflation expectations,\" Powell added. Powell noted that shorter-term expectations have risen, partly out of concern about tariffs, though longer-term expectations have been stable.",
      "Expectations that prices will rise can worsen inflation if they cause consumers and businesses to change their behavior in anticipation. Some companies might charge more when they expect their own costs to increase.",
      "When Trump imposed tariffs in his last administration, Powell noted, the Fed ended up reducing its key rate, \"because growth weakened so much.\"",
      "Economists with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley this week forecast that inflation is likely to edge up in 2025, citing the potential impact of tariffs and other Trump administration policies.",
      "\"Larger tariffs are also likely to hit GDP harder through their tax-like effect on disposable income and consumer spending and their effect on financial conditions and uncertainty for businesses,\" Goldman analysts wrote in a report.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the\u00a0soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Powell says economy remains solid",
      "Powell said the economy remains mostly healthy despite \"elevated uncertainty.\" He characterized Friday's jobs report, which showed employers added 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, as in line with the \"solid\" gains of the past six months.",
      "He also noted that there were signs consumer spending has slowed compared with the healthy gains in the second half of last year, and said surveys of consumers and businesses \"point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\" Further complicating matters, he acknowledged that measures of consumer sentiment \"have not been a good predictor\" of consumer spending in recent years.",
      "The Fed's own beige book, a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses, mentioned uncertainty 47 times in its latest edition released Wednesday, up from just 17 times in January. The Fed publishes the beige book eight times a year.",
      "Powell spoke at a conference organized by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.",
      "President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policy and rapid-fire layoffs of government workers has created a spike in uncertainty among businesses and caused a sharp drop in consumer confidence. Many economists have marked down their estimates for the economy's growth to as low as 1% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.3% in last year's final quarter.",
      "Yet as Fed governor Christopher Waller noted Thursday, there are \"good news\" cuts and \"bad news\" cuts. \"Bad news\" cuts occur if the Fed reduces rates out of concern that the economy is slowing, while \"good news\" reductions are those that reflect a sense by the Fed that inflation is returning to its target of 2%.",
      "Waller added that he still believes it will be possible for the Fed to engineer \"good news\" rate cuts later this year, though he dismissed the potential for a cut at the Fed's next meeting this month.",
      "After cutting its key rate three times last year to about 4.3%, Powell indicated in January that the Fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation has remained stuck above its target. The central bank's preferred inflation gauge shows that prices rose 2.5% in January compared with a year ago. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6%, the smallest increase since June.",

    "summary": "Experts say you could save thousands of dollars by buying a car now, versus later in 2025 if tariffs are enacted.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a car can be a fraught financial decision even in the best of times. Now, car shoppers are facing the added pressure of deciphering U.S. tariff policy.",
      "On Wednesday, President Trump issued a one-month delay for U.S. automakers on tariffs placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, trading partners that provide many of the car makers' vehicle parts and components. If the 25% levies are enacted, auto manufacturers will face higher costs and are likely to\u00a0pass on some of those price hikes to consumers, industry players say.",
      "The upshot, according to experts, is that consumers who are thinking of buying a car in the next year may want to consider buying a car sooner in 2025 rather than later. If the tariffs eventually take effect, car prices could rise by between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, according to a recent estimate from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it, will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them,\" AEG CEO Patrick Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The timing of the tariffs remain uncertain, and it's possible that Mr. Trump could further delay the import duties on Canada and Mexico, while the U.S. could also shelve the trade measures if the sides reach agreement. Even if the tariffs are ultimately deployed in April, it's unclear how long they might remain in place, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding the import duties, according to Morningstar equity strategist David Whiston.",
      "Spreading the costs",
      "While certain car models source a greater share of their components from Canada and Mexico than others, automakers are expected to spread any added costs they incur across their vehicle lineups.",
      "\"If the tariffs are here, and permanent, by the time we get to summer we'd expect to see higher prices everywhere,\" Tyson Jominy, vice president of analytics at J.D. Power, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That means even U.S.-sourced and assembled vehicles with components that aren't subject to tariffs could see moderate price hikes.",
      "\"If we are talking about 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, prices will go up, and we are expecting most automakers to peanut-butter spread the impact across their entire portfolio, even if the vehicle is built in the U.S.,\" Jominy explained. \"The reality is that every automaker, regardless of where they final assemble, is likely to be affected if these parts tariffs go into effect.\"",
      "Automakers are likely to be strategic about how they implement price hikes in order to mitigate the effect on sales, experts say.",
      "\"Automakers will smooth costs out across their vehicle lineups,\" Edmunds head of insights Jessica Caldwell told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They won't increase one model's price by 40%. They'll figure out ways to spread out the costs in a way that doesn't harm profitability as much, and doesn't kill sales at the same time.\"",
      "When could car prices rise?",
      "Although vehicle prices wouldn't skyrocket overnight if the Canada and Mexico tariffs kick in, they could start to rise by summer, industry analysts say. That means car buyers should seriously consider starting their search now.",
      "Manufacturers with more inventory in stock could push off price hikes for some time, whereas those that are running low could be forced to incorporate them into sales prices earlier. Jominy said the range could be a few weeks to \"many months\" from the time tariffs take effect.",
      "\"If you think you'll need a car within the next several months, you should probably get into the market sooner rather than later,\" Jominy said.",
      "That doesn't mean buying on impulse, and experts urge consumers to do their homework before signing on the dotted line for what is, after all, a major financial decision for most people.",
      "\"But if you're planning to be in market the first half of year, it probably makes sense to speed up what you can and make sure you're ready to go,\" he said.",
      "What about used cars?",
      "When new vehicle prices rise, some buyers turn to the used car market, which in turn can drive up costs in that segment.",
      "\"If something comes to pass on tariffs, we'd expected higher prices on both new and used vehicles,\" Jominy said.",
      "Demand for cars \u2014 and other products impacted by tariffs \u2014 may be pulled forward, experts say. \"Because we don't know what's doing to happen, I would be buying everything that I needed that's an appliance that could have content coming from Canada or Mexico,\" Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's a little bit like eating your lunch at recess. You get the same amount of food \u2014 you just get it earlier,\" he added.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs more than once already, it's unclear if and when auto tariffs will hit. But Robert Handfield, professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University, said for the risk-averse, buying an automobile now versus later in the year is a wise move.",
      "\"He postponed the tariffs for a month to give automakers a little breathing room,\" he said. \"I think it's a good idea to buy now. You'd be able to get in under the wire and save around $4,000 for a regular sedan or up to $10,000 to $12,000 for a truck, which are significant savings.\"",
      "Even if the tariffs never come to fruition, consumers wishing to play it safe can't go wrong by making purchases now, according to Edmunds' Caldwell.",
      "\"Some people don't have the finances to get it wrong. We are stretched thin financially as a country and new vehicle prices aren't cheap, so I can see a lot of people don't want to take the risk,\" she said. \"Sure, it might not happen. But what if it does? Now you're paying how much more that you can't afford.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 14:55:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Union representing TSA workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Friday it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the union representing thousands of frontline workers with the Transportation Security Administration, a decision the TSA union called an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
      "In announcing the decision, DHS criticized the union \u2014 which represents worker responsible for screening airline passengers \u2014 claiming TSA employs more people working full-time on union issues than those \"performing screening functions at 86% of our airports.\"",
      "\"This action will ensure Americans will have more effective and modernized workforces across the nation's transportation networks,\" Homeland Security said in a statement. \"TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\"",
      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on key U.S. trading partners and ongoing crackdown on immigration are likely to result in higher prices for American consumers and businesses, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Economists with Morgan Stanley Research said in a report on Friday that they expect inflation in 2025 to rise 2.5%, up from their previous forecast in December of 2.3%. Another key gauge that strips out volatile food and energy costs is now projected to reach 2.7%, up from 2.5% in the bank's earlier forecast.",
      "\"We now see higher inflation in 2025 with a more pronounced and sooner re-acceleration in goods prices,\" the analysts wrote.",
      "\"If our narrative entering the year was 'slower growth, stickier inflation' then we now think 'slower growth, firmer inflation,'\" they added.",
      "Analysts at Goldman Sachs also said on Friday they're now projecting higher inflation, largely due to Mr. Trump's tariffs. Core PCE inflation, or price increases excluding food and energy costs, could rise to 3% this year, rather than sinking to 2.1% by year-end if there were no tariffs in place.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Inflation during the pandemic soared to its highest level since 1981, peaking at 9.1% in June 2022. The pace of price increases has cooled since then, but costs remain roughly 10% higher than before the COVID crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "Recently, inflation has been moving in the wrong direction. After dipping to 2.4% in September, the closely watched Consumer Price Index has nosed up, and in January rose to an annual rate of 3% \u2014 higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target and the fourth straight monthly increase. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release CPI data for February on March 12.",
      "Many businesses are also expecting higher prices. As of early February, manufacturers and service firms expected inflation over the next year of 3.5% and 4%, respectively, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey out this week. Companies pointed to stiffer U.S. tariffs on foreign imports, which raise their operating costs, as a major reason they're bracing for higher inflation.",
      "President Trump on Friday again suspended 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the second time he has paused steeper levies on the two largest U.S. trade partners. The White House\u00a0also recently raised tariffs on China by an additional 10% and has vowed to deploy broader \"reciprocal tariffs\" against other nations on April 2.",
      "Although the delays leave open the possibility of a breakthrough in trade talks, the whipsaw in policy makes it more challenging for businesses to plan in advance.",
      "Tighter immigration restrictions can contribute to inflation by reducing the nation's supply of labor, according to economists.",
      "\"One factor that we think limits services disinflation is reduced immigration, which could lead to labor shortages in many face-to-face service sectors (retail, restaurants, leisure, hospitals) that could result in supply-side driven inflation,\" the Morgan Stanley analysts said in their report.",
      "Persistent inflation could deter the Fed from moving to nudge down interest rates and lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, experts note. About 1 in 10 economists polled by FactSet expect the central bak to cut rates at its next meeting on March 19.",

      "Although the timing of such a move is unclear, reports that is in the works are already raising questions for millions of parents, students and taxpayers about the future of the Education Department and how the services it provides will be handled if the agency is dismantled.",
      "What does the Department of Education do?",
      "In 1979, President Jimmy Carter signed a bill creating the Department of Education. The agency's key functions include:",
      "Disbursing billions in student loans each yearOperating the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which allows students to apply for loans, grants and other college aidProviding funding to help poor and disabled students enrolled in K-12 schoolsEnsuring equal access to education through its Office of Civil RightsOperating the Pell grant program, which provides qualifying low- and middle-income students with up to $7,400 per year to attend collegeFunding public charter schoolsOverseeing the the college accreditation system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agenciesCollecting data on education and student outcomes, from early to higher education",

      "Funding public charter schools",
      "Overseeing the the college accreditation system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agencies",
      "Collecting data on education and student outcomes, from early to higher education",
      "The Department of Education is \"primarily about ensuring who can access the classroom \u2014 it's not so much about what is being talked about in the classroom,\" Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation and expert on higher education, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "One major misconception held by many Americans is that the Education Department oversees school curriculums and learning, which are instead overseen by states and local school districts. Rather than setting public school curriculums, the Education Department's role is primarily financial, distributing billions in government money to colleges and schools and managing the federal student loan portfolio.",
      "\"Curriculum is handled by states and local governance \u2014 the Department of Education has historically had no role in setting curriculum,\" Granville said. \"The primary role of the Department of Education has been as a grant maker and a loan lender.\"",
      "For instance, the Education Department operates the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which is used by about 17 million students each year to apply for federal loans, grants and scholarships to attend college or vocational programs. The agency also manages $1.5 trillion in student loans, including repayment programs.",
      "Additionally, the Education Department handles Title I funding for low-income schools as well as for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Here's what to know about the agency.",
      "Why does the Trump administration want to close the Education Department?",
      "Mr. Trump is a vocal critic of the Education Department, describing\u00a0it last month as \"a big con job\" and falsely claiming the U.S. is ranked 40th in education internationally but spends the most per pupil. (Spending on K-12 education is largely determined by local school boards and funded by property taxes.)",
      "One of the president's executive orders, signed Jan. 30,\u00a0directed the Education Department to investigate \"school choice programs,\" saying that parents need \"opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\" Vouchers that allow families to pay for private K-12 schools are a priority of conservatives, as such programs allow parents to use tax credits to pay for private schools, including Christian-based institutions.",
      "In an email earlier this month to the agency's staff entitled \"Our Department's Final Mission,\" McMahon wrote that her goal is to \"restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington.\" That echoes language from Project 2025, the blueprint for a conservative administration written by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "\"Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes,\" Project 2025's section on the Education Department claims. \"Eventually, policymaking and funding should take place at the state and local level, closest to the affected families.\"",
      "Can Mr. Trump abolish the Education Department?",
      "Complete elimination of the Education Department would need congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate, which is unlikely given the current makeup.",
      "However, the Trump administration could make changes to the agency, such as by cutting staff, without closing the entire department. The Trump administration is currently making massive employment cuts at several other federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs Department, describing the efforts as a way to reduce federal waste.",
      "The Trump administration could change some of the department's oversight duties, such as those carried out by its Office for Civil Rights, which issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied. Trump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role.",
      "Under his administration, the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of\u00a0antisemitism, and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to\u00a0compete on women's teams, according to the Associated Press.",
      "The Trump administration isn't expected to defend the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, which have been tied up in court cases, experts say. Last month, the Education Department removed the online application for income-driven repayment plans, according to Business Insider.",
      "What would happen to student loans?",
      "The Education Department manages $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for more than 40 million borrowers. Although the Trump administration hasn't outlined how it might want to reallocate the Education Department's responsibilities, student loans could be moved to the Treasury Department, Granville noted.",
      "\"If this is going to be a smooth handoff, some other agency has to pick up what the Education Department is setting down,\" he said. \"The most logical destination is the Treasury, but I worry about the risk of disruption from any handoff.\"",
      "Project 2025 posits that student loans should be handled by a \"new government corporation with professional governance and management.\" The blueprint calls for federal loans \"to be assigned directly to the Treasury Department, which would manage collections.\"",
      "Project 2025 also favors phasing out income-based repayment plans, which help borrowers lower their monthly loan payments by making them proportional to their wages and salaries, and creating a new repayment plan that would require people earning above poverty wages to pay 10% of their income toward their loans.",
      "\"[T]here should be no loan forgiveness,\" Project 2025 states.",
      "What would happen to the FAFSA if the Education Department is abolished?",
      "The Education Department required by law to release the FAFSA on or close to Oct. 1, allowing students and their families to apply for loans and other student aid during the college application season. Families must complete the FAFSA each year a student is enrolled in a college program if they wish to qualify for loans or other aid.",
      "\"Congress passed a law that created the FAFSA, and unless Congress creates a new law, the FAFSA has to continue,\" Granville said.",
      "Still, it's unclear which agency would handle the FAFSA if the Department of Education is dismantled, he added.",
      "What would happen to federal funding for public K-12 schools?",
      "Much of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools is funneled through large federal programs, such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities, smaller class sizes with additional teaching positions, and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.",
      "During his campaign, Mr. Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.",
      "Project 2025 suggests sending oversight of programs for kids with disabilities and low-income children first to the Department of Health and Human Services, before eventually phasing out the funding and converting it to no-strings-attached grants to states.",
      "What do educators and Democrats say?",
      "There's concern that making massive changes to the Education Department could impact millions of families and students who rely on the agency for loans, grants and other support, experts say.",
      "Moving some of those tasks to states and local governments could drive up costs for many families, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.",
      "\"That will mean higher local and state taxes to fill the void,\" Sanders said at a Thursday press conference organized by the Senate Democrats about the potential dismantling of the Education Department. \"In other words, shutting down the Department of Education would be a disaster for low income and working class families in every state of our country.\"",
      "The American Federation of Teachers, a union that represents 1.8 million K-12 teachers, said that it planned to fight the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the agency.",
      "\"The directive to 'return decision-making to the states' fails the smell test,\" said AFT President Randi Weingarten in a statement. \"States and districts already govern schools through locally elected school boards, as they should. They put up most of the money and control most of the decisions\u2014from approving curriculum to deciding who graduates.\"",
      "She added, \"The Department of Education, and the laws it is supposed to execute, has one major purpose: to level the playing field and fill opportunity gaps to help every child in America succeed.\"",

      "Mr. Trump announced the delay in the Mexico tariffs in a social media post after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. On Thursday afternoon, he signed two executive orders stating the exemptions would apply to U.S. imports of products from both Mexico and Canada that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Goods that are not covered by the agreement remain subject to tariffs.",
      "\"After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He characterized the move \"as an accommodation\" for the Mexican leader.",
      "\"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "When asked if any concessions had been offered by Canada or Mexico to lead to the pause, a White House official told CBS News that during leader-to-leader discussions, Mexico brought up progress it had made cracking down on cartels and drugs, including cocaine.",
      "The USMCA agreement covers the vast majority of imports from Mexico. In a press conference Thursday, Sheinbaum said that nearly all of Mexico's trade with the U.S. is covered under the trade pact which is in effect until April 2.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Canadian energy, which is not included in the USMCA, is expected to be tariffed at 10%, which could boost gas prices and heating and electricity costs in the U.S. Potash that U.S. farmers import from Canada would be tariffed at the same rate.",
      "According to a White House official, in 2024, 38% of all imports from Canada were covered by the USMCA and therefore exempt from tariffs, while 49.6% of all imports from Mexico were covered under the agreement.",
      "International trade expert Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that \"a massive amount of goods\" fall under the brief exemption from tariffs on imports from Canada. They include auto parts, steel and aluminum, beef and other products.",
      "Despite the brief reprieve. uncertainty around the tariffs have \"broken complex supply chains that will never be fixed,\" Appleton said.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, underlined the importance of cooperation on trade.",
      "\"Though today's delay mitigates some of economic damage U.S. tariffs will cause, this is not a moment to celebrate. The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll. We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People's livelihoods are at stake,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The only outcome that makes sense for both economies is for all tariffs to be taken off the table, without exception,\" Holmes added.",
      "Economists have warned that tariffs are likely to lead to price increases on an array of goods, from vegetables and fruit to automobiles. Levies on materials from Canada and Mexico used in car production won't go into effect immediately after Mr. Trump also issued one-month exemption from tariffs for automakers Wednesday, following conversations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.",

      "The Deerfield, Illinois, company had already shed about a thousand U.S. stores since it grew to nearly 9,500 after buying some Rite Aid locations in 2018.",
      "The company also said last August that it was reviewing a U.S. health care operation it had expanded aggressively, and it might sell all or part of its VillageMD clinic business. That announcement came less than two years after the company said it would spend billions to expand it.",
      "Shares of Walgreens shed nearly two thirds of their value last year. Walgreens said the transaction price represents a nearly 30% premium to the share price in December when reports of a deal first surfaced. Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth confirmed in January that a sale process for the business was underway. Including debt, the value of the deal is just under $24 billion, the company said.",
      "Walgreens said earlier this year it was making progress improving prescription reimbursement.",
      "Walgreens has also taken steps to preserve cash. It said in January that it was suspending a quarterly dividend it has offered for more than 90 years, and it's been reducing its stake in the drug distributor Cencora this year to get cash in part to pay down debt.",
      "Ultimately, the company has to improve its cash flow, whether it remains publicly traded or goes private, Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a Feb. 23 research note.",
      "\"Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan,\" the analyst wrote. \"Without cash flow, none of the value cases work.\"",
      "Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. also runs nearly 3,700 international stores, with locations in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Thailand and Ireland.",
      "The Walgreens buyout comes after competitor Rite Aid emerged last September as a private company from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Remaining publicly traded drugstore operators include the nation's largest, CVS Health Corp., and retailers like Walmart and the grocer Kroger that run pharmacies at many of their locations.",

      "Layoffs across the U.S. spiked in February, reaching their highest levels since July 2020, led by widespread firings of government workers ordered by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Employers cut 172,017 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number that was announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when 262,649 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "The job cuts were led by losses in federal jobs, largely directed by DOGE, which says it is dedicated to rooting out government waste and fraud. DOGE-related job losses have cut a wide swath across federal government agencies by targeting newly hired workers, regardless of their job performance or whether their jobs are essential.",
      "In a few cases, some agencies have scrambled to rehire workers who were fired under DOGE's policies, such as the U.S. Agriculture Department bringing back bird flu experts who were mistakenly cut.",
      "Federal agencies announced 62,242 job cuts last month, an increase of 41,311% from a year earlier, Challenger, Gray said. More federal cuts are on the way, with the Veterans Affairs Department planning to cut thousands of jobs in the coming months, while some government workers may opt to leave because of the uncertainty caused by the layoffs, the group said.",
      "\"When mass layoffs occur, it often leaves remaining staff feeling uneasy and uncertain. The likelihood that many more workers leave voluntarily is high,\" Andrew Challenger, workplace expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "The impact of the DOGE cuts haven't yet shown up in official government data, with the Labor Department saying Thursday that the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits fell by 21,000 to 221,000 for the week ending March 1.",
      "On Friday, the monthly jobs report is expected to show that employers hired 159,000 workers in February, an increase from January's 143,000, according to financial data firm FactSet. The jobless rate is forecast to remain steady at 4%. Some analysts expect layoffs ordered by DOGE to show up in the report in the coming weeks or months.",
      "Other sectors besides the federal government also laid off workers last month, Challenger, Gray found. Retailers cut almost 39,000 jobs, while technology companies cut 14,554 jobs in February, its data shows.",
      "The DOGE cuts are already having \"downstream\" effects, Challenger, Gray said. For instance, private non-profits cut about 900 jobs due to the impact of loss of federal funding, it noted.",

      "Almost one-third of the more than 3,500 people surveyed by Gallup and West Health, a group of nonprofit health care organizations, said they're \"very concerned\" that a major health event would lead to medical debt despite most of them having some form of health care coverage.",
      "The survey results underscore how exposed individuals and families can be to financial hardship just to pay for essential health care services.",

      "To avoid taking on debt, families sometimes make tradeoffs, such as purchasing fewer groceries or not paying rent in order to get the care they need, Lash added.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0An\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that was sent to lawmakers this week showed that budget goals outlined in a House GOP plan could not be reached without reducing spending on Medicaid, clashing with commitments from Republicans not to cut the popular entitlement program.",
      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",
      "House Republican leaders have stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution and said benefits would not be cut, noting that last week's vote was merely to begin the reconciliation process. But Republicans have said they plan to remove \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program, and many members support work requirements that could limit eligibility for benefits. Other GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns about making cuts to the program, since many of their constituents and voters rely on coverage.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday that the CBO findings \"confirmed what we have long understood to be the case with the reckless Republican budget.\"",
      "\"Republicans are trying to rip healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans,\" the New York Democrat said, pledging that \"every single Democrat\" will stand against the House plan.",

    "story": [
      "Salt Lake City \u2014 Utah on Wednesday became the first state to pass legislation requiring app stores to verify users' ages and get parental consent for minors to download apps to their devices.",
      "The bill headed to the desk of Gov. Spencer Cox has pitted Meta, which operates Facebook and Instagram, against app store giants Apple and Google over who should be responsible for verifying ages. Similar bills have been introduced in at least eight other states in the latest fight over children's online safety. The proposals targeting app stores follow legal fights over laws requiring social media platforms to verify the ages of users.",
      "Meta and other social media companies support putting the onus on app stores to verify ages amid criticism that they don't do enough to make their products safe for children - or verify that no kids under 13 use them.",
      "\"Parents want a one-stop shop to verify their child's age and grant permission for them to download apps in a privacy-preserving way. The app store is the best place for it,\" Meta, X and Snap Inc. said in a joint statement Wednesday. \"We applaud Utah for putting parents in charge with its landmark legislation and urge Congress to follow suit.\"",
      "The app stores say app developers are better equipped to handle age verification and other safety measures. Requiring app stores to confirm ages will make it so all users have to hand over sensitive identifying information, such as a driver's license, passport, credit card or Social Security number, even if they don't want to use an age-restricted app, Apple said.",
      "\"Because many kids in the U.S. don't have government-issued IDs, parents in the U.S. will have to provide even more sensitive documentation just to allow their child to access apps meant for children. That's not in the interest of user safety or privacy,\" the company said in its most recent online safety report.",
      "Apple considers age a matter of privacy and lets users decide whether to disclose it. The company gives parents the option to set age-appropriate parameters for app downloads. The Google Play Store does the same.",
      "Apple and Google are among a litany of tech companies that help support the Chamber of Progress, a tech policy group that lobbied Utah lawmakers to reject the bill. Last year, Apple helped kill a similar bill in Louisiana that would have required app stores to help enforce age restrictions.",
      "Kouri Marshall, a spokesperson for the Chamber of Progress, called the measure \"a tremendous encroachment of individual privacy\" that he said places a heavy burden on app stores to ensure online safety.",
      "Republican Sen. Todd Weiler, the bill's sponsor, argued it's \"a lot easier to target two app stores than it is to target 10,000 (app) developers.\"",
      "Under the bill, app stores would be required to request age information when someone creates an account. If a minor tries to open one, the bill directs the app store to link it to their parent's account and may request a form of ID to confirm their identity. Weiler said a credit card could be used as an age verification tool in most cases.",
      "If a child tries to download an app that allows in-app purchases or requires them to agree to terms and conditions, the parent will first have to approve.",
      "Melissa McKay, a Utah mother, is among those who pushed for the legislation. She said she started asking questions about device safety after her nephew in 2017 was exposed to \"really harmful content on another student's device at school.\" Inaccurate age ratings on apps and faulty parental controls are \"at the root of online harm,\" McKay said.",
      "The eight other states considering proposals would similarly place responsibility on app stores to verify ages and seek parental permissions. A legislative committee advanced Alabama's bill last week.",
      "Lawsuits have delayed implementation of state laws regulating social media apps and websites. A federal judge in 2024 temporarily blocked Utah's first-in-the-nation law requiring social media companies to check the ages of all users and place restrictions on accounts belonging to minors.",
      "If Cox signs the Utah bill into law, most provisions would take effect May 7. The governor's office didn't respond to emails seeking comment Wednesday. Cox, a Republican, supported the state law currently on hold that requires age verification on social media."

      "The announcement comes after Mr. Trump spoke with leaders of the so-called Big Three automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram \u2014 on Wednesday, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on all\u00a0goods imported\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional tariff of 10% on Chinese imports, were expected to hit the auto industry hard\u00a0because many vehicle parts and components are imported from those countries to manufacture cars in the U.S.",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.",
      "\"Since President Trump's successful USMCA was signed, Ford has invested billions in the United States and committed to billions more in the future to both invest in American workers and ensure all of our vehicles comply with USMCA,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.\"",
      "In its own statement on the tariff delay, GM said the automaker \"has more vehicle assembly plants in the U.S. than any other automaker,\" adding that \"we continue to invest billions of dollars every year in our manufacturing base, supply chain and U.S. jobs.\"",
      "The goal of the tariff pause is to give U.S. automakers time to shift their supply chains to within the U.S., Leavitt said. Mr. Trump \"told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the U.S. of America, where they will pay no tariffs. That's the ultimate goal,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has said the tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of migrants and drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S., as well as redressing trade imbalances with other countries. The taxes quickly triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday.",
      "The new tariffs Canada and Mexico could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs\u00a0close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers",

      "The S&P 500 has lost about 3% of its value since Friday, with Wall Street tumbling on Monday and Tuesday after Mr. Trump\u00a0decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. The stock index regained some ground on Wednesday, rising 21 points, or 0.4%, to 5,799 in afternoon trading.",
      "According to Wall Street analysts, the market reaction reflects investor concerns that a trade war could crimp U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation, putting pressure on U.S. consumers who are already financially strained after grappling with several years of elevated price increases. Some recent economic data also points to\u00a0souring outlooks from consumers and businesses, with both groups now\u00a0expecting higher inflation in the face of Mr. Trump's new tariffs.",
      "With uncertainty on the rise, employees exposed to stocks through their retirement plans should brace for more investment volatility, experts say.",
      "\"There is evidence that a cooling in the economy is underway,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst and founder of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"U.S. equities are bearing the brunt of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might \"modify the tariffs somewhat.\"",
      "Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said.",
      "\"I look at tariffs as a corporate tax,\" he said. \"Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion \u2014 it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be.\"",
      "Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as \"an uncertain time,\" said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put \"meaningful pressure\" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said.",
      "\"Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high,\" investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5\u00a0note\u00a0to investors. \"In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks.\"",
      "How could this impact your 401(k)?",
      "While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research\u00a0has found.",
      "The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December.",
      "For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say.",
      "\"Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility,\" Crisafulli said. \"I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s.\"",
      "Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada.",
      "Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted.",
      "\"On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods,\" the wealth management firm noted.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs \"are about making America rich again and making America great again.\" Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S.",
      "While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action,\" Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report.",
      "Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, \"an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter,\" he added.",
      "Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to \"differentiate between signal and noise,\" Arone said.",
      "\"And, rightly or wrongly, the Trump administration uses the economy and stock market as barometers for its success,\" he added. \"They won't purposefully harm the economy or the bull market.\"",

    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 China has responded to President Trump's trade war with defiance, something Mr. Trump is not accustomed to. Now facing 20% tariffs on all exports to the U.S., Beijing has refused to back down \u2014 despite its own economic problems \u2014 and is hitting the U.S. with its own retaliatory tariffs. The air of strength from Beijing was projected clearly on Wednesday at the opening of the National People's Congress.",
      "Thousands of delegates from around the country descended on the Chinese capital's central Tiananmen Square. Dressed in their finery, including some in traditional garments, they came to Beijing for the most important event in China's political calendar. But for the members of China's rubber-stamp legislature, certain topics were clearly off limits when speaking with CBS News.",
      "None of the legislators would respond when asked about any concerns they might have regarding the trade war between the world's two largest economies, or whether Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping might be able to get over their differences.",
      "Once inside the cavernous Great Hall of the People, the cameras turned to the main event. While the NPC is focused mainly on China's sluggish economy, this year, that discussion and the public proclamations are being overshadowed by geopolitical events \u2014 and the trade war with the U.S. in particular.",
      "President Xi, who's government announced its retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. just one day before the NPC opened, was an observer at the massive gathering on Wednesday. His deputy, Premier Li Qiang, delivered the keynote address.",
      "He announced an ambitious\u00a0GDP growth target of 5% and committed more fiscal resources aimed at stimulating the economy, which is mired in youth unemployment and weak consumer spending, in addition to the lingering fallout from a property crisis.",
      "Li acknowledged the geopolitical tension China is facing, including a reference to the escalating trade war that, at least from public view, shows no signs of abating.",
      "But some of the Chinese delegates in attendance tried to remain hopeful, at least when speaking with CBS News.",
      "\"As this sort of rivalry goes on, there will come a point where we can have a good settlement,\" predicted Delegate Lin Shun-chao, from Hong Kong.",
      "While many Chinese people hope Beijing and Washington will eventually reach a trade deal, it's worth noting how stock markets in both countries have reacted to the tit-for-tat tariffs thus far: Chinese stocks overall are up about 15% from the beginning of the year, while U.S. markets are down almost 2%.",
      "It's another sign \u2014 and perhaps a more telling one than the rhetoric from the podium at the NPC \u2014 of a belief in China that the country's economy will be able to manage whatever Mr. Trump throws at it.",

    "story": [
      "The Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports near the Panama Canal has agreed to sell shares of its units that operate the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., after President Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.",
      "In a press release, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and all shares in Hutchison Port Group Holdings, in a deal valued at $22.8 billion. The two units hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group that operates 43 ports in 23 countries, including two of the four major ports that exist along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",
      "The consortium, comprised of BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited will acquire 90% interests in Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, according to the filing.",
      "\"This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP's combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients. These world-class ports facilitate global growth,\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a joint announcement with TilL of the deal. \"Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.",
      "In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports \"give China ready observation posts\" to take action. \"This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,\" Cruz said.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.",
      "Panama quit China's Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio's visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the move in his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, saying that \"to further enhance our national security, our administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.\"",
      "\"Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal, and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal, and a couple of other canals,\" the president said.",
      "Victory for Trump",
      "With 40 million container ships passing through every year, the Panama Canal \u2014 a 51 mile waterway that cuts through Central America, linking the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans \u2014 is vital to the U.S. economy. Disputes over the canal were first sparked in 2024 when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, made accusations that Chinese companies have taken control of the ports.",
      "But while much attention was focused on Mr. Trump's threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the canal's key ports, at either end of the canal. As a result of BlackRock's deal with CK Hutchison Holding, those two key ports will be placed under American control.",
      "The United States is the canal's largest user, with about 70% of shipping traffic going through the canal either coming to or from the U.S. Its second largest user is China.",
      "Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over.",

      "The SSA said it is continuing to pay the retroactive benefits to eligible Social Security beneficiaries, whose monthly payments will increase beginning in April, reflecting March's benefit.",

      "What is the average Social Security retroactive payment?",
      "The retroactive payments are due to the law's elimination of two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",

The market's trajectory could continue downward, he added, depending on how long the tariffs remain in effect.",
      "The burgeoning trade war between the U.S., China, Canada and Mexico is helping to extend a recent slump for U.S. stocks that was prompted by signs of weakness in the economy.

Target reported Tuesday that sales and profit in the crucial holiday quarter both fell from a year ago, though they were better than expected. The Minnesota retailer said there will be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year because of tariffs and other costs.",
      "Shares of Target and Best Buy fell after the retailers warned of pressure on sales and higher prices for consumers. Target shares tumbled $3.62, or 3.0%, to $117.14.",

    "summary": "President Trump warned that the arrest of prominent Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil by federal immigration authorities is the first \"of many to come.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump warned Monday that this weekend's arrest of prominent Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil by federal immigration authorities is the first \"of many to come\" amid his administration's crackdown on students and alleged \"agitators\" protesting Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza.",
      "The president wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social that his administration \"will not tolerate\" what he said is \"pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American\" activity on college campuses across the country, and claimed the protests are being waged by \"paid agitators,\" rather than students. As a student at Columbia University last spring, Khalil helped lead demonstrations protesting Israel and the war in Gaza.",
      "\"We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country \u2014 never to return again,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America's Colleges and Universities to comply.\"",
      "The president said the Saturday night arrest of Khalil is \"the first arrest of many to come.\"",
      "Last year, Khalil and other Columbia students set up an encampment on the school's main lawn to protest the ongoing war in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, which Israel launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack. More than 1,200 people in southern Israel were killed in the massacre and another 251 were taken hostage. Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in the fighting since, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "Khalil's lawyer, Amy Greer, said in a statement that he was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Saturday night. Greer said the ICE agents said Khalil's student visa had been revoked, but Greer noted that he is a U.S. green card holder.",
      "She has since filed a petition on Khalil's behalf challenging his arrest and detention. Greer said in her statement that immigration authorities also threatened to arrest Khalil's wife, who is a U.S. citizen and eight months pregnant.",
      "\"We will vigorously be pursuing Mahmoud's rights in court, and will continue our efforts to right this terrible and inexcusable \u2014 and calculated \u2014 wrong committed against him,\" Greer said. \"ICE's arrest and detention of Mahmoud follows the U.S. government's open repression of student activism and political speech, specifically targeting students at Columbia University for criticism of Israel's assault on Gaza. The U.S. government has made clear that they will use immigration enforcement as a tool to suppress that speech.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Khalil's arrest was \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.\" The agency alleged that Khalil \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X that the Trump administration \"will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is scheduled to vote Monday on former GOP Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer's nomination to lead the Labor Department under President Trump.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer served one two-year term in the House, becoming the first Republican woman elected to represent Oregon in Congress. Mr. Trump nominated Chavez-DeRemer as labor secretary after she lost her reelection bid in November, and her confirmation vote comes as nearly all of the president's Cabinet nominees have been approved by the Senate.",
      "With a history of support for pro-labor policies, Chavez-DeRemer's path to confirmation once appeared threatened. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, has opposed her nomination, and predicted in January that she would lose more than a dozen Republican votes. But she appeared poised for confirmation Monday, with support on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, a bill that would have made it easier for workers to unionize that was introduced in the last Congress. During her confirmation hearing last month, Chavez-DeRemer addressed her prior support for the bill, saying it was \"imperfect,\" while backing right-to-work laws that allow workers to choose whether or not to join a union.",
      "Though Paul's opposition threatened to tank Chavez-DeRemer's advancement out of committee last month, three Democrats on the committee ultimately voted to move her nomination forward. And although Democrats haven't been eager to support some of Mr. Trump's nominees amid intense criticism of the administration's work so far, Chavez-DeRemer was expected to see bipartisan support Monday.",
      "Monday's confirmation vote comes after Chavez-DeRemer's nomination cleared a procedural hurdle in a 66-30 vote last week, with 15 Democrats voting with all present Republicans except Paul to advance her nomination.",
      "Though some of her previous views may have conflicted with the administration, Chavez-DeRemer committed during her confirmation hearing to implementing Mr. Trump's policy vision.",

    "summary": "Congress is staring down a deadline to fund the government by the end of the week, as the familiar threat of a shutdown looms over Washington.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress is staring down a deadline to fund the government by the end of the week, as the familiar threat of a shutdown looms over Washington.",
      "Lawmakers have until the end of the day on Friday, March 14, to fund the government. But it remains to be seen whether House Republicans will be able to muster the near-unanimous GOP support they'll need to pass the short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution.",
      "Here's what to know about the funding fight:",
      "What is a government shutdown, exactly?",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding or funding extensions for federal agencies and programs, resulting in a funding gap that prompts federal agencies to shut down projects and activities. During a shutdown, agencies halt nonessential functions until Congress approves funding and the president signs it into law. Essential services, like air traffic control and law enforcement, continue during a shutdown, but workers go without pay until funding is passed. Shutdowns can also disrupt processing of government benefits, loans and applications and shutter national parks.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have used funding deadlines to their advantage in recent decades, leveraging the threat of a government shutdown to pass spending bills with their priorities attached. But lawmakers generally have strong incentives to avoid shutdowns, since they can be economically and politically costly. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the last funding lapse caused a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "How does Congress fund the government?",
      "Article I of the Constitution gives \u00a0Congress the power to approve any money spent by the federal government. Bills to approve that spending must originate in the House, pass the Senate and be signed by the president before departments and agencies can use the funds.",
      "Congress is tasked annually with approving spending bills before the beginning of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. Under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the president is supposed to submit a budget to Congress by the first Monday of February, outlining how much the executive branch needs for the coming year. The House and Senate budget committees then go on to pass a budget resolution by the middle of April, before the House begins considering the 12 individual appropriations bills drafted by subcommittees to fund different areas of the government, to be concluded by the end of June.",
      "In recent decades, Congress has hardly ever stuck to that timeline. Instead, lawmakers opt almost every year for continuing resolutions that extend funding before ultimately adopting massive bills, known as omnibus packages, in lieu of the 12 appropriations bills to get the new funding over the finish line. Tucked within those omnibus packages are often policies or programs that wouldn't pass if they were taken up in isolation, making them appealing to some lawmakers.",
      "Currently, Congress is still working on the funding process that was meant to be resolved by October of last year. Lawmakers passed a funding patch just ahead of the deadline in late September, giving themselves three more months to reach an agreement on new government funding and pass appropriations bills. Then in December, Congress approved another extension, setting up the March 14 deadline.",
      "What needs to happen this week to prevent a shutdown?",
      "To fund the government and avert a shutdown, both the House and Senate need to pass a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, extending funding. The measure would then go to President Trump for his signature.",
      "House Republicans unveiled a continuing resolution over the weekend, which would extend government funding through September. The stopgap measure would increase defense spending, along with additional funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. The bill also includes more funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "The resolution first goes to the House Rules Committee, before a vote on the floor as soon as Tuesday. Republicans, who have a razor-thin majority in the House, are working to shore up support on the measure, with opposition expected from House Democrats. Already at least one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, has pledged to oppose the continuing resolution.",
      "If the House is unable to find the necessary support for the six-month continuing resolution, lawmakers would likely move to a shorter-term funding measure that would give appropriators more time to flesh out new spending bills. Democrats have signaled in recent days that they prefer the latter approach, which would likely find wide bipartisan margins in both chambers, while frustrating conservatives.",
      "Many Democrats have reservations about the six-month stopgap measure, warning that it would give the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. That's because a continuing resolution, unlike regular appropriations bills, lacks a congressional statement of direction on how funds are to be spent by a department or agency. Democrats have also expressed frustration with the spending reductions in the continuing resolution. But Democrats generally aren't inclined to let the government shut down, and House Republicans \u2014 expected to leave town after the stopgap measure passes \u2014 are exerting pressure to avoid a shutdown.",
      "Should the House find enough support to approve the six-month stopgap measure, it would then go to the Senate. But the upper chamber poses its own hurdles. Republicans have a 53-seat majority in the Senate, but 60 votes are necessary to propel the bill to passage, meaning support from Democrats will be needed. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has also pledged to oppose the measure, making support from at least eight Democrats necessary to pass the measure and send it to the president's desk.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "Since the current budget process was enacted in 1976, Congress has prompted 20 funding gaps lasting at least one full day, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Many of those funding lapses were short lived and didn't prompt a shutdown, while a handful have been lengthy funding fights with major political significance and impact. In 2013, a feud over the Affordable Care Act prompted a shutdown. And disagreements over immigration prompted two shutdowns in 2018 \u2014 the second of which marked the most recent government shutdown, and the longest on record.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history started in 2018 and lasted 34 days. The shutdown occurred over an impasse on funding for Mr. Trump's border wall during his first term. But as the fight stretched into the new year, the president signed a bill to reopen the government without his demands being met.",
      "Before the 2018-2019 shutdown, a 1995-1996 shutdown held the record for the longest, at 21 days. The dispute concerned disagreement over spending cuts between President Bill Clinton and then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "summary": "\"CANCELLED: $600,000 grant to study 'menstrual cycles in transgender men,'\" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said on X last week. That's not what it was.",
    "story": [
      "Last Friday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins stated on X that a $600,000 grant to Southern University in Louisiana was being revoked for studying \"menstrual cycles in transgender men,\" in the latest mischaracterization of a grant that was then canceled by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency team, known as DOGE.",
      "DOGE highlighted the Rollins post, reposting it on the official doge.gov website and on X.",
      "The grant was actually intended for research on the potential health risks posed by synthetic feminine hygiene products and for developing alternatives using natural fibers and fabrics, according to the project's documentation, which was publicly filed on the USDA website.",
      "According to that documentation, the goals of the grant were to develop sustainable feminine hygiene products using regenerative cotton, wool, and industrial hemp while enhancing education through an extension program that teaches women and girls about menstrual health and reusable products. It also would have funded a fiber processing center for locally grown fibers in Louisiana \u2014 potentially benefiting a state with some of the highest unemployment and poverty rates in the country.",
      "The USDA's decision to cancel the grant appears to have been a result of the grant being flagged to the Trump administration by the American Principles Project, a conservative think tank.",
      "Cailey Myers, a spokesperson for the American Principles Project, said in an email to CBS News, \"This grant clearly denies biological reality \u2014 men don't menstruate,\" but did not provide any evidence the grant funded research into \"menstrual cycles in transgender men.\"",
      "A USDA spokesperson confirmed this reasoning in a statement emailed to CBS News, saying the taxpayer-funded education component of the grant \"prioritized women identifying as men who might menstruate.\"",
      "\"This mission certainly does not align with the priorities and policies of the Trump Administration, which maintains that there are two sexes: male and female,\" the statement said.",
      "While the grant language does include a single sentence acknowledging that transgender men are among those who menstruate, there was no indication that they were the focus of the grant or even part of it. The passing reference to transgender men in the original grant application appears to be the sole justification for its cancellation.",
      "The description of the grant's goals, objectives and project methods contains no mention of prioritizing transgender men and focuses solely on the development of menstrual products made from natural fibers. The grant repeatedly notes that it would focus on efforts to \"educate young women and adolescent girls\" about menstrual hygiene products.",
      "The USDA, asked in a follow-up question whether it had any evidence that the study prioritized transgender men, did not respond.",
      "The true purpose of the project, according to the grant, was to \"address the growing concerns and issues surrounding menstruation, including the potential health risks posed to users of synthetic feminine hygiene products.\"",
      "According to 2022 study published in the journal Current Environmental Health Reports, there have only been limited studies on the risks of environmental contamination from synthetic hygiene products, despite the potential for toxic chemical exposure. Some of the concerns include whether exposure to heavy metals and PFAS chemicals could be harmful or cancer causing.",
      "Dr. Samii Kennedy Benson, who oversaw the program, told the local NBC affiliate WVLA the program held potential for U.S. farmers.",
      "\"Our local fiber processing facility will benefit local farmers who often grow fibers on a smaller scale and so we'll also have that ability to provide something local,\" Benson said.",
      "CBS affiliate WAFB in Baton Rouge also covered the project.",
      "In an email, Benson told CBS News that she received notification her grant had been canceled on Saturday but had not been aware of why until contacted by CBS News.",
      "Southern University, which is a public historically Black land-grant university in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told CBS News \"the term 'transgender men' was only used once to state that this project, through the development of safer and healthier FHPs [feminine hygiene products], would benefit all biological women.\"",
      "A statement from Southern University said the grant was reviewed by researchers from throughout the country before going forward.",
      "Although the overall dollar amount of the grant is small in the larger context of government spending, it was posted by a Trump Cabinet secretary and re-shared by DOGE. As a result, the tweets reached over 5 million people on X by Sunday evening. It was also covered by Fox News and other conservative outlets.",
      "Since DOGE first began posting to its \"wall of receipts,\" news organizations have found numerous mistakes in both the claims of money saved and the descriptions of programs being shut down.",
      "In one instance, a contract was alleged to have been worth $8 billion, but was in fact worth just $8 million. Additionally, hundreds of millions of contracts and grants have been removed from the \"wall of receipts\" after reporters exposed errors including double or triple postings of the same contract.",
      "DOGE has also claimed credit for the sale of a building in Washington, D.C., that was sold at auction under the Biden administration.",
      "Hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts have been canceled due to inclusion of phrases or words that the Trump administration believes are associated with diversity, equity or inclusion, or DEI \u2014 initiatives Mr. Trump is seeking to ban by executive order \u2014 or for conflicting with his executive order declaring that the federal government recognizes only \"two sexes, male and female.\""

    "summary": "The dispute will be heard by the Supreme Court in its next term, which begins in October.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to take up a challenge to state and local laws that ban so-called \"conversion therapy\" for LGBTQ children.",
      "The dispute before the court arose out of a Colorado law that prohibits licensed mental health professionals from engaging in conversion therapy on children who may be questioning their sexual orientation or gender identity. More than 20 states and the District of Columbia have similar laws on the books. The case will be heard in the Supreme Court's next term, which begins in October. A decision is expected by the end of June 2026.",
      "Colorado enacted the Minor Conversion Therapy Law in 2019 following what the state said was a growing mental health crisis among young people in the state and \"mounting evidence\" that conversion therapy is tied to increased depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation.",
      "The law prohibits \"any practice or treatment [upon minors] \u2026 that attempts or purports to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\"",
      "The state joined more than a dozen others in disciplining mental health professionals who practice conversion therapy on minors. Those who are found to engage in this practice face a range of punishments, from fines to a letter of admonition to having their license revoked.",
      "The challenge to Colorado's law was brought by Kaley Chiles, a professional counselor who is licensed by the state and uses talk therapy in her practice. A practicing Christian, Chiles works with adults and young people, and many of her clients are also Christian.",
      "According to court papers, some of Chiles' clients seek Christian-based counseling \"to reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body.\"",
      "Chiles' sued the state of Colorado in September 2022 and sought to block enforcement of the state's restriction on conversion therapy. She argued that the measure violates her free speech rights under the First Amendment and censors her conversations with clients based on viewpoint.",
      "A federal district court declined to block the law, finding that it regulates professional conduct that incidentally involves speech. The court also found that conversion therapy is \"ineffective and harms minors.\"",
      "Chiles' appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which upheld the lower court's decision. The 10th Circuit said that the restriction on conversion therapy implicates speech solely as to the practice of mental health treatment, which can be licensed by the state. The appeals court also concluded that Colorado's law advances its interests in protecting minors and the integrity of the mental health profession.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, lawyers for Chiles argued that she does not seek to \"cure\" her clients of same-sex attractions or change their sexual orientation. Instead, they said she aims to help her clients \"with their stated desires and objectives in counseling, which sometimes includes clients seeking to reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with one's physical body.\"",
      "\"Colorado disagrees with Chiles's beliefs on gender and sexuality. So much so that the State puts itself in Chiles's counseling room, forbidding her from discussing the values she and her clients share,\" her lawyers wrote in a Supreme Court filing. She is represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group.",
      "But Colorado officials said that the First Amendment allows states to regulate professional conduct to protect patients from \"substandard treatment,\"even when that rule \"incidentally\" burdens speech. They argued that efforts to change a young person's sexual orientation or gender identity are \"unsafe and ineffective.\"",
      "\"A professional's treatment of her patients and clients is fundamentally different, for First Amendment purposes, from laypersons' interactions with each other,\" Colorado officials wrote in a filing. \"Unlike laypersons, those who choose to practice as health professionals are required, among various other responsibilities, to provide treatment to their patients consistent with their field's standard of care.\"",
      "The state argued that Chiles' claim undercut the ability of states to protect patients and clients from \"harmful professional conduct.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has been asked before to jump into the debate over conversion therapy, but had previously declined to intervene.

    "summary": "Air Force fighter jets intercepted aircraft flying near Donald Trump's Florida home twice over the weekend.",
    "story": [
      "Air Force fighter jets intercepted a civilian aircraft flying in the temporarily restricted airspace near President Donald Trump's Florida home Sunday, bringing the number of violations to more than 20 since the president took office on Jan. 20.",
      "North American Aerospace Defense Command said in a statement that Sunday's incident, which took place as Trump finished a round of golf at his West Palm Beach golf course, saw F-16s deploy flares to get the attention of the civilian pilot. Jets also conducted an intercept on Saturday morning shortly after Mr. Trump arrived at the course from his private Mar-a-Lago club and residence.",
      "The airspace intrusions in the heavily congested south Florida airspace have prompted fighter jet intercepts but did not alter Mr. Trump's schedule or impact his security, officials said. NORAD says the flares may have been visible from the ground but that they burn out quickly and don't pose danger.",
      "Federal officials maintain a permanent flight restriction over Mr. Trump's club that expands to a radius of 30 nautical miles when the president is in residence.",
      "Violations, and intercepts, are relatively routine, but NORAD is raising alarm over the frequency of the intrusions since Mr. Trump's inauguration, saying it has responded to more than 20 incidents and blames civilian pilots for not following regulations requiring them to check for airspace restrictions before taking off.",
      "NORAD has urged aircrews to check Notice to Airmen, or NOTAMs, from the FAA before flying, \"especially in the Mar-a-Lago region.\" The FAA uses NOTAMs\u00a0to inform pilots of temporary flight restrictions, which prohibit aircraft from entering certain airspaces for set periods of time. Restrictions are issued \"for safety or security purposes,\" including for natural disasters, some major sporting events and emergency or national security situations, the FAA says.",
      "\"Adherence to TFR procedures is essential to ensure flight safety, national security, and the security of the President,\" Gen. Gregory Guillot, the commander of NORAD and US Northern Command said in a statement. \"The procedures are not optional, and the excessive number of recent TFR violations indicates many civil aviators are not reading Notice to Airmen, or NOTAMS, before each flight as required by the FAA, and has resulted in multiple responses by NORAD fighter aircraft to guide offending aircraft out of the TFR.\"",
      "In 2017, during Mr. Trump's first term as president, two F-15 fighter jets were scrambled to intercept an unresponsive aircraft near Mar-a-Lago and officials said the\u00a0incident created a \"sonic boom\"\u00a0that alarmed nearby residents.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday turned away a bid by Republican-led states to block lawsuits brought by a group of Democratic-led states that seek to hold oil and gas companies accountable for their fossil fuel products' contributions to climate change.",
      "The court's decision to stay out of the dispute allows the five blue states to pursue lawsuits filed against the energy industry in their own courts. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented from the court's decision not to allow the red states to seek its intervention.",
      "\"Our exclusive original jurisdiction over suits between states reflects a determination by the framers and by Congress about the need 'to open and keep open the highest court of the nation' for such suits, in recognition of the 'rank and dignity of the states,\" Thomas wrote in a dissent joined by Alito. \"Yet, this court has \u2014 essentially for policy reasons \u2014 assumed a power to summarily turn away suits between states. The court today exercises that power to reject a suit involving nearly half the states in the nation, which alleges serious constitutional violations.\"",
      "The lawsuits",
      "The novel suits were brought by California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey and Rhode Island and seek to hold energy companies liable for allegedly deceiving the public about the dangers of their fossil-fuel products.",
      "Filed between 2018 and 2023, the suits allege claims arising under state laws but broadly accuse the energy industry of knowing for decades that greenhouse gas emissions would contribute to climate change. The states claim that oil and gas companies engaged in deceptive marketing by misrepresenting the dangers of their fossil fuel products, which caused consumers to use more of them.",
      "The oil and gas companies sought to move nearly all the cases to federal court, arguing that federal law governs interstate emissions, but the efforts were rejected by U.S. courts of appeals.",
      "The cases are now proceeding in state courts and are in the early stages of litigation.",
      "Oil and gas companies separately asked the Supreme Court to shut down a lawsuit brought by the city of Honolulu that is seeking to hold the industry liable for harms caused by the effects of climate change. But the high court in January said it would not consider the appeal from the 15 companies, including Sunono and Shell, which cleared the way for the cases to move forward in Hawaii state court.",
      "Alabama and 18 other Republican-led states separately went to the Supreme Court and urged it to exercise its original jurisdiction over disputes between the states. They asked the high court to block the civil suits filed by the Democratic-led states and prevent other litigation seeking similar relief in the future.",
      "The red states allege that the claims pending in state court seek to regulate activity outside of the blue states' borders and involve an area governed by federal law.",
      "They argued in a Supreme Court filing that the blue states are seeking \"massive\" penalties and relief against energy producers that are not based in their states. If the Democratic-led states succeed, they warned it would have sweeping impacts on the national energy system.",
      "\"If defendant states are right about the substance and reach of state law, their actions imperil access to affordable energy everywhere and inculpate every state and indeed every person on the planet,\" the red states wrote. \"Consequently, defendant states threaten not only our system of federalism and equal sovereignty among States, but our basic way of life.\"",
      "But the attorneys general for the blue states told the court\u00a0that their state-court actions seek to address local harms resulting from allegedly unlawful deceptive conduct by the oil and gas companies.",
      "They argued that Alabama and the red states have not satisfied the standard governing the Supreme Court's exercise of original jurisdiction.",
      "\"Accurately understood, the state enforcement actions that Alabama targets do not intrude on the sovereign prerogatives of Alabama or any other state,\" the blue states wrote. \"Even if each one of those actions succeeds, Alabama and other states will remain free to pursue their own energy policy goals.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump may want more than the long-anticipated minerals and economic partnership deal to end the pause he has put on U.S. military and intelligence support for Ukraine in its war against Russia, but his specific terms for restarting aid remain murky.",
      "\"The president of the United States did not say it has ended. He said it is paused. That is transitional,\" U.S. envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg told Margaret Brennan in conversation at Council on Foreign Relations on Thursday. The envoy indicated he personally was unaware of what would determine that decision.",
      "\"That's his call. And I would leave it up to him to make the decision when he thinks it's equitable or when a pause should be lifted,\" Kellogg added.",
      "Diplomatic sources told CBS News on Sunday that there is no indication that U.S. aid will be switched back on.",
      "\"I think we can see the impact. It's certainly, on the one hand, emboldened Russia to really step up the attacks. And it's also not just blindsided, but also partially blinded Ukraine,\" said Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the U.S. National Security Council during Mr. Trump's first administration, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"And frankly, I think it's going to be an impetus to other allies to start stepping up their own capabilities and questioning themselves about the virtues of sharing with the United States,\" Hill added. \"I mean, this is a two way street. We have to remember that other countries also share pretty vital information with the United States, even if the scale is not quite the same.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to meet with Ukrainian officials this week in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for the first face-to-face discussions since the explosive Oval Office confrontation between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that triggered the U.S. cutoff. National security adviser Mike Waltz made remarks Friday in the Oval Office that raised expectations that he would discuss not only reviving a minerals deal but also try to get a ceasefire in place, and \"drive peace home.\" Trump friend and envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff separately announced that he'd be part of the team.",
      "Ukraine's Zelenskyy will not be in the Tuesday meeting. He announced that he would be in Saudi Arabia on Monday, and that a Ukrainian delegation \u2014 including key aide Andry Yermak, along with Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, and deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa \u2014 would meet with the Americans.",
      "\"The fact they are coming here at senior levels is a good indication to us that they want to sit down and they're ready to move forward,\" a senior State Department official told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.",
      "Ukraine envoy Kellogg told Brennan on Thursday that the Trump administration was waiting on what he referred to as Ukraine's \"term sheet\" for ending the war, and said the Russian version had already been received. Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokesperson, said in a statement on Friday that Rubio spoke with Ukraine's foreign minister about \"all sides\" taking steps to secure a sustainable peace, which would suggest a request for Ukrainian concessions. It is not clear if Russia has offered any at all. Kellogg said that Trump has talked about the potential of Ukraine getting territory back from the Russians, but acknowledged that the U.S. president did not specify which territory.",
      "It is also unclear what would trigger any U.S. pressure on Russia. Mr. Trump posted on social media that he would consider sanctions on Russian energy and banking, but then later said in the Oval Office that Putin's stepped up attacks on Ukraine during the U.S. pause was something \"anybody would do.\"",
      "\"I don't believe what he said for a second about the sanctions,\" said Fiona Hill on \"Face the Nation.\" \"I believe more what he just said there in the Oval Office, sitting behind, you know, the resolute desk.\"",
      "\"He sees, you know, obviously, the Ukraine- Ukrainians, and he said that in the Oval Office during the meeting with President Zelensky, that he sees them on the back foot, as losing, and he's basically telling them that they have to capitulate. Very clear,\" she continued",
      "Kellogg said Thursday that there was room for further U.S. pressure on Moscow especially when it comes to enforcement of existing sanctions.",
      "\"I think it was between one to 10, we're probably at a seven. The problem is with enforcement, we're probably at a three,\" Kellogg said. \"I think the most important thing is the enforcement sanctions, not to serve the sanctions themselves.\"",
      "CBS News confirmed via three U.S. officials that the U.S. has paused lethal intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which includes no longer providing coordinates for targeting of Ukrainian strikes for U.S.-provided weapons like HIMARS.",

      "\"In accordance with the Administration's directive on support to Ukraine, NGA has temporarily suspended access to the Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery system, or GEGD, which is the primary portal for access to U.S. government-purchased commercial imagery,\" an NGA spokesperson said.",
      "In a statement Saturday, private sector imagery company Maxar confirmed that the U.S. government had \"temporarily suspended Ukrainian accounts\" in its Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery program, which provides Ukraine access to commercial satellite imagery collected by U.S. intelligence.",
      "The Trump administration also halted the transfer of any of the $3.85 billion in remaining military equipment designated for delivery to Ukraine. In addition, the European Command told CBS in a statement that it had been ordered to mothball deliveries of weapons already in transit from past shipments approved by the Biden administration prior to January 20th.",

    "story": [
      "Seven years ago, Erica Green learned through a Facebook post that her brother had been shot.",
      "She rushed to check on him at a hospital run by Denver Health, the city's safety-net system, but she was unable to get information from emergency room workers, who complained that she was creating a disturbance.",
      "\"I was distraught and outside, crying, and Jerry came out of the front doors,\" she said.",
      "Jerry Morgan is a familiar face from Green's Denver neighborhood. He had rushed to the hospital after his pager alerted him to the shooting. As a violence prevention professional with the At-Risk Intervention and Mentoring program, or AIM, Morgan supports gun-violence patients and their families at the hospital \u2014 as he did the day Green's brother was shot.",
      "\"It made the situation of that traumatic experience so much better. After that, I was, like, I want to do this work,\" Green said.",
      "Today, Green works with Morgan as the program manager for AIM, a hospital-linked violence intervention program launched in 2010 as a partnership between Denver Health and the nonprofit Denver Youth Program. It since has expanded to include Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado Hospital.",
      "AIM is one of dozens of hospital-linked violence intervention programs around the country. The programs aim to uncover the social and economic factors that contributed to someone ending up in the ER with a bullet wound: inadequate housing, job loss, or feeling unsafe in one's neighborhood, for example.",
      "Such programs that take a public health approach to stopping gun violence have had success \u2014 one in San Francisco reported a fourfold reduction in violent injury recidivism rates over six years. But President Trump's executive orders calling for the review of the Biden administration's gun policies and trillions of dollars in federal grants and loans have created uncertainty around the programs' long-term federal funding. Some organizers believe their programs will be just fine, but others are looking to shore up alternative funding sources.",
      "\"We've been worried about, if a domino does fall, how is it going to impact us? There's a lot of unknowns,\" said John Torres, associate director for Youth Alive, an Oakland, California-based nonprofit.",
      "Federal data shows that gun violence became a leading cause of death among children and young adults at the start of this decade and was tied to more than 48,000 deaths among people of all ages in 2022. New York-based pediatric trauma surgeon Chethan Sathya, a National Institutes of Health-funded firearms injury prevention researcher, believes those statistics show that gun violence can't be ignored as a health care issue. \"It's killing so many people,\" Sathya said.",
      "Research shows that a violent injury puts someone at heightened risk for future ones, and the risk of death goes up significantly by the third violent injury, according to a 2006 study published in The Journal of Trauma: Injury, Infection and Critical Care.",
      "Benjamin Li, an emergency medicine physician at Denver Health and the health system's AIM medical director, said the ER is an ideal setting to intervene in gun violence by working to reverse-engineer what led to a patient's injuries.",
      "\"If you are just seeing the person, patching them up, and then sending them right back into the exact same circumstances, we know it's going to lead to them being hurt again,\" Li said. \"It's critical we address the social determinants of health and then try to change the equation.\"",
      "That might mean providing alternative solutions to gunshot victims who might otherwise seek retaliation, said Paris Davis, the intervention programs director for Youth Alive.",
      "\"If that's helping them relocate out of the area, if that's allowing them to gain housing, if that's shifting that energy into education or job or, you know, family therapy, whatever the needs are for that particular case and individual, that is what we provide,\" Davis said.",
      "AIM outreach workers meet gunshot wound victims at their hospital bedsides to have what Morgan, AIM's lead outreach worker, calls a tough, nonjudgmental conversation on how the patients ended up there.",
      "AIM uses that information to help patients access the resources they need to navigate their biggest challenges after they're discharged, Morgan said. Those challenges can include returning to school or work, or finding housing. AIM outreach workers might also attend court proceedings and assist with transportation to health care appointments.",
      "\"We try to help in whatever capacity we can, but it's interdependent on whatever the client needs,\" Morgan said.",
      "Since 2010, AIM has grown from three full-time outreach workers to nine, and this year opened the REACH Clinic in Denver's Five Points neighborhood. The community-based clinic provides wound-care kits; physical therapy; and behavioral, mental and occupational health care. In the coming months, it plans to add bullet removal to its services. It's part of a growing movement of community-based clinics focused on violent injuries, including the Bullet Related Injury Clinic in St. Louis.",
      "Ginny McCarthy, an assistant professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Colorado, described REACH as an extension of the hospital-based work, providing holistic treatment in a single location and building trust between health care providers and communities of color that have historically experienced racial biases in medical care.",
      "Caught in the Crossfire, created in 1994 and run by Youth Alive in Oakland, is cited as the nation's first hospital-linked violence intervention program and has since inspired others. The Health Alliance for Violence Intervention, a national network initiated by Youth ALIVE to advance public health solutions to gun violence, counted 74 hospital-linked violence intervention programs among its membership as of January.",
      "The alliance's executive director, Fatimah Loren Dreier, compared medicine's role in addressing gun violence to that of preventing an infectious disease, like cholera. \"That disease spreads if you don't have good sanitation in places where people aggregate,\" she said.",
      "Dreier, who also serves as executive director of the Kaiser Permanente Center for Gun Violence Research and Education, said medicine identifies and tracks patterns that lead to the spread of a disease or, in this case, the spread of violence.",
      "\"That is what health care can do really well to shift society. When we deploy this, we get better outcomes for everybody,\" Dreier said.",
      "The alliance, of which AIM is a member, offers technical assistance and training for hospital-linked violence intervention programs and successfully petitioned to make their services eligible for traditional insurance reimbursement.",
      "In 2021, President Joe Biden issued an executive action that opened the door for states to use Medicaid for violence prevention. Several states, including California, New York, and Colorado, have passed legislation establishing a Medicaid benefit for hospital-linked violence intervention programs.",
      "Last summer, then-U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared gun violence a public health crisis, and the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act earmarked $1.4 billion in funding for a wide array of violence-prevention programs through next year.",
      "But in early February, Mr. Trump issued an executive order instructing the U.S. attorney general to conduct a 30-day review of a number of Biden's policies on gun violence. The White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention now appears to be defunct, and recent moves to freeze federal grants created uncertainty among the gun-violence prevention programs that receive federal funding.",
      "AIM receives 30% of its funding from its operating agreement with Denver's Office of Community Violence Solutions, according to Li. The rest is from grants, including Victims of Crime Act funding, through the Department of Justice. As of mid-February, Mr. Trump's executive orders had not affected AIM's current funding.",
      "Some who work with the hospital-linked violence prevention programs in Colorado are hoping a new voter-approved\u00a0firearms and ammunition excise tax in the state, expected to generate about $39 million annually and support victim services, could be a new source of funding. But the tax's revenues aren't expected to fully flow until 2026, and it's not clear how that money will be allocated.",
      "Trauma surgeon and public health researcher Catherine Velopulos, who is the AIM medical director at the University of Colorado hospital in Aurora, said any interruption in federal funding, even for a few months, would be \"very difficult for us.\" But Velopulos said she was reassured by the bipartisan support for the kind of work AIM does.",
      "\"People want to oversimplify the problem and just say, 'If we get rid of guns, it's all going to stop,' or 'It doesn't matter what we do, because they're going to get guns, anyway,'\" she said. \"What we really have to address is why people feel so scared that they have to arm themselves.\"",

    "story": [
      "Toronto\u00a0\u2014 Canada's Liberal Party has chosen veteran central bank leader Mark Carney as its new leader, meaning he will quickly replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the country's top office. The transition, and Trudeau's political downfall, comes amid the chaotic trade war with Canada's closest ally launched by President Trump.",
      "The exact date that Carney will take office as Canada's prime minister remains uncertain. The timing of the transition will be determined by Carney in conjunction with Trudeau.",
      "Carney won nearly 86% of the more than 151,000 votes cast. The next closest candidate received 11,144 votes.",
      "The new leader will inherit a government led by a party which has seen its support among the Canadian electorate wane significantly over the past few years. With opposition parties eager to trigger an election, the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. Carney's government could be toppled by Parliament to call for a new national election, which can be called any time between the Parliament going back into session on March 24 and October 20, by which time a vote must be held.",
      "Trudeau announced in January that he would step down as party leader and, with the move, from his role as the prime minister, due to increasing pressure from within the Liberal Party as polls showed its support among voters tanking.",
      "Trudeau's resignation announcement paved the way for the Liberal Party to chose a new leader, and Carney won that internal party election on Sunday \u2014  and many Canadians will hope to see him quickly form a new cabinet and then put his decades of financial experience to work as the country confronts Mr. Trump's trade war.",
      "Who is Mark Carney?",
      "Born in Fort Smith, in Canada's Northwest Territories, Carney grew up in Edmonton before heading to the U.S. to pursue a degree in economics at Harvard University. He later moved to the U.K. and earned a master's degree and then, in 1995, a doctorate in economics from the prestigious University of Oxford.",
      "He was appointed as the Governor of the Bank of Canada \u2014   akin to the Federal Reserve in the U.S. \u2014 in 2008, amid the global financial crisis, which he helped to steer Canada through.",
      "Carney's influence has extended well beyond Canada, however, and not only because he led one of its most important central government institutions. In 2010, Time Magazine named him among the world's 25 most influential leaders. In 2011, Reader's Digest Canada named him the \"Most Trusted Canadian,\" and the editors of Euromoney magazine named him Central Bank Governor of the Year in 2012.",
      "During his tenure as Canada's central banker, he also held several high-profile international positions, including as chair of the Committee on the Global Financial System and head of the Financial Stability Board for the G20 group of the world's biggest economies.",
      "Between 2013 and 2020, Carney moved back to Britain after being tapped as the Governor of the Bank of England, heading up the U.K.'s central bank and helping to guide the country through the economic convulsions brought on by its \"Brexit\" from the European Union. He was the first non-U.K. citizen to govern the institution in its 300-year history.",
      "More recently, Carney served as the United Nations' special envoy on climate action and finance and as head of transition investing at the Brookfield Asset Management firm. He stepped down from both of those positions to pursue his Liberal Party leadership bid.",
      "Carney's reaction to Trump",
      "Mr. Trump's trade war and his frequent threats to make Canada a U.S. \"51st state\" were hot topics during the Liberal Party leadership campaign. Carney, along with the other candidates, emphasized the importance of a strong domestic economy in the face of those threats.",
      "Carney said Canada had allowed its economy to become \"weak,\" leaving it susceptible to Mr. Trump's tariff-based pressure tactics.

    "summary": "Prosecutors said Ryan Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks, before aiming a rifle through shrubs as Trump played golf last September at his golf club.",
    "story": [
      "While President Trump spoke with reporters about federal job cuts and signed executive orders in the Oval Office last Tuesday, a notable \u2014 and unannounced \u2014 visit was underway at Mr. Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. It wasn't publicized. But it could impact one of the highest-profile criminal trials in America this year.",
      "According to court filings reviewed by CBS News, defense attorneys for Ryan Routh were given access to tour the Trump golf course on Feb. 25 to prepare Routh's defense in the alleged assassination attempt against Mr. Trump during a Sept. 15 golf outing. A court filing submitted by Justice Department prosecutors this week said, \"We took the lead in setting up arrangements for this visit even though the prosecution team obviously does not control the course, which is private property.\"",
      "In a March 3 court filing, prosecutors added, \"As we told defense counsel, their request to inspect the firearm in this manner was highly unusual in the experience of the FBI, but nonetheless we made it happen.\"",
      "Prosecutors have also helped provide transport of the rifle allegedly wielded by Routh near Trump's September golf outing.\tAccording to the Justice Department's submissions to a federal judge in Miami, \"To accommodate a defense request, the prosecution team ensured that the firearm, scope, magazine, ammunition, and antiballistic plates were transported from the FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia, to the FBI Field Office in Miramar, Florida, so the defense could inspect it, with purported consultants in tow, in South Florida after the golf course visit.\"",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks, before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at the Trump West Palm Beach country club. Before Trump came into view, Routh was allegedly spotted by a Secret Service agent. Federal authorities accuse Routh of aiming his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions.",
      "A White House spokeswoman declined comment when asked about the defense attorney visit to the president's Florida golf property. FBI, Justice Department officials and Routh's federal public defense attorneys also did not comment.",
      "The federal criminal case against Routh, which gathered widespread attention when it was filed in September, has attracted little attention\u00a0 in the months since. His alleged attempt on Mr. Trump's life was partly overshadowed by the dramatic first assassination attempt last July in Butler, Pennsylvania. Routh's trial is scheduled for September 2025.",
      "Routh's son charged in separate felony case",
      "A CBS News review found Routh's legal case has also given rise to another federal investigation. According to charging documents filed in North Carolina, federal investigators searched the apartment of Routh's son six days after the alleged assassination attempt in September. The court filings said an electronic device discovered in Oran Routh's apartment had \"hundreds of child pornography images.\"",
      "Prosecutors said the initial search of Oran Routh's home was unrelated to the child pornography evidence, but the investigation ultimately revealed multiple devices with suspected child exploitative images.",
      "On Jan. 8, Oren Routh signed a plea agreement in which he acknowledged \"that the material which contained an image of child pornography charged in the Second Superseding Indictment herein involved a prepubescent minor and minor who had not attained 12 years of age.\"",
      "He is scheduled to be sentenced May 14 at the federal courthouse in Greensboro, North Carolina.",
      "Both Oran Routh and his father are being held in pretrial detention pending the resolution of their cases.",
      "Though the two criminal cases are separate, court filings reviewed by CBS News show correspondence between Ryan Routh and his son are part of the evidence that has been collected and noted in Ryan Routh's assassination attempt case in Florida.",
      "If convicted, Ryan Routh faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. According to court records, Routh was convicted of felonies in North Carolina in December 2002 and March 2010.",
      "Ryan Routh's trial is scheduled for Sept. 8, nearly a year to the day after the alleged assassination attempt. The presiding judge is Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by\u00a0 Mr. Trump in 2020. Last year, Cannon dismissed Trump's classified documents federal criminal case.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Fiona Hill, former White House Russia expert, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Russia stepped up its aerial attacks on Ukraine following the Trump administration's suspension of intelligence sharing and military equipment. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Moscow has carried out hundreds of attacks using ballistic missiles and drones. For more now we're joined by Fiona Hill. She is a senior fellow at Brookings, and during the first Trump administration, she was the senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council. Good to have you back.",
      "FIONA HILL: Thanks, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the U.S. pauses of lethal intelligence sharing, including targeting data for U.S. provided weapons like HIMARS, we also know it extends to satellite imagery, which is no longer being shared with Ukraine. What's the practical impact of that and the military freeze?",
      "HILL: Well, I think we can see the impact. It's certainly, on the one hand, emboldened Russia to really step up the attacks. And it's also not just blindsided, but also partially blinded Ukraine. I mean, we heard from the previous segment that there's still some sharing with allies like the United Kingdom, of course, which is part of the Five Eyes sharing with the United States. But frankly, none of the other allies, including the UK, have the same access to satellite imagery as the United States does. So even if there is some sharing, not much restrictions, there certainly has an impact. And frankly, I think it's going to be an impetus to other allies to start stepping up their own capabilities and questioning themselves about the virtues of sharing with the United States. I mean, this is a two way street. We have to remember that other countries also share pretty vital information with the United States, even if the scale is not quite the same.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Canada, the UK, Australia, among those who do so. You think they will essentially punish the U.S. by not sharing intelligence?",
      "HILL: I'm not sure whether it's punishment, but it'll be a lot of questioning about what actually happens with this, because if you're bundling together intelligence, and then effectively, the United States is putting restrictions on that. Was that pre-discussed with our Five Eyes allies, for example, or with other allies? Particularly in the midst of, basically, a conflict that is, as we've heard over and over again, the largest land war in Europe since World War II. I mean, this is really unprecedented in terms of the actions of the United States in this regard, because it's not just affecting Ukraine. Again, it's having knock on effects for all of our other allies who are directly affected, all of our European allies that are directly affected by this conflict.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said on Friday, when he was asked if this uptick in Putin's bombing was directly related to the U.S. halt, here's what he said.",
      "(BEGIN SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "DONALD TRUMP: I actually think he's doing what anybody else would do. I think he's- I think he wants to get it stopped and settled. And I think he's hitting them harder than- than he's been hitting them. And I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now.",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yet earlier in the day, the president had posted on social media he was considering possibly putting sanctions on Russia. That's a contradiction. What do you make of what he said?",
      "FIONA HILL: I make of it exactly what he said. I mean, he's actually, obviously, putting himself in the shoes of Vladimir Putin and saying that if I were the aggressor, that's exactly what I would be doing if I wanted to make Ukraine capitulate. So, I mean, yeah, he called it as it is. I don't believe what he said for a second about the sanctions. I believe more what he just said there in the Oval Office, sitting behind, you know, the resolute desk. I mean, I think if that's what you can take away from this. He actively- that's--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Believe the president when he says things.",
      "HILL: I think you should, yeah. I mean, he is the president of the United States. And he made it crystal clear, I think. And he sees, you know, obviously, the Ukraine- Ukrainians, and he said that in the oval office during the meeting with President Zelensky, that he sees them on the back foot, as losing, and he's basically telling them that they have to capitulate. Very clear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't have the cards, was the line he kept using then.",
      "HILL: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I know you were at the Council on Foreign Relations this week, as was I. I had an interview with Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, and when we were discussing the president's decision to cut off Ukraine. He said, Ukrainians brought it on themselves, and the decision was like, quote, \"hitting a mule with a two by four across the nose. You got their attention.\" It's quite a statement, comparing our ally to a farm animal here that needed to be beaten. Do you think it was right to say the Ukrainian government, though, was just not getting it?",
      "HILL: Well, what they weren't getting is really what President Trump wanted directly from them, which was obviously to have President Zelenskyy make a personal agreement with him in the Oval Office, in front of all the cameras, to thank him profusely for all the aid that was already provided to Ukraine over, you know, successive administrations now, and basically to sign a deal on rare earths minerals, and then basically leave immediately after that. And clearly, President Zelenskyy didn't really get that message. And I think there's a very important element here. In diplomacy, you really should only be speaking in your native language. And I think that there was- a lot of this was lost in translation. First of all, President Zelenskyy didn't fully understand that this agreement was just purely with President Trump. And you may remember, if we all go back and watch that, I watched it many times just to try to figure out exactly where things had gone wrong, and there were multiple points, but there was one point when President Zelenskyy basically said, look, you know, we had deals with your- your previous presidents, basically with Obama and Biden, and President Trump immediately dismissed all of that. And basically said those deals were not worth the paper they were written on, all the commitments that were made--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not me.",
      "HILL: --because they were weak and it wasn't me. And President Zelenskyy didn't quite follow all of this, because, like the rest of our allies, he actually thinks that commitments made by the United States are supposed to hold over successive administrations. And what we learned there, and what he learned there, was, that is not the case. You're essentially going to have to make a new commitment with President Trump. It's a personal commitment, and that was what he was being told, and he didn't fully understand. And I think in future, when the Ukrainians are meeting with the Americans, they ought to have translators with them, because as good as President Zelenskyy's English is, there's two things that he's missing there. He doesn't quite understand the way that President Trump operates, although I think he's probably got the message now, but he doesn't always understand the nuances. And I would also think that our side, on the United States' side, could do with some interpretation as well, coming also from President Zelenskyy. So my advice to President Zelenskyy and to the team around President Trump is, use interpreters. That's what they're there for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And your own government's interpreters.",
      "FIONA HILL: That's absolutely right. Your own government's interpreters, not- because you actually asked that question, whose interpreter we used, and General Kellogg couldn't answer the question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, for Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin for three and a half hours.",
      "HILL: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Europe seems to be taking these threats seriously and looking at an alternative to the American nuclear deterrent and umbrella. That's- does that mean the Transatlantic Alliance is gone?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, it doesn't mean that it's gone, but there's a bit of, a kind of a one sided attempt to rupture it here on the part of the United States. I was also at the Munich Security Conference. I heard Vice President Vance's speech. I was standing next to a couple of very prominent Europeans who were completely in shock. And immediately after that, as you well know, there were many statements coming out of Germany, as well as countries like Sweden, basically asking whether the United States could be trusted on nuclear weapons. And we have to remember that Ukraine had nuclear weapons that it gave up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they gave them up.",
      "HILL: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: With the promise of the security guarantee that was not delivered on.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Tom Suozzi, Democrat of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're joined now by the co-chairs of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick represents a district that was narrowly carried by Kamala Harris, and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi represents a district that went for President Trump. So you all have to find the middle and that brings you together and brings you here today. It's good to see, in a bipartisan fashion, this conversation take place. But I want to start with you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, there is this potential government shutdown looming March 14th. Speaker Johnson says there's going to be a vote on Tuesday. Will Republicans be able to pass this on party lines, or do you need Democratic votes?",
      "REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA): Well, that remains to be seen. You know, the text was just released yesterday, compliant with the 72-hour rule before a vote. We're still digging through it. Like most bills, there's some good in there. There's some not so good in there. And we got to make an aggregated decision. I will say, you know, Tom and I are friends, we came in together. We obviously co-chair this bipartisan group together. And we do lament the fact of any single party bill- the construct in this country is if you get 218 votes, you get everything, and if you get 217 votes you get nothing. And that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So the reason that we do what we do is we want two party solutions, including on the CR. So, it remains to be seen whether the votes are there or not, but I think we're really going to be learning over the next 24 hours what's in it and what's not in it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you haven't decided your vote?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What about you, Congressman Suozzi? Because Leader Jeffries initially said in a letter, Democrats cannot back it. You have the text. Are you a no?",
      "REP. TOM SUOZZI (D-NY): Right now, I'm a no. I mean, there's been no outreach on a bipartisan basis. What Brian and I are trying to do in this environment, you can imagine, is not too easy. Everything's very fractured, everything's very divisive, and to overcome that requires trust building and requires people to work together. In the case of the CR there's been offers to negotiate, and there's been very little negotiated. It's kind of been a my way or the highway type of thing. And I think that's going to go on for a while. I think that the leadership is going to try and do my way or the highway for a while, and then at some point they're going to need Democratic votes. And then people start negotiating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A while, meaning we could be staring down to shut down March 14?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, we'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday. I believe the government funding runs out at the end of the week. We're scheduled to end votes on Wednesday. Oftentimes, that does not happen during weeks like this, but it's- it's incumbent upon every legislator to read the text and to make an aggregate decision. Does the good outweigh the bad? We never want to shut the government down. That's why I think we need no budget, no pay. If you cut legislators' funding off, if they don't pass a CR or a budget, I think you'll have a much different outcome. So people need to put their money where their mouth is.",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Right now, the Republicans are counting on all the Republicans in the House to stick together to pass this through the House with no Democratic votes. That's what they're counting on. That's why they've conducted themselves this way. Then it goes to the Senate. In the Senate, you need 60 votes. You don't have 60 votes with the Senate Republicans. So it's going to become a challenge for the Senate Republicans and the Senate Democrats to decide who's going to get blamed for this thing. And wouldn't it be better if we all just work together to try and find common ground the way- this is not normal what we're doing. The idea of a full year continuing resolution is not the normal process. And there's a lot of bad stuff that I see in this bill that I don't like.",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: And I will add Margaret, I've lived through government shutdowns as an FBI agent, and it's horrific. Title Three wire taps get shut down. Surveillance teams get shut down. It has massive implications that most people don't realize. You never, ever want to shut the government down. It should never happen, and it's a symptom of a broken system that we're even talking about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me follow up with you on that. You are the only FBI agent who- now turned Congressman. On Monday, the top agent at the New York office, James Dennehy, said he was forced out of his job due to clashes with Justice Department officials over a directive. He had been supportive of Bureau leaders who resisted turning over the names of those agents assigned to carry out investigations related to January 6, 2021. Are you concerned about all this political pressure?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: I'm very concerned. I'm a huge defender and supporter of the Bureau. It's the best job I ever had in my life, and the most honorable job I've ever had in my life, keeping America safe. And I care very much about the agent population and the professional support staff that work there. They are tremendous people. They are completely nonpartisan. In 14 years in the FBI, I never heard any political talk whatsoever, which is pretty remarkable, so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- directly contradicts what the Homeland Security secretary said at the top of this program when she talked- she went at the FBI- the FBI director--",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: -- Well, there are problems at the top. I want to differentiate. So there have been problems on the seventh floor of the J Edgar Hoover Building that they did politicize things, things like- people like Jim Comey, for example, who tweet out, you know, to vote single party during an election. You can't do that as an FBI director. That's terrible. He did it as a former director, but it undermines everything he did leading up to that point. The FBI needs to be completely non-partisan, completely apolitical. Personally, I think that part of the polygraph testing that comes in- so when you're an agent coming through the process, you get tested on drug history, foreign contacts, financial vulnerabilities. They also ought to test political bias as well, just to give the public the assurance that people are coming into the bureau, checking their politics at the door.",
      "REP. TOM SUOZZI: This all comes down to a busting of norms and things that we've been used to for years are all trying to be disrupted. And I think in some ways, very dangerously. We can't see this politicization of the FBI. It's a dangerous thing for our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to talk to the FBI director about any of this?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: -- Absolutely, absolutely--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- About the firings of the--",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: -- Director Patel he worked on our committee. He was a staffer on the House Intelligence Committee, which I sit. And I look forward to having a conversation with him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, illegal border crossings, as we just discussed, they are at a historic low. President Trump made that point when he was addressing Congress this week. Was he right that- that he didn't need to wait for Congress, that it was really messaging from the White House beyond?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Well, obviously we've seen a reduction in crossings. We saw it under the end of the Biden administration as well, after he did his executive order to say no asylum applications in between the ports of entry. But we need to make a permanent law, and Congress has not done its job for 30 years. So we need to secure the border. We need to fix the broken asylum system, and we need to treat people like human beings by fixing our legal immigration system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an opening to do any of that, though? The two of you together?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: I was working on this before I became the co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus for about a year with a guy named Morgan Luttrell from Texas. Very conservative, former Navy SEAL guy, talking about the details, trying to build a coalition of business, badges, and the Bible to work together to support an effort like this. Now, Brian and I, as co-chairs of the Problem Solvers Caucus, are taking those efforts and others and trying- and we have a working group as well to say, as soon as that opening arises, we're ready to make a deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know, but you guys are talking about- you can't even agree to keep the lights on, right?--",
      "REP. SUOZZI: -- Okay, but we--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- you're talking about really hard, substantive thing--",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Well what's going to happen is the Homeland Security is going to need money. They're spending money like crazy, and the CR is not going to fix the problem and--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's going to go to reconciliation, a party line vote, right?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: You can't fix everything through reconciliation, and you're going to need- and you can't- certainly can't fix asylum, and you can't- certainly can't fix the Dreamers and a whole bunch of other stuff through reconciliation. There's going to be an opening that's going to come when they need Democratic votes. And my argument to my Democratic colleagues is we should be looking to finally fix this broken immigration system once and for all. Secure the border, fix asylum, Dreamers, farm workers, essential workers and other people that we need to keep our economy open.",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: If I may add, one of the reasons why I'm so excited about Tom being the co-chair is he shares my passion and the passion of so many people about this issue that there is a border security piece and there is an immigration piece. And we're a country of immigrants. All of our families came in to this country through other places, Italy, Ireland--",
      "REP. SUOZZI: -- My father was born in Italy. And for Brennan and Fitzpatrick I got Irish as well.",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK : You know, that's the- that's the huge advantage that we have over our adversaries. It's- we have an endless supply of brilliant people coming into this country. Nobody wants to move to Russia or China or North Korea or Iran, everybody wants to come here. That's a huge economic advantage. It's a huge national security advantage. So we can combine border security and the rule of law with being- bringing the best and brightest people into this country, and also people that are truly fleeing oppression. That's what America is about.",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Margaret, every problem we face in our country is complicated. You know this as well as anybody, everything's complicated. You can't, why don't you just? There's no why don't you just anything. Anybody who says that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's an entire political campaign--",
      "REP. SUOZZI: --Right",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why don't you just",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Which doesn't make sense. And so what you need is people who may disagree with each other on certain issues, to sit across from each other say, well, I think this, well, I think that. Well, how about this? Well, how about that? And you try and find a compromise somewhere in the middle. Compromise is not a dirty word, and we have got to figure out how to start moving our country forward, not with this all my way or the highway. You guys are no good because you're one of those. No you're one of those. That's not working for our country. People want us to work together to solve problems.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, I know you feel very strongly about supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Ben Hodges, who's a retired general who commanded US Army Europe, said he's having a hard time understanding how withholding intelligence and military support from Ukraine advances strategic interests or helps make America great. Can you explain that?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, I will say this. We're going to get a briefing, a full briefing, on this, this coming week, but I will say this key in on what's not being said here, what kind of intelligence and who can't share it, right? So what I suspect, and I will get confirmation of this next week, is that it's the over-the-horizon intelligence striking into Russian territory.",

      "REP. FITZPATRICK: We have seamless intelligence sharing with the UK. To give you one example, there's no restriction on the UK sharing that intelligence with Ukraine. So what I suspect is happening here, and I could be proven wrong, is that this is an escalate to de-escalate tactic by the administration, to bring these parties to the table and to come to a conclusion, a just conclusion, which means success and victory for Ukraine. And I want to emphasize that, and I get asked, well, what does that mean? Yep. Vladimir. What victory means for me is Vladimir Putin regrets his decision to invade Ukraine, that he wishes he did not do that, and that's really going to be the test here, right? Because if we reward dictators for invading sovereign, freedom loving democracies, we are sending a message to every other dictator and aspiring dictator across this planet that if you do do that, you will be rewarded. That cannot be the message coming out of this",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Trump has been wrong in the way he's handled this. I want to give Brian credit, as co-chair of the Ukrainian caucus, for standing up and saying, you cannot reward a dictator. Zelensky was elected by 73% of the Ukrainian population in a free and fair election that's dictated by the European Commission that oversees free and fair elections. Putin is the dictator. Putin invaded. Zelensky is democratically elected. We cannot reward the guy responsible for murdering, for kidnapping, for raping, for all the awful things that have happened to the Ukrainian people. We all need to stand up for the Ukrainian people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know that the Secretary of State, the national security adviser and President Trump's envoy are all meeting with Ukrainian officials Tuesday. One of the things that I took note of Congressman Fitzpatrick, you tweeted that you have an outcome determinative number of members of the US Congress who are ready, willing and able to do whatever it takes to prevent Putin from being rewarded. That sounds like you are threatening leverage with votes. How would you use it?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: It's not a threat. What this is is us making very clear that we view this issue to be existential to world peace. These are the lessons of World War II, when we had- when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and you had leaders, including Neville Chamberlain and many other leaders around the world, saying it's not our problem. We don't want to provoke. We don't want to escalate, and a problem that could have been could have been nipped in the bud early, because it was not, turned out to be the costliest and deadliest war in world history, where we had to send our young, our youth in our country, to fight on Omaha Beach. We should never get to that point. We should learn from the lessons of history. These dictators want to relitigate the outcome of World War II. In World War II freedom won over dictatorships. They want to relitigate that. So we just have to be mindful of history and how we approach this.",
      "REP. SUOZZI: And if Putin gets away with this just because Ukraine is a smaller country, think about Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia and Moldova, and think about Poland, right? They're all next, and we have to stand up against this.",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: And Putin has said that he's telegraphed this punch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Right, well, President Trump says that it's all different when he's in charge, but Congressman, I need to ask you before you go because of the district and the unique characteristics of it, the one you represent. Earlier this week, we saw guidance from the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee urging members to hold virtual town halls, suggesting that holding them in person was not a good idea. Will you still hold town halls with your constituents?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Yeah, we, we--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Because some of them have gotten quite heated recently.",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Oh, I know. No. I think every member needs to find the best way to communicate with our constituents, and there's a number of ways to do that. I think what Chairman Hudson is referring to are the what's turning out to be a circus, a three-ring circus, where you go to a high school gymnasium. The protesters show up. They hold signs up, and you have legitimate concerns from some other people that are never heard because they're getting shouted down by people that are there to make a spectacle, oftentimes that are funded by some of these dark money groups. So there's- it's about communicating to your constituents in a way that you can get your message out, that you can hear their concerns. And every single district does it different, depending on- on where they're at.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, Congressman Suozzi, during the address to Congress this week, you did see Texas Democrat Congressman Green be disruptive. He was pulled out of the chamber because of that later censured with the votes of nine Democrats, including yourself, and 214 Republicans. Why did you take that vote against a fellow Democrat?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Because if it was a Republican doing the same thing to a Democratic president, I would have voted for that as well. And the bottom line is it was a strategic mistake on the on our behalf as well. Because instead of talking about Social Security cuts and talking about Medicaid cuts and talking about Medicare cuts and talking about the things that the President said in his speech that we disagree with, especially things like Ukraine or firing people in these different departments that make no sense whatsoever. We instead focus too much time on disruptive behavior and the conduct of the Democrats. That was a strategic mistake, as well as something that just is not appropriate for the decorum of the US House of Representatives--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Was the message from Democratic leadership not clear, then?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: --I think that it was pretty clear. I understood a clear message, let's not make the story about us. Let's make the story about what President Trump says and how we disagree with it. And we squandered that opportunity. All right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, gentlemen for doing this in a bipartisan fashion as well.",

      "And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump's tariff threats rattle allies and adversaries alike, plus the latest on the administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "After a whiplash week of on-again/off-again tariffs, the Trump trade war is entering a new phase, as the president steps up his threats against America's neighbors.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): We don't need trees from Canada. We don't need cars from Canada. We don't need energy from Canada. We don't need anything from Canada.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The administration says it hopes the tariffs will pressure Canada and Mexico to stop the flow of fentanyl and illegal migrants into the U.S.",
      "We will ask Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem if it's working and we will get the latest on the president's mass deportation mission.",
      "Canada's ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, will also be here. We will ask her about the costs and consequences of the growing trade war.",
      "Plus, with just days to go before a possible government shutdown, lawmakers unveil a new bill to avoid it. We will hear from the co-chairs of the congressional Problem Solvers Caucus, Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi.",
      "Finally, Russia expert Fiona Hill, who served as a top National Security Council official during the first Trump administration, joins us to discuss Trump's diplomatic pivot on Ukraine.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We begin this morning with the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem.",
      "Madam Secretary, good to have you in person. Thank you for joining us.",
      "KRISTI NOEM (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary): Yes, good morning. Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to dive right into this trade war.",
      "The justification President Trump invoked these tariffs under had to do with fentanyl. Mexico's president said Thursday that Customs and Border Protection figures show seizures of fentanyl on the southern border have dropped over the past year. She claimed they plummeted 75 percent in the past six months.",
      "Doesn't that show the existing system is working?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We've seen incredible progress as far as what we've been able to stop at the southern border since President Trump has taken office.",
      "And I think that progress can be built on. These partnerships that we have in going after traffickers, cartels, the drug trade, and also human trafficking can be even stronger and built on in the future. That's one of the things we've been asking for, in specific to the Mexican government, is, how can we work better together to make sure we not only have the enforcement mission at the border, but south of the border and make sure we're going after these cartels?",
      "You've seen the president name them as terrorist organizations. And Canada just recently is starting to allow us to access some of their criminal background histories that we need in order to know who's coming across our border and what they're bringing. So, because of his strong stance on tariffs, we're seeing them wanting to be better partners with us to keep our people safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Canada's Prime Minister said it's totally false to claim Canada is unwilling to fight fentanyl. You just indicated they're willing to do more here.",
      "He pointed to CBP data that showed a 97 percent drop in fentanyl seizures from January compared to December, a near zero low, he said.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, we're\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the data accurate?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: The data is getting better. And I would say, in the conversations that I have had this week with Canadian officials, they were hoping to avoid the tariffs, and had a lot of conversations, but not a lot of action.",
      "So this is the hope, is that the fact that President Trump has said something and now has enforced consequences, we really are hoping for even better partnerships. We need access to their criminal background system, so that we know, when someone crosses that northern border, who they are, why they're in our country, and who they may be partnering with.",
      "We also need them to work with us on identifying packages, technology investments. Canada has said they will do that. We just want to see them actually do it. In the past, promises have been made by both Mexico and Canada that they didn't follow through on. Their naming of a fentanyl czar in Canada is important. That's great. Now let's see really what happens.",
      "President Trump has been strong, and I think that's why you've seen the data going our direction. But, boy, every day, people in this country are dying of overdoses. And I don't want any more families to have to deal with that tragedy if we can be \u2013 if it can be avoided and we can have a stronger relationship.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you just gave specific examples of what Canada and Mexico can do presumably to avoid the tariffs that are now being pushed off until April 2.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The commerce secretary said on another network: \"If fentanyl ends, I think these will come off, but if fentanyl does not end, or he's uncertain about it,\" meaning the president, \"they will stay on until he's comfortable.",
      "Is it that general, or are these very specific things that you can kind of go through and check to avoid these tariffs?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, I have had very specific conversations with Canadian officials and Mexican officials on what they can do. So they know what they can do to help avoid tariffs in the future, and what we're expecting of them.",
      "If they do it, we shall see. We all recognize that each one of these leaders has political environments in their home countries as well, but President Trump means business. And he meant it when he ran to be president of the United States again and since he's taken office that he will put America first.",
      "And every day in this country, we have seen over the last several years violence and unsafe streets and cities and people lose their children and grandchildren, and he's taking action to make sure that we're cleaning up the mess that Joe Biden left behind, and that we have a much safer country, and where Americans can look forward to the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is not just leverage to get a better free trade deal? This is not just because President Trump truly believes that tariffs are the heart of his economic policy?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying this really is about fentanyl?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: It really is about fentanyl. It really is.",
      "And I think the president obviously wants a strong economy, obviously wants better trade deals as well. But this is about fentanyl and what we can do to stop the cartels from partnering with Chinese officials, laundering money and bringing a poison into our country that is specifically designed to kill the next generation.",
      "I think a lot of people don't understand the strategy\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 of these enemies of the United States and what they're utilizing.",
      "They are bringing this in, not just to make money. They're bringing it in here to kill Americans. And it's time that we stand up for the people that live here and make sure that we're stopping this war against our children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you.Border crossings, they're at a 25-year low.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: They are. It's fantastic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 6,000 U.S. military personnel working at the border now. That number could go up to 9,000 by the end of the month.",
      "How long do you have to keep them there if the numbers are already dropping like this?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: You know, we'll continue the partnership with the Department of Defense.",
      "But, also, we've got partnerships with Commerce, with the attorney general's office. You know, we're working every day with the secretary of state. We'll keep them there until that border is completely secure. And we see all-time record lows of encounters. Our Border Patrol is doing fantastic work.",
      "But we're going to keep them there until the whole world gets the message that this isn't Joe Biden's world anymore. This is President Donald Trump's country, where we have a border, where we have laws, and it applies equally to everybody. I think that is what is so refreshing, is that we're not picking and choosing winners and losers anymore.",
      "Americans have to live by the law. So do those who come to this country. You have to come here legally, or there will be consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening internally when it comes to \u2013 excuse me \u2013 migration.",
      "The administration has revived this policy of detaining migrant families, parents with children, in ICE detention centers. Bush did it. Obama did it. Biden did not. Have you seen these Texas facilities where children are being held with their parents? Are you comfortable with it personally?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We've got detention facilities across the country, and there's specific ones that are built specifically for families if they are detained.",
      "But, remember, everybody has an option. They have an option to be here legally or illegally, and they can self-deport as well. We've set up a system and a Web site where people who are here illegally right now can register, and they can choose to go home on their own and keep their families united.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The kids don't have a choice in this. You know that.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, the kids do have a choice. If they have parents, they make a choice to keep their families together, if they want to or not. They \u2013 if parents make a decision to leave their children behind, then that's a choice that they made as a family.",
      "And we need to remember that when Americans break the law, and they have consequences or face a situation, they're separated from their families too. I don't believe we should prioritize people from other countries above Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to reviving the policy of separating families from their children at the border\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I don't know that we're actually reviving it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I want to ask you.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: It's that President Biden didn't follow the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You won't\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: He didn't follow the law, in the fact that it's always been equally applied until his administration, and then he made decisions to ignore federal law in how he handled immigration and enforcement within our borders.",
      "And so, today, we're \u2013 we're expanding our team at ICE, and we're going to have an acting director in Todd Lyons, who has a long history with Tom Homan. They have worked together to build on these enforcement operations. We're also naming a deputy secretary in Madison Sheahan. That was going to be another expansion of this team.",
      "They have done incredible work cleaning up our communities and making them safer. Adding more people to the team, with Todd and with Madison, is going to allow us to partner with local law enforcement officials to make sure that we truly are following through on enforcing the law. And, if you break our law, then there's going to be consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: al Qaeda you want the number of deportations to tick up?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I do, absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: People, remember, they have an option to go home on their own.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We are giving them that opportunity to do that, and we will help facilitate that. And if they don't, and they end up coming into our enforcement opportunities that we have in front of us, you know, they may never get the chance to come back. So people need to remember, if they self-deport, they will have an opportunity to come back to this country legally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you have a capacity issue right now in terms of just beds to put people in when you detain them. Are you going to open up military facilities like Fort Bliss?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: There is, yes, a plan to use the facilities at Fort Bliss for detention facilities.",
      "But, also, we need to remember to ask \u2013 Congress needs to continue through with funding that this administration has asked for. You know, we clearly have a C.R. discussion in front of us this week. We have a reconciliation discussion. That reconciliation bill needs to happen. We have just weeks before we are out of the funds to continue the operations that \u2013 that we have.",
      "And even \u2013 everywhere I have been in this country out there, looking at what President Trump has done on immigration and border enforcement, the people that I meet are saying, thank you. Thank you for getting these terrorists out of the country. He has deported\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Terrorists?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 in just one month\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you deported terrorists?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 22 known and \u2013 terrorists on the terrorist watch list are out of this country now.",
      "We have almost 700 gang members that have been deported out of the country in just a month, and\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which have been redefined as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, 281 specific TDA members, which we know are the worst of the worst, have been taken out of this country.",
      "So, everyone that has a story like Laken Riley's family or Jocelyn's family, they're extremely grateful that that won't be perpetuated amongst other families in other states.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you. You said that you have found leakers within DHS and you're going to prosecute them.",
      "Back on February 9, you tweeted: \"The FBI is so corrupt.We will work with any and every agency to stop leaks.\"",
      "Were you wrong then to blame the FBI if the leaks were from within DHS?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: No, I think there's leakers all over throughout this government. I think that everybody needs to be\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What did they leak?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I think these \u2013 in DHS specifically, these two were leaking our enforcement operations that we had planned and were going to conduct in several cities and exposed law enforcement to vulnerabilities, to those ops being jeopardized, to where their lives would be in danger.",
      "So they will be prosecuted, and they could face up to 10 years in federal prison because they did that. Anyone who is leaking information outside of \u2013 of how something is planned for the safety of those law enforcement officers needs to be held accountable for that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're going to continue these polygraphing\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 of employees?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: The authorities that I have under the Department of Homeland Security are broad and extensive. And I plan to use every single one of them to make sure that we're following the law, that we are following the procedures in place to keep people safe, and that we're making sure we're following through on what President Trump has promised, that he's going to make America safe again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Madam Secretary, thank you for your time today.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Thank you for having me.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Canadian officials are warning of retaliation against the U.S. over President Trump's tariff threats.",
      "Senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe has the latest from Ottawa.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Well, Margaret, President Trump is now threatening tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber exports, even as he holds off on the broader tariffs on goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement until at least early April.",
      "This has mostly been a war of words so far, rather than a war over the wallet, but that's going to change in the coming day, as Ontario is now threatening to tariff electricity it wires to Minnesota, Michigan and New York.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DOUG FORD (Premier of Ontario, Canada): I'm going to put a 25 percent tariff on the electricity, the 1.5 million homes and businesses, as of Monday, until President Trump drops these tariffs.",
      "He has to understand that he can't attack our country economically and expect us to roll over.",
      "(End VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: It's not entirely clear how the cost of those tariffs would be passed on to American households.",
      "Now, we're here in Ottawa today because, amid the tariff war, there's also a Canadian transfer of power under way. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in January he would be stepping down after nearly a decade. His ruling Liberal Party today anoints his successor.",
      "It's a race between Mark Carney, an economist and the former head of the Banks of Canada and Britain, and Chrystia Freeland, a former Trudeau deputy. Whoever wins the race, Margaret, becomes prime minister and has to deal with President Trump and the tariff war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was our Ed O'Keefe in Ottawa.",
      "We're joined now by Canada's ambassador to the United States, Kirsten Hillman.",
      "Ambassador, it's good to have you here.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN (Canadian Ambassador to the United States): Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the homeland security secretary say there are conversations with your government. She seemed optimistic that there would be follow-through on fentanyl.",
      "Does that make you think the threat of tariffs on April 2 is something that can be managed and avoided?",
      "AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, I hope so.",
      "I mean, it \u2013 I think that we are in a very good place in our discussions with the U.S. administration on fentanyl. We have invested a lot of new resources. We have given our law enforcement new powers. And we have responded to the requests of the Trump administration with respect to cooperative effects in getting at the sources, so the organized crime, the precursors coming from China.",
      "We've had some really, really good discussions. So we're optimistic. And, you know, I just would say, and I think it's important for your viewers to know, fentanyl is a very serious problem in Canada too. On some days, we have more deaths per capita than you have here in the United States.",
      "So we take this very seriously. It is not a big issue between our two countries. Less than 1 percent of the fentanyl that is seized in the United States is coming from Canada, but every ounce can kill families and people. So we're taking it very seriously.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are indulging the premise that that is the actual motivation for the tariffs, rather than leverage for a free trade deal or just because President Trump believes in them?",
      "AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, I think that this set of tariffs, the 25 and 10 percent set of tariffs, are \u2013 we have been told repeatedly that it is about fentanyl and security at the border.",
      "There are other tariffs that have been discussed, and the president has raised other issues as motivations for other tariffs, reciprocity and fairness, and, you know, maybe some changes that he'd like to see to our USMCA, our trade agreement. So those conversations are going to have to happen as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said Friday he may put tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy Monday or Tuesday. Here's what he said. Take a listen:",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products, 250 percent. Nobody ever talks about that, 250 percent tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. So that's not going to happen anymore.",
      "We're going to be \u2013 they'll be met with the exact same tariff unless they drop it. And that's what reciprocal means.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On another network, the commerce secretary said, no, that's actually on hold until April 2.",
      "It's confusing for us to follow this along. Is the clarity with the two governments any better?",
      "AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: You know, we are in active discussions with Secretary Lutnick. And those discussions are heading towards April 2.",
      "And that, I think, is \u2013 we are putting our energy in the substantive discussions that we are having with the secretary, with USTR, with the White House. And, you know, that is, I guess, how I can answer that question.",
      "The president \u2013 the president does have a variety of concerns and I think also sees tariffs as a tool for a variety of policy objectives. But, really, all we can do is focus on the real work at hand, which is to get at these issues, like, for example, lumber. Canada doesn't have a tariff on lumber. It's zero. U.S. lumber can come into Canada duty-free.",
      "On dairy, the U.S. sells three times as much dairy into Canada as we sell into the United States. So, what's more, I think, productive for us is to talk about the facts around the actual trading relationship and try and get at where the concerns are.",

Title Three wire taps get shut down, surveillance teams get shut down. It is massive implications that most people don't realize. You never ever want to shut the government down. It should never happen. And it's a symptom of a broken system that we're even talking about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me follow up with you on that. You are the only FBI agent who - now a congressman. On Monday, the top agent at the New York office, James Dennehy, said he was forced out of his job due to clashes with Justice Department officials over directives. He had been supportive of bureau leaders who resisted turning over the nations of those agents assigned to carry out investigations related to January the 6th, 2021. Are you concerned about all this political pressure?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I'm very concerned. I'm a huge defender and supporter of the bureau. It was the best job I ever had in my life, and most honorable job I've ever had in my life, keeping America safe. And I care very much about the agent population and the professional support staff that worked there. They're a tremendous people. They are completely nonpartisan. At 14 years in the FBI, I never heard any political talk whatsoever, which is pretty remarkable. So -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That directly contradicts what the Homeland Security secretary said at the top of this program when she talked - she went at the FBI. The FBI director was -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, there have been conflicts at the top. I want - I want to differentiate. So, there have been problems on the seventh floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building that they did politicize things, things like - people like Jim Comey, for example, who tweet out, you know, to vote single party during an election. You can't do that as an FBI director. That's terrible. He did it as a former director, but it undermines everything he did leading up to that point.",
      "The FBI needs to be completely nonpartisan, completely apolitical. Personally, I think that part of the polygraph testing that comes in, so when you're an agent coming through the process, you get tested on drug history, foreign contacts, financial vulnerabilities. They also ought to test political bias as well, just to give the public the assurance that people are coming into the bureau, checking their politics at the door.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: This all comes down to a busting of norms. And things that we've been used to for years are all trying to be disrupted, and I think, in some ways, very dangerously. We can't see this politization of the FBI. It's a dangerous thing for our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to talk to the FBI director about any of this?",

Was he right that - that he didn't need to wait for Congress, that it was really messaging from the White House beyond?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, obviously, we've seen a reduction in crossings. We saw it under the end of the Biden administration as well after he did his executive order to say, no, asylum applications are between the ports of entry. But we need to make it permanent law. And Congress has not done its job for 30 years. So, we need to secure the border, we need to fix the broken asylum system and we need to treat people like human beings by fixing our legal immigration system.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: If - you can't fix everything through reconciliation. And you're going to need - and you can't - certainly can't fix asylum and you certainly can't fix the dreamers and a whole bunch of other stuff through reconciliation. There is going to be an opening that's going to come when they need Democratic votes. And my argument to my Democratic colleagues is, we should be looking to finally fix this broken immigration system once and for all. Secure the border, fix asylum, dreamers, farm workers, essential workers and other people that we need to keep our economy open.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And if I may add, one of the reasons why I'm so excited about Tom being the co-chair is he shares my passion and the passion of so many people about this issue that there is a border security piece and there is an immigration piece. And we're a country of immigrants. All of our families came into this country through other places, Italy, Ireland.",

Nobody wants to move to Russia or China or North Korea or Iran. Everybody wants to come here. That's a huge economic advantage. It's a huge national security advantage.",
      "So, we can combine border security and the rule of law with being - bringing the best and brightest people into this country and also people that are truly fleeing oppression. And that's what America is about.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Margaret, every problem we face in our country is complicated. You know this as well as anybody. Everything's complicated. You can't, why don't you just?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Compromise is not a dirty word. And we have got to figure out how to start moving our country forward, not with this all my way or the highway, you guys are no good because you're one of those - no, you're on of those.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, I know you feel very strongly about supporting Ukraine and its fight against Russia. Ben Hodges, who's a retired general who commanded U.S. Army Europe, said he's having a hard time understanding how withholding intelligence, and military support from Ukraine, advances strategic interests or helps make America great.",
      "Can you explain that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I will say this, we're going to get a briefing - a full briefing on this, this coming week. But I will say this, key in on what's not being said here. What kind of intelligence and who can't share it, right? So, what I suspect, and I will get confirmation of this next week, is that it's the over the horizon intelligence striking into Russian territory.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's also satellite.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Maxar technologies cannot (INAUDIBLE).",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We have seamless intelligence sharing with the U.K., to give you one example. There's no restriction on the U.K. sharing that intelligence with Ukraine. So, what I suspect is happening here, and I could be proven wrong, this that this an escalate to de- escalate tactic by the administration to bring these parties to the table and to come to a conclusion, a just conclusion, which means success and victory for Ukraine. And I want to emphasize that. And I get asked, well, what does that mean?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Vladimir - what victory means for me is Vladimir Putin regrets his decision to invade Ukraine. That he wishes he did not do that. And that's really going to be the test here, right, because if we reward dictators from invading sovereign, freedom-loving democracies, we are sending a message to every other dictator and aspiring dictator across this plant that, if you do do that, you will be rewarded. That cannot be the message coming out of this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Trump has been wrong in the way he's handled this. I want to give Brian credit as co-chair of the Ukrainian Caucus, for standing up and saying, you cannot reward a dictator. Zelenskyy was elected by 73 percent of the Ukrainian population in a free and fair election as dictated by the European Commission that oversees free and fair elections. Putin is the dictator. Putin invaded. Zelenskyy is democratically elected. We cannot reward the guy responsible for murdering, for kidnapping, for raping, for all the awful things that have happened to the Ukrainian people. We all need to stand up for the Ukrainian people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know that the secretary of state, the national security adviser and President Trump's envoy are all meeting with Ukrainian officials Tuesday. One of the things that I took note of, Congressman Fitzpatrick, you tweeted that you have an outcome determinative number of members of the U.S. Congress who ready, willing and able to do whatever it takes to prevent Putin from being rewarded. That sounds like you are threatening leverage with votes. How would you use it?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It's not - it's not a threat. What this is, is us making very clear that we view this issue to be existential to world peace. These are the lessons of World War II. When we had - when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and you had leaders, including Neville Chamberlain and many other leaders around the world saying it's not our problem, we don't want to provoke, we don't want to escalate. And a problem that could have been nipped in the bud early, because it was not, turned out to be the costliest and deadliest war in world history where we had to send our young - our youth in our country to fight on Omaha beach. We should never get to that point. We should learn from the lessons of history.",
      "These dictators want to relitigate the outcome of World War II. And World War II, freedom won over dictatorship. They want to relitigate that. So, we just have to be mindful of history and how we approach this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And if Putin gets away with this, just because Ukraine is a smaller country, think about Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia and Moldova and think about Poland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: They're all next. And we have to stand up against this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And Putin has said that. He's telegraphed this punch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, President Trump says, oh, it's all different when he's in charge.",
      "But, Congressman, I need to ask you, before you go, because of the districts and the unique characteristics of it, the one you represent, earlier this week we saw guidance from the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee urging members to hold virtual town halls, suggesting that holding them in person was not a good idea. Will you still hold town halls with your constituents?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yes. We - we communicate -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because some have gotten quite heated recently.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Oh, I know. No, I think every member needs to find the best way to communicate with their constituents. And there's a number of ways to do that. I think what Chairman Hudson is referring to are the - what's turning out to be a circus, a three-ring circus, where you go to a high school gymnasium, the protesters shows up, they hold signs up, and you have legitimate concerns from some other people that are never heard because they're getting shouted down by people that are there to make a spectacle, oftentimes that are funded by some of these dark money groups.",
      "So, there's - it's about communicating to your constituents in a way that you can get your message out, that you can hear their concerns. And every single district does it different depending on - on where they're at.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, Congressman Suozzi, during the address to Congress this week, you did see Texas Democrat Congressman Green be disruptive. He was pulled out of the chamber because of that. Later censured with the votes of nine Democrats, including yourself, and 214 Republicans. Why did you take that vote against a fellow Democrat?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Because if it was a Republican doing the same thing to a Democratic president, I would have voted for that as well. And the bottom line is, it was a strategic mistake on the part - on our behalf as well because instead of talking about Social Security cuts, and talking about Medicaid cuts and talking about Medicare cuts, and talking about the things that the president said in his speech that we disagree with, especially things like Ukraine or firing people in these different departments that makes no sense whatsoever, we, instead, focus too much time on disruptive behavior.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And the conduct of the Democrats. That was a strategic mistake, as well as something that just is not appropriate for the decorum of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was - was that message from Democratic leadership not clear then?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I think that it was pretty clear. I understood a clear message.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Let's not make the story about us, let's make the story about what President Trump says and how we disagree with it.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the U.S. pauses of lethal intelligence sharing, including targeting data for U.S.-provided weapons like HIMARS. We also know it extends to satellite imagery, which is no longer being shared with Ukraine.",
      "What's the practical impact of that and the military freeze?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, I think we can see the impact. It's certainly, on the one hand, emboldened Russia to really step up the attacks, and it's also not just blindsided but also partially blinded Ukraine. I mean, we heard from the previous segment that there's still some sharing with allies, like the United Kingdom, of course, which is part of the Five Eyes sharing with the United States. But frankly, none of the other allies, including the U.K., have the same access to satellite imagery as the United States does. So, even if there is, you know, some sharing, not much restrictions, there certainly has an impact.",
      "And, frankly, I think it's going to be an impetus to other allies to start stepping up their own capabilities and questioning themselves about the virtues of sharing with the United States. I mean, this is a two-way street. We have to remember that other countries also share pretty vital information with the United States, even if the scale is not quite the same.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Canada, the U.K., Australia, among those who do so. You think they will essentially punish the U.S. by not sharing intelligence freely?",
      "FIONA HILL: I'm not sure whether it's punishment, but it will be a lot of questioning about what actually happens with this. Because if you're bundling together intelligence, then effectively the United States is putting restrictions on that. Was that pre-discussed with our five eyes allies, for example, or with other allies, particularly in the midst of basically a conflict that is, as we've heard, you know, over and over again, the largest land war in Europe since World War II. I mean, this is really unprecedented in terms of the actions of the United States in this regard because he's not just affecting Ukraine, again, it's having knock-on effects for all of our other allies who are directly affected, all of our European allies that are directly affected by this conflict.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said on Friday when he was asked if this uptick in Putin's bombing was directly related to the U.S. halt. Here's what he said.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I actually think he's doing what anybody else would do. I think he's - I think he wants to get it stopped and settled, and I think he's hitting them harder than - than he's been hitting them. And I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yet earlier in the day, the president had posted on social media he was considering possibly putting sanctions on Russia. That's a contradiction. What do you make of what he said?",
      "FIONA HILL: I make of it exactly what he said. I mean, he's actually, obviously, putting himself in the shoes of Vladimir Putin and saying that if I were the aggressor, that's exactly what I would be doing if I wanted to make Ukraine capitulate. So, I mean, yes, he called it as it is. I don't believe what he said for a second about the sanctions. I believe more what he just said there in the Oval Office, sitting behind, you know, the Resolute Desk. I mean,n I think that's what you can take away from this. He accurately -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Believe the president and when he says things?",
      "FIONA HILL: That's - I think you should. Yes. I mean, he's the president of the United States. And he made it crystal clear, I think. And he sees, you know, obviously, the Ukraine - the Ukrainians, and he said that in the Oval Office during the meeting with President Zelenskyy, that he sees them on the back foot as losing, and he's basically telling them that they have to capitulate. Very clear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't have the cards was the line. He kept using that.",
      "FIONA HILL: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know you were at the Council on Foreign Relations this week, as was I. I had an interview with Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg. And when we were discussing the president's decision to cut off Ukraine, he said, Ukrainians brought it on themselves, and the decision was, like, quote, \"hitting a mule with a two by four across the nose, you got their attention.\"",
      "It's quite a statement, comparing our ally to a farm animal here that needed to be beaten. Do you think it was right to say the Ukrainian government, though, was just not getting it?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, what they weren't getting is really what President Trump wanted directly from them, which was obviously to have President Zelenskyy make a personal agreement with him in the Oval Office in front of all the cameras to thank him profusely for all the aid that was already provided to Ukraine over, you know, successive administrations now, and basically to sign a deal on rare earths minerals and then basically leave immediately after that. And clearly, President Zelenskyy didn't really get that message.",
      "And I think there's a very important element here. In diplomacy, you really should not only be speaking in your native language. And I think that a lot of this was lost in translation. First of all, President Zelenskyy didn't fully understand that this agreement was just purely with President Trump. And you may remember, if we all go back and watch that - I watched it many times just to try to figure out exactly where things had gone wrong, and there were multiple points. But there's one point when President Zelenskyy basically said, look, you know, we had deals with your - your previous presidents, basically with Obama and Biden. And President Trump immediately dismissed all of that and basically said those deals were not worth the paper they were written on, or the commitments that were made because they were weak and it wasn't me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it was not me.",
      "FIONA HILL: And President Zelenskyy didn't quite follow all of this because, like the rest of our allies, he actually thinks that commitments made by the United States are supposed to hold over successive administrations. And what we learned there, what he learned there, was that is not the case. You're essentially going to have to make a new commitment with President Trump. It's a personal commitment. And that was what he was being told, and he didn't fully understand.",
      "And I think in the future, when the Ukrainians are meeting with the Americans, they ought to have translators with them because as good as President Zelenskyy's English is, there's two things that he's missing there. He doesn't quite understand the way that President Trump operates -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: Although I think he's probably got the message now, but he doesn't always understand the nuances. And I would also think that our side on the United States side could do with some interpretation as well, coming also from President Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: So, my advice to President Zelenskyy and to the team around President Trump is, use interpreters, that's what they're there for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And your own government's interpreters?",
      "FIONA HILL: That's absolutely right, your own government's interpreters, no (ph), because you actually asked that question, who's interpreters were used and General Kellogg couldn't answer the question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, for Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin for three and a half hours.",
      "FIONA HILL: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Europe seems to be taking these threats seriously and looking at an alternative to the American nuclear deterrent. An umbrella. That's - does that mean the transatlantic alliance is gone?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, it doesn't mean that it's gone, but there's a bit of a kind of a one-sided attempt to rupture it here on the part of the United States.",
      "I was also at the Munich Security Conference. I heard Vice President Vance's speech. I was standing next to a couple of very prominent Europeans who were completely in shock.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: And immediately after that, as you well know, there were many statements coming out of Germany, as well as countries like Sweden, basically asking whether the United States could be trusted on nuclear weapons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "FIONA HILL: But we have to remember that Ukraine had nuclear weapons that it gave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they gave them up.",
      "FIONA HILL: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: With the promise of a security guarantee that was not delivered on.",
      "FIONA HILL: Correct.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Kirsten Hillman, U.S. ambassador to Canada, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was our Ed O'Keefe in Ottawa. We're joined now by Canada's Ambassador to the United States, Kirsten Hillman. Ambassador, it's good to have you here.",
      "CANADIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the Homeland Security Secretary say there are conversations with your government. She seemed optimistic that there would be follow through on fentanyl. Does that make you think the threat of tariffs on April 2 is something that can be managed and avoided?",
      "HILLMAN: Well, I hope so. I mean, I think that we are in a very good place in our discussions with the U.S. administration on fentanyl. We have invested a lot of new resources, we have given our law enforcement new powers and we have responded to the requests of the Trump Administration with respect to cooperative effects in getting at the sources, so the organized crime, the precursors coming from China. We've had some really, really good discussions, so we're optimistic. And, you know, I just would say, and I think it's important for your viewers to know fentanyl is a very serious problem in Canada too. On some days we have more deaths per capita than you have here in the United States. So we take this very seriously. It is not a big issue between our two countries. Less than 1 percent of the fentanyl that is seized in the United States is coming from Canada, but every ounce can kill families and people. So we're taking it very seriously,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, you are indulging the premise that that is the actual motivation for the tariffs, rather than leverage for a free trade deal, or just because President Trump believes in them?",
      "HILLMAN: Well, I think that this set of tariffs, the 25 and 10 percent set of tariffs, are- we have been told repeatedly that it is about fentanyl and security at the border. There are other tariffs that have been discussed and the President has raised other issues as motivations for other tariffs, reciprocity and fairness, and you know, maybe some changes that he'd like to see to our USMCA, our trade agreement. So those conversations are going to have to happen as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said Friday he may put tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy Monday or Tuesday. Here's what he said. Take a listen:",
      "SOT DONALD TRUMP: Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products. 250 percent, nobody ever talks about that. 250 percent tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. So that's not going to happen anymore. We're going to be- they'll be met with the exact same tariff unless they drop it. And that's what reciprocal means.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On another network, the Commerce Secretary said, no, that's actually on hold till April 2. It's confusing for us to follow this along. Is the clarity with the two governments any better?",
      "HILLMAN: You know we are in active discussions with Secretary Lutnick, and those discussions are heading towards April 2, and that, I think, is we are putting our energy in the substantive discussions that we are having with the secretary, with USTR, with the White House. And you know, that is, I guess, how I can answer that question. The President- the President does have a variety of concerns, and I think also sees tariffs as a tool for a variety of policy objectives, but really, all we can do is focus on the real work at hand, which is to get at these issues. Like, for example, lumber, Canada doesn't have a tariff on lumber. It's zero. U.S. lumber can come into Canada duty-free. On dairy, the U.S. sells three times as much dairy into Canada as we sell into the United States. So what's more, I think productive for us is to talk about the facts around the actual trading relationship and try and get at where the concerns are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Canada does put a tariff as high as 241 percent on dairy imports, but it's a sliding scale that only kicks in at a certain level, and that's under the free trade deal.",
      "HILLMAN: That's right, and it's like the United States. In agriculture, the United States is the same in sugar and dairy. You allow a certain amount of product in, and then after that level is hit, you put restraints in on imports. And we do the same to protect our farmers and families and you know, small family farms that- that need to be sure that they can have a bit of the market.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there was this 50-minute phone call Wednesday with the Vice President, the Commerce Secretary and President Trump, with your Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. Afterwards, the president posted that Trudeau was unable to tell him when the election was taking place, which made him curious. Like, quote, \"what's going on here? I then realized he's trying to use this issue to stay in power.\" Do you think this is like a personal issue here? Do you think it'll change when your leadership changes?",
      "HILLMAN: It's hard for me to- hard for me to say. I think that the prime minister and the president- Prime Minister Trudeau and the president, they've done big things together, right? They did renegotiate NAFTA together\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They have a history together.",
      "HILLMAN: Right. They have a long history. They did good things together. They managed our 6,000- practically 6,000 mile border during COVID very successfully, in my opinion. So it's a long relationship, and has many- has had many phases to it. We will have a new prime minister this week. Today, the Liberal Party will elect a new leader. That new leader will be sworn in in the coming days, and that person will become Canada's Prime Minister. Those are facts that are not going to change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it will stop the vows from the president to talk about threatening to annex Canada?",
      "HILLMAN: You know, I guess\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is that?",
      "HILLMAN: I- I'm not sure what that is. What I can say is that Canadians don't really appreciate it. They're getting a little bit frustrated with that kind of rhetoric. But more importantly, Canadians are frustrated with our neighbors. You know, the country that we feel closest to, the country that is partners, allies, often family that we've gone to war with, that we've died with, that we come to each other's aid, most recently in LA, but obviously 9/11. You've come to our aid over the years so many times, and we feel- Canadians feel under attack, under economic attack, and that is causing some challenges, for sure, across Canadian society. I think our new prime minister, when that person comes in, will prioritize trying to have a good and- and healthy and productive relationship with the present. I am sure that that's going to be possible. Relationships go both ways, but I know that on our side, that's going to be a priority.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We begin this morning with the Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. Madam Secretary, good to have you in person. Thank you for joining us.",
      "SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY KRISTI NOEM: Good morning. Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to dive right into this trade war. The justification President Trump invoked these tariffs under had to do with fentanyl. Mexico's president said Thursday that Customs and Border Protection figures show seizures of fentanyl on the southern border have dropped over the past year. She claimed they plummeted 75% in the past six months. Doesn't that show the existing system is working?",
      "10:32:23",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 We've seen incredible progress as far as what we've been able to stop at the southern border since President Trump has taken office. And I think that progress can be built on. These partnerships that we have in going after traffickers, cartels, the drug trade, and also human trafficking, can be even stronger and built on in the future. That's one of the things we've been asking for, in specific to the Mexican government, is how can we work better together to make sure we not only have the enforcement mission at the border, but south of the border and make sure we're going after these cartels. You've seen the President name them as terrorist organizations. And Canada, just recently, is starting to allow us to access some of their criminal background histories that we need in order to know who's coming across our border and what they're bringing. So, because of his strong stance on tariffs, we're seeing them wanting to be better partners with us to keep our people safe.",
      "10:33:16",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So Canada's Prime Minister said it's totally false to claim Canada is unwilling to fight fentanyl. You just indicated they're willing to do more here. He pointed to CBP data that showed a 97% drop in fentanyl seizures from January compared to December, a near zero low, he said.",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 Yeah we're--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --is the data accurate?",
      "10:33:36",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 The data is getting better. And I would say in the conversations that I've had this week with Canadian officials, they were hoping to avoid the tariffs, and had a lot of conversations, but not a lot of action. So this is the hope, is that the fact that President Trump has said something and now has enforced consequences, we really are hoping for even better partnerships. We need access to their criminal background system so that we know when someone crosses that northern border who they are, why they're in our country, and who they may be partnering with. We also need them to work with us on identifying packages, technology investments. Canada has said they will do that. We just want to see them actually do it. In the past, promises have been made by both Mexico and Canada that they didn't follow through on. Their naming of a fentanyl czar in Canada is important. That's great. Now let's see really what happens. President Trump has been strong, and I think that's why you've seen the data going our direction, but boy, every day people in this country are dying of overdoses, and I don't want any more families to have to deal with that tragedy if we can be- if it can be avoided and we can have a stronger relationship.",
      "10:34:43",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So you just gave specific examples of what Canada and Mexico can do, presumably, to avoid the tariffs that are now being pushed off until April 2. The Commerce Secretary said on another network, if fentanyl ends, I think these will come off, but if fentanyl does not end, or he's uncertain about it, meaning the president, they will stay on until he's comfortable. Is it that general, or are these very specific things that you can kind of go through and check to avoid these tariffs.",
      "10:35:11",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 I've had very specific conversations with Canadian officials and Mexican officials on what they can do so they know what they can do to help avoid tariffs in the future, and what we're expecting of them. If they do it, we shall see. We all recognize that each one of these leaders has political environments in their home countries as well, but President Trump means business, and he meant it when he ran to be President of the United States again, and since he's taken office, that he will put America first. And every day in this country, we have seen over the last several years, violence and unsafe streets and cities and people lose their children and grandchildren, and he's taking action to make sure that we're cleaning up the mess that Joe Biden left behind, and that we have a much safer country and where Americans can look forward to the future.",
      "10:36:01",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So this is not just leverage to get a better free trade deal. This is not just because President Trump truly believes that tariffs are the heart of his economic policy?",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You're saying this really is about fentanyl?",
      "10:36:12",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 It really is about fentanyl. It really is. And I think the President obviously wants a strong economy, obviously wants better trade deals as well. But this is about fentanyl and what we can do to stop the cartels from partnering with Chinese officials, laundering money and bringing a poison into our country that is specifically designed to kill the next generation. I think a lot of people don't understand the strategy of these enemies of the United States and what they're utilizing. They are bringing this in, not just to make money, they're bringing it in here to kill Americans. And it's time that we stand up for the people that live here and make sure that we're stopping this war against our children.",
      "10:36:47",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to ask you, border crossings, they're at a 25 year low.",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: They are. It's fantastic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 6,000 US military personnel working at the border now, that number could go up to 9,000 by the end of the month. How long do you have to keep them there if the numbers are already dropping like this?",
      "10:37:02",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: You know, we'll continue the partnership with the Department of Defense, but also we've got partnerships with Commerce, with the Attorney General's office, you know, we're working every day with the Secretary of State. We'll keep them there until that border is completely secure, and we see all time record lows of encounters. Our border patrol is doing fantastic work, but we're going to keep them there until the whole world gets the message that this isn't Joe Biden's world anymore. This is President Donald Trump's country where we have a border, where we have laws and it applies equally to everybody. I think that is what is so refreshing, is that we're not picking and choosing winners and losers anymore. Americans have to live by the law, so do those who come to this country. You have to come here legally, or there will be consequences.",
      "10:37:49",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening internally when it comes to, excuse me, migration. The administration has revived this policy of detaining migrant families, parents with children in ICE detention centers. Bush did it, Obama did it, Biden did not. Have you seen these Texas facilities where children are being held with their parents? Are you comfortable with it personally?",
      "10:38:10",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: We've got detention facilities across the country, and there's specific ones that are built specifically for families if they are detained. But remember, everybody has an option. They have an option to be here legally or illegally, and they can self-deport as well. We've set up a system and a website where people who are here illegally right now can register, and they can choose to go home on their own and keep their families united.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The kids don't really have a choice in this--",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: Well, the kids do have a choice. If they have parents, they make a choice to keep their families together, if they want to or not. They- if parents make a decision to leave their children behind, then that's a choice that they made as a family. And we need to remember that when Americans break the law and they have consequences or face a situation, they're separated from their families, too. I don't believe we should prioritize people from other countries above Americans.",
      "10:38:59",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 But when it comes to reviving the policy of separating families from their children at the border--",
      "10:39:04",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: I don't know that we're actually reviving it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I want to ask you--",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: --President Biden didn't follow the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You won't?",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: He didn't follow the law in the fact that it's always been equally applied until his administration, and then he made decisions to ignore federal law in how he handled immigration and enforcement within our borders. And so today, we're- we're expanding our team at ICE, and we're going to have an acting director in Todd Lyons, who has a long history with Tom Homan, they have worked together to build on these enforcement operations. We're also naming a deputy secretary in Madison Sheahan, that was going to be another expansion of this team. They have done incredible work cleaning up our communities and making them safer. Adding more people to the team, with Todd and with Madison, is going to allow us to partner with local law enforcement officials to make sure that we truly are following through on enforcing the law, and if you break our law, then there's going to be consequences.",

      "\"Anyone who is leaking information outside of how something is planned for the safety of those law enforcement officers needs to be held accountable for that,\" Noem said.",
      "Noem, who was confirmed and sworn in as DHS secretary in late January, touted the administration's work on the border so far, saying \"we've seen incredible progress\" since Mr. Trump took office. She noted that the progress can be built upon, including by working with the Mexican government to \"make sure we not only have the enforcement mission at the border, but south of the border, and make sure we're going after these cartels.\"",
      "The DHS secretary argued that due to the Trump administration's tariffs, imposed last week and later delayed on Canada and Mexico, \"we're seeing them wanting to be better partners with us to keep our people safe.\"",
      "Noem stressed that the tariffs are about stopping fentanyl from entering the country, saying Mr. Trump is committed to making the country safer.",
      "\"The president obviously wants a strong economy, obviously wants better trade deals as well, but this is about fentanyl and what we can do to stop the cartels from partnering with Chinese officials laundering money and bringing a poison into our country that is specifically designed to kill the next generation,\" Noem said.",
      "Noem also announced Sunday that Todd Lyons will be serving as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who she said has a long history with border czar Tom Homan. Madison Sheahan will serve deputy secretary, she said.",
      "Amid the administration's effort to crackdown on illegal immigration and pledge to conduct the largest deportation operation in American history, illegal border crossings fell to a 25-year low last month. Asked whether she plans to keep the 6,000 military personnel at the southern border, Noem said they'll remain \"until that border is completely secure, and we see all time record lows of encounters.\"",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

    "summary": "A study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Butterflies, known for their beauty and vital role in pollination, are vanishing from U.S. landscapes at an alarming rate. A comprehensive study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
      "The new research offers a stark warning about the potential future of these cherished insects.",
      "\"Losing one out of every five butterflies over 20 years should be a big wake-up call to people,\" said Dr. Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University and co-author of the study. \"These declines are not stopping.\"",
      "While butterflies are the most extensively monitored insect group in the U.S., most past studies have been limited by geography or focused on specific species, a news release on the study said. The researchers behind the Science study used data from more than 12.6 million butterflies spanning 342 individual species, drawing from 76,000 surveys across 35 nationwide monitoring programs.",
      "Funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the study was the first to integrate such a vast dataset, its authors said. The findings revealed that 33% of butterfly species have experienced significant population declines over the past two decades, with 107 out of the 342 species examined losing more than half of their population \u2014 including 22 species that declined by more than 90%. Meanwhile, only 3% of species showed population increases.",
      "One of the most striking examples is the monarch butterfly. In December 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the monarch under the Endangered Species Act, saying the species' eastern population has declined by about 80% and the western population has dropped by more than 95% since the 1980s.",
      "The species was already designated an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2022.",
      "Ultimately, the butterfly decline is part of a larger global trend of insect population loss, with insects declining by about 1-2% annually, the study's authors said.",
      "Butterflies play an essential role in ecosystems, pollinating flowers, crops, and other plants. Their decline could have far-reaching impacts on plant reproduction and the health of ecosystems.",
      "According to the Science study, habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use are driving their declines. Rising temperatures and changing climates threaten butterfly populations by disrupting breeding cycles, reducing food sources, and increasing habitat stress. Insecticides have been identified as leading causes of butterfly decline, which can be tackled with policy intervention such as restricting harmful insecticides, promoting integrated pest management and encouraging diversified cropping, according to the study.",
      "Despite the declines, individuals can take steps to help butterfly populations recover, Grames said.",
      "\"One of the really positive messages about insect conservation is that the things we do in our own backyards actually make a difference,\" she said.",
      "She recommends allowing a portion of yards to grow wild with native plants, reducing pesticide use, and creating habitat spaces like small brush piles for insects. \"Even simple actions \u2014 like leaving a strip of wildflowers or planting species that support pollinators \u2014 can provide crucial resources for butterflies and other insects.\"",
      "On a larger scale, experts say conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and climate adaptation strategies, are also essential to protecting vulnerable species and ensuring butterfly populations remain resilient in the face of ongoing environmental changes.",

      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",

    "story": [
      "Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts\u00a0\u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.",
      "Colossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\"You're not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "\"We are in the world of synthetic biology. These tools exist. It's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. We need to be really thoughtful about the intended and unintended consequences of our actions,\" Lamm told CBS News Boston in 2022.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \"de-extinction.\"",
      "\"You might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it's not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It's changing an Asian elephant,\" said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal's technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\"It's part of how we monetize our business,\" said Lamm.",
      "Ben Mezrich, who authored the book, \"Woolly: The True Story of the Quest to Revive One of History's Most Iconic Extinct Creatures,\" told CBS News in 2017 that reviving woolly mammoths could potentially facilitate medical breakthroughs.",
      "\"I mean, elephants don't get cancer, which is very strange,\" he told CBS News. \"Elephants have thousands and thousands of more cells than us. And why they don't get cancer is in their genes. If we can figure that out, we can use this genetic engineering to solve cancer.\"",

    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

    "summary": "Viewers across North America will get to enjoy a full Blood Worm Moon during a total lunar eclipse on March 13 into March 14.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomy fans are in for a treat this March as the full moon will appear to turn red during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "March's full moon, known as the Worm Moon, will pass into Earth's shadow on the night of March 13, or early on March 14, depending on the time zone, according to NASA. This eclipse will be visible from Earth's Western Hemisphere.",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse?",
      "A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this March, the entire moon will fall within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "Each lunar eclipse is visible from half of Earth.",
      "There are also partial and penumbral eclipses, which are when the sun, Earth and moon are not perfectly aligned.",
      "Why does the moon look red during the lunar eclipse?",
      "With the moon in the shadow of the Earth, it will appear red-orange, according to NASA. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called blood moons because of the phenomenon.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, the moon gets its red coloration because any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth is filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere during the total lunar eclipse, the redder the moon will appear.",
      "\"It's as if all the world's sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the Moon,\" NASA explains in a blog post.",
      "This is the same phenomenon that makes the sky appear blue during the day.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",
      "There are also other names for March's full moon related to the transition from winter to spring. The first day of spring will be on March 20, just days after the Worm Moon.",
      "Other names for March's full moon are the Eagle Moon, Goose Moon, Crow Comes Back Moon, Sugar Moon, Wind Strong Moon and Sore Eyes Moon.",
      "What else can you see during the full Blood Worm Moon?",
      "If there's a bit of rain during the full moon, there may be a rare moonbow, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. It's like a rainbow, but created by moonlight, rather than sunlight. Moonbows only happen when the full Moon is fairly low in the sky, so the phenomenon would be most apparent in the hours after sunset when the sky is dark.",
      "Viewers can also look to the western sky on the night of the total lunar eclipse to catch a glimpse of Jupiter and Mars, according to NASA. Constellations may also be easier to spot than usual as Earth's shadow dims the Moon's glow.",

    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",

    "summary": "SpaceX made multiple changes in the wake of a January Starship failure, only to suffer a second straight vehicle breakup Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched its huge Starship rocket on the program's eighth test flight Thursday, but a malfunction of some sort triggered multiple upper stage engine shutdowns and the vehicle failed to reach its planned sub-orbital altitude, breaking apart in a spectacular shower of debris.",
      "It was the second failure in a row for a Starship upper stage, a vehicle critical to NASA's plans to return astronauts to the moon in the next few years.",
      "\"During Starship's ascent burn, the vehicle experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly and contact was lost. Our team immediately began coordination with safety officials to implement pre-planned contingency responses,\" SpaceX said in a statement.",
      "\"We will review the data from today's flight test to better understand root cause. As always, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will offer additional lessons to improve Starship's reliability.\"",
      "\"Obviously, a lot to go through, a lot to dig through. We're going to go right at it,\" said SpaceX launch commentator Dan Huot. \"The primary reason we do these flight tests is to learn. We have some more to learn about this vehicle, but we're going to be right back here in the not-too-distant future, and we're going to get a ship to space.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said it has ordered a\u00a0mishap investigation\u00a0into the loss of the Starship.",
      "Flights at several Florida airports were temporarily grounded due to the risk of falling debris.",
      "Ground stops have now been lifted, but the FAA reported Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport both had departure delays of about 45 minutes, with the cause listed as \"space launch debris.\" Flights at Palm Beach International Airport and Orlando International Airport were also affected.",
      "\"During the event, the FAA activated a Debris Response Area and briefly slowed aircraft outside the area where space vehicle debris was falling or stopped aircraft at their departure location. Normal operations have resumed,\" the agency said.",
      "Social media users across South Florida and the Caribbean posted videos showing the remnants of the spacecraft falling back to Earth.",

      "Launch began according to plan",
      "Three days after a last-minute scrub due to unspecified technical issues, SpaceX fired up the Super Heavy first stage's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines at 6:30 p.m. EST. Two seconds later, the tallest, most powerful rocket in the world lifted off from the company's launch site on the Texas Gulf Coast.",
      "Capable of generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust \u2014 more than twice the power as NASA's Saturn 5 moon rocket \u2014 the Super Heavy-Starship arced away to the east atop of long jet of bluish flame.",
      "After boosting the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere, the 230-foot-tall, 30-foot-wide Super Heavy first stage booster flew itself back to the launch site and into the grasp of two giant mechanical arms known as \"chopsticks\" mounted on the side of the launch tower.",
      "The chopsticks closed around the slowly descending booster, locking onto structural capture fixtures on both sides of the rocket. The dramatic launch pad capture, SpaceX's third, is a key element in the company's plan to enable rapid refurbishment and reuse.",
      "The 160-foot-tall Starship upper stage, meanwhile, climbed toward space as planned on the power of six Raptor engines, appearing to work flawlessly as it soared skyward toward the planned sub-orbital trajectory.",
      "Trouble 8 minutes after liftoff",
      "But a little more than eight minutes after liftoff, telemetry shown on SpaceX's live webcast indicated four of the six engines had prematurely shut down. A camera on the Starship showed the spacecraft starting to spin about and several seconds later contact was lost.",
      "Multiple videos posted on social media showed a dramatic shower of debris arcing back toward Earth after the vehicle broke up. It wasn't immediately clear if the breakup was triggered by the Starship's self-destruct system or by extreme structural loads as it fell back into the lower atmosphere.",
      "While SpaceX will no doubt attempt its usual rapid recovery, the Federal Aviation Administration will almost certainly order another failure investigation. Given two destructive breakups in a row, it could take longer to return to flight status this time around.",
      "The flight plan called for a battery of tests, including the deployment of four simulated Starlink satellites to test the Starship's payload release system, the in-space restart of one of the rocket's Raptor engines and tests of new heat shield materials and components needed for the eventual pad capture of returning Starships.",
      "At the conclusion of the sub-orbital flight, the Starship was expected fall back into the atmosphere belly first. Once past the region of maximum atmospheric heating, the rocket was programmed to flip into a vertical orientation before settling to a tail-first rocket-powered \"soft landing\" in the Indian Ocean near Australia.",
      "But it was not to be.",
      "January launch ended in self-destruct",
      "During the program's seventh integrated flight test, or IFT, in January, a fire developed just above the Super Heavy first stage engines and contact was lost eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch.",
      "Three minutes after that, the rocket's self-destruct system triggered an explosion that broke the Starship apart, producing a spectacular shower of flaming debris that rained down along the flight path.",
      "Telemetry indicated the fire broke out after propellant lines leading to one of the Raptors ruptured due to unexpected harmonic vibrations. SpaceX carried out a 60-second engine test firing of the Starship launched Monday, studying responses to various thrust levels.",
      "Based on the test results, propellant feed lines were modified, fuel temperatures were changed and thrust levels were adjusted to avoid any such harmonic responses. Additional vents were installed in the area where the fire broke out and a nitrogen purge system was added to minimize the chance of fire.",
      "It was not immediately known what went wrong Thursday.",
      "Starship program aiming for the moon",
      "Working the bugs out of the Super Heavy-Starship is critical to both SpaceX and NASA. SpaceX is under contract to NASA to supply a modified Starship to carry astronauts to landings near the moon's south pole in the agency's Artemis program.",
      "To get a Starship lander to the moon, SpaceX must first get it into low-Earth orbit, then launch multiple Super Heavy-Starship \"tankers\" to refuel the moon-bound Starship for the trip to lunar orbit.",
      "The astronauts will launch atop NASA's Space Launch System rocket and fly to the moon aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion capsule. The crew will transfer to the waiting Starship for the descent to the lunar surface. NASA hopes to send the first woman and the next man to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe, after an unpiloted Starship moon landing.",
      "Rapid reusability is a key element of the program given the number of Super Heavy-Starships that will be required for a single moon landing. Multiple successful test flights will be needed to perfect the system and demonstrate the reliability required to carry astronauts.",
      "The latest mishap comes amid ambitious SpaceX plans for major upgrades to the company's facilities at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, building a 380-foot-tall building where Super Heavy boosters and Starships can be refurbished and processed for launch from one and possibly two Florida launch pads.",
      "The towering \"Gigabay\" facility will provide 46.5 million cubic space for processing with 815,000 square feet of work space. Construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2026. Another facility is planned where Starships can be built from scratch in Florida, similar to a facility already in place at Boca Chica.",
      "\"To enable initial Starship flights from Florida while our Space Coast Starship manufacturing, integration, and refurbishment facilities are being completed, we will first transport completed Super Heavy boosters and Starship upper stage ships from Starbase via barge to build up a Starship fleet in Florida,\" SpaceX said in a statement Monday.",
      "\"With production, integration, refurbishment, and launch facilities in Florida as well as Texas, we will be in a position to quickly ramp Starship's launch rate via rapid reusability.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:30:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander is \"alive,\" but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
    "story": [
      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",
      "Second lunar lander to reach moon this year",
      "Athena's arrival is the second of three to reach the moon this year.",
      "A lander built by Austin-based\u00a0Firefly Aerospace successfully touched down on the moon early Sunday, March 2. The commercially-developed Blue Ghost lander is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments designed to collect data needed for the Artemis program.",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million for delivery of the agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon's surface. The instruments cost NASA another $44 million.",
      "Athena's instruments and technology demonstrations also were funded by NASA. The agency paid the company $62.5 million to deliver a powerful drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon's surface.",
      "NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million went to Intuitive Machines to help finance the \"Grace\" hopper.",
      "Another $89 million paid for a lunar satellite built by Lockheed Martin that was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket as Athena. But the Lunar Trailblazer satellite dropped out of contact with Earth shortly after launch and has not been heard from since.",
      "Blue Ghost and Athena were both funded in large part by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The CLPS initiative is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface later this decade.",
      "In the meantime, a Japanese lander known as Resilience was launched in January atop the same Falcon 9 rocket that boosted the Blue Ghost into space. Built by Tokyo-based ispace, Resilience took a longer, low-energy route to the moon and will not arrive until early June.",

    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-techs-big-bet-on-nuclear-power-to-fuel-artificial-intelligence/",
    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:47:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump warned that the arrest of prominent Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil by federal immigration authorities is the first \"of many to come.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump warned Monday that this weekend's arrest of prominent Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil by federal immigration authorities is the first \"of many to come\" amid his administration's crackdown on students and alleged \"agitators\" protesting Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza.",
      "The president wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social that his administration \"will not tolerate\" what he said is \"pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American\" activity on college campuses across the country, and claimed the protests are being waged by \"paid agitators,\" rather than students. As a student at Columbia University last spring, Khalil helped lead demonstrations protesting Israel and the war in Gaza.",
      "\"We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country \u2014 never to return again,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America's Colleges and Universities to comply.\"",
      "The president said the Saturday night arrest of Khalil is \"the first arrest of many to come.\"",
      "Last year, Khalil and other Columbia students set up an encampment on the school's main lawn to protest the ongoing war in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, which Israel launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack. More than 1,200 people in southern Israel were killed in the massacre and another 251 were taken hostage. Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in the fighting since, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "Khalil's lawyer, Amy Greer, said in a statement that he was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Saturday night. Greer said the ICE agents said Khalil's student visa had been revoked, but Greer noted that he is a U.S. green card holder.",
      "She has since filed a petition on Khalil's behalf challenging his arrest and detention. Greer said in her statement that immigration authorities also threatened to arrest Khalil's wife, who is a U.S. citizen and eight months pregnant.",
      "\"We will vigorously be pursuing Mahmoud's rights in court, and will continue our efforts to right this terrible and inexcusable \u2014 and calculated \u2014 wrong committed against him,\" Greer said. \"ICE's arrest and detention of Mahmoud follows the U.S. government's open repression of student activism and political speech, specifically targeting students at Columbia University for criticism of Israel's assault on Gaza. The U.S. government has made clear that they will use immigration enforcement as a tool to suppress that speech.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Khalil's arrest was \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.\" The agency alleged that Khalil \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X that the Trump administration \"will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "An online ICE database states that Khalil is being held at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, Louisiana, and lists his birthplace as Syria.",
      "Since returning to the White House for his second term, Mr. Trump and his administration have taken numerous steps in response to last year's protests on college campuses and antisemitic incidents.",
      "Among those was an executive order signed by the president in late January that pledged to revoke student visas and deport \"Hamas sympathizers.\" The order also directed the Justice Department to \"quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.\"",
      "The Department of Education has also announced investigations into five universities, including Columbia, where there have been reported incidents of antisemitic harassment. On Friday, the Trump administration moved to cancel $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia.",
      "Mr. Trump has separately threatened to strip federal funding for colleges and universities that allow \"illegal protests.\"",
      "\"Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came,\" he wrote on social media last week. \"American students will be permanently expelled or, depending [on] the crime, arrested.\"",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union condemned Khalil's arrest, calling it \"unprecedented, illegal and un-American,\" and urged the Trump administration to return him to New York and release him from custody.",
      "\"The federal government is claiming the authority to deport people with deep ties to the U.S. and revoke their green cards for advocating positions that the government opposes,\" Ben Wizner, director of its Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said in a statement. \"To be clear: The First Amendment protects everyone in the U.S.\u00a0 The government's actions are obviously intended to intimidate and chill speech on one side of a public debate.\"",

      "Caleb McCray, 23, has been charged with criminal hazing and manslaughter in Wilson's death. McCray turned himself in on March 6 and was booked into East Baton Rouge Parish Prison, Morse said. He was later released on bond, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.",
      "McCray is a current member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, according to an arrest warrant affidavit reviewed by CBS News. He is a graduate of Southern University, WAFB reported.",
      "In a statement, an attorney for McCray acknowledged the charges and said McCray \"should be afforded the opportunity to establish his innocence in the court of law.\"",
      "What was the alleged hazing ritual?",
      "Wilson and eight other Omega Psi Phi fraternity pledges went to a warehouse of a flooring company in Baton Rouge on Feb. 26 for a meeting, according to the arrest warrant. At the warehouse, they changed into gray sweatsuits.",
      "The pledges were lined up and each punched four times by at least three people wearing boxing gloves, the warrant said. McCray allegedly punched Wilson four times in the chest, according to witnesses cited in the warrant.",
      "When Wilson was punched, he appeared to have a seizure and fell to the ground, the warrant said. The other pledges were moved to a separate room while some fraternity members attended to Wilson, the warrant continued.",
      "No one called or attempted to call 911 or tried to summon an ambulance, Morse said.",
      "Wilson was later dropped off by a group of males at Baton Rouge General Medical Center, Morse said. The time between his collapse and arrival at the hospital was not immediately clear.",
      "The individuals who took him to the hospital told staff there that Wilson collapsed while playing basketball at a park, Morse said. That was later determined to not be accurate, he said.",
      "Wilson was pronounced dead by medical personnel at the hospital and police were notified of his death. An autopsy identified a \"small bruise\" on the right side of Wilson's chest, the warrant said, but further information about his cause and manner of death was not released.",
      "In a search of the warehouse, a pair of black boxing gloves were recovered, according to the warrant.",
      "No evidence indicates McCray intended to cause death or great bodily harm to the pledges, the warrant concluded.",
      "Omega Psi Phi chapter ordered to cease all activities",
      "Southern University, a historically Black university, has launched an internal investigation into the incident and ordered the Omega Psi Phi chapter to cease all activities, the school said.",
      "Additionally, the university has banned all Greek organizations on campus from taking in any new members at least through the remainder of the academic year, Dennis Shields, president of the Southern University System, said at the March 7 news conference.",
      "Students found to be involved in Wilson's death could face expulsion, Shields said.",
      "Who was Caleb Wilson?",
      "Wilson, 20, was a junior at Southern University majoring in mechanical engineering. He was from Kenner, Louisiana, WAFB reported.",
      "Wilson was a member of Southern University's marching band,\u00a0the Human Jukebox.",
      "\"A talented trumpet player, a dedicated student, and a bright soul, Caleb was a mechanical engineering major who poured his passion into both his studies and his time with the Human Jukebox,\" a post on the band's Facebook page says. \"His energy, spirit, and impact on those around him will never be forgotten.\"",
      "Wilson's family said in a statement that he was \"a bright and talented young man with a promising future ahead of him,\"\u00a0according to WAFB.",
      "A\u00a0funeral service\u00a0is set to be held on March 15, WAFB reported.",
      "What is hazing?",
      "Hazing is generally defined as an activity or action as a condition of joining or participating in a group that endangers, embarrasses or degrades a person.",
      "Hazing can occur in multiple settings, including college fraternities and sororities, school clubs or sports teams, the military and workplaces.",
      "Southern University's Greek Life Code of Conduct defines hazing as \"any action taken or situation created, intentionally, whether on or off campus, to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment, or ridicule.\"",
      "Examples in the code of conduct include marching in line, forced or extreme physical activity, forced or involuntary spending, standing for a length of time, personal servitude, sleep deprivation or interruption of consecutive sleep hours, acts of humiliation or degradation, interruption or interference of academic commitments and paddling in any form.",
      "\"All organizations on campus are required to undergo rigorous anti-hazing training,\" Southern University said in a statement.",
      "Anti-hazing laws in Louisiana",
      "Louisiana is one of 44 states that have anti-hazing laws, according to StopHazing, an organization that promotes hazing prevention.",
      "Hazing can be a felony in the state under the Max Grover Act. The law passed in 2018 and was named after a Louisiana State University student who died of alcohol poisoning after being hazed at a Phi Delta Theta fraternity house.",
      "The state law defines hazing as \"any intentional, knowing, or reckless act by a person acting alone or acting with others that is directed against another when both of the following apply:",
      "(i) The person knew or should have known that the act endangers the physical health or safety of the other person or causes severe emotional distress.",
      "(ii) The act was associated with pledging, being initiated into, affiliating with, participating in, holding office in, or maintaining membership in any organization.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is scheduled to vote Monday on former GOP Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer's nomination to lead the Labor Department under President Trump.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer served one two-year term in the House, becoming the first Republican woman elected to represent Oregon in Congress. Mr. Trump nominated Chavez-DeRemer as labor secretary after she lost her reelection bid in November, and her confirmation vote comes as nearly all of the president's Cabinet nominees have been approved by the Senate.",
      "With a history of support for pro-labor policies, Chavez-DeRemer's path to confirmation once appeared threatened. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, has opposed her nomination, and predicted in January that she would lose more than a dozen Republican votes. But she appeared poised for confirmation Monday, with support on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, a bill that would have made it easier for workers to unionize that was introduced in the last Congress. During her confirmation hearing last month, Chavez-DeRemer addressed her prior support for the bill, saying it was \"imperfect,\" while backing right-to-work laws that allow workers to choose whether or not to join a union.",
      "Though Paul's opposition threatened to tank Chavez-DeRemer's advancement out of committee last month, three Democrats on the committee ultimately voted to move her nomination forward. And although Democrats haven't been eager to support some of Mr. Trump's nominees amid intense criticism of the administration's work so far, Chavez-DeRemer was expected to see bipartisan support Monday.",
      "Monday's confirmation vote comes after Chavez-DeRemer's nomination cleared a procedural hurdle in a 66-30 vote last week, with 15 Democrats voting with all present Republicans except Paul to advance her nomination.",
      "Though some of her previous views may have conflicted with the administration, Chavez-DeRemer committed during her confirmation hearing to implementing Mr. Trump's policy vision.",
      "\"My guiding principle will be President Trump's guiding principle \u2014 ensuring a level playing field for businesses, unions and, most importantly, the American worker,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress is staring down a deadline to fund the government by the end of the week, as the familiar threat of a shutdown looms over Washington.",
      "Lawmakers have until the end of the day on Friday, March 14, to fund the government. But it remains to be seen whether House Republicans will be able to muster the near-unanimous GOP support they'll need to pass the short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution.",
      "Here's what to know about the funding fight:",
      "What is a government shutdown, exactly?",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding or funding extensions for federal agencies and programs, resulting in a funding gap that prompts federal agencies to shut down projects and activities. During a shutdown, agencies halt nonessential functions until Congress approves funding and the president signs it into law. Essential services, like air traffic control and law enforcement, continue during a shutdown, but workers go without pay until funding is passed. Shutdowns can also disrupt processing of government benefits, loans and applications and shutter national parks.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have used funding deadlines to their advantage in recent decades, leveraging the threat of a government shutdown to pass spending bills with their priorities attached. But lawmakers generally have strong incentives to avoid shutdowns, since they can be economically and politically costly. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the last funding lapse caused a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "How does Congress fund the government?",
      "Article I of the Constitution gives \u00a0Congress the power to approve any money spent by the federal government. Bills to approve that spending must originate in the House, pass the Senate and be signed by the president before departments and agencies can use the funds.",
      "Congress is tasked annually with approving spending bills before the beginning of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. Under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the president is supposed to submit a budget to Congress by the first Monday of February, outlining how much the executive branch needs for the coming year. The House and Senate budget committees then go on to pass a budget resolution by the middle of April, before the House begins considering the 12 individual appropriations bills drafted by subcommittees to fund different areas of the government, to be concluded by the end of June.",
      "In recent decades, Congress has hardly ever stuck to that timeline. Instead, lawmakers opt almost every year for continuing resolutions that extend funding before ultimately adopting massive bills, known as omnibus packages, in lieu of the 12 appropriations bills to get the new funding over the finish line. Tucked within those omnibus packages are often policies or programs that wouldn't pass if they were taken up in isolation, making them appealing to some lawmakers.",
      "Currently, Congress is still working on the funding process that was meant to be resolved by October of last year. Lawmakers passed a funding patch just ahead of the deadline in late September, giving themselves three more months to reach an agreement on new government funding and pass appropriations bills. Then in December, Congress approved another extension, setting up the March 14 deadline.",
      "What needs to happen this week to prevent a shutdown?",
      "To fund the government and avert a shutdown, both the House and Senate need to pass a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, extending funding. The measure would then go to President Trump for his signature.",
      "House Republicans unveiled a continuing resolution over the weekend, which would extend government funding through September. The stopgap measure would increase defense spending, along with additional funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. The bill also includes more funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "The resolution first goes to the House Rules Committee, before a vote on the floor as soon as Tuesday. Republicans, who have a razor-thin majority in the House, are working to shore up support on the measure, with opposition expected from House Democrats. Already at least one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, has pledged to oppose the continuing resolution.",
      "If the House is unable to find the necessary support for the six-month continuing resolution, lawmakers would likely move to a shorter-term funding measure that would give appropriators more time to flesh out new spending bills. Democrats have signaled in recent days that they prefer the latter approach, which would likely find wide bipartisan margins in both chambers, while frustrating conservatives.",
      "Many Democrats have reservations about the six-month stopgap measure, warning that it would give the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. That's because a continuing resolution, unlike regular appropriations bills, lacks a congressional statement of direction on how funds are to be spent by a department or agency. Democrats have also expressed frustration with the spending reductions in the continuing resolution. But Democrats generally aren't inclined to let the government shut down, and House Republicans \u2014 expected to leave town after the stopgap measure passes \u2014 are exerting pressure to avoid a shutdown.",
      "Should the House find enough support to approve the six-month stopgap measure, it would then go to the Senate. But the upper chamber poses its own hurdles. Republicans have a 53-seat majority in the Senate, but 60 votes are necessary to propel the bill to passage, meaning support from Democrats will be needed. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has also pledged to oppose the measure, making support from at least eight Democrats necessary to pass the measure and send it to the president's desk.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "Since the current budget process was enacted in 1976, Congress has prompted 20 funding gaps lasting at least one full day, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Many of those funding lapses were short lived and didn't prompt a shutdown, while a handful have been lengthy funding fights with major political significance and impact. In 2013, a feud over the Affordable Care Act prompted a shutdown. And disagreements over immigration prompted two shutdowns in 2018 \u2014 the second of which marked the most recent government shutdown, and the longest on record.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history started in 2018 and lasted 34 days. The shutdown occurred over an impasse on funding for Mr. Trump's border wall during his first term. But as the fight stretched into the new year, the president signed a bill to reopen the government without his demands being met.",
      "Before the 2018-2019 shutdown, a 1995-1996 shutdown held the record for the longest, at 21 days. The dispute concerned disagreement over spending cuts between President Bill Clinton and then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

They compared an original set of prints taken in Puerto Rico in 1986, the year before Milla-Valdes fled incarceration, with another set collected by authorities in South Florida's Monroe County, near the Everglades, where \"Luis Aguirre\" apparently had a criminal history. His record in Monroe County included robbery and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to the Lee County sheriff.",
      "The analysis confirmed both prints were a match within 15 minutes, the office said. The Puerto Rico Department of Justice had previously tipped off Lee County law enforcement to the escaped prisoner's possible whereabouts in Fort Myers, as well as his believed alias. That helped members of the sheriff's fugitive warrants unit find what they believed to be Milla-Valdes' residence in the neighborhood Fort Myers Shores.",
      "Milla-Valdes admitted to breaking out of prison and adopting a different name in body camera footage recorded as he was being taken into custody, which the sheriff also shared on social media. Asked by an officer whether he used to go by \"Jorge,\" Milla-Valdes, while handcuffed, said, \"Yeah, years ago. About 40 years ago.\" He acknowledged that was around the time he escaped from jail in Puerto Rico, and the officer informed him Puerto Rican authorities had put out a warrant for his arrest.",

      "Beijing imposed the levies in response to President Trump's extra 10% blanket tariff on Chinese goods. Under China's retaliatory action, U.S. farmers now face levies of 15% on chicken, wheat and corn, and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.",
      "China is the largest market for such products, and if prices of foreign-grown goods rise in China, locals will turn to less expensive alternatives either from China or other countries. American farmers that deal in chicken and more will likely lose market share as a result.",
      "\"If prices go up, folks won't eat imported stuff,\" a fruit seller, surnamed Shi, told Agence France-Presse. \"There will be more domestic goods sold, and I think this is something folks can accept.\"",

      "Goods that shipped before Monday and arrive in China before April 12 will not be subject to the new tariffs.",
      "\"A web of uncertainty\"",
      "Virginia-based farmer John Boyd Jr., president of the National Black Farmers Association, told CBS MoneyWatch that Mr. Trump's trade conflict with China hits farmers like himself hard.",
      "For one, Mr. Trump's earlier flip-flopping on his tariff policy vis-a-vis Mexico and Canada \"has cast a web of uncertainty around agriculture,\" Boyd told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You are really shaking at the root of all the major commodities that we produce in the U.S., because we are a market-driven industry.\"",

      "Last Friday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins stated on X that a $600,000 grant to Southern University in Louisiana was being revoked for studying \"menstrual cycles in transgender men,\" in the latest mischaracterization of a grant that was then canceled by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency team, known as DOGE.",
      "DOGE highlighted the Rollins post, reposting it on the official doge.gov website and on X.",
      "The grant was actually intended for research on the potential health risks posed by synthetic feminine hygiene products and for developing alternatives using natural fibers and fabrics, according to the project's documentation, which was publicly filed on the USDA website.",
      "According to that documentation, the goals of the grant were to develop sustainable feminine hygiene products using regenerative cotton, wool, and industrial hemp while enhancing education through an extension program that teaches women and girls about menstrual health and reusable products. It also would have funded a fiber processing center for locally grown fibers in Louisiana \u2014 potentially benefiting a state with some of the highest unemployment and poverty rates in the country.",
      "The USDA's decision to cancel the grant appears to have been a result of the grant being flagged to the Trump administration by the American Principles Project, a conservative think tank.",
      "Cailey Myers, a spokesperson for the American Principles Project, said in an email to CBS News, \"This grant clearly denies biological reality \u2014 men don't menstruate,\" but did not provide any evidence the grant funded research into \"menstrual cycles in transgender men.\"",
      "A USDA spokesperson confirmed this reasoning in a statement emailed to CBS News, saying the taxpayer-funded education component of the grant \"prioritized women identifying as men who might menstruate.\"",
      "\"This mission certainly does not align with the priorities and policies of the Trump Administration, which maintains that there are two sexes: male and female,\" the statement said.",
      "While the grant language does include a single sentence acknowledging that transgender men are among those who menstruate, there was no indication that they were the focus of the grant or even part of it. The passing reference to transgender men in the original grant application appears to be the sole justification for its cancellation.",
      "The description of the grant's goals, objectives and project methods contains no mention of prioritizing transgender men and focuses solely on the development of menstrual products made from natural fibers. The grant repeatedly notes that it would focus on efforts to \"educate young women and adolescent girls\" about menstrual hygiene products.",
      "The USDA, asked in a follow-up question whether it had any evidence that the study prioritized transgender men, did not respond.",
      "The true purpose of the project, according to the grant, was to \"address the growing concerns and issues surrounding menstruation, including the potential health risks posed to users of synthetic feminine hygiene products.\"",
      "According to 2022 study published in the journal Current Environmental Health Reports, there have only been limited studies on the risks of environmental contamination from synthetic hygiene products, despite the potential for toxic chemical exposure. Some of the concerns include whether exposure to heavy metals and PFAS chemicals could be harmful or cancer causing.",
      "Dr. Samii Kennedy Benson, who oversaw the program, told the local NBC affiliate WVLA the program held potential for U.S. farmers.",
      "\"Our local fiber processing facility will benefit local farmers who often grow fibers on a smaller scale and so we'll also have that ability to provide something local,\" Benson said.",
      "CBS affiliate WAFB in Baton Rouge also covered the project.",

      "Ontario, Canada's most populous province, is adding a 25% surcharge to all electricity exports sent to the U.S. as part of retaliation against the Trump administration's tariffs on Canadian products.",
      "The 25% surcharge will be effective as of March 10, and will affect consumers and businesses in Michigan, Minnesota and New York, the province said in a Monday statement. The new fee will add as much as $400,000 Canadian dollars ($277,000) in daily costs for 1.5 million U.S. homes and businesses, it added.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford estimated it will add about CA$100, or $69 a month, to the bills of each American affected.",
      "On March 8, Ford told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe that President Trump's tariff plan was creating \"mass chaos,\" and added that a trade war between the U.S. and Canada was \"unacceptable.\" During the interview, he also said that while he has a great relationship with the governments of Michigan, Minnesota and New York, he planned to impose a 25% surcharge on energy products starting March 10 unless the trade dispute came to an end.",
      "\"President Trump's tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They're making life more expensive for American families and businesses,\" Premier Doug Ford said in Monday's statement. \"Until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario won't back down. We'll stand strong, use every tool in our toolkit and do whatever it takes to protect Ontario.\"",

      "\"While the vast majority of Michigan's electricity is either produced by the electric utilities or purchased under long-term power contracts, the imposition of these tariffs could have some impact on prices in the regional energy markets, though the ultimate impact on Michigan customers is likely to be small,\" the regulatory agency said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico went into effect last week, although on Thursday he said he would delay the levies by one month, until April 2.

    "summary": "The dispute will be heard by the Supreme Court in its next term, which begins in October.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to take up a challenge to state and local laws that ban so-called \"conversion therapy\" for LGBTQ children.",
      "The dispute before the court arose out of a Colorado law that prohibits licensed mental health professionals from engaging in conversion therapy on children who may be questioning their sexual orientation or gender identity. More than 20 states and the District of Columbia have similar laws on the books. The case will be heard in the Supreme Court's next term, which begins in October. A decision is expected by the end of June 2026.",
      "Colorado enacted the Minor Conversion Therapy Law in 2019 following what the state said was a growing mental health crisis among young people in the state and \"mounting evidence\" that conversion therapy is tied to increased depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation.",
      "The law prohibits \"any practice or treatment [upon minors] \u2026 that attempts or purports to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\"",
      "The state joined more than a dozen others in disciplining mental health professionals who practice conversion therapy on minors. Those who are found to engage in this practice face a range of punishments, from fines to a letter of admonition to having their license revoked.",
      "The challenge to Colorado's law was brought by Kaley Chiles, a professional counselor who is licensed by the state and uses talk therapy in her practice. A practicing Christian, Chiles works with adults and young people, and many of her clients are also Christian.",
      "According to court papers, some of Chiles' clients seek Christian-based counseling \"to reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body.\"",
      "Chiles' sued the state of Colorado in September 2022 and sought to block enforcement of the state's restriction on conversion therapy. She argued that the measure violates her free speech rights under the First Amendment and censors her conversations with clients based on viewpoint.",
      "A federal district court declined to block the law, finding that it regulates professional conduct that incidentally involves speech. The court also found that conversion therapy is \"ineffective and harms minors.\"",
      "Chiles' appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which upheld the lower court's decision. The 10th Circuit said that the restriction on conversion therapy implicates speech solely as to the practice of mental health treatment, which can be licensed by the state. The appeals court also concluded that Colorado's law advances its interests in protecting minors and the integrity of the mental health profession.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, lawyers for Chiles argued that she does not seek to \"cure\" her clients of same-sex attractions or change their sexual orientation. Instead, they said she aims to help her clients \"with their stated desires and objectives in counseling, which sometimes includes clients seeking to reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with one's physical body.\"",
      "\"Colorado disagrees with Chiles's beliefs on gender and sexuality. So much so that the State puts itself in Chiles's counseling room, forbidding her from discussing the values she and her clients share,\" her lawyers wrote in a Supreme Court filing. She is represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group.",
      "But Colorado officials said that the First Amendment allows states to regulate professional conduct to protect patients from \"substandard treatment,\"even when that rule \"incidentally\" burdens speech. They argued that efforts to change a young person's sexual orientation or gender identity are \"unsafe and ineffective.\"",
      "\"A professional's treatment of her patients and clients is fundamentally different, for First Amendment purposes, from laypersons' interactions with each other,\" Colorado officials wrote in a filing. \"Unlike laypersons, those who choose to practice as health professionals are required, among various other responsibilities, to provide treatment to their patients consistent with their field's standard of care.\"",
      "The state argued that Chiles' claim undercut the ability of states to protect patients and clients from \"harmful professional conduct.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has been asked before to jump into the debate over conversion therapy, but had previously declined to intervene. In 2023, the court turned away a First Amendment challenge to a Washington state law that prohibits licensed therapists from performing conversion therapy on patients under the age of 18.",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh said then that they would have taken up the appeal from a licensed licensed marriage and family counselor in the state.",

    "summary": "As bird flu continues to spread, impacting poultry farms and the price of eggs, the Agriculture Department says it's almost doubling the amount spent to combat it.",
    "story": [
      "Despite a major federal investment to help egg and poultry producers bounce back from bird flu losses, finding eggs at a reasonable price \u2014 or any eggs at all \u2014 remains a tough task for shoppers across the U.S.",
      "In January, egg prices rose 15.2%, and economists say they expect prices to continue to rise this year.",
      "The increase is due to the limited number of hens laying eggs right now. There are fewer hens because of federal bird flu control measures. They require farmers to kill their chickens if they discover a bird flu case in a flock \u2014 a process known as \"culling\" \u2014 to try to prevent the viral disease from spreading.",
      "When farmers cull their flocks to prevent the spread of a disease like the bird flu, they are eligible for public money to help them replace the flocks.",
      "Since 2020, the Department of Agriculture has paid $1.1 billion to hundreds of egg producers who had to cull their flocks to stop bird flu from spreading, according to a CBS News analysis of federal data.",
      "Now, the USDA says it will\u00a0send $400 million more to farmers who need new chickens. The agency also says it will pay $500 million for biosecurity measures and $100 million \"for vaccine research, action to reduce regulatory burdens, and exploring temporary import options.\"",
      "Frank Singleton, a spokesperson for Wayne-Sanderson Farms \u2014 the third largest poultry producer in the nation \u2014 is glad the USDA is helping.",
      "He says his company has 23 plants and 2,000 partner farms in seven states, employing 26,000 people across the Southeast and processing 21 million broiler chickens a week for sale of their meat into the consumer market.",
      "Wayne-Sanderson Farms received more than $600,000 from the USDA's bird flu assistance program to replace three flocks the company culled after discovering bird flu cases in 2023 and 2024.",
      "Singleton says the checks are an important investment to help the farms his company sponsors get back on track.",
      "\"It's a partnership with the farmers, and the consumer, and our company, to make sure we can continue to feed America,\" he says. \"It would be very difficult to get a farmer to take a risk like that without a farm partner like Wayne-Sanderson Farms. So that's where we step in. We make sure that we do our part, our due diligence, help them get back up to speed, and work to make sure those funds are available to them.\"",
      "Culling flocks and shielding them from bird flu",
      "The process of culling is arduous. Singleton says his company sprays a foam agent over the affected chickens to kill them quickly.",
      "\"Different farms and different companies have different methods,\" he said. \"We use a humane method to euthanize all the birds. It's all supervised by regulatory folks and our teams.\"",
      "\"Ours is an approved, USDA-approved method where a foaming agent used, and it's very quick,\" Singleton continued. \"So, those birds have to be disposed of. The house itself has to be cleaned up and sanitized. So it's a long process, and it takes awhile for the farmer to get back up and running. So we work with them directly to make sure that happens.\"",
      "Singleton says there are several proactive measures his company is taking to protect farms from exposure in the first place.",
      "Biosecurity measures are so tight for Wayne-Sanderson Farms, our CBS News cameras were not allowed inside a farm or facility.",
      "\"It just takes one vector to infect a flock so, from the time people come to the farm, using disinfectant sprays, wearing coveralls, wearing personal protective gear, goggles, those kinds of things \u2014 limiting the type of people, the number of people,\" Singleton explained. \"We make sure our people have the equipment, they have the chemicals, the disinfectants, and they have the knowledge. ... It's very critical. Every individual has to do their part to make sure that this doesn't happen.\"",
      "His company supports a recent proposal from other egg and poultry industry leaders to allow broiler eggs \u2014 eggs typically used to hatch chicks \u2014 to be used in consumer products amid the national shortage of traditional eggs.",
      "After a law change in 2009 that stipulated that eggs must be refrigerated sooner if sold into the consumer market, broiler egg producers were no longer able to send excess broiler eggs to consumer companies needing them for things like cakes and pies, because broiler eggs are typically stored at a higher temperature during the first 48 hours prior to shipment.",
      "Singleton says his company throws out 560,000 broiler eggs a week \u2014 about 2% of the total 26 million broiler eggs Wayne-Sanderson Farms produces.",
      "If the Food and Drug Administration were to allow the broiler eggs to be used in consumer products, Singleton says, it would be a win-win.",
      "\"We certainly want to do our part to help feed the country and (solve) a need where a need is there; certainly (that) would help us from a waste standpoint and just from employees having to work on that particular aspect of it,\" Singleton said. \"So, it's really just a cost savings and an efficiency savings and putting food back into the marketplace for consumers.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Food and Drug Administration says it is still considering the proposal.",
      "A smaller farm's approach in the bird flu saga",
      "Another company currently able to fill the need is a small independent farm in the northern Alabama city of Madison called Southard Farms.",
      "It has been in co-owner Keith Southard's family for five generations. Southard turned the farm into a pasture-raised poultry, egg and pork production operation in 2019 and never dreamed his business would be booming so soon.",
      "He says over the last month, his phone has been ringing off the hook with restaurants seeking eggs.",
      "\"It's been it's been crazy. It's been busy. My phone rings constantly,\" Southard said. \"Huge, huge opportunity for growth, and people are searching now ... not just to find eggs but something different \u2014 to find good eggs, fresh, local, that they don't just depend on a store to provide them; they know where it's coming from.\"",
      "Southard's father grows grows crops on the farm and they in turn use the crops as feed for his chickens.",
      "He has 900 laying hens for eggs and 700 broiler chickens \u2014 or chickens used for meat.",
      "Right now, Southard's hens lay about 400 eggs a week. A few weeks ago, Southard signed a contract with a restaurant in Birmingham to sell it 500 dozen eggs a week. Southard says he expects his total egg production in the next few months will be just under 1,000 dozen a week to meet the demand.",
      "Unlike in traditional egg farms, where laying hens are kept in an indoor warehouse, Southard's chickens live an outdoor lifestyle, rotating regularly onto fresh grass to graze. He says the pasture-raised format keeps his chickens' immune systems stronger.",
      "\"No medicines needed to keep them going. So, we just use nature's benefits,\" Southard says.",
      "However, the outdoor living could make them more susceptible to coming into contact with wild birds that could be carrying the avian (bird) flu.",
      "\"There's always that risk,\" Southard says. \"We just hope that it doesn't affect us.\"",
      "Last year, Southard had to cull his flock after chickens got hit with a bacterial infection, different than bird flu, called mycoplasma. He says the experience was devastating.",
      "\"I noticed a few symptoms, and then within three days, we went from a normal amount of eggs per day to almost zero, and it was very similar symptoms to the avian flu, so (we) immediately took the hens to the state lab for testing ... and once we got the results in, there really wasn't any answer but to just cull the flock and start over,\" Southard recalled.",
      "He said he and his farmhand had to personally kill each chicken by cutting their throats to make it as quick and painless for the birds as possible.",
      "\"Nothing I want to see again, that's for sure,\" Southard said.",
      "Because mycoplasma is not considered a \"highly-pathogenic\" disease, he did not qualify for the USDA's program to receive a check to help him finance the replacement of his chickens.",
      "\"We just bared through it and kept going,\" Southard says.",
      "And kept going he did.",
      "Southard took us to Farm Burger in Huntsville, Alabama, one of the restaurants that uses his chicken meat and eggs. The staff affectionately calls out, \"The Chicken Man's here!\" upon his arrival to deliver his product in person each week.",
      "The restaurant's co-owner and manager says Southard has been a blessing to his business because Southard has kept his prices low at a time when other restaurants in neighboring states have seen egg prices more than double in the last few months.",
      "Low prices for the restaurant also mean costs don't have to be passed on to customers.",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal data found some farms received large checks from the USDA indemnity and reimbursement program after culling their flocks last year \u2014 one egg producer received $10 million.",
      "Asked his thoughts about the taxpayer expense, Southard said, \"I think there's probably, there's definitely a question there about when USDA should get involved or not. So, I think that should be looked into to some more, because obviously we see still these big supply problems. So, I don't think we have the right answer yet, but it should be looked into some more.\"",
      "With supply issues and high egg costs expected at least another year, Southard says it's important to protect small farms.",
      "\"Small farmers like us, family farms, play a key role, because it takes away the big consolidation that's happened and spreads out the risk where you have more farms across the state or country and more farmers,\" Southard says. \"So, if one gets hit, it's not as big of an effect on the whole supply chain.\"",

      "\"Our exclusive original jurisdiction over suits between states reflects a determination by the framers and by Congress about the need 'to open and keep open the highest court of the nation' for such suits, in recognition of the 'rank and dignity of the states,\" Thomas wrote in a dissent joined by Alito. \"Yet, this court has \u2014 essentially for policy reasons \u2014 assumed a power to summarily turn away suits between states. The court today exercises that power to reject a suit involving nearly half the states in the nation, which alleges serious constitutional violations.\"",
      "The lawsuits",
      "The novel suits were brought by California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey and Rhode Island and seek to hold energy companies liable for allegedly deceiving the public about the dangers of their fossil-fuel products.",
      "Filed between 2018 and 2023, the suits allege claims arising under state laws but broadly accuse the energy industry of knowing for decades that greenhouse gas emissions would contribute to climate change. The states claim that oil and gas companies engaged in deceptive marketing by misrepresenting the dangers of their fossil fuel products, which caused consumers to use more of them.",
      "The oil and gas companies sought to move nearly all the cases to federal court, arguing that federal law governs interstate emissions, but the efforts were rejected by U.S. courts of appeals.",
      "The cases are now proceeding in state courts and are in the early stages of litigation.",
      "Oil and gas companies separately asked the Supreme Court to shut down a lawsuit brought by the city of Honolulu that is seeking to hold the industry liable for harms caused by the effects of climate change. But the high court in January said it would not consider the appeal from the 15 companies, including Sunono and Shell, which cleared the way for the cases to move forward in Hawaii state court.",
      "Alabama and 18 other Republican-led states separately went to the Supreme Court and urged it to exercise its original jurisdiction over disputes between the states. They asked the high court to block the civil suits filed by the Democratic-led states and prevent other litigation seeking similar relief in the future.",

      "The discovery was made not far from where the body of Jones' fianc\u00e9e, Spelman College instructor Joycelyn Wilson, was found a day after the two went missing on Feb. 8, the newspaper reported. It comes a month to the day that Wilson's body was recovered in the vicinity of where Jones' empty two-seater fishing boat and his sneakers were found floating.",
      "Sills said Jones' body was found by Wisconsin search-and-recovery expert Keith Cormican, who was brought in by Jones' family over the weekend and used sophisticated underwater sonar in his effort, the newspaper reported.",
      "The body of missing teacher Gary Jones was found in Lake Oconee Sunday, according to the Putnam County Sheriff\u2019s Office.https://t.co/qfAzOhT6Ul",
      "Jones was a teacher and coach at the Westminster Schools, an exclusive Atlanta private school. The empty boat was discovered circling in the water, triggering an intensive search of the lake.",
      "The sheriff's office said previously that it had obtained video of Wilson and Jones launching their small boat from a marina. Authorities said at the time that they had been staying at a hotel on the lake, about 85 miles southeast of Atlanta.",
      "The area where the body was found is about 3 miles northwest of a dam that separates Lake Oconee from neighboring Lake Sinclair just to the south. Underwater timber still stands from when the Oconee River basin was flooded to build the lake nearly half a century ago.",
      "Previous searches involved a trained cadaver dog, government vessels and private boats, a helicopter and underwater sonar to probe parts of the lake as deep as 80 feet.",
      "According to Westminster President Keith Evans, Jones joined the staff in 2002 and was a middle school science teacher, eighth grade basketball coach and head of the track and field program, Atlanta News First reported.",
      "\"I have had the privilege of connecting with alumni, parents, students, and faculty members who have shared stories of Gary's legacy and the many ways he inspired both his students and colleagues.

      "According to ANF, Wilson was a math instructor at Spelman College, \"where she made an indelible impact on both her students and colleagues,\" the college said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Hospital-based violence intervention programs have operated in the U.S. since the mid-1990s, but recent moves by the Trump White House are raising anxiety about the programs' future.",
    "story": [
      "Seven years ago, Erica Green learned through a Facebook post that her brother had been shot.",
      "She rushed to check on him at a hospital run by Denver Health, the city's safety-net system, but she was unable to get information from emergency room workers, who complained that she was creating a disturbance.",
      "\"I was distraught and outside, crying, and Jerry came out of the front doors,\" she said.",
      "Jerry Morgan is a familiar face from Green's Denver neighborhood. He had rushed to the hospital after his pager alerted him to the shooting. As a violence prevention professional with the At-Risk Intervention and Mentoring program, or AIM, Morgan supports gun-violence patients and their families at the hospital \u2014 as he did the day Green's brother was shot.",
      "\"It made the situation of that traumatic experience so much better. After that, I was, like, I want to do this work,\" Green said.",
      "Today, Green works with Morgan as the program manager for AIM, a hospital-linked violence intervention program launched in 2010 as a partnership between Denver Health and the nonprofit Denver Youth Program. It since has expanded to include Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado Hospital.",
      "AIM is one of dozens of hospital-linked violence intervention programs around the country. The programs aim to uncover the social and economic factors that contributed to someone ending up in the ER with a bullet wound: inadequate housing, job loss, or feeling unsafe in one's neighborhood, for example.",
      "Such programs that take a public health approach to stopping gun violence have had success \u2014 one in San Francisco reported a fourfold reduction in violent injury recidivism rates over six years. But President Trump's executive orders calling for the review of the Biden administration's gun policies and trillions of dollars in federal grants and loans have created uncertainty around the programs' long-term federal funding. Some organizers believe their programs will be just fine, but others are looking to shore up alternative funding sources.",
      "\"We've been worried about, if a domino does fall, how is it going to impact us? There's a lot of unknowns,\" said John Torres, associate director for Youth Alive, an Oakland, California-based nonprofit.",
      "Federal data shows that gun violence became a leading cause of death among children and young adults at the start of this decade and was tied to more than 48,000 deaths among people of all ages in 2022. New York-based pediatric trauma surgeon Chethan Sathya, a National Institutes of Health-funded firearms injury prevention researcher, believes those statistics show that gun violence can't be ignored as a health care issue. \"It's killing so many people,\" Sathya said.",
      "Research shows that a violent injury puts someone at heightened risk for future ones, and the risk of death goes up significantly by the third violent injury, according to a 2006 study published in The Journal of Trauma: Injury, Infection and Critical Care.",
      "Benjamin Li, an emergency medicine physician at Denver Health and the health system's AIM medical director, said the ER is an ideal setting to intervene in gun violence by working to reverse-engineer what led to a patient's injuries.",
      "\"If you are just seeing the person, patching them up, and then sending them right back into the exact same circumstances, we know it's going to lead to them being hurt again,\" Li said. \"It's critical we address the social determinants of health and then try to change the equation.\"",
      "That might mean providing alternative solutions to gunshot victims who might otherwise seek retaliation, said Paris Davis, the intervention programs director for Youth Alive.",
      "\"If that's helping them relocate out of the area, if that's allowing them to gain housing, if that's shifting that energy into education or job or, you know, family therapy, whatever the needs are for that particular case and individual, that is what we provide,\" Davis said.",
      "AIM outreach workers meet gunshot wound victims at their hospital bedsides to have what Morgan, AIM's lead outreach worker, calls a tough, nonjudgmental conversation on how the patients ended up there.",
      "AIM uses that information to help patients access the resources they need to navigate their biggest challenges after they're discharged, Morgan said. Those challenges can include returning to school or work, or finding housing. AIM outreach workers might also attend court proceedings and assist with transportation to health care appointments.",
      "\"We try to help in whatever capacity we can, but it's interdependent on whatever the client needs,\" Morgan said.",
      "Since 2010, AIM has grown from three full-time outreach workers to nine, and this year opened the REACH Clinic in Denver's Five Points neighborhood. The community-based clinic provides wound-care kits; physical therapy; and behavioral, mental and occupational health care. In the coming months, it plans to add bullet removal to its services. It's part of a growing movement of community-based clinics focused on violent injuries, including the Bullet Related Injury Clinic in St. Louis.",
      "Ginny McCarthy, an assistant professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Colorado, described REACH as an extension of the hospital-based work, providing holistic treatment in a single location and building trust between health care providers and communities of color that have historically experienced racial biases in medical care.",
      "Caught in the Crossfire, created in 1994 and run by Youth Alive in Oakland, is cited as the nation's first hospital-linked violence intervention program and has since inspired others. The Health Alliance for Violence Intervention, a national network initiated by Youth ALIVE to advance public health solutions to gun violence, counted 74 hospital-linked violence intervention programs among its membership as of January.",
      "The alliance's executive director, Fatimah Loren Dreier, compared medicine's role in addressing gun violence to that of preventing an infectious disease, like cholera. \"That disease spreads if you don't have good sanitation in places where people aggregate,\" she said.",
      "Dreier, who also serves as executive director of the Kaiser Permanente Center for Gun Violence Research and Education, said medicine identifies and tracks patterns that lead to the spread of a disease or, in this case, the spread of violence.",
      "\"That is what health care can do really well to shift society. When we deploy this, we get better outcomes for everybody,\" Dreier said.",
      "The alliance, of which AIM is a member, offers technical assistance and training for hospital-linked violence intervention programs and successfully petitioned to make their services eligible for traditional insurance reimbursement.",
      "In 2021, President Joe Biden issued an executive action that opened the door for states to use Medicaid for violence prevention. Several states, including California, New York, and Colorado, have passed legislation establishing a Medicaid benefit for hospital-linked violence intervention programs.",
      "Last summer, then-U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared gun violence a public health crisis, and the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act earmarked $1.4 billion in funding for a wide array of violence-prevention programs through next year.",
      "But in early February, Mr. Trump issued an executive order instructing the U.S. attorney general to conduct a 30-day review of a number of Biden's policies on gun violence. The White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention now appears to be defunct, and recent moves to freeze federal grants created uncertainty among the gun-violence prevention programs that receive federal funding.",
      "AIM receives 30% of its funding from its operating agreement with Denver's Office of Community Violence Solutions, according to Li. The rest is from grants, including Victims of Crime Act funding, through the Department of Justice. As of mid-February, Mr. Trump's executive orders had not affected AIM's current funding.",
      "Some who work with the hospital-linked violence prevention programs in Colorado are hoping a new voter-approved\u00a0firearms and ammunition excise tax in the state, expected to generate about $39 million annually and support victim services, could be a new source of funding. But the tax's revenues aren't expected to fully flow until 2026, and it's not clear how that money will be allocated.",
      "Trauma surgeon and public health researcher Catherine Velopulos, who is the AIM medical director at the University of Colorado hospital in Aurora, said any interruption in federal funding, even for a few months, would be \"very difficult for us.\" But Velopulos said she was reassured by the bipartisan support for the kind of work AIM does.",
      "\"People want to oversimplify the problem and just say, 'If we get rid of guns, it's all going to stop,' or 'It doesn't matter what we do, because they're going to get guns, anyway,'\" she said. \"What we really have to address is why people feel so scared that they have to arm themselves.\"",

      "Where did ships collide in the North Sea?",
      "Crowley Maritime, which operates the U.S.-flagged chemical and oil products carrier MV Stena Immaculate, said the tanker was anchored in the North Sea off the coast of Hull, about 155 miles north of London, when it was struck by the Portugal-flagged container ship Solong.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office said details of the collision and its cause \"are still becoming clear.\" Abdul Khalique, head of the Maritime Center at Liverpool John Moores University, said it appeared the crew of the cargo ship had not been \"maintaining a proper lookout by radar\" as required by international maritime regulations.",
      "The Stena Immaculate was at anchor near the port of Grimsby, according to ship-tracking site VesselFinder. The Solong was sailing from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. According to the BBC, the Stena Immaculate was en route from Agio Theodoroi in Greece to Killingholme in the U.K.",
      "It is one of just 10 tankers enlisted in a U.S. government program designed to supply the armed forces with fuel during times of armed conflict or national emergency, the BBC reported. A cargo tank on the ship containing jet fuel ruptured, leaking fuel and a fire broke out, Crowley said.",
      "\"The Stena Immaculate crew abandoned the vessel following multiple explosions onboard,\" Crowley said. \"All Crowley mariners are safe and fully accounted for.\"",
      "The company said it was working with authorities to contain the fire and secure the vessel.",

      "Meanwhile, business information service Lloyd's List Intelligence said the cargo ship was carrying 15 containers of the chemical sodium cyanide. It wasn't immediately clear if any of the containers were damaged.",
      "A U.S. official confirmed that the Stena Immaculate was carrying cargo in support of the Defense  Department, CBS News senior national security correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported. The collision will not impact operations or combat readiness, the official said.",
      "Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East, said 13 casualties were brought in on a Windcat 33 high-speed vessel, followed by another 19 on a harbor pilot boat. He said he was told about the fireball following the collision.",
      "\"It's too far out for us to see \u2014 about 10 miles \u2014 but we have seen the vessels bringing them in,\" he said. \"They must have sent a mayday out. Luckily there was a crew transfer vessel out there already. Since then, there has been a flotilla of ambulances to pick up anyone they can find.\"",
      "Erik Hanell, CEO of the Stena Immaculate's co-owner Stena Bulk,\u00a0told BBC News\u00a0that the ship's crew consisted of more than 20 people.",
      "Britain's Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the alarm was raised at 9:48 a.m. local time (5:48 a.m. EDT).",
      "The coast guard said several lifeboats and a coast guard rescue helicopter were dispatched to the scene in the North Sea, along with a coast guard plane and nearby vessels with firefighting capability.",
      "The Royal National Lifeboat Institution said \"there were reports that a number of people had abandoned the vessels following a collision and there were fires on both ships.\" It said three lifeboats were working on search and rescue at the scene alongside the coast guard.",
      "Video footage aired by BBC News and apparently filmed from a nearby vessel showed thick black smoke pouring from both ships.",
      "Greenpeace said it was \"extremely concerned\" about the collision, which took place in a busy fishing ground and close to major seabird colonies.",
      "\"As more information emerges about what the ships were carrying, we are extremely concerned about the multiple toxic hazards these chemicals could pose to marine life,\" said Paul Johnston, a senior scientist at the Greenpeace Research Laboratories at Exeter University.",
      "Scientists said the environmental impact might be less severe than with a spill of heavier crude oil.",
      "\"Whilst the images look worrying, from the perspective of the impact to the aquatic environment it's less of a concern than if this had been crude oil because most of the jet fuel will evaporate very quickly,\" said Mark Hartl of the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Biotechnology at Scotland's Heriot-Watt University.",
      "Mark Sephton, professor of organic geochemistry at Imperial College London, said jet fuel disintegrates more quickly than crude oil, and warmer temperatures also speed biodegradation.",

      "Doctors said Monday Pope Francis is no longer in imminent danger of death as a result of pneumonia that has kept him hospitalized for nearly a month, but have decided to keep him hospitalized for several more days to receive treatment.",
      "In a late update, the doctors said the 88-year-old pope remains stable and has consolidated improvements in recent days, as determined by blood tests and positive responses to drug treatments.",
      "The\u00a0Vatican said the doctors had lifted their previous \"guarded\" prognosis, meaning they determined he was no longer in imminent danger as a result of the original respiratory infection he arrived with on Feb. 14. But their caution remained.",
      "\"However, in view of the complexity of the clinical picture and the important infectious picture presented on admission, it will be necessary to continue medical drug therapy in a hospital setting for additional days,\" according to the Vatican statement.",
      "In a sign of his improved health, Francis followed the Vatican's weeklong spiritual retreat via videoconference on Monday in both the morning and afternoon sessions.",
      "As he did on Sunday, Francis participated in the retreat remotely from the Rome hospital where he is being treated. He could see and hear the Rev. Roberto Pasolini, preacher of the papal household, but the priests, bishops and cardinals gathered for the retreat in the Vatican auditorium could not see or hear him.",
      "Pasolini is delivering a series of meditations this week on \"The hope of eternal life,\" a theme that was chosen well before\u00a0Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 with a complex lung infection.",
      "The retreat, an annual gathering that kicks off the\u00a0Catholic Church's solemn Lenten season\u00a0leading to Easter, continues through the week. The Vatican has said Francis would participate \"in spiritual communion\" with the rest of the hierarchy, from afar.",
      "Francis also resumed his physical and respiratory therapy at the Gemelli hospital, and rested and prayed in between. Francis has been using a nasal tube for supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night, therapy that he was continuing Monday.",
      "The 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, had what was just a bad case of bronchitis when he was hospitalized last month. The infection progressed into a\u00a0complex respiratory tract infection\u00a0and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future.",
      "Francis was still keeping his eye on things. The Vatican said he had been informed about the floods in his native Argentina and expressed his closeness to the affected population. In addition, a Vatican cardinal close to Francis spoke out Monday to refute some negative media reports that have circulated in his absence.",
      "The Vatican development office released a letter written by Cardinal Michael Czerny to one of Francis' close friends, the Argentine social justice activist Juan Grabois. Grabois had travelled to Rome to pray for Francis at Gemelli hospital, and some Italian media reported last month that he had tried to forcibly get into Francis' 10th floor hospital suite, a claim he denied.",
      "In the March 6 letter, Czerny told Grabois that Francis \"knew of your presence in Rome and your daily vigils of prayer and spiritual solidarity at Gemelli Polyclinic and I'm sure this gave him a true comfort and support.\"",
      "\"Additionally, I know that you join me in strongly repudiating the unfounded versions that have circulated in some media about alleged inappropriate behavior in the hospital,\" Czerny wrote.",
      "The Vatican is always abuzz with rumor but has gone into overdrive with speculation about Francis' health and talk of conclaves, even though Francis is very much alive and in charge. The fact that Czerny felt it necessary to defend one of Francis' friends suggested that the rumor and maneuvering in Francis' absence had crossed a line.",
      "On Thursday, the Vatican will mark the 12th anniversary of Francis' election, the first with the pope out of sight but still in charge. Francis was elected the 266th pope,\u00a0the first Jesuit pope\u00a0and first from Latin America on March 13, 2013, following the resignation of\u00a0Pope Benedict XVI.",

      "In a Friday post on his own Truth social platform, Mr. Trump once again offered \"safe refuge\" to Afrikaner farmers who feel unsafe in South Africa. That came after, on Feb. 7, Mr. Trump signed an executive order accusing the South African government of adopting racist laws that discriminate against Afrikaners, an ethnic group made up primarily of the descendants of Dutch settlers who started arriving in the country hundreds of years ago and now amount to about 13% of the population.",
      "He specifically called out a law that was passed to allow the government expropriation of some privately owned land without compensation.",
      "South Africa's government hit back at the time, saying the law pertained to unused land or land that was not serving the public interest. Mr. Trump ordered Secretary of State Marco Rubio to prioritize the resettlement program in the U.S. for Afrikaners who feel they have been the victims of racial discrimination. He also cut off all aid and assistance to South Africa for as long as the land expropriation law remains on the books.",
      "What do Afrikaner farmers actually want?",
      "Talk shows and editorials in South Africa buzzed with talk of Mr. Trump's executive order, and the possibility of even more U.S. sanctions. Many South Africans who've called into such shows have voiced confusion, as it seems there's little interest in an offer of asylum in the U.S. \u2014 even among the leaders of the Afrikaans groups who have appealed to Mr. Trump for help.",
      "\"I think we the Afrikaners have been treated as a scapegoat and punching bag in this country for three decades, with political leaders chanting on stage at political rallies 'kill the boer,' so we are very grateful for someone like President Trump to acknowledge the 144 race laws in South Africa,\" Ernest Roets, former head of policy at the Afrikaans organization Solidarity Movement, told CBS News.",
      "He added, however, that he and many other Afrikaner leaders do not want to leave the country, and do not necessarily support the blanket sanctions being imposed by the Trump administration. He said there should be targeted sanctions against \"specific leaders\" who act against the South Africa's constitution \"by discriminating against the Afrikaner with racist laws.\"",
      "South Africa's News24 reported over the weekend that members of the Solidarity group had travelled to the U.S. over the past two weeks and met with Michael Needham, a chief adviser to Rubio, as well as senior advisers to both President Trump and Vice President JD Vance and members of the U.S. Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "Flip Buys, who chairs the Solidarity Movement and who was among those to visit Washington, told News 24 that the possibility of targeted U.S. sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, which would require a determination of serious human rights violations, was discussed at the meetings.",
      "It's expected that a small number of farmers would take Mr. Trump up on his offer, but most say that while their rights and safety need to be protected, they want to stay on the land their families have farmed for, in many cases, generations.",
      "South Africa rejects Elon Musk's complaint over Starlink",
      "Mr. Trump's close adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa and still holds dual nationality, took to his X platform Friday and criticized the government in Pretoria, claiming his Starlink satellite network was \"not allowed to operate in South Africa, because I'm not black.\"",
      "South Africa's Electronic Communications Act, which, since 2005 has regulated broadcasting and telecommunications in the post-Apartheid country, requires that at least 30% of a company must be owned by previously disadvantaged groups as part of the criteria to gain a communications license. News24 reports that, as of Friday, Starlink had not applied for a license to operate in the country.",
      "Clayson Monyela, the head of public diplomacy for the South African government's Department of International Relations and Cooperation, replied to Musk on X, saying: \"Sir that's NOT true, and you know it! It's got nothing to do with skin color.\"",
      "\"Starlink is welcome to operate in South Africa,\" Monyela said, \"provided there's compliance with local laws.\"",
      "Some South African government officials have told CBS News they expect they could be targeted with specific U.S. sanctions.",
      "There is also some concern that Mr. Trump will scrap the Africa Growth Opportunity Act, a trade agreement between the U.S. and 32 African countries that took effect in 2000.",
      "Multiple officials said there are already plans to draft a replacement trade and energy pact, with the hope that the White House can be convinced to consider a new deal.",

    "story": [
      "China's retaliatory tariffs went into effect Monday, spelling trouble for American farmers by making U.S.-grown crops more expensive for their top purchaser.",
      "Beijing imposed the levies in response to President Trump's extra 10% blanket tariff on Chinese goods. Under China's retaliatory action, U.S. farmers now face levies of 15% on chicken, wheat and corn, and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.",
      "China is the largest market for such products, and if prices of foreign-grown goods rise in China, locals will turn to less expensive alternatives either from China or other countries. American farmers that deal in chicken and more will likely lose market share as a result.",
      "\"If prices go up, folks won't eat imported stuff,\" a fruit seller, surnamed Shi, told Agence France-Presse. \"There will be more domestic goods sold, and I think this is something folks can accept.\"",
      "Shi told the agency that if U.S. produce prices rise, he might seek out replacement fruit and vegetables from Thailand and Malaysia.",
      "Goods that shipped before Monday and arrive in China before April 12 will not be subject to the new tariffs.",
      "\"A web of uncertainty\"",
      "Virginia-based farmer John Boyd Jr., president of the National Black Farmers Association, told CBS MoneyWatch that Mr. Trump's trade conflict with China hits farmers like himself hard.",
      "For one, Mr. Trump's earlier flip-flopping on his tariff policy vis-a-vis Mexico and Canada \"has cast a web of uncertainty around agriculture,\" Boyd told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You are really shaking at the root of all the major commodities that we produce in the U.S., because we are a market-driven industry.\"",
      "Farmers are bearing the brunt of the effects of a trade war with key U.S. trade partners, Boyd added. \"The president is using American farmers to bargain with, but at the end of the day, we are the ones that are hurting.\"",
      "Nick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, told CBS MoneyWatch that the industry had anticipated that Mr. Trump would impose levies on key U.S. trade partners, but that there wasn't a whole lot the farmers he represents could do to prepare.",
      "\"Of course, agriculture products are subject to the retaliatory tariffs, and farmers tend to be the ones that get it first and hardest in a trade war; we take the brunt of this and get a black eye or busted nose,\" Levendofsky told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He explained that farmers across the U.S. are grappling with high input costs, including the price of seeds, fertilizer, chemicals, fuel and equipment costs needed to run their farms. Meanwhile, commodity prices are low.",
      "\"This trade war and these tariffs adds to that very stressful time and does not help the farm economy. When farmers aren't making money, they are not spending money and that directly ripples across the rural economy,\" he said.",

      "Ontario, Canada's most populous province, is adding a 25% surcharge to all electricity exports sent to the U.S. as part of retaliation against the Trump administration's tariffs on Canadian products.",
      "The 25% surcharge will be effective as of March 10, and will affect consumers and businesses in Michigan, Minnesota and New York, the province said in a Monday statement. The new fee will add as much as $400,000 Canadian dollars ($277,000) in daily costs for 1.5 million U.S. homes and businesses, it added.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford estimated it will add about CA$100, or $69 a month, to the bills of each American affected.",
      "On March 8, Ford told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe that President Trump's tariff plan was creating \"mass chaos,\" and added that a trade war between the U.S. and Canada was \"unacceptable.\" During the interview, he also said that while he has a great relationship with the governments of Michigan, Minnesota and New York, he planned to impose a 25% surcharge on energy products starting March 10 unless the trade dispute came to an end.",
      "\"President Trump's tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They're making life more expensive for American families and businesses,\" Premier Doug Ford said in Monday's statement. \"Until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario won't back down. We'll stand strong, use every tool in our toolkit and do whatever it takes to protect Ontario.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico went into effect last week, although on Thursday he said he would delay the levies by one month, until April 2. On Monday, Ford said Ontario's electricity surcharge would remain in place despite the one-month reprieve from Trump, noting a one-month pause means nothing but more uncertainty.",
      "On March 8, Ford told CBS News that Mr. Trump has declared \"an economic war on his closest friends.\"",
      "Ford's office said the new market rules require any generator selling electricity to the U.S. to add a 25% surcharge. Ontario's government expects it to generate revenue of CA$300,000 ($208,000) to CA$400,000 ($277,000) per day, \"which will be used to support Ontario workers, families and businesses.\"",
      "The new surcharge is in addition to Canada's initial CA$30 billion's ($21 billion's) worth of retaliatory tariffs have been applied on items like American orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, appliances, footwear, cosmetics, motorcycles and certain pulp and paper products.",

    "summary": "Australian police say a wave of seemingly antisemitic attacks and threats was really a \"fabricated terrorist plot, essentially a criminal con job.\"",
    "story": [
      "An explosives-filled trailer that Australian politicians earlier described as an antisemitic terrorism plot and a foiled mass casualty event was staged by criminals in a complicated hoax and was never meant to be detonated, police said Monday.",
      "Law enforcement agencies investigating January's discovery of the trailer on the outskirts of Sydney divulged in a news conference that its placement was concocted by criminals who meant to derive personal gain from tipping off authorities to its presence \u2014 a bizarre twist in a saga that followed a monthslong wave of antisemitic crimes in Australia.",
      "The cluster of attacks targeting places where Jewish people live, work and study, including a firebombing of a synagogue and a daycare center and several instances of antisemitic vandalism, were committed by \"a very small group, and potentially one individual behind all those matters,\" Deputy Police Commissioner for the state of New South Wales David Hudson told reporters on Monday.",
      "Authorities in January made the unusual claim that none of the 12 they had then arrested in relation to the spate of crimes in Australia's largest cities Sydney and Melbourne was driven by antisemitic ideology and were instead criminals for hire. Hudson said 14 more arrested Monday were not motivated by hate either.",
      "But he added he has no doubt that antisemitism in Australia \u2014 which has dominated news media and the political sphere following the recent spate of crimes \u2014 has experienced \"an escalation over the past 18 months\" since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "Preliminary data released by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry just a few months after that attack showed a total of 662 antisemitic incidents across Australia were reported during October and November 2023.",
      "\"By comparison, there were 495 anti-Jewish incidents reported in Australia for the entire 12 months to 30 September 2023,\" the council said at the time.",
      "In response to the rise in such incidents, Australia enacted new laws in January 2024 explicitly banning the performance of the Nazi salute in public and the display or sale of Nazi hate symbols such as the swastika. The new laws also made the act of glorifying or praising acts of terrorism a criminal offense.",
      "\"Essentially a criminal con job\"",
      "But a number of incidents now appear to have been part of the elaborate criminal hoax, and not, in fact, rooted in antisemitism.",
      "The revelation \u2014 leaked to the public before law enforcement planned to announce it \u2014 that a trailer was found in January outside Sydney, packed with explosives used in the mining industry and containing a list of purported Jewish targets, prompted state and national leaders to say it represented an escalation in potential extremist violence.",
      "But investigators said Monday that they \"almost immediately\" believed the trailer's appearance was \"part of a fabricated terrorist plot, essentially a criminal con job,\" but kept their suspicions a secret, according to Australian federal police deputy commissioner Krissy Barrett.",
      "The trailer was easily found and the explosives were visibly displayed. \"Also, there was no detonator,\" Barrett said, adding that it was \"never going to cause a mass casualty event.\"",
      "Instead, those who staged the caravan planned to then inform the authorities of an impending attack against Jewish Australians, said Barrett. Why investigators believed they had done so was not simple.",
      "The motivation, overseas interests, and a culprit still at large",
      "Barrett and Hudson, speaking on behalf of a joint law enforcement effort assembled to arrest the perpetrators of antisemitic crimes, said they believed those who faked the trailer plot meant to attract attention from authorities, divert police resources, create fear and leverage the situation for personal gain. That might have included attempts to use information about an attack to bargain with police for lesser sentences in other criminal proceedings.",
      "\"We believe the person pulling the strings wanted changes to their criminal status but maintained a distance from their scheme and hired alleged local criminals,\" Barrett said. That person remains at large, she added.",
      "Authorities have said since January that they believe overseas interests are orchestrating the crimes, although they haven't been more specific. They also haven't divulged which local criminal groups might have been hired to undertake the attacks, which have included hateful graffiti.",
      "It wasn't the only time this has happened, Barrett added. \"Too many offenders working in a criminal gig economy are accepting these tasks for money,\" she said.",
      "The 14 people arrested Monday face charges in relation to the more than a dozen attacks investigators believe were orchestrated.",
      "The strange twist caps a summer where antisemitic crimes roiled Sydney and Melbourne, home to 85% of Australia's Jewish population. One person has been physically hurt \u2014 a worshipper who suffered burns in the fire that was set at a Melbourne synagogue in December.",
      "There was \"some comfort to be taken by the Jewish community,\" in the fact that the worst episodes were not ideological acts of hated, Hudson said. But the crimes have had \"a chilling effect on the Jewish community\" and provoked unwarranted suspicion of other groups, Barrett added.",
      "The high-profile attacks are not the only ones police are investigating. Nearly 200 more people have been charged since October 2023 in the state of New South Wales, where Sydney is located, with crimes linked to antisemitism, police told The Associated Press in February.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 20:26:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As Trump's trade war looms over Canada, the ruling Liberal Party has chosen veteran economist Mark Carney to replace Justin Trudeau.",
    "story": [
      "Toronto\u00a0\u2014 Canada's Liberal Party has chosen veteran central bank leader Mark Carney as its new leader, meaning he will quickly replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the country's top office. The transition, and Trudeau's political downfall, comes amid the chaotic trade war with Canada's closest ally launched by President Trump.",
      "The exact date that Carney will take office as Canada's prime minister remains uncertain. The timing of the transition will be determined by Carney in conjunction with Trudeau.",
      "Carney won nearly 86% of the more than 151,000 votes cast. The next closest candidate received 11,144 votes.",
      "The new leader will inherit a government led by a party which has seen its support among the Canadian electorate wane significantly over the past few years. With opposition parties eager to trigger an election, the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. Carney's government could be toppled by Parliament to call for a new national election, which can be called any time between the Parliament going back into session on March 24 and October 20, by which time a vote must be held.",
      "Trudeau announced in January that he would step down as party leader and, with the move, from his role as the prime minister, due to increasing pressure from within the Liberal Party as polls showed its support among voters tanking.",
      "Trudeau's resignation announcement paved the way for the Liberal Party to chose a new leader, and Carney won that internal party election on Sunday \u2014  and many Canadians will hope to see him quickly form a new cabinet and then put his decades of financial experience to work as the country confronts Mr. Trump's trade war.",
      "Who is Mark Carney?",
      "Born in Fort Smith, in Canada's Northwest Territories, Carney grew up in Edmonton before heading to the U.S. to pursue a degree in economics at Harvard University. He later moved to the U.K. and earned a master's degree and then, in 1995, a doctorate in economics from the prestigious University of Oxford.",
      "He was appointed as the Governor of the Bank of Canada \u2014   akin to the Federal Reserve in the U.S. \u2014 in 2008, amid the global financial crisis, which he helped to steer Canada through.",
      "Carney's influence has extended well beyond Canada, however, and not only because he led one of its most important central government institutions. In 2010, Time Magazine named him among the world's 25 most influential leaders. In 2011, Reader's Digest Canada named him the \"Most Trusted Canadian,\" and the editors of Euromoney magazine named him Central Bank Governor of the Year in 2012.",
      "During his tenure as Canada's central banker, he also held several high-profile international positions, including as chair of the Committee on the Global Financial System and head of the Financial Stability Board for the G20 group of the world's biggest economies.",
      "Between 2013 and 2020, Carney moved back to Britain after being tapped as the Governor of the Bank of England, heading up the U.K.'s central bank and helping to guide the country through the economic convulsions brought on by its \"Brexit\" from the European Union. He was the first non-U.K. citizen to govern the institution in its 300-year history.",
      "More recently, Carney served as the United Nations' special envoy on climate action and finance and as head of transition investing at the Brookfield Asset Management firm. He stepped down from both of those positions to pursue his Liberal Party leadership bid.",
      "Carney's reaction to Trump",
      "Mr. Trump's trade war and his frequent threats to make Canada a U.S. \"51st state\" were hot topics during the Liberal Party leadership campaign. Carney, along with the other candidates, emphasized the importance of a strong domestic economy in the face of those threats.",
      "Carney said Canada had allowed its economy to become \"weak,\" leaving it susceptible to Mr. Trump's tariff-based pressure tactics. He said Canada was experiencing one of the worst economic crises in its history, and that overcoming it would require major reforms to ensure long-term strength and stability.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a debate for his party's leadership. \"I know how to build strong economies.\"",
      "Carney on Sunday said the retaliatory tariffs Canada has placed on the U.S., which he said will have \"maximum impact in the United States and minimum impact here in Canada,\" would remain \"until the Americans show us respect.\"",
      "Carney said Mr. Trump was \"attacking Canadian families, workers and businesses, and we cannot let him succeed. And we won't. We won't. I am proud. I am proud of the response of Canadians who are making their voices heard and their wallets felt.\"",
      "Earlier in the campaign, he said that as prime minister, he would impose dollar-to-dollar reciprocal tariffs on U.S. imports in a trade war and leverage Canada's role as a vital supplier of energy and uranium to its southern neighbor.",
      "\"It's important to distinguish what you can't control, what we can control. We can't change Donald Trump, but we can control our economic destiny,\" he said during a debate.",
      "Carney on Sunday also addressed Mr. Trump's threats to annex Canada, saying, \"America is not Canada, and Canada never, ever will be part of America in any way.\"",
      "\"We didn't ask for this fight... So the Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade, as in hockey, Canada will win,\" he added.",

      "Prince Robert; his wife, Princess Julie of Nassau; and Prince Frederik's siblings, Alexander and Charlotte, were all able to say goodbye to him on his last day, the patriarch said. One of the last things Frederik asked him was, \"Papa, are you proud of me?\" according to Prince Robert.",
      "\"He had barely been able to speak for several days, so the clarity of these words was as surprising as the weight of the moment was profound,\" Prince Robert wrote. \"The answer was very easy, and he had heard it oh so many times\u2026. but at this time, he needed reassurance that he had contributed all that he possibly could in his short and beautiful existence and that he could now finally move on.\"",
      "The young prince was remembered as a joyful person with \"indomitable lust for life.\" He was learning Italian and was a big fan of the U.S. adaptation of \"The Office,\" which he has seen over 10 times in its entirety, Prince Robert said.",

      "According to the POLG Foundation, the mitochondrial disorder Frederik had \"robs the body's cells of energy,\" and can cause a variety of symptoms, including progressive dysfunction and failure of multiple organs.",
      "\"One might compare it to having a faulty battery that never fully recharges, is in a constant state of depletion and eventually loses power,\" the PoLG Foundation said on its website.",
      "Experts estimate that about 2% of the population carry POLG mutations. However, the total number of people with POLG-related diseases is unclear. One study of adults in Australia with POLG mutations found that 10% of them had POLG-related diseases."

      "She wrote about the complicity of the French and other European governments in keeping what the Nazis stole in her book,\u00a0\"Museum Worthy: Nazi Art Plunder in Postwar Western Europe.\"\u00a0Campbell says there could be even more change with new guidelines agreed to by France and other countries, including the United States. \"These new guidelines say that any persecuted person who sold a work of art during the Nazi era should be assumed to have done so under duress,\" she said. \"So, it's now giving a blanket acknowledgement of coercion in any sale. It's really a dramatic change.\"",
      "When the Germans retreated, allied art experts found stacks of stolen paintings everywhere, from caves to castles. More than 60,000 pieces of art were returned to France. But some 2,000 pieces ended up in limbo, held by the French government with no clear rightful owner.",
      "Ines Rotermund-Reynard is the newly-hired provenance researcher at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. Her job is to find the truth about a piece of art's Nazi-era past. \"There's really a huge wish now by the French to clarify the situation,\" she said. \"It's somehow as if you take a detective and you say, 'Look at all the cold cases which happened 80 years ago and solve it.' Each story is important. And it is worth, for each family, to do this effort.\"",
      "But the case of Armand Dorville has pitted the French government against his heirs, among them Francine Kahn, who said, \"Discovering those pictures is a way to know him.\"",
      "Another heir, Rapha\u00ebl Falk, said, \"I feel anger when we have so much difficulties to retrieve them.\"",
      "When Dorville died of natural causes in 1941, his art collection was sold at auction. But due to anti-semitic laws, the French authorities confiscated the proceeds, and family members \u2013 without money to escape \u2013 were later murdered at Auschwitz.",
      "Eighty years later, a North Carolina museum returned one of Dorville's paintings to the family, and a German museum returned one by impressionist Camille Pissarro. But the French government is refusing to give back more than half a dozen paintings held in public museums, saying the auction was not done under duress.",
      "Falk said, \"It must be hard for them to give them back. So, I can understand that. But [to give them back], it's just right, you know? It's just right.\"",
      "The family hired Paris lawyer Corinne Herschkovitch, who has spent 30 years recovering art for Jewish families. \"All these people in charge of the cultural heritage, they were more concerned by keeping alive or preserve all these paintings and works of art than to preserve the Jews,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think some of these museum directors are still ashamed of how they got these paintings?\"",
      "\"I think so, I think so. They are embarrassed, that's for sure,\" said Herschkovitch.",
      "The Dorville heirs believe they are fighting for their history.",
      "I asked, \"When you get them back into the family, do you feel somehow that bad history has been corrected? Erased?\"",
      "\"Not erased, never erased,\" Falk replied. \"Members of our family died because of it. In my mind, it's a way to repair the damage that was done.\"",
      "Kahn said, \"It is the memory of the family. Because it was totally forgotten. And it is on our shoulders to awake this story ... to tell the story.\"",

      "After more than three weeks in the hospital recovering from double pneumonia, the 88-year-old pope's doctors reported positive news about his health over the weekend, saying Francis was responding well to treatment and has shown a \"gradual, slight improvement\" in recent days.",
      "For the fourth Sunday in a row, the 88-year-old Francis didn't appear for his weekly noon blessing, but he met with his top deputies and the Holy See distributed the text he would have delivered if he were well enough. In it, the Argentine pope thanked all those who were caring for him and others who are sick and experiencing a \"night of pain.\"",
      "\"Brothers and sisters, during my prolonged hospitalization here, I too experience the thoughtfulness of service and the tenderness of care, in particular from the doctors and health care workers, whom I thank from the bottom of my heart,\" read the message from Gemelli hospital.",
      "\"And while I am here, I think of the many people who in various ways are close to the sick, and who are for them a sign of the Lord's presence. We need this, the 'miracle of tenderness' which accompanies those who are in adversity, bringing a little light into the night of pain,\" he wrote.",
      "Francis, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, has remained in stable condition at Gemelli, with no fever and good oxygen levels in his blood for several days, doctors reported in a Vatican statement Saturday.",
      "The doctors said that such stability \"as a consequence testifies to a good response to therapy.\" It was the first time the doctors had reported that Francis was responding positively to the treatment for the complex lung infection that was diagnosed after he was hospitalized on Feb. 14. The positive update for Francis followed a few bouts of respiratory crises last week.",
      "Doctors characterized the pope's prognosis as \"guarded,\" meaning he's not out of danger.",
      "\"In order to record these initial improvements in the coming days as well, his doctors have prudently maintained the prognosis as guarded,\" the Vatican said in a statement.",
      "On Sunday morning, the Vatican reported Francis was resting after a quiet night.",
      "In his absence, the Vatican's day-to-day operations continued alongside celebrations of its Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century Jubilee that brings millions of pilgrims to Rome. On Sunday, Canadian Cardinal Michael Czerny, who is close to Francis, celebrated the Holy Year Mass for volunteers that Francis was supposed to have celebrated.",
      "During the Mass in St. Peter's Square, the giant banner bearing Francis' papal coat of arms fluttered from the loggia of the basilica above. Even while in the hospital, Francis is very much still the pope and in charge of the Catholic Church.",
      "That was evident too by the fact that the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, visited the pope on Sunday, for the third time since he has been in the hospital. The Vatican has noted that such meetings are the routine way the pope governs while at the Vatican, making clear that he was getting essential work done from Gemelli.",
      "Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night.",
      "Francis was hospitalized Feb. 14 for what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future.",

      "One patient\u2019s story",
      "One of\u00a0Scheinin\u2019s\u00a0patients was a pastor in his mid-50s who was infected with COVID-19 in March 2020.",
      "Pastor\u00a0Benjamin Thomas of East Meadow, Long Island, spent nearly 100 days in the hospital \u2014 54 of which were on a ventilator \u2014 and six weeks in a medically induced coma.",
      "5 YEARS AFTER COVID, AMERICANS ARE SPLIT ON WHETHER IT'S STILL A THREAT",
      "He was discharged in July 2020 with an oxygen tank. Despite overcoming the initial infection, Thomas\u2019 condition deteriorated.",
      "In 2022, the pastor noticed that his daily activity tolerance diminished dramatically and he required more oxygen for simple tasks.",
      "The inflammatory response sparked by early mutations of the novel coronavirus led to scarring of lungs in many individuals.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"I couldn't take a shower for more than 30 seconds without being on oxygen,\" he told Fox News Digital in an interview.",
      "Scheinin said the pastor had no underlying conditions before contracting COVID. A lung biopsy showed that Thomas\u2019 symptoms were consistent with post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis due to the COVID-19 infection.",
      "BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WITH THESE 8 SIMPLE STEPS \u2014 SOME MAY SURPRISE YOU",
      "Thomas\u2019 story was remarkable in that he survived the first bout with COVID, but two years later, his lungs had deteriorated so badly from the scarring that he needed a double lung transplant, Scheinin shared.",
      "After spending seven months on the wait list, Thomas opted to settle for one lung since that would be faster than waiting for two. His surgery was performed on Feb. 28, 2023.",
      "\"The flu and any other illness would be exacerbated because of the underlying scarring of the lung.\"",
      "Now, two years after his lung transplant, Thomas says he no longer needs oxygen supplementation and is back to performing his daily pastoral activities at his church in Queens Village, New York, albeit at a slower pace than before.",

      "What is post-COVID fibrosis?",
      "A healthy lung allows for the normal exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, when one breathes air,\u00a0Scheinin told Fox News Digital.",
      "The inflammatory response sparked by early mutations of the novel coronavirus led to scarring of lungs in many individuals.",
      "Testing for this condition is relatively non-invasive, typically including a cat scan or X-ray to check for structural lung damage, as well as blood tests and a pulmonary function test. (iStock)",
      "In certain cases, the doctor said, the lungs no longer function as well as they did before the infection.",
      "\"The normal gas exchange is impeded because now you have areas of the lung tissue that are scarred, and therefore they're not functioning normally,\" he said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"If it's a small area, it may be insignificant and unnoticeable, but as more of the lung tissue becomes scarred, more of the normal lung function is destroyed, [and] the patient becomes short of breath.\"",
      "This could lead to future issues, especially if the patient is exposed to other respiratory ailments.",
      "\"The flu and any other illness would be exacerbated because of the underlying scarring of the lung,\" Scheinin said. \"I think it just makes the lungs more susceptible to injury.\"",
      "Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment",
      "Symptoms of post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis can mimic other types of interstitial lung diseases, which are disorders that\u00a0cause progressive scarring and inflammation of lung tissue.",
      "If a person who previously had a COVID infection continues to experience shortness of breath, chronic cough and change in their exercise tolerance \u2014 or if they smoke or have an underlying condition such as emphysema \u2014 they should see their physician or a pulmonologist, according to Scheinin.",

      "Well, you have a good memory. But you don\u2019t have to have a long one. The reason is that a government funding drama played out in Washington just before last Christmas. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., thought he had forged an agreement which could pass the House with a coalition of Democrats and Republicans. It would also get through the Senate with Democrats lugging some of the freight to overcome a filibuster.",

In fact, many House Republicans complained that lawmakers failed to advance the 12 individual spending bills by the book. The House has completed a few. The Senate? None. That was under the stewardship of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., when Democrats ran the show last year. Zero bills under new Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., this year.",

      "This is why government funding crises ricochet around constantly.",
      "House Republicans published the text of an interim spending bill over the weekend. It renews the Biden-level funding numbers \u2013 but also makes some cuts to social spending programs and the budget for the city of Washington. However, there are small increases in funding for the Pentagon. There are few Democratic priorities reflected in the bill. Yet House Republicans \u2013 who control the House \u2013 are demanding Democrats join them to help pass the bill. Democratic votes may be necessary when Republicans have a slim majority. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., already said he was a no unless he were to receive \"a lobotomy.\"",

      "Ellzey noted that if all Senate Republicans supported the package, it would be incumbent on at least seven Senate Democrats to help break a filibuster to advance the plan. Republicans hold 53 Senate seats. But 60 yeas are necessary to overcome a filibuster.",

      "\"It's disingenuous for them to expect Democratic votes without making compromise,\" said Khanna. \"You can't say \u2018Vote for it on my terms.\u2019\"",
      "This may be a bumpy week. The House plans to pass the bill and skip town, leaving the Senate holding the bag. Democrats are debating whether it\u2019s better to keep the government operating \u2013 since they support federal workers. They simultaneously fear a government shutdown could invite more cuts by DOGE.",
      "But even though this seems like other government shutdown battles, this one is slightly different. One can never expect things to go by the script when President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are involved. Some argue that their interference with the December bill was just an appetizer. We\u2019ll know by Friday night if this government shutdown threat is like all the others \u2013 or not.",

      "In their book, \"Fool's Gold: The Radicals, Con Artists, and Traitors Who Killed the California Dream and Now Threaten Us All,\" authors Jedd McFatter and Susan Crabtree write extensively about Newsom\u2019s relationship with the Chinese community in the Bay Area and his ties to CCP businesses.",
      "The book explains that Newsom came into office as San Francisco\u2019s mayor in 2004 after receiving strong support from Chinese voters, enough so that he celebrated his victory in Chinatown and the authors write that from an early point in his tenure he was ready to \"go full steam ahead with Chinatown\u2019s interests.\"",
      "One of those interests, according to Chapter 3 of the book, was a nonprofit organization initiative started by Newsom called ChinaSF that the book argues served as a gateway for CCP officials and Chinese criminals to exploit California.",

      "The book describes a Newsom trip to China, where he was hosted in a Shanghai \"clubhouse\" by Vincent Lo,\u00a0a Chinese businessman with deep ties to the CCP.",
      "\"It was during this meeting that Newsom and Lo hatched a long-\u200bterm plan to turn San Francisco into the premiere gateway through which Chinese companies could invest and expand their businesses in the United States,\" the book says. \"Upon his return from China, starry-\u200beyed Gavin told his staff that he was going to set aside a couple of million dollars to set up a public-\u200bprivate partnership called ChinaSF that would open the floodgates to Chinese money and business like never before. It turns out the young mayor wasn\u2019t just blowing smoke: three years later, Newsom and Lo joined forces in Shanghai to co\u2011launch ChinaSF.\"",
      "The book says that ChinaSF impacted the Bay Area arguably \"more than any other\" program that Newsom created as mayor and that the initiative hauled in almost $5.5 billion of economic impact to San Francisco from 2008 to 2018 while recruiting 108 Chinese companies into the city.",
      "The book alleges that during this time period, ChinaSF \"helped several corrupt Chinese corporations come to America.\"",
      "One of the several companies discussed in the book was Suntech,\u00a0a Chinese solar company developed by the CCP that was personally recruited by Newsom into the United States, and he publicly praised the company\u2019s CEO, Dr. Zhengrong Shi, multiple times, and made him an advisory board member for ChinaSF.",
      "In addition to green energy companies who streamed through ChinaSF, real estate companies were also involved, and the book alleges that Newsom received over $23,000 in anonymous contributions from Chinese real estate company Z&L,\u00a0whose billionaire owner was\u00a0criminally sentenced for bribing a San Francisco government official.",
      "Chapter 3, titled \"Feeding the Dragon,\" goes into detail about a variety of potential red flags on Newsom\u2019s ties with China, including ChinaSF being used as a \"tool to build San Francisco into a global hub for biotechnology and pharmaceutical science.\"",
      "\"Dozens of Chinese biotech companies were drawn to the Bay Area with huge tax breaks and other incentives, but it appears that there was very little vetting,\" the book states. \"One of ChinaSF\u2019s most concerning recruits is the biotech company JOINN Laboratories, which has close ties to China\u2019s military.\"",

      "Fox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office for comment and received a response pointing to an article about conspiracy theories with the headline, \"Conspiracy theorists really do see the world differently, new study shows.\"",
      "The book goes on to discuss ChinaSF\u2019s involvement with biotechnology and pharmaceutical science companies that were \"drawn to the Bay Area\" with tax breaks and \"little vetting\" along with a liquor company called Kweichow Moutai, which has a history of \"several major corruption scandals involving bribery by CCP officials.\"",
      "The book also alleges that as California\u2019s lieutenant governor, Newsom trademarked wines he owns in China and poured them for CCP elites at a lavish Shanghai tasting.",
      "The authors also drew attention to the controversial connection between ChinaSF and Huawei, a company that has been involved in a myriad of questionable practices that have drawn scrutiny from U.S. presidential administrations,\u00a0resulting in restrictions.",
      "\"However, no one seemed to notice when an infamous Chinese company became their top financial sponsor in 2016,\" the book says. \"This might be because the U.S. government has long identified that company, Huawei Technologies, as one of China\u2019s most dangerous tech companies. According to an internal report, ChinaSF hosted two events in 2016, headlined by Huawei, which led to Huawei establishing a new research and development office in San Francisco. The amount of money Huawei funneled to ChinaSF is unknown, but it\u2019s worth noting that in 2016, Huawei generated more than $75 billion in revenue, so they had plenty of cash to flash around.\"",
      "ChinaSF once described itself as a nonprofit, including on its now defunct website, the book explains, but between 2009 and 2014 it was a limited liability corporation whose only member was the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce.",
      "\"In other words, for a period of time, ChinaSF was a private entity embedded in a local chamber of commerce,\" the book says.",

      "\"Close analysis of available data reveals that most descriptions of ChinaSF by government and media have been vacuous and misleading,\": the book says. \"Essentially, ChinaSF is the branded name of a complex bureaucratic mirage used as cover to legitimize the massive transfer of Bay Area technology, property, and wealth to China while streamlining the establishment of Chinese business in the United States. It\u2019s the secret elixir Newsom concocted to help transform San Francisco into the primary entry point and hub of China\u2019s BRI in the United States.\"",
      "\"On the surface, the flurry of MOUs, press conferences, ribbon cuttings, and so forth \u2013 propped up by reassuring proclamations\u00a0from chambers of commerce and government officials like Newsom \u2013 cohere into what may look like an innovative job-\u200bgenerating public-\u200bprivate partnership. But the deeper you probe into who\u2019s funding ChinaSF, who\u2019s failing to vet all the Chinese companies coming in, and who\u2019s making money off the deals \u2013 you discover there\u2019s no reasonable public accountability structure in place, not enough records for the public to review, and no clear explanations for why the San Francisco mayor\u2019s office has a right to engage in risky subnational business schemes in some cases with People\u2019s Republic of China criminals and shady Chinese firms who have exploited and damaged the US economy and fleeced American citizens with their fraudulent schemes.\"",

      "2. Have strong antivirus software: This can help detect and block malicious software that might be downloaded if Jane had clicked on the scammer's link. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

      "3. Contact your bank directly using official channels: Jane should call Kinecta's official number to verify if there's any real issue with her account, rather than responding to the text.",
      "4. Report the text to your bank and forward it to 7726 (SPAM): By reporting this text, Jane can help Kinecta and her mobile carrier protect other customers from similar scams.",
      "5. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) on your accounts: This extra layer of security could prevent scammers from accessing Jane's account even if they obtained her password.",

Invest in personal data removal services: This can help reduce the amount of personal information available online, making it harder for scammers to target Jane and you with personalized attacks in the future. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Remember, legitimate financial institutions will never pressure you to act immediately or click on links in text messages.

      "How were the extensions compromised?",
      "GitLab Security has uncovered a major security breach affecting over 3.2 million users through a network of compromised browser extensions, including some linked to GitLab. The attack stemmed from a supply chain breach, where threat actors infiltrated legitimate extensions and pushed malicious updates. These updates embedded hidden scripts that allowed unauthorized data collection, altered HTTP requests and injected ads into web pages, all without users noticing.",
      "Originally built for tasks like ad blocking, emoji input and screen recording, these extensions were repurposed through covert updates that exploited the extensive permissions users had granted, enabling real-time manipulation of web activity.",
      "Typically, malicious extensions or apps are created solely to steal data, with their advertised functionality being an afterthought or simply a way to get listed in an official store.

      "The malicious extensions bypassed Content Security Policy protections, which are designed to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, allowing attackers to modify web content without detection. They also communicated with command-and-control servers to receive further instructions, showing a high level of coordination. The attackers exploited the trust users place in the Chrome Web Store and its automatic update system. Investigations suggest this activity has been ongoing since at least July 2024.",
      "Some of the compromised extensions listed above have generic names that may resemble well-known and legitimate tools, but they are not the same. For example, \"Password Manager\" in our list refers to a malicious extension identified in the breach,\u00a0not to reputable password manager services we mention here.\u00a0Similarly, extensions named \"AdBlock Plus\" or \"VPN Extension\" in this context are not necessarily the widely trusted versions but rather imitations or malicious variants.",

Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser. Don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer is no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the incident, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Browser extensions can improve functionality but also pose significant security risks if not carefully managed.

      "Why should you store your driver's license in Apple Wallet?",
      "Storing your Apple ID in your Apple Wallet may be more secure than carrying a physical card that can be lost easily. Additionally, your digital ID doesn't contain as much visible personal information as a physical ID card. Digital IDs stored in your Apple Wallet do not display personal information other than your full name. To display things such as your address, date of birth and so on, you must sign in with Face ID or Touch ID.",
      "Information is only ever transferred from your Apple Wallet via NFC, which uses an encrypted Bluetooth data connection. This means nothing can be easily or quickly copied. Whenever you have to hand your phone over to a police officer or TSA agent, they won't see your personal information without authentication from you.",
      "Using your digital ID with Apple Wallet from your iPhone or Apple Watch works similarly to Apple Pay. You hold the device near the reader, and a screen will appear telling you exactly which information you will share. Next, you'll double-tap the side button to approve it, as if you were paying with Apple Pay.",

      "With digital IDs, only the information needed and nothing more can be transferred easily. For example, a security guard who needs to check your ID at a venue entrance would have a reader that shows your ID photo and confirms if you're over 21. They wouldn't see things like your ID number, address or actual date of birth, simplifying the process for you and the worker and preventing your personal info from being copied.",
      "At the time of publishing, police agencies do not accept digital IDs as driver's licenses, so you'll need to have your physical ID when driving. However, the TSA does accept digital IDs with digital ID readers at\u00a0several airports, and a few concert venues have begun accepting digital IDs. Additionally, apps that require an ID, such as car rental apps or alcohol delivery services, can use the info stored in your Apple Wallet to provide proof of age.",

      "Why can't I add my driver's license to my Apple Wallet?",
      "If you are unable to add your driver's license to your Apple ID, it's most likely because your state doesn't yet support the feature. If your state is on the list above, but you can't add your license, it may be because of a temporary Apple server outage.\u00a0Apple recommends that you contact the local DMV or state office that issued your card in the event that the servers are not down.",

      "Vishing, short for \"voice phishing,\" is a type of cybercrime that uses phone calls to deceive individuals into revealing personal or financial information. Unlike\u00a0traditional phishing, which relies on emails or text messages, vishing leverages the power of human voice and social engineering to manipulate victims. Scammers often impersonate legitimate organizations, such as banks, tech companies, or government agencies, to gain trust and create a sense of urgency. They may ask for passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive details, which they then use for fraudulent purposes.",

      "Scammers start by identifying potential victims through social media, public transaction records, leaked databases, and more. Once they select a target, they gather personal details (email, phone number, financial holdings) to build credibility. And you could easily be a target. That\u2019s because\u00a0data brokers \u2013 companies that buy and sell your personal information \u2013 are goldmines for scammers.

I strongly suggest you remove your personal info from people search sites online. If you give someone your email or phone number, they might be able to find your home address through a reverse search.\u00a0While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "7. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install and regularly update strong antivirus software to protect your devices from malware, viruses and other cyber threats. Antivirus software provides real-time protection, scans for malicious files and helps prevent infections by blocking access to harmful websites and downloads. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Tony's story is a chilling reminder that even the most diligent savers can fall victim to sophisticated scams. These vishing schemes, carefully orchestrated like a theatrical play, exploit our trust and leverage real security alerts to gain access to our accounts. Protecting ourselves requires constant awareness, skepticism towards unsolicited communications, and proactive measures to safeguard our personal information. While the tactics may evolve, the underlying principle remains the same: scammers rely on deception to exploit our vulnerabilities. By understanding their methods and taking preventative steps, we can make it harder for them to succeed.",

      "The key to the Touchdown's appeal lies in its transformative design.\u00a0Expandable's philosophy is to create \"a space that can turn into a trailer, instead of a trailer that can turn into a space,\" emphasizing spaciousness and a seamless connection between travel and relaxation. The Touchdown achieves this with a patented external retractable wheel system, eliminating awkward steps and providing a natural, accessible entrance.",

      "Scammers are preying on society's most vulnerable members.",
      "Companies that handle massive amounts of user data are often the least careful with it. Last year, the National Public Data breach\u00a0exposed 2.7 billion records. The company\u2019s entire business model was built around collecting data from public sources to create detailed user profiles for people in the U.S. and beyond. Now, another breach has surfaced, this time affecting DISA Global Solutions, an employee screening provider.",

      "What you need to know",
      "DISA Global Solutions, a company specializing in employee screening services, recently\u00a0disclosed a major data breach affecting over 3.3 million individuals. The Texas-based firm serves more than 55,000 businesses, including a third of Fortune 500 companies, offering background checks, drug and alcohol testing and compliance solutions.",
      "The breach began on Feb. 9, 2024, when an unauthorized party gained access to part of DISA\u2019s network. Shockingly, the intrusion went undetected for more than two months until the company discovered the \"cyber incident\" on April 22, 2024. Following the breach, DISA launched an internal investigation with help from third-party forensic experts to assess the damage.",
      "It's still unclear how the attack happened. DISA hasn\u2019t confirmed whether phishing, malware or another method was used. However, the fact that hackers had access for months without detection points to serious gaps in the company\u2019s monitoring systems. Adding to the concern, nearly a year passed before the public was notified, which raises serious questions about DISA\u2019s cybersecurity measures and response time.",

      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS",
      "What data got stolen?",
      "The hackers accessed a trove of sensitive personal information, though DISA has admitted it cannot definitively confirm the full scope of the stolen data. According to filings with the attorneys general of Maine and\u00a0Massachusetts, the compromised information included Social Security numbers, financial account details (such as credit card numbers), driver\u2019s licenses and other government-issued identification documents.",
      "Given DISA\u2019s role in employee screening, the breach likely exposed data collected from background checks and drug tests, potentially including employment histories, criminal records and even health-related information. The notification to affected individuals \u2013 more than 360,000 were Massachusetts residents and 15,198 from Maine \u2013 underscored the breadth of the incident, affecting a staggering 3,332,750 people nationwide.",

      "If you\u2019ve undergone a background check or drug test through an employer or prospective employer, your data might be among the millions exposed in this breach. Here are five practical steps to protect yourself.",
      "1) Monitor your financial accounts: Regularly check your bank statements, credit card transactions and credit reports for suspicious activity. The breach exposed financial details, making unauthorized transactions a real risk. Consider setting up alerts for any unusual activity.",
      "2) Enroll in credit monitoring: DISA is offering affected individuals 12 months of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian. Take advantage of this by enrolling before the June 30 deadline to keep tabs on your credit and detect potential misuse early.",
      "3) Place a fraud alert or credit freeze: Contact one of the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) to place a fraud alert on your file, which makes it harder for thieves to open accounts in your name. For stronger protection, consider a credit freeze, which restricts access to your credit report entirely.",
      "4) Be wary of phishing attempts and install strong antivirus: With personal details in the hands of cybercriminals, expect an uptick in targeted scams. Avoid clicking links or sharing information in unsolicited emails, texts or calls claiming to be from DISA or related entities.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0In light of these recurring data breaches, taking proactive steps to protect your personal information is crucial. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The DISA Global Solutions data breach isn\u2019t just an apparent mistake. It seems to be a complete failure. A company that handles sensitive data for millions, including Fortune 500 clients, let hackers lurk in its systems for more than two months. Worse, it took 10 months to tell the public. Now, 3.3 million people are left dealing with the fallout while DISA offers a token year of credit monitoring. The real cost is years of potential identity theft and financial damage.",

      "Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman told reporters Monday that he is seeking to withdraw his predecessor's motion to have a resentencing hearing for the Menendez brothers \u2013\u00a0two convicted killers, Erik and Lyle \u2013 who hope to be freed from life imprisonment without parole.",
      "He said the brothers have failed to come clean about a motive or display meaningful self-reflection that would warrant a resentencing.",

      "They had previously exhausted all appeals and had no hope of freedom, until a new California law made resentencing hearings possible.",

      "In a statement following Hochman's remarks, relatives of the brothers who have been pushing for their release accused the DA of holding their family \"hostage.\"",
      "\"He appears fixated on their trauma-driven response to the killings in 1989 with blinders on to the fact they were repeatedly abused, feared for their lives, and have atoned for their actions,\" the family saidd in a statement. \"How many times do we have to hear the same attempts to bury who they are today and rip us back to that painful time?\"",
      "In an 88-page filing, Hochman's office said prosecutors were ready to proceed with the scheduled resentencing hearings on March 20 and 21 \u2013 but would formally ask the court to withdrew the initial resentencing request under former District Attorney George Gascon.",
      "\"The basis for that request is that the prior motion did not examine or consider whether the Menendez brothers have exhibited full insight and taken complete responsibility for their crimes by continuing for the past over 30 years to lie about their claims of self-defense, that is, their fear that their mother and father were going to kill them the night of Aug. 20, 1989, justifying the brutal murders of their parents with shotgun blasts through the back of their father\u2019s head, a point-blank blast through their mother\u2019s face, and shots to their kneecaps to stage it as a Mafia killing,\" Hochman said.",
      "\"As a full examination of the record reveals, the Menendez brothers have never come clean and admitted that they lied about their self-defense as well as suborned perjury and attempted to suborn perjury by their friends for the lies, among others, of their father violently raping Lyle\u2019s girlfriend, their mother poisoning the family, and their attempt to get a handgun the day before the murders.\"",
      "Read the filing",
      "Hochman noted that jurors had rejected the self-defense claim at trial.",
      "\"We are basically, in some ways, offering a path to the Menendez brothers, and here's what the pathway looks like: If the Menendez brothers, at some point unequivocally, sincerely and fully accept complete responsibility for all their criminal actions, acknowledge that the self-defense defense was phony as their parents weren't going to kill them the night of August 20th when they murdered them in cold blood, acknowledged that they suborned or attempted to suborn perjury and all the various ways I have outline, if they go ahead and finally come clean with the court, with the public, with the DA's office, with their own family members, and acknowledge all these lies, and then can be said to have fully and completely accepted responsibility for their actions in the future,\" Hochman said. \"[Then] the court can weigh these new insights into making a determination as to whether they now qualify for rehabilitation and re sentencing, and the people will do the same.\"",
      "The Menendez brothers have never come clean and admitted that they lied about their self-defense as well as suborned perjury and attempted to suborn perjury by their friends for the lies, among others, of their father violently raping Lyle\u2019s girlfriend, their mother poisoning the family, and their attempt to get a handgun the day before the murders.",

      "A newly released study is challenging the International Criminal Court's (ICC) investigation of starvation claims against Israel and exposes the Hamas terror organization's role in controlling aid distribution.",
      "Just last week, as a result of Hamas terrorists' refusal to extend the ceasefire deal and start releasing the 59 hostages still held in Gaza, the Israeli government decided to halt all goods and supplies going into Gaza.",
      "Yet despite howls of criticism from U.N. relief chief Tom Fletcher, who called the decision \"alarming,\" the Trump administration has given its blessing to the move.",
      "Retired Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a former IDF international spokesperson and now a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, dismissed claims of starvation, telling Fox News Digital that Hamas hoards supplies while Israel ensures aid enters. \"Over 25,200 trucks arrived during the ceasefire \u2013 enough for four months. If there\u2019s hunger, it\u2019s because of Hamas corruption, not a lack of food,\" he said.",
      "The study published by Israeli public health experts, based on data from Israel\u2019s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), challenges these claims, showing no evidence of famine or intentional deprivation.",

      "The study, named \"Food supplied to Gaza during seven months of the Hamas-Israel war,\" was led by nutrition and public health experts Aron Troen and Ronit Endevelt, along with researchers from multiple Israeli universities and the Ministry of Health. The study analyzed food shipments into Gaza from January to July 2024.",
      "Using international food composition databases and the Sphere humanitarian standards, they tracked calorie intake, nutritional value, and humanitarian aid efforts, providing an objective, data-driven analysis of food supplies delivered to Gaza during the first seven months of the war.",
      "The research assessed food shipments from international donors processed through COGAT. Each item was categorized based on its energy content, protein, fat and micronutrient composition. The total nutritional supply per capita was then measured against international benchmarks to ensure accuracy.",

      "\"We didn't enter politics,\" said professor Ronit Endevelt. \"We just wanted to know if, from a nutritional perspective, the food entering Gaza was sufficient. We double-checked our data multiple times to avoid exaggeration.\"",
      "Between January and April 2024, 14,916 trucks carrying 227,854 tons of food entered Gaza, averaging 124 food trucks per day. The study found that the daily per capita caloric supply averaged 3,374 kcal, with 101 grams of protein and 80.6 grams of fat \u2013 meeting or exceeding international humanitarian food aid standards.",
      "ICC REJECTS ISRAELI APPEALS, ISSUES ARREST WARRANTS FOR BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, YOAV GALLANT",
      "\"In March 2024, the United Nations Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned of imminent famine in Gaza. Within days, cautious technical language gave way to media headlines and political statements claiming mass starvation was already underway,\" professor Troen told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"One of the most persistent falsehoods has been the claim that before the war, 500 or more humanitarian trucks entered Gaza daily, and that this number was necessary to meet the population\u2019s needs. In reality, the number of food trucks was around or fewer than 100 per day before the war, and has since increased substantially,\" he continued. \"Our study aimed to address that gap by analyzing verified food shipments. The numbers show that while there were variations, at no point did the food supply drop to starvation levels.\"",

      "When asked specifically about testimonies obtained by Fox News Digital from Gazans who reported struggling to find food on certain days, Endevelt acknowledged the study did not track final distribution within Gaza. \"We can\u2019t say there was no hunger, but we can confirm enough food entered,\" she said. \"Most of the time, in most months, there was enough food available.\"",
      "A key finding of the study is the distinction between food supply and distribution. \"Hamas systematically weaponized food distribution, using it as a tool of control,\" said Endevelt. \"Aid often didn\u2019t reach those in need because Hamas seized supplies, sold them on the black market, or prioritized its own fighters. Reports of famine are not due to a lack of aid but Hamas\u2019 deliberate strategy of restricting access to maintain power and profit.\"",
      "Despite these findings, the ICC investigation and global criticism continued. \"IPC reports, widely cited as evidence against Israel, failed to mention Hamas\u2019 role in manipulating aid,\" Troen said.",
      "When asked by Fox News Digital whether the new findings would be considered in its investigation, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor responded: \"The ICC Office of the Prosecutor has a current and ongoing investigation in relation to the Situation in the State of Palestine. The Office\u2019s investigations are built from a wide range of sources. They can encompass Article 15 communications, information from states, international partners, and civil society, publicly available sources of information, and the direct collection of evidence by the Office, including interviews with witnesses.",

However, the political climate made the review process unusually intense.\"",
      "\"This was one of the most rigorously reviewed studies I\u2019ve ever worked on,\" Endevelt added. \"We had five reviewers, far more than usual, and months of back-and-forth revisions to ensure absolute accuracy.\"",

      "The data obtained by NBC News is also an early indication of whether the second Trump administration is delivering on one of the main promises of its immigration crackdown, which President Donald Trump repeated in his inaugural address:\u00a0\u201cWe will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.\u201d",
      "Border czar Tom Homan has consistently said the administration\u2019s deportation policy is \u201cworst first,\u201d meaning it will prioritize removing people with criminal records or suspected national security threats. ICE told Congress last year that, as of July, it had identified 435,000 undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions in the country who were not in custody.",
      "Spokespeople for Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, under which CBP and ICE fall, have not responded to questions about how many of those 435,000 people have been arrested by ICE or deported since Trump took office. The spokespeople also did not respond to questions from NBC News about the data on deportations last month.",
      "Of the people deported in February, roughly half did not have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, the data showed. The number of immigrants without criminal records arrested by ICE and deported increased only slightly from the end of the Biden administration, from 223 in December to 390 in February, according to the data.",
      "While the overall deportation number is lower than Biden\u2019s, Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown has been successful in other ways.",
      "For example, the number of border crossers has dropped significantly.",
      "Encounters along the border are the lowest they have been since tracking began 25 years ago. One reason is that the Trump administration ended the CBP One program that allowed migrants to book asylum appointments via a phone app while waiting at the border. Now, migrants are turned away at the border even if they approach legal ports of entry, a policy that immigration advocacy groups have opposed in court.",
      "The Trump administration has been slow to reveal its deportation numbers, though it has publicized its arrest and detention figures, which are up compared to the Biden administration. In Trump\u2019s first month in office, ICE arrested more than 20,000 immigrants, the Department of Homeland Security said, a 111 percent increase compared to the average monthly number of arrests during the last fiscal year. And ICE under Trump is holding 10 percent more detainees than it was at the end of the Biden administration, according to the agency\u2019s public data. At the end of February, ICE was holding almost 44,000 migrants in detention, according to the data.",
      "Not every ICE arrest leads to an immediate deportation, or even necessarily to deportation at all.",
      "\u201cArrest is just the beginning, not the end,\u201d explained former ICE chief of staff Jason Houser, who served under the Biden administration. \u201cEvery ICE removal requires a legal case, court rulings, potential arrest, detention space, transport logistics, diplomatic approvals and coordination across agencies.\u201d",
      "Some of those arrested by ICE, including during the Trump administration, are released into the U.S. on a monitoring program because there is not enough space in ICE detention.\u00a0In the first two weeks of the Trump administration, ICE arrested over 8,000 immigrants and released 461, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in response to NBC News reporting.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed Congress for more money to increase detention space and ICE manpower. It is also using federal prisons and exploring using military bases as potential sites to expand detention, which could allow ICE to arrest, hold and deport more people."

    "story": [
      "After resuscitating his career in Minnesota last season, quarterback Sam Darnold will attempt to repeat that success in Seattle.",
      "Darnold has agreed to join the Seahawks, according to multiple reports, in the latest round of quarterback musical chairs around the NFL as free agency begins around the league. It is a three-year deal worth $100.5 million, including $55 million guaranteed, per ESPN and NFL Network.",
      "The Seahawks were in need of a starting quarterback after trading starter Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders last week.",
      "Multiple teams entered the offseason needing help at quarterback, but the question they faced was whether Darnold\u2019s largely resurgent 2024 season was replicable in 2025. He completed 66% of his passes for 4,319 yards with 35 touchdowns \u2014 all career-highs \u2014 and 12 interceptions in the offensive scheme of Vikings coach Kevin O\u2019Connell, who was voted the NFL\u2019s coach of the year.",
      "In Seattle, Darnold will not have the services of receiver D.K. Metcalf, whom the Seahawks traded to Pittsburgh. What he will have is former first-round pick receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba as a top target and familiarity with offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, who was on the coaching staff in San Francisco when Darnold was briefly with the 49ers.",

      "LeBron James leaves late with groin injury as Lakers lose 111-101 to Celtics",
      "The household item turning runners into world record holders",
      "The former third overall draft pick of the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold quickly lost favor in New York and bounced between two more franchises before landing with Minnesota one year ago. Expectations were low; the Vikings had drafted quarterback J.J. McCarthy in the first round and were considering him as a potential Week 1 starter. Yet after a preseason injury to McCarthy sidelined him for the entire season, Darnold was thrust into the starting job and helped the Vikings to a 14-2 record.",
      "During a seven-game stretch last season, Darnold threw for 18 touchdowns against just two interceptions while completing nearly 68% of his passes, a run that set up the Vikings for an opportunity to earn the NFC\u2019s top playoff seed entering the regular season\u2019s final game.",
      "The way Darnold ended the season likely affected his market as a free agent, however. The Vikings lost the season finale to Detroit, with Darnold throwing for a season-low 166 yards and no touchdowns and looking rattled by the Lions\u2019 pressure.",
      "Just eight days later Minnesota was routed in its playoff opener in the wild-card round by the Los Angeles Rams. Darnold was sacked nine times in the loss, in which he completed 25 of his 40 passes for 245 yards, one touchdown and one interception."

    "story": [
      "Most leading artificial intelligence voice cloning programs have no meaningful barriers to stop people from nonconsensually impersonating others, a Consumer Reports investigation found.",
      "Voice cloning AI technology has made remarkable strides in recent years, and many services can effectively mimic a person\u2019s cadence with only a few seconds of sample audio. A flashpoint moment came during the Democratic primaries last year, when robocalls of a fake Joe Biden spammed the phones of voters telling them not to vote. The political consultant who admitted to masterminding the scheme was fined $6 million, and the Federal Communications Commission has since banned AI-generated robocalls.",
      "A new survey of the six leading publicly available AI voice cloning tools found that five have easily bypassable safeguards, making it simple to clone a person\u2019s voice without their consent. Deepfake audio detection software often struggles to tell the difference between real and synthetic voices.",
      "Generative AI, which mimics human qualities such as their appearance, writing and voices, is a new and rapidly evolving technology, and the industry has few federal regulations. Most ethical and safety checks in the industry at large are self-imposed. Biden had included some safety demands in his executive order on AI, which he signed in 2023, though President Donald Trump revoked that order when he took office.",
      "Voice cloning technology works by taking an audio sample of a person speaking and then extrapolating that person\u2019s voice into a synthetic audio file. Without safeguards in place, anyone who registers an account can simply upload audio of an individual speaking, such as from a TikTok or YouTube video, and have the service imitate them.",
      "Four of the services \u2014 ElevenLabs, Speechify, PlayHT and Lovo \u2014 simply require checking a box saying that the person whose voice is being cloned had given authorization.",
      "Another service, Resemble AI, requires recording audio in real time, rather than allowing a person to just upload a recording. But Consumer Reports was able to easily circumvent that restriction by simply playing an audio recording from a computer.",
      "Only the sixth service, Descript, had a somewhat effective safeguard. It requires a would-be cloner to record a specific consent statement, which is difficult to falsify except through cloning through another service.",
      "All six services are available to the public via their websites. Only Eleven Labs and Resemble AI cost money \u2014\u00a0respectively $5 and $1 \u2014 to create a custom voice clone. The others are free.",
      "Some of the companies claim that abuse of their tool can have serious negative consequences.",
      "\u201cWe recognize the potential for misuse of this powerful tool and have implemented robust safeguards to prevent the creation of deepfakes and protect against voice impersonation,\u201d a spokesperson for Resemble AI told NBC News in an emailed statement.",
      "There are legitimate uses for AI voice cloning, including helping people with disabilities and creating audio translations of people speaking in different languages. But there is also enormous potential for harm, said Sarah Myers West, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute, a think tank that focuses on the consequences of AI policy.",
      "\u201cThis could obviously be used for fraud, scams and disinformation, for example impersonating institutional figures,\u201d West told NBC News.",
      "There is little research on the scope of how often AI is used in audio-based scams. In so-called grandparent scams, a criminal makes a phone call to a person claiming an emergency involving a family member, like they have been kidnapped, arrested or injured. The Federal Trade Commission has warned that such scams may use AI, though the scams predate the technology.",
      "Cloned voices have been used to create music without the depicted artist\u2019s permission, as happened with a viral 2023 song that falsely seemed to be by Drake and the Weeknd, and some musicians have struggled to control their image when other people release music with their voices."

      "Maryam Alwan, a 22-year-old Columbia student involved in the pro-Palestinian movement on campus, told NBC News she has felt intense anxiety since Khalil\u2019s arrest. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep all night,\u201d she said Monday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really feel real.\u201d",

Bush, ruled Monday that Trump's Jan. 6 pardon \"does not apply to defendant\u2019s convictions for conspiracy to murder employees of the United States (Count 1), solicitation to commit a crime of violence (Count 2), and influencing a federal official by threat (Count 3).\" He wrote that the pardon \"does not encompass defendant\u2019s Tennessee Case because this case involved separate offense conduct that was physically, temporally, and otherwise unrelated to defendant\u2019s conduct in the D.C. Case and/or events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\"",
      "Kelley's conduct in the murder plot \"was separated from the defendant\u2019s conduct in the D.C. Case by years and miles\" and could not reasonably be expected to be covered by the language of Trump's mass pardon, the judge ruled.",
      "\u201cTrial evidence established that defendant took independent, volitional action to prepare for a violent attack against federal officials in Knoxville \u2014 actions that are causally attenuated from the events of January 6, 2021,\" Varlan wrote. \"His acquisition of firearms, ammunition, and explosive materials, coordination with Austin Carter and Christopher Roddy to train for combat, and his distribution of a list of targeted victims are all intervening actions taken without direct or proximate relation to January 6, 2021, though perhaps in relation to the investigation of conduct occurring on January 6, 2021 \u2014 a form of relation that is, as mentioned before, notably absent from the text of the pardon.\u201d",
      "Late last month, a federal judge in Washington grilled an assistant U.S. attorney about the new contention that Trump's pardon covered charges related to guns that were found when federal agents searched Jan. 6 defendant Dan Wilson's home in 2023. U.S. District Judge Dabney L. Friedrich, a Trump appointee, has yet to rule in that case, but the judge said in court that pardons \"have to have a fixed meaning\" and that Trump's intent when he issued the pardons on Jan. 20, 2025, \"cannot evolve over time as new cases are brought to his attention.\"",
      "\"I don\u2019t think you can just have an open pardon,\" Friedrich said. \"It can\u2019t be 'we know it when we see it.'\""

    "story": [
      "After resuscitating his career in Minnesota last season, quarterback Sam Darnold will attempt to repeat that success in Seattle.",
      "Darnold has agreed to join the Seahawks, according to multiple reports, in the latest round of quarterback musical chairs around the NFL as free agency begins around the league. It is a three-year deal worth $100.5 million, including $55 million guaranteed, per ESPN and NFL Network.",
      "The Seahawks were in need of a starting quarterback after trading starter Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders last week.",
      "Multiple teams entered the offseason needing help at quarterback, but the question they faced was whether Darnold\u2019s largely resurgent 2024 season was replicable in 2025. He completed 66% of his passes for 4,319 yards with 35 touchdowns \u2014 all career-highs \u2014 and 12 interceptions in the offensive scheme of Vikings coach Kevin O\u2019Connell, who was voted the NFL\u2019s coach of the year.",
      "In Seattle, Darnold will not have the services of receiver D.K. Metcalf, whom the Seahawks traded to Pittsburgh. What he will have is former first-round pick receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba as a top target and familiarity with offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, who was on the coaching staff in San Francisco when Darnold was briefly with the 49ers.",

      "The household item turning runners into world record holders",
      "The former third overall draft pick of the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold quickly lost favor in New York and bounced between two more franchises before landing with Minnesota one year ago. Expectations were low; the Vikings had drafted quarterback J.J. McCarthy in the first round and were considering him as a potential Week 1 starter. Yet after a preseason injury to McCarthy sidelined him for the entire season, Darnold was thrust into the starting job and helped the Vikings to a 14-2 record.",
      "During a seven-game stretch last season, Darnold threw for 18 touchdowns against just two interceptions while completing nearly 68% of his passes, a run that set up the Vikings for an opportunity to earn the NFC\u2019s top playoff seed entering the regular season\u2019s final game.",
      "The way Darnold ended the season likely affected his market as a free agent, however. The Vikings lost the season finale to Detroit, with Darnold throwing for a season-low 166 yards and no touchdowns and looking rattled by the Lions\u2019 pressure.",
      "Just eight days later Minnesota was routed in its playoff opener in the wild-card round by the Los Angeles Rams. Darnold was sacked nine times in the loss, in which he completed 25 of his 40 passes for 245 yards, one touchdown and one interception."

    "published": "Mon, 10 Mar 2025 19:00:03 GMT",
    "summary": "NBC News obtained data that provides early indications on how the Trump administration is delivering on promises it made about the immigration crackdown.",
    "story": [
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents deported fewer immigrants in February than they did under the Biden administration during the same month a year ago, according to ICE data obtained by NBC News that has not been previously reported.",
      "According to the data, ICE deported around 11,000 migrants last month, the first full month Trump was in office, compared to just over 12,000 in February 2024. One major reason for the higher numbers under the Biden administration was higher traffic from attempted border crossings, both legal and illegal, in 2024 compared to 2025.",
      "People who were first arrested by Customs and Border Protection, which typically means those arrested at the border, accounted for most of the deportations in February 2024 under Biden. It is easier to deport people detained near the border than to find them after they disperse across the U.S.",
      "When removing recent border crossers from the total and counting only immigrants who were deported after first being arrested by ICE, nearly 4,300 immigrants were deported this February compared with roughly 2,100 in February 2024.",
      "The data obtained by NBC News is also an early indication of whether the second Trump administration is delivering on one of the main promises of its immigration crackdown, which President Donald Trump repeated in his inaugural address:\u00a0\u201cWe will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.\u201d",
      "Border czar Tom Homan has consistently said the administration\u2019s deportation policy is \u201cworst first,\u201d meaning it will prioritize removing people with criminal records or suspected national security threats. ICE told Congress last year that, as of July, it had identified 435,000 undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions in the country who were not in custody.",
      "Spokespeople for Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, under which CBP and ICE fall, have not responded to questions about how many of those 435,000 people have been arrested by ICE or deported since Trump took office. The spokespeople also did not respond to questions from NBC News about the data on deportations last month.",
      "Of the people deported in February, roughly half did not have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, the data showed. The number of immigrants without criminal records arrested by ICE and deported increased only slightly from the end of the Biden administration, from 223 in December to 390 in February, according to the data.",
      "While the overall deportation number is lower than Biden\u2019s, Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown has been successful in other ways.",
      "For example, the number of border crossers has dropped significantly.",
      "Encounters along the border are the lowest they have been since tracking began 25 years ago. One reason is that the Trump administration ended the CBP One program that allowed migrants to book asylum appointments via a phone app while waiting at the border. Now, migrants are turned away at the border even if they approach legal ports of entry, a policy that immigration advocacy groups have opposed in court.",
      "The Trump administration has been slow to reveal its deportation numbers, though it has publicized its arrest and detention figures, which are up compared to the Biden administration. In Trump\u2019s first month in office, ICE arrested more than 20,000 immigrants, the Department of Homeland Security said, a 111 percent increase compared to the average monthly number of arrests during the last fiscal year. And ICE under Trump is holding 10 percent more detainees than it was at the end of the Biden administration, according to the agency\u2019s public data. At the end of February, ICE was holding almost 44,000 migrants in detention, according to the data.",
      "Not every ICE arrest leads to an immediate deportation, or even necessarily to deportation at all.",
      "\u201cArrest is just the beginning, not the end,\u201d explained former ICE chief of staff Jason Houser, who served under the Biden administration. \u201cEvery ICE removal requires a legal case, court rulings, potential arrest, detention space, transport logistics, diplomatic approvals and coordination across agencies.\u201d",
      "Some of those arrested by ICE, including during the Trump administration, are released into the U.S. on a monitoring program because there is not enough space in ICE detention.\u00a0In the first two weeks of the Trump administration, ICE arrested over 8,000 immigrants and released 461, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in response to NBC News reporting.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed Congress for more money to increase detention space and ICE manpower. It is also using federal prisons and exploring using military bases as potential sites to expand detention, which could allow ICE to arrest, hold and deport more people."

      "CLEVELAND \u2014 A super PAC backing Vivek Ramaswamy for governor in Ohio is launching a $3 million ad campaign that highlights his endorsement from President Donald Trump \u2014 an early push to cement the biotech entrepreneur as the undisputed Republican front-runner more than a year before GOP voters select their nominee.",
      "\u201cHe has a big, beautiful, bright future ahead,\u201d Trump is seen and heard saying of Ramaswamy in one of the spots set to debut Tuesday. The 15-second ad, which was shared first with NBC News, also shows footage of Trump and Ramaswamy embracing at an event last year.",
      "A companion 30-second spot features a clip of Ramaswamy praising Trump and a narrator informing viewers of Trump\u2019s support: \u201cEndorsed by Trump, Vivek will make Ohio a state of excellence, the leading state to grow a business, get an education, raise a family.\u201d",
      "The ads, paid for by V-PAC: Victors not Victims, will air for three weeks on broadcast TV stations in Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Dayton and on digital platforms statewide, a GOP operative working with the group said. The allied group, as well as Ramaswamy\u2019s campaign, employs consultants with close political ties to Trump and Vice President JD Vance, a former senator from Ohio.",
      "Ramaswamy, 39, who ran for president in 2024 and worked to set up Trump\u2019s federal cost-cutting initiative led by billionaire Elon Musk, declared his candidacy last month and immediately landed Trump\u2019s endorsement. His campaign announced Monday that it had raised $1 million in its first two weeks.",
      "V-PAC, which is not subject to the same fundraising limits as a candidate\u2019s committee and can take in donations of unlimited size, has raised more than $15 million in that time, the GOP operative said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re building a massive war chest for this race that no other candidate in either the primary or general election will be able to compete with,\u201d the operative added. \u201cAfter President Trump\u2019s monumental early endorsement of Vivek, the floodgates from the donor community have opened up and we expect to have the resources necessary to steamroll the competition.\u201d",
      "The fast start comes as Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost remains in the GOP gubernatorial primary \u2014 and as Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel embarks on a schedule of GOP dinners that has kept alive speculation that he might seek the nomination.",
      "Tressel, a former Ohio State Buckeyes football coach with celebrity status to match Ramaswamy, became lieutenant governor last month. Gov. Mike DeWine, who is serving his second term and is barred from running again, appointed Tressel to succeed Sen. Jon Husted, a Republican who had been eyeing the governor\u2019s race before taking over Vance's old Senate seat. Tressel has not ruled out running for governor in 2026.",
      "\u201cFor someone who has never run for office in Ohio to raise $1 million in two weeks, it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d Jai Chabria, a top Ramaswamy adviser, wrote in a statement to NBC News. \u201cThe level of support he has garnered in such a short time is as clear a sign of Vivek\u2019s strength as a candidate. It also underscores Ohioans\u2019 hunger for fresh ideas and new energy \u2014 they\u2019re rallying behind his bold vision for the future, not just the status quo.\u201d",
      "Ramaswamy is positioning himself as an antidote to more experienced Republicans like Yost, who has won four statewide elections. Parts of Ramaswamy's agenda reads like a state-level application of Trump and Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Ramaswamy is calling for less spending and fewer regulations, the elimination of the state\u2019s income tax and merit-based pay for teachers. All are ideas that Ohio\u2019s GOP leaders have to varying degrees proposed in the past but have been unable to advance.",
      "Trump has won Ohio three times by decisive margins, and his endorsements, coupled with rally appearances, proved to be clinching factors in two of the state\u2019s recent Republican slugfests.",
      "In 2022, Trump\u2019s support lifted Vance, his future vice president, out of a messy primary and into a Senate seat. And in another rancorous Senate primary last year, businessman Bernie Moreno flooded the airwaves with clips of Trump\u2019s praise for him \u2014 even before he officially landed Trump\u2019s endorsement. Moreno won the nomination over more seasoned Republican candidates and went on to unseat longtime Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown.",
      "Dr. Amy Acton, who served as Ohio\u2019s health director in the early days of the pandemic, is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor. Others, like former Rep. Tim Ryan, who lost to Vance in the 2022 Senate race, could also enter the primary.",
      "A Democrat has not been elected governor in Ohio since 2006. Since 2010, Brown is the only Democrat to win a nonjudicial statewide office."

      "The newly returned White House leader has long been threatening to slap tariffs on major U.S. trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and the EU. Last week, new duties on goods from Mexico, Canada and China came into effect.",
      "The threat of import tariffs has raised alarm bells in Europe, as vehicles and machinery are the European Union\u2019s biggest exports to the United States.\u00a0In 2023, the EU had a 102 billion euro ($110.6 billion) trade surplus in machinery and vehicles with the U.S., with the category accounting for 41% of its exports to America.",
      "However, some of the region\u2019s automaking giants may be able to \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 skirt around the new duties.

      "\u201cThe current situation regarding the introduction of import tariffs in North America is very volatile and complex,\u201d BMW said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe linkage of import tariff to compliance with USMCA rules is the most recent announcement. If this regulation remained in effect, the BMW Group would be one of the affected companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur position remains unchanged: Free trade, which has always been a guiding principle for the BMW Group, is of immense importance worldwide,\u201d the company added. \u201cIt is one of the most crucial drivers of growth and progress. Tariffs, on the other hand, hinder free trade, slow down innovation, and set a negative spiral in motion. In the end, they are detrimental to customers, making products more expensive and less innovative.\u201d",
      "In a note to clients on Friday, UBS analysts estimated that 10% of U.S. unit sales for BMW were imported from Mexico at a fairly low price tag, largely for the company\u2019s 2 and 3 series models.",
      "\u201cIt is worth highlighting that BMW\u2019s U.S. imports from Mexico were already subject to a tariff before,\u201d they said. \u201cThe incremental tariff should, all else equal, result in an EBIT impact of ~\u20ac400m (before price increases), relatively small in a group context (4%). The bigger potential threat for BMW and the other German OEMs is the potential tariff on EU-made cars, which is facing a deadline on 2 April.\u201d",

      "Oliverson did not immediately return a request for comment. So far, the bill has no other co-sponsors, making it unlikely to pass, the Houston Chronicle reported. However, the bill is among the first of its kind nationally and is an example of how legislation targeting trans people has become more clear in its intent and more extreme in recent years, particularly in Texas.",
      "Last month, Texas state Rep. Brent Money, a Republican, filed a bill that would make it illegal for a health care provider to treat any patient, including adults, with puberty-suppressing medication, hormone therapy or surgeries if the purpose of the treatment is to affirm the patient\u2019s gender identity.",
      "Money\u2019s bill is a replica of a law enacted in 2023 that prohibits such treatments for minors. The text of the new bill shows the word \u201cchild\u201d struck out and replaced with \u201cperson\u201d to apply to adults. The bill would also prohibit medical institutions from receiving public funds if they provide any such treatments.",
      "Money did not immediately return a request for comment. After filing the bill, he said on X that the measure is intended to expand the law restricting care for minors.",
      "\u201cI want to make it clear that my heart goes out to those struggling with gender dysphoria,\u201d he said, referring to the medical term for the severe emotional distress caused by the misalignment between one\u2019s gender identity and birth sex. \u201cThese individuals deserve compassion, support, and real solutions to address their pain \u2014 not irreversible procedures that leave them scarred for life. This legislation isn\u2019t about judgment; it\u2019s about accountability.\u201d",
      "He added that the bill targets doctors and \u201cmedical profiteers\u201d who \u201cexploit vulnerable people, pushing costly surgeries and lifetime pharmaceuticals for financial gain rather than offering genuine care.\u201d",
      "However, most, if not all, major medical associations in the U.S. \u2014 including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association \u2014 support transition-related care for both minors and adults, and oppose restrictions on it.",
      "Multiple studies have found that access to transition-related care, including surgeries for adults, improves mental health outcomes. Last year, the National Center for Transgender Equality, which is now called Advocates for Trans Equality, released the largest nationwide survey of the trans community, with more than 90,000 respondents, and found that 94% reported that they were at least a little more satisfied with their lives.",
      "Texas has provided a blueprint over the last decade for states that have sought to restrict trans rights, becoming in 2017 one of the first states, alongside North Carolina, to consider a \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which would\u2019ve barred trans people from using the restrooms that align with their gender identities.",
      "The bill didn\u2019t pass, but the state has enacted other measures targeting trans people. In March 2022, after failing to pass a bill restricting transition-related care for minors, the state\u2019s attorney general issued a legal opinion that resulted in the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services opening child abuse investigations into parents who were suspected of having provided such care to their minor children.",
      "The state went on to pass a transition-related care restriction, and it has also enacted a measure barring trans student athletes from playing on school sports teams that align with their gender identities, among others. Additionally, the state recently announced that an executive order signed by President Donald Trump bars it from allowing trans people to update the gender marker on their Texas birth certificates, state IDs and driver\u2019s licenses.",
      "So far this year, Texas lawmakers have introduced nearly 170 state bills targeting LGBTQ people, according to Equality Texas, a state LGBTQ advocacy group. These include a new bathroom bill supported by a majority of the Texas House."

      "The change\u00a0announced\u00a0last week by the Social Security Administration marks a reversal from a 10% default withholding rate that was\u00a0put in place last year\u00a0after some beneficiaries received letters demanding immediate repayments for sums that were sometimes tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "The discrepancy \u2014 called overpayments \u2014 happens when Social Security beneficiaries receive more money than they are owed.",
      "The erroneous payment amounts may occur when beneficiaries fail to report to the Social Security Administration changes in their circumstances that may affect their benefits, according to a 2024\u00a0Congressional Research Service report. Overpayments can also happen if the agency does not process the information promptly or due to errors in the way data was entered, how a policy was applied or in the administrative process, according to the report.",
      "The Social Security Administration paid about $6.5 billion in retirement and disability benefit overpayments in fiscal year 2022, which represents 0.5% of total benefits paid, the Congressional Research Service said in its 2024 report. The agency also paid about $4.6 billion in overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, benefits in that year, or about 8% of total benefits paid.",
      "The Social Security Administration recovered about $4.9 billion in Social Security and SSI overpayments in fiscal year 2023. However, the agency had about $23 billion in uncollected overpayments at the end of the 2023 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "By defaulting to a 100% withholding rate for overpayments, the Social Security Administration said it may recover about $7 billion in the next decade.",
      "\u201cWe have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people,\u201d Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, said in a statement. \u201cIt is our duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding, as it was during the Obama administration and first Trump administration, to properly safeguard taxpayer funds.\u201d",
      "New overpayment policy goes into effect March 27",
      "The new 100% withholding rate will apply to new overpayments of Social Security benefits, according to the agency. The withholding rate for SSI overpayments will remain at 10%.",
      "Social Security beneficiaries who are overpaid benefits\u00a0after March 27\u00a0will automatically be subject to the new 100% withholding rate.",
      "Individuals affected will have the right to appeal both the overpayment decision and the amount, according to the agency.\u00a0They may also ask for a waiver of the overpayment, if either they cannot afford to pay the money back or if they believe they are not at fault. While an initial appeal or waiver is pending, the agency will not require repayment.",
      "Beneficiaries who cannot afford to fully repay the Social Security Administration may also request a lower recovery rate either by calling the agency or visiting their local office.",
      "For beneficiaries who had an overpayment before March 27, the withholding rate will stay the same and no action is required, the agency said.",
      "Some call 100% withholding rate 'clawback cruelty'",
      "The new overpayment policy goes into effect about one year after former Social Security Commissioner Martin O\u2019Malley implemented a 10% default withholding rate.",
      "The change was prompted by financial struggles some beneficiaries faced in repaying large sums to the Social Security Administration.",
      "At a\u00a0March 2024 Senate committee hearing, O\u2019Malley called the policy of intercepting 100% of a benefit check \u201cclawback cruelty.\u201d",
      "At the same hearing, Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Georgia, recalled how one constituent who was overpaid $58,000 could not afford to pay her rent after the Social Security Administration reduced her monthly checks.",
      "Following the Social Security Administration\u2019s announcement that it will return to 100% as the default withholding rate, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare said it is concerned the agency may be more susceptible to overpayment errors as it cuts staff.",
      "\u201cThis action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices \u2014 usually through no fault of their own,\u201d the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy organization, said in a statement.",

    "summary": "AKRON, Ohio \u2014 Does the Goodyear blimp sell tires?",
    "story": [
      "AKRON, Ohio \u2014 Does the Goodyear blimp sell tires?",
      "That was one question veteran auto executive Mark Stewart had when he started as CEO of\u00a0Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.\u00a0a little more than a year ago, seeking to lead a transformation plan for the quintessential American company.",
      "For a century, Goodyear Tire has used helium-filled airships to tout its brand. Stewart wanted to ensure consumers connected the blimps to the company\u2019s products and services, which it\u00a0has increasingly done\u00a0as Goodyear celebrates the 100-year anniversary of its first blimp,\u00a0called Pilgrim, in 1925.",
      "\u201cThe answer is yes it can, and yes it does,\u201d Stewart told CNBC during an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters. \u201cIt really is about using one of our most powerful marketing icon pieces, the blimp, both here as well as in Europe, to in fact sell tires.\u201d",
      "The blimp question was an easy one to answer compared with the rest of the challenges Stewart, who has become known for transformation plans, has tackled since joining the company in January 2024.",
      "Much like automakers and related suppliers, Goodyear\u2019s business is rapidly changing with new technologies, increased competition from low-cost countries\u00a0such as China\u00a0and investor skepticism on whether a legacy company can transform itself to be more efficient, profitable and competitive.",
      "Goodyear\u2019s answer, which was prompted by activist investor Elliott Investment Management\u00a0revealing a stake in the company\u00a0in 2023, is \u201cGoodyear Forward\u201d \u2014 a two-year transformation plan that ends in December.",
      "The\u00a0plan includes\u00a0doubling operating income margin to 10%, enacting top-line and cost reductions of $1.5 billion, and bringing in gross proceeds of $2 billion in business asset sales. It\u2019s also reducing its debt load by $1.5 billion, net of approximately $1.1 billion for restructuring.",
      "To assist, the company is investing in and deploying artificial intelligence technologies and 3D-printing for things such as tread teeth, as well as using simulation to speed development and production of its products.",
      "Roughly halfway through the initial plan, Stewart said Goodyear is ahead of schedule for its benchmarks, including upping the cuts by $200 million. But investors remain skeptical amid geopolitical uncertainty\u00a0such as tariffs\u00a0and a disbelief in the longevity, or \u201cstickiness\u201d in tire terminology, of the changes.",
      "Stewart believes Goodyear is at a \u201cshow me\u201d period with investors, which he plans to continue to deliver on as the company has reported five consecutive quarters of margin growth and its best retail performance in more than 20 years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to execute, and I think we\u2019re doing a better job of communicating in terms of our single and double hit wins as we go through the Goodyear Forward, and structurally changing the business,\u201d said Stewart, whose father worked at an Alabama plant for Goodyear\u2019s recently sold Dunlop brand. \u201cIt\u2019s continuing to stack those up.\u201d",
      "Shares of Goodyear received a 17% boost after the company reported its 2024 and fourth-quarter results. But shares of the company are down 30.3% since the plan\u2019s announcement, and 33.4% since Stewart became CEO.",
      "A spokesperson for Elliott, which has taken\u00a0board seats\u00a0at companies including\u00a0Southwest Airlines\u00a0and\u00a0eBay, declined to comment on Goodyear. Goodyear reached a cooperation agreement with Elliott, which FactSet reports retains a roughly 9% stake in the company, that included adding three directors to its board.",
      "Stewart succeeded Goodyear CEO Richard Kramer, who retired after 14 years leading the company.",
      "Goodyear blimps",
      "What started out as a new emerging aeronautics business for Goodyear in 1910 has grown into a cultural icon as the company\u2019s Goodyear blimps have flown over major sporting events and historical landmarks.",
      "The first Goodyear blimp, called Pilgrim, took flight in 1925 from a hangar the company continues to use near Akron, Ohio.",
      "Goodyear has built more than 300 blimps, also known as airships, including over 200 for the U.S. Navy to patrol oceans during World War II.",
      "There have been five major generation changes of the blimps, according to Gerald Hissem, a chief pilot who has flown Goodyear blimps for 27 years.",
      "\u201cThe technology really has advanced,\u201d he told CNBC during a tour of the company\u2019s hangar in Ohio. \u201cIt\u2019s totally different flying.\u201d",
      "Today\u2019s airship debuted in 2014 and feature a \u201cfly-by-wire\u201d system that eliminate many physical parts, according to Hissem. They were designed by Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH in Germany to Goodyear\u2019s specifications, followed by a joint team constructing them in the U.S.",
      "The blimps are powered by three four-cylinder engines \u2014 left, right and back \u2014 that are each capable of 200 horsepower. They can travel at speeds of up to 73 miles per hour. Other blimp facts include:",
      "Airship bases:\u00a0Pompano Beach, Florida; Carson, California; Suffield, Ohio; and Essen, Germany.Names:\u00a0America, Columbia, Defender, Eagle, Enterprise, Europa, Mayflower, Pilgrim, Rainbow, Ranger, Reliance, Resolute, Spirit of Akron, Spirit of Goodyear, Volunteer.Longest flight?\u00a0In March 1957, an airship called Snow Bird went 11 consecutive days in flight.

      "'Forward' progress",
      "Goodyear is well on its way to achieving its plan, but its success is not guaranteed. In addition to achieving its own targets, it\u2019s unclear how changing regulations such as President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will impact the tire company\u2019s business.",
      "Stewart, prior to the implementation and then delay of\u00a025% tariffs\u00a0on Canada and Mexico for\u00a0automakers and suppliers, declined to go into detail on Goodyear\u2019s preparation and potential contingency plans for such tariffs on North American operations as well as other countries.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re running all the scenarios with that right now,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cAnd bottom line is we\u2019ll continue to add projects into Goodyear Forward to keep marching on our journey.\u201d",
      "Goodyear has built up an international business from its humble beginnings 127 years ago in Akron, Ohio. The company employs about 68,000 people and manufactures its products in 53 facilities in 20 countries, with major operations in North and South America, Asia-Pacific and Europe.",
      "Its manufacturing operations in the Americas, which represented roughly half of its tire sales in 2024, include making tires in eight plants in the U.S., two plants in both Canada and Mexico and a plant each in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru.",
      "The Goodyear Forward plan reaches across the operations, aiming to achieve the goals through a mix of cost cutting, headcount reductions and making the business more efficient through new processes and technologies.",
      "In addition to those targets, Stewart also has set priorities to re-establish focus on its retail business, increase fleet business, including telematics, and ink high-profile business deals such as Goodyear\u2019s first launch in decades on a\u00a0Ferrari\u00a0sports car.",
      "\u201cGoodyear Forward is just getting embedded into our DNA,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cWhat\u2019s next for us is we are going to get aggressive about growth in retail and service. We are getting aggressive in growth in the high-end [tires].\u201d",
      "Evolving business",
      "Tires \u2014 Goodyear\u2019s main business \u2014 seem simple. Rubber is made into different shapes and treads, put on wheels and then put on a vehicle. They\u2019re literally where the rubber meets the road.",
      "But the process, material chemistry and production of tires continue to evolve. Goodyear has expanded its top-tier products to include massive tires for off-road vehicles such as the\u00a0Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco, as well as the\u00a0Tesla Cybertruck\u00a0and large SUVs that feature 22-inch or 24-inch wheels such as the Cadillac Escalade.",
      "Such businesses are highly profitable for the company, which is investing an unspecified amount into a facility in Oklahoma to expand production by 10 million units annually and modernize the plant.",
      "\u201cWe will ensure we\u2019re running at the optimal level of output and efficiency, and we\u2019re running the products that will yield the highest opportunities for profitability this year,\u201d Stewart said last month on the company\u2019s quarterly call.",
      "In Asia\u2013Pacific, where its newest plants are located, the company has been able to capitalize faster on such business. It increased its segment operating income by 37% last year to $277 million, with an operating margin of 11.4% \u2014 a juxtaposition from Western automakers with escalading problems in the region, specifically China.",
      "While its Asia\u2013Pacific business is a tailwind at the moment, products from competitors and nearby nations are not. Similarly to how Chinese automakers have expanded outside their own country, tire manufacturers such as Sumitomo and Yokohama have been increasingly exporting products.",
      "Tires from that region have undercut Goodyear, as companies rushed to purchase them ahead of potential tariffs. Low-end\u00a0imports\u00a0outperformed\u00a0the\u00a0U.S. industry\u00a0last year and\u00a0grew\u00a011%, CFO Christina Zamarro said during the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call.",
      "The company said low-cost imported tires are largely sourced from Southeast Asia, including from a number of countries that are either not subject to antidumping or countervailing duty tariffs.",
      "\u201cAs we look at the top line this past year, we\u2019ve seen growth in the low-end imports impacting the consumer replacement industry in the U.S., Europe, as well Brazil,\u201d Stewart told investors. \u201cThe inflows at the low-end of the market over the last two years are unprecedented.\u201d",
      "Goodyear\u2019s the last major U.S. tire company: Its largest competitors globally are France-based Michelin;\u00a0Bridgestone Corp., which is a subsidiary of a Japanese-based company; and German-based Continental.",
      "From wooden floors to tireless testing",
      "At Goodyear\u2019s headquarters, three floors of a historic building for the company that was built in 1916 continue to produce racing tires, most notably for NHRA professional classes and the top three series for NASCAR.",
      "The processes in this facility are traditional, with a lot of human interaction compared to newer plants with more automation like the company has at facilities in Luxembourg and China, and is expanding to the U.S.",
      "Down the road from the factory, which features wood floors similar to those in the factory in Detroit where Henry Ford started\u00a0building the Model T in 1900s, is a different Goodyear.",
      "Walking into the nondescript building in the shadow of the headquarters is a glimpse into the future Stewart wants for the company.",
      "In the building is Goodyear\u2019s simulation machine, a multimillion investment that promises to cut research and development costs and time, while improving product profits.",
      "To be clear, no actual tires are used in the simulator and the \u201cvehicle\u201d cockpits \u2014 a hatchback and a pickup truck \u2014 are held up by hydraulics, surround by 270 degrees of screens.",
      "\u201cThe goal is to be able to evaluate and test tire designs and theories virtually before ever having to spend the money to build a mold or build the tire,\u201d said Patrick Renz, a senior engineer at Goodyear. \u201cWe\u2019re really using this now to win [automaker business].\u201d",
      "Goodyear has worked with many of the major automakers on such virtual development, including Ferrari, according to Renz. He said the earlier in the development Goodyear can work with a company, the more impactful the virtual testing can be.",
      "Mahesh Kavaturu, Goodyear senior director of global performance and simulation technology, said such simulations, as well as AI, aim to transform Goodyear\u2019s processes.",
      "\u201cWe actually have a lot of capabilities on physical tire testing, and now we are getting into artificial intelligence, machine learning,\u201d he told CNBC in the company\u2019s \u201cInnovation Center\u201d that includes conceptual and unique products made by the company\u00a0such as airless tires. \u201cIn Goodyear, [AI] is not a buzz word.\u201d",
      "On Wall Street, hype is building for Goodyear, but many investors remain on the sidelines waiting to see if the company\u2019s recent efforts under Goodyear Forward can be ingrained in the company as much as its blimps.",
      "Goodyear\u2019s stock is rated overweight with a target price of $11.47 a share, according to nine analysts compiled by FactSet.",
      "\u201cThe company has reported inconsistent levels of profit growth over the past several years. But, we believe that an inflection point developed with the reporting of fourth quarter 2024 results, which were much better than we expected,\u201d Argus analyst Bill Selesky said in a Feb. 14 investor note upgrading Goodyear to buy.",

      "For years, American financial companies have fought the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 the chief U.S. consumer finance watchdog \u2014 in the courts and media, portraying the agency as illegitimate and as unfairly targeting industry players.",
      "Now, with the CFPB on\u00a0life support\u00a0after the Trump administration issued a\u00a0stop-work\u00a0order and shuttered its headquarters, the agency finds itself with an unlikely ally: the same banks that reliably complained about its rules and enforcement actions under former Director Rohit Chopra.",
      "That\u2019s because if the Trump administration succeeds in reducing the CFPB to a shell of its former self, banks would find themselves competing directly with nonbank financial players, from big tech and fintech firms to mortgage, auto and payday lenders, that enjoy far less federal scrutiny than Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-backed institutions.",
      "\u201cThe CFPB is the only federal agency that supervises non-depository institutions, so that would go away,\u201d said David Silberman, a veteran banking attorney who lectures at Yale Law School. \u201cPayment apps like\u00a0PayPal, Stripe,\u00a0Cash App, those sorts of things, they would get close to a free ride at the federal level.\u201d",
      "The shift could wind the clock back to a pre-2008 environment, where it was largely left to state officials to prevent consumers from being ripped off by nonbank providers. The CFPB was created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis that was caused by irresponsible lending.",
      "But since then, digital players have made significant inroads by offering banking services via mobile phone apps. Fintechs led by PayPal and\u00a0Chime\u00a0had roughly as many\u00a0new accounts\u00a0last year as all large and regional banks combined, according to data from Cornerstone Advisors.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re the big banks, you certainly don\u2019t want a world in which the non-banks have much greater degrees of freedom and much less regulatory oversight than the banks do,\u201d Silberman said.",
      "Keep the exams",
      "The CFPB and its employees are in limbo after acting Director Russell Vought took over last month, issuing a flurry of directives to the agency\u2019s then 1,700 staffers. Working with operatives from\u00a0Elon Musk\u2019s\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, Vought quickly laid off about 200 workers, reportedly took steps to end the agency\u2019s building lease and canceled reams of contracts required for legally mandated duties.",
      "In internal emails released Friday, CFPB Chief Operating Officer Adam Martinez detailed plans to remove roughly 800 supervision and enforcement workers.",
      "Senior executives at the CFPB shared plans for more layoffs that would leave the agency with\u00a0just five employees, CNBC has reported. That would kneecap the agency\u2019s ability to carry out its supervision and enforcement duties.",
      "That appears to go beyond what even the\u00a0Consumer Bankers Association, a frequent CFPB critic, would want. The CBA, which represents the country\u2019s biggest retail banks,\u00a0has sued\u00a0the CFPB in the past year to scuttle rules limiting overdraft and credit card\u00a0late fees. More recently, it noted the CFPB\u2019s role in keeping a level playing field among market participants.",
      "\u201cWe believe that new leadership understands the need for examinations for large banks to continue, given the intersections with prudential regulatory examinations,\u201d said\u00a0Lindsey Johnson, president of the CBA, in a statement provided to CNBC. \u201cImportantly, the CFPB is the sole\u00a0examiner of non-bank financial institutions.\u201d",
      "Vought\u2019s plans to hobble the agency were halted by a federal judge, who is now considering the merits of a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0brought by a CFPB union asking for a preliminary injunction.",
      "A hearing where Martinez is scheduled to testify is set for Monday.",
      "'Good luck'",
      "In the meantime, bank executives have gone from antagonists of the CFPB to among those concerned it will disappear.",
      "At a late October bankers convention in New York,\u00a0JPMorgan Chase\u00a0CEO\u00a0Jamie Dimon\u00a0encouraged his peers to \u201cfight back\u201d against regulators. A few months before that, the bank said that it\u00a0could sue\u00a0the CFPB over its investigation into peer-to-peer payments network Zelle.",
      "\u201cWe are suing our regulators over and over and over because things are becoming unfair and unjust, and they are hurting companies, a lot of these rules are hurting lower-paid individuals,\u201d Dimon said at the convention.",
      "Now, there\u2019s growing consensus that an initial push to \u201cdelete\u201d the CFPB is a mistake. Besides increasing the threat posed from nonbanks, current rules from the CFPB would still be on the books, but nobody would be around to update them as the industry evolves.",
      "Small banks and credit unions would be even more disadvantaged than their larger peers if the CFPB were to go away, industry advocates say, since they were never regulated by the agency and would face the same regulatory scrutiny as before.",
      "\u201cThe conventional wisdom is not right that banks just want the CFPB to\u00a0go away, or that banks want regulator consolidation,\u201d said an executive at a major U.S. bank who declined to be identified speaking about the Trump administration. \u201cThey want thoughtful policies that will support economic growth and maintain safety and soundness.\u201d",
      "A senior CFPB lawyer who lost his position in recent weeks said that the industry\u2019s alignment with Republicans may have backfired.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re about to live in a world in which the entire non-bank financial services industry is unregulated every day, while they are overseen by the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a world where\u00a0Apple, PayPal, Cash App and\u00a0X\u00a0run wild for four years. Good luck.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The path to averting a government shutdown at the end of the week remains murky in the Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is eyeing a House vote Tuesday on a six-month funding extension that was crafted on a partisan basis. His strategy is to rely on only Republican votes to pass it in the House and dare Democrats to oppose it.",
      "If it passes the House, where a simple majority is needed, the legislation will require 60 votes in the Senate, meaning at least seven Democrats would need to back it to break a filibuster.",
      "Johnson expressed confidence to reporters Monday that the stopgap funding measure would pass both chambers of Congress.",
      "\"No one wants to shut the government down, and we are governing, doing the responsible thing as Republicans,\" Johnson said. \"It\u2019s going to be up to [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats to do the right thing, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to shut the government down.\"",
      "But congressional Democrats have blasted the continuing resolution after they were cut out of the negotiations. They object to some of the changes, which feature an increase in military spending and a reduction in nondefense money. And they have demanded guardrails on President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk's attempts to slash or freeze some spending.",
      "\"The president has been deciding how to spend the money anyway he wants even when we have a budget that both Democrats and Republicans voted on. That's a constitutional issue, right? Everyone knows Congress has the power of the purse,\" Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., said Sunday on \"Meet the Press.\"",
      "\"Until I see some assurances that whatever we pass next week is going to ensure that the money is spent the way Congress intends, I'm going to withhold my vote until I see that,\" she added.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, issued a memo describing how Republicans had structured the bill to take control away from Congress to fund certain federal programs and hand the Trump administration more flexibility in how to spend the money.",
      "Murray's memo said the Johnson measure creates \u201cslush funds for the Trump administration to reshape spending priorities, eliminate longstanding programs, pick winners and losers.\u201d",
      "The specific cuts are not spelled out in the legislation. But according to Murray, potential cuts to nondefense spending could include funding for combatting fentanyl and other substance abuse programs, as well as National Institutes of Health priorities like Alzheimer\u2019s disease and vaccine research.",
      "On top of that, it gives the the Trump administration broad discretion on choosing Army Corps of Engineer projects, military construction projects and transit improvement projects, the memo said, \"leaving Democratic states and priorities in the lurch.\"",
      "The bill would also would restrict Washington, D.C.'s local funding levels to fiscal year 2024, resulting in a roughly $1 billion cut and potentially affecting police, firefighters and teachers.",
      "Johnson has little room for error to get his measure through the House. Republicans hold a 218-214 majority, following the sudden death last week of Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Texas. That means Johnson can\u00a0afford just one Republican defection if all members are present and voting. If some Democrats are absent, it could give Johnson a slightly larger cushion.",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., has made it crystal clear he will vote against the continuing resolution, blasting both parties over failing to cut spending.",
      "\"Unless I get a lobotomy Monday that causes me to forget what I've witnessed the past 12 years, I'll be a NO on the CR this week,\" Massie wrote on X on over the weekend. \"It amazes me that my colleagues and many of the public fall for the lie that we will fight another day.\"",
      "If Republicans can muscle the bill through the House this week, then all eyes will be on Slotkin and other Senate Democrats.",
      "Because of their 53-47 majority and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., vowing to oppose the measure over spending concerns, Republicans will need Democratic votes to overcome the 60-vote threshold in the upper chamber.",
      "So far, not a single Democrat in either the House or the Senate has said they will vote yes on the bill.",
      "Trump has backed Johnson's bill, urging Republicans over the weekend to vote for it.",
      "\"I am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country\u2019s \u2018financial house\u2019 in order,\" Trump posed on Truth Social. \"Democrats will do anything they can to shut down our Government, and we can\u2019t let that happen.\""

      "Daniel Hastings and Taylor Haag are the only couple from \"Love Is Blind\" Season 8 to get married.",
      "The two matched each other\u2019s energy from their first conversation.",
      "He joked about proposing a few minutes into their chat and she playfully went along. When she returned to gush with the girls, Taylor, a 32-year-old colonoscopy nurse, said she appreciated that Daniel, a 30-year-old sales account executive, repeatedly spoke about searching for the mother of his kids.",
      "They also bonded over their love of Christmas. In Episode 5, they gifted each other Christmas ornaments and stockings and marveled over their similarities. \u201cThe Christmas thing means a lot to me,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cBut even if it wasn\u2019t Christmas stuff, I feel like we were meant to find each other.\u201d",
      "Taylor replied that Daniel made her feel \u201cvery special, very loved and very important.\u201d She then told Daniel that his words to her were the nicest things anyone has ever said to her.",
      "In Episode 6, he read her a letter explaining why he loved her. \u201cAll I want to do is make you feel safe and make you happy for the rest of your life,\u201d Daniel said. He then knelt on one knee and proposed.",
      "\u201cI would love to marry you!\u201d she cheered.",
      "Episode 6 ended on a cliffhanger as all the optimism and excitement Daniel and Taylor shared after meeting each other came to a screeching halt. After the face-to-face reveal, Taylor told the cameras she had an eerie feeling that she recognized Daniel. She spiraled, recalling that a social media user who looked like Daniel briefly followed her on Instagram before she left to film the show.",
      "She met Daniel and voiced her concerns, explaining that she worried he already knew facts based on her profile and used the prior knowledge to woo her. He said he couldn\u2019t remember following her and that her description didn\u2019t exactly match his account. To confirm the truth, she scrolled through a list of Instagram users who had previously followed her. When she couldn\u2019t find his name, she apologized. He was understanding and said he still wanted to take the trip with her Honduras.",
      "The two quickly moved past the tiff and enjoyed their vacation in Honduras. After they returned, they met each other\u2019s families and gushed about their connection. Daniel also introduced his parents to Taylor\u2019s mom and dad, who stressed that divorce wasn\u2019t an option in their family.",
      "The couple got married in the finale, becoming the only couple to do so. As of the reunion, they are still together.",

      "Devin Buckley and Virginia Miller hit it off in the pods after learning that they both attended the same Minnesota high school. But, Devin, a 29-year-old youth director and coach, was a student at the school a few years after Virginia, a 34-year-old healthcare recruiter, graduated and the two had never crossed paths.",
      "While in the pods, Devin also formed a connection with Brittany Dodson, but the relationship fizzled out when she realized he was too \u201crigid\u201d and didn\u2019t seem like the ideal partner. He agreed and continued to pursue Virginia, who had been reserved and skeptical during many of their conversations.",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a sweet letter to Virginia expressing his feelings. \u201cVirginia, you are the most kind, loving and genuine person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he praised. \u201cI know that in your past relationships, they made you feel insecure and undervalued. But I promise to always make you feel valued, loved, and to make you feel like the queen that you are.\u201d",
      "At the end of his letter, he told Virginia he loved her and asked her to marry him. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d she softly replied. She later told the cameras through tears, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this ever. I just feel amazing. Today\u2019s a good day.\u201d",
      "In Honduras, Virginia and Devin continued to get along but had a minor disagreement when they moved in together. After the couple visited their separate apartments and spoke about their future, Virginia suggested that they sign a prenup to establish financial boundaries. She explained that they should each be entitled to the assets they had before meeting each other. Devin was caught off guard and seemed hesitant to agree.",
      "When Devin introduced Virginia to his family, he mentioned the possible prenuptial agreement. His family, particularly his sister Kayla, questioned the idea and wondered if Virginia was already doubting if the marriage would work.",
      "On the day of their wedding, Virginia decided not to move forward, shocking Devin completely.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just not ready. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry,\" she said. Virginia and Devin's parents also seemed to be shocked by the move. Virginia\u2019s father hugged Devin and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a very good man. I\u2019m disappointed also, but I think you\u2019re a great guy.\u201d",
      "She explained her decision in a confessional.",
      "\u201cThere were just depths of our relationship that we didn\u2019t get to. We just didn\u2019t get there. And even our sexual relationship, we just didn\u2019t get to it. So I just think that we should be all the way there before we decide to spend the rest of our lives together,\u201d she said.",
      "Joey and Monica",
      "Joey Leveille and Monica Danus\u2019 time in the pods was drama-free. Joey, a 35-year-old physician associate, and Monica, a 28-year-old digital marketer, seemed to only form a bond with each other. They quickly connected thanks to their bubbly and quirky personalities and their love for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d Joey also supported Monica when she revealed that she was between jobs because she needed to take time off to help her family.",
      "By Episode 2, they already knew that they wanted to get engaged and leave the pods together, making them the first official couple of Season 8.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve had an incredible time falling in love with who you are as a person, your laugh, your voice, and I would love to take the next step with you,\u201d Joey said.",
      "\u201cWould you get engaged with me?\u201d he asked.",
      "She laughed and said \u201cYes!\u201d She said she couldn\u2019t wait to see him in person before running to share the news with her friends.",
      "Joey and Monica spent their time in Honduras learning more about each other and their idiosyncrasies, like her family's shared \"sock bin.\" It appeared the two would have a drama-free path to the finale \u2014 until Joey met Monica's family.",
      "While her parents were welcoming and invited Joey to participate in their family jam session, Monica's older sister, Nicolle, quietly eyed Joey from her seat. When she pulled Monica to have a private conversation outside, Nicolle mentioned that Joey wasn't her sister's usual type. She also said that as the older sister she always felt she would get married first.",
      "At their apartment, Joey shared that he could tell Nicolle didn't warm to him. After Monica revealed what she spoke about with Nicolle, Joey suggested that jealousy might be the cause of Nicolle's disapproval.",
      "Nicolle later takes Joey and Monica's engagement photos and appeared to come around \u2014 but Joey was still doubtful, as he says in Episode 13.",
      "In the finale, Joey and Monica chose not to get married. Monica felt that Joey wasn't completely ready and he agrees at the altar.",
      "\"If Joey had told me with his words, \u2018I am 100% in. It is you. I know it\u2019s you. I\u2019m certain.\u2019 I feel like it could have been a lot different,\u201d\u00a0she said in a confessional.",
      "Ben and Sara",
      "Ben Mezzenga and Sara Carton briefly struggled in the pods when they started discussing their values. In Episode 2, Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, asked Ben, a 28-year-old developer, about growing up in a Christian household. He explained his beliefs before she revealed that she wasn\u2019t religious.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me that\u2019s really tough about religion is my sister, Lisa. She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s gay,\u201d she explained. She asked if Ben would be comfortable around her sister and would go to Pride activities with them.",
      "\u201cYeah, no discomfort around that community at all,\u201d he replied. She felt confident in their connection, but when they met again in Episode 4, she had some more concerns. She mentioned Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of ignorant towards that stuff. Like, I didn\u2019t vote in the last election. As long as I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not going to do much, so\u2026\u201d Ben said. When she asked directly about BLM, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not one way or the other. I just kind of keep out of it.\u201d",
      "Sara replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable and important to think about those things.\u201d\u00a0 She later said she didn\u2019t like his responses to her questions. \u201cBasic human rights, equality, I need someone to be on the same page with me about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben assured her in Episode 5 that their values aligned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any burden or any weight on your shoulder thinking that you have to teach me because I do have that motivation to grow into that and that internal feeling that we do have the same beliefs in these things,\u201d he said before proposing.",
      "\u201cI feel so at peace and accepted by you,\u201d she said after accepting his proposal. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t imagine being with anyone else.\u201d",
      "Ben and Sara landed in Honduras and swiftly decided to build on their emotional connection by exploring a physical relationship. When all the engaged couples reunited, Ben and Sara could not stop gushing about how well they got along.",
      "In Minneapolis, Sara met a few of Ben's friends. Sara shared details about their conversation about values in the pods and his friends confirmed that he was an inclusive person.",
      "Sara and Ben continued to progress until the two had an uncomfortable conversation at the end of Episode 9. She gasped twice after learning that a woman on TikTok posted a video calling out some of the \"s----- men\" on the Season 8 cast, without identifying the male cast members.",
      "Ben, who had already seen the video, said, \"I think she is referencing me.\" He also shared that he blocked the user and she blocked him.",
      "When Sara pressed him to further explain the situation, he said he hadn't spoken to the woman in over four years and that he was \"uncertain\" about what else she would reveal. He added that she was \"overreacting.\" Sara cautioned him that if he wasn't being forthcoming then the trust between them would be broken.",
      "In Episode 10, the couple meets Sara's sister and her partner, who express worry and skepticism over her sister's new relationship.",
      "\u201cI see that you have a strong connection, but this is not real right now,\u201d Lisa, Sara's sister, told her.",
      "Sara appeared to hold firm. \u201cBen is such... like, we are so aligned in so many ways,\" she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose Ben because I felt we were the same person. I chose Ben because he made me feel so special, and I felt energized and loved and important.\u201d",
      "But by the finale, her tune had changed. Sara decided not to marry Ben \u2014 who seemed shocked and, in his words, \"devastated\" by her decision. Sara cited their differing values and political beliefs as one of her reasons.",
      "Ben wanted to continue dating but Sara seemed to balk. \u201cBut you can\u2019t date someone for their potential because they may never reach the potential,\" she said.",
      "David and Lauren",
      "David \u201cDave\u201d Bettenburg and Lauren O\u2019Brien were one of many Season 8 contestants who were involved in a love triangle. Dave, a 33-year-old medical device salesman, couldn\u2019t determine if he had stronger feelings for Lauren or Molly Mulaney. When Lauren, a 31-year-old education saleswoman, realized Dave was undecided, she revealed to him that she didn\u2019t have any other connections.",
      "Meanwhile, Molly anxiously waited for Dave to call it quits with Lauren and solely pursue her. But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",
      "Dave then met with Lauren. She said although they had some tough conversations she appreciated that they were open with each other and were able to move past everything.",
      "He agreed and said, \u201cYou easily could have bailed. I just can\u2019t thank you enough for your patience because it helped me come to terms with a lot of other things. And not being afraid to go after the girl that I really want to be with. I\u2019m so in love with you.\u201d",
      "He proposed and she quickly accepted. \u201cI love you so much, too. I\u2019m excited to just start a future with you,\u201d she said.",
      "In the pods, Dave repeatedly mentioned that his sister\u2019s opinions of his partners played a big role in his past relationships. Although fans still haven\u2019t met her, the weight of her apparent disapproval and the mistrust of Dave\u2019s friends negatively impacted his romance with Lauren in the second group of episodes.",
      "As soon as Dave and Lauren returned to Minneapolis, he complained that friends and family members learned about his engagement before he told them. Then, Dave revealed that an acquaintance claimed he had been dating Lauren up until she left to go on \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d Lauren denied his timeline of events and said that she had ended their casual fling. She said that the acquaintance wanted to create drama.",
      "Despite Lauren\u2019s friends also supporting her, Dave could not fully trust Lauren, creating a strain in their relationship as they approached wedding day.",
      "The couple broke up in Episode 11 of the series in a long conversation that covered her past fling \u2014 which they still didn't share an understanding of \u2014 and Dave's talk with her father.",
      "Speaking to the camera after the breakup, Dave said he felt like he \u201clet her down\u201d because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t get over my own ego.\u201d",
      "\u201cLove is blind but I don\u2019t think marriage is,\u201d he said.",
      "Lauren, meanwhile, was \"really sad\" it didn't work out \u2014 and \"pissed,\" too. The former couple met after a group hangout but did not reconcile.",
      "Alex and Madison",
      "Alex Brown and Madison Errichiello opened up in the pods about their difficult childhoods. Alex, a 29-year-old commercial real estate broker, and Madison, a 28-year-old artist, were both bullied in school and felt like outcasts.",
      "The two seemed headed for an engagement until Madison revealed she had an avoidant attachment style. Alex suddenly became less talkative and their conversation ended abruptly.",
      "When they met again, Alex voiced his concerns that Madison would run if they faced an obstacle. She told him that her still being in the experiment was proof that she was ready to go through challenging times with him. Meanwhile, Madison was also building a connection with Mason Horacen.",
      "Mason told Madison he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to her. But when Madison decided to pursue her relationship with Alex instead, Mason regretted what he said. In Episode 6, Madison explained the situation to Alex.",
      "Alex said he sympathized with Mason and wished him well. Madison didn\u2019t appreciate that Alex wasn\u2019t more comforting toward her.\u00a0 After their tense conversation, Alex said he could see a future with her but he was worried they would struggle with communication and disagreements. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s a pretty big jump. We\u2019re not at a point to get engaged,\u201d he said.",
      "Madison tearfully departed the pods and left the experiment.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Alex said he had no regrets over ending the relationship.",
      "\"I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen,\" he said.",
      "His decision came down to attachment style and conflict resolution, as it appeared in the pods. \"I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\" he said.",
      "Read the rest of our interview with Alex here.",
      "Mason and Meg",
      "Mason, a 33-year-old cinematographer, gravitated toward Meg Fink, a 31-year-old oncology nurse, in the pods. She shared her conspiracy theories with him and expressed her strong feelings. But she knew that Mason also had a connection with Madison.",
      "After Madison ended things with Mason, she told Meg what happened. Meg confronted Mason in the pods at the end of Episode 5. She questioned if she was only there by \u201cdefault\u201d because Madison rejected him.",
      "He said he validated the \u201cwrong person\u201d because he was \u201cconfused\u201d at the time.",
      "When he said she was always his first choice, Meg replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t yesterday, just to be fair.\u201d She said he never affirmed his feelings for her until it was too late.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll never know if what you\u2019re saying is true because we don\u2019t get the opportunity for you to pick,\u201d she told him in Episode 6. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to get past that.\u201d",
      "He said he understood her perspective and they said goodbye. They tried to date after the pods but have since broken up. At the reunion, Mason said he and Meg are \"best friends.\"",

      "\u201cFootloose\u201d may have been one of the films that helped put Kevin Bacon on the map, but there\u2019s one part of the movie he likes to avoid.",
      "During a retrospective of his career at SXSW in Austin, Texas, on March 7, the actor, who played Ren in the smash film, said he hates when Kenny Loggins\u2019 iconic title track from the 1984 movie plays at weddings.",
      "\u201cMy worst nightmare is to be at a wedding and the DJ puts on the music,\u201d he said, according to Variety.",
      "\u201cThey always start out being about the bride, and then there\u2019s alcohol involved. And by about 10:30, the song comes on, and suddenly the wedding becomes about me getting out and dancing. People will literally form a circle around me and clap their hands like I\u2019m a trained monkey.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s gotten to the point where Bacon, who has detailed his struggles being a regular person, will tell the DJ: \u201cPlease don\u2019t play that song.\u201d",

      "\u201cFootloose\u201d remains one of Bacon\u2019s signature roles and a popular song, but he said he had no clue the movie was about dancing once he got the part and that he didn\u2019t think a choreographer was needed.",
      "\u201cThe script was not written in that way at all, and there was no indication other than one line, like, he gets pissed off and dances or something,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not a trained dancer.\u201d",
      "Appearing in \u201cFootloose\u201d certainly changed the trajectory of Bacon\u2019s career and his own life, catapulting him to fame.",

      "\u201cLove Is Blind\u201d Season 8 stars Ben Mezzenga and Sara Carton have had an unusual journey during their time on the Netflix dating show.",
      "Back in the pods, the couple bonded before realizing a glaring difference between them. Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, explained to Ben that she grew up in a conservative household but was no longer religious and she shared that her sister, Lisa, was gay. Sara also expressed her opinions on the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, noting that she felt more engaged in social issues during that time given that George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
      "Ben, a 28-year-old developer, said that he went to church often and that faith played a big role in his life. But he said he had \u201cno discomfort around that community at all,\u201d when referring to the LGBTQ+ community and that he was \u201cignorant\u201d toward politics and the BLM movement.",
      "Despite not being on the same page, both thought that their values aligned and they decided to get engaged. When they left the pods, they continued to have lengthy conversations where they discussed conflicting views about religion. In Episode 10, Sara also learned that Ben\u2019s ex released a TikTok video in which she labeled some of the Season 8 cast as \u201cs----- men,\u201d appearing to refer to him.",

      "\u201cBen, I love you so much,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always wanted a partner to be on the same wavelength. So today, I can\u2019t.\u201d",

      "She politely shut him down. \u201cWe\u2019ll see!\u201d she replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that.\u201d",
      "Sara then walked out of the ceremony and sat in a car to process the situation with her mom, Kathy, and sister, Lisa.",
      "She assured her family she was fine and mentioned her pod conversation with Ben about BLM as one of the reasons she couldn\u2019t marry him. She said she often wondered if their relationship was just \u201csurface, fun, carefree love\u201d and worried that there was \u201cno curiosity coming from his side.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Ben remained at the ceremony with his friends. Together, they prayed for him and Sara. Ben said he wanted to unpack everything with Sara, but the couple did not communicate the rest of the episode.",
      "Instead, Sara further explained her decision to the cameras. She said the two were \u201cnot a good fit\u201d and that she could not continue the \u201ccycle\u201d of them trying to sort through their different values.",
      "At the end of the episode, Ben said that he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Sara\u2019s choice while she offered more insight into their relationship",
      "She said that she had to \u201cconstantly give him the benefit of the doubt\u201d when they disagreed.",
      "Sara added, \u201cBut you can\u2019t date someone for their potential because they may never reach the potential.\u201d Even though they didn\u2019t get married, she said she still believed love is blind and that she was proud of herself.",
      "What happened at the reunion?",
      "At the reunion, Sara and Ben spoke about the main topic that broke them up: Values and politics.",
      "Sara also brought up what happened after the wedding from her perspective. While in Nashville for a travel nursing job, she expected Ben to join her.

      "Simultaneously, Devin was talking with Brittany Dodson, a 35-year-old partnership executive, and they started to form a connection. Soon enough, Devin and Brittany realized they weren't the best fit for each other and went their separate ways on amicable terms. This left Devin free to pursue his connection with Virginia.",
      "At the same time, Devin was a bit worried that Virginia was too \u201cclosed off\u201d and slow to open up. She began to express herself more freely and noted that she's at first very \u201cshy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't want to keep choosing the wrong guy,\u201d she said, adding that she hasn't had many good examples of healthy relationships in her life.",
      "Virginia called Devin \u201cquite refreshing\u201d and said she'd never dated a \u201cnice guy\u201d before. In a confessional interview, Devin called Virginia a \u201ckind, loving, genuine person.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere were just depths of our relationship that we didn't get to. We just didn't get there. And even our sexual relationship, we just didn't get to it. So I just think that we should be all the way there before we decide to spend the rest of our lives together,\u201d she said.",

      "The highly-anticipated footage for the upcoming season, which is set five years after the events of Season 1, was revealed during a South by Southwest film festival panel on March 8. The clip was subsequently uploaded to YouTube and gained more than 6 million views in less than 24 hours.",
      "In the preview, Joel and Ellie are living safely on a base with other survivors, seemingly protected from the monsters that lurk beyond the walls. Meanwhile, other survivors on the outside of the base are trying to fend off rabid creatures and fight for survival.",
      "But, Joey and Ellie's moment of peace will be short-lived. The preview shows that their bond will be tested after she learns about his betrayal. \"You swore,\" she says to him in the final seconds of the clip.",

      "In January 2023, Variety reported that HBO had renewed \"The Last of Us\" for Season 2 after only two episodes of the first season.",
      "But, it took more than two years for Season 2 details to officially emerge. Following the show's SXSW panel March 8, HBO announced in a press release that Season 2 of \"The Last of Us\" will premiere on Sunday, April  13 at 9 p.m. ET/ PT. The show will air on HBO and also be available to stream on Max every week.",
      "While Season 1 had nine episode, the next season will be slightly shorter with only seven episodes.",

      "Will Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey return for Season 2?",
      "Viewers may remember that by the eighth episode of Season One (\"When We Are in Need\"), Joel and Ellie, once-guarded companions,  grew inseparable, forging an unbreakable father-daughter bond.",
      "Upon finding a shell-shocked Ellie (who discovered a pastor and his flock had been eating fellow parishioners instead of venison), the pair share a pivotal moment in the series with Joel tenderly saying, \"It's OK, baby girl. I got you.\" In that moment, it becomes apparent that Joel accepted being a father figure to Ellie, despite his pain over the loss of his own daughter on the first day of the pandemic.",

      "Among them? That O\u2019Hara might play wife to Tommy Miller (Gabriel Luna), the younger brother of Joel (Pascal).",
      "However, according to an article by Entertainment Weekly, some rumors suggested that O\u2019Hara will be slotted into a newly created role, separate from the video games the series is based on.",
      "On March 8, HBO remained tight-lipped with details about O'Hara's character. But, the network did reveal that Gabriel Luna will be back as Tommy and Rutina Wesley will reprise her role as Maria.",

Whether it\u2019s hosting American officials for negotiations to end the Ukraine war, orchestrating talks about the future of Gaza or rolling out the red carpet for Trump\u2019s first foreign trip, Saudi Arabia has emerged in recent years as an unlikely global powerbroker.",
      "Less than five years ago, then-presidential hopeful Joe Biden called the kingdom a \u201cpariah\u201d and, even after significant reforms, rights groups say the authoritarian Gulf state still has an \u201cabysmal\u201d human rights record.",
      "The talks in the coastal city of Jeddah are emblematic of the rebranding effort choreographed by powerful Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "They come as MBS, as he\u2019s widely known, is attempting\u00a0 to transform Saudi Arabia\u2019s image from the deeply conservative, oil-rich theocracy whose officials murdered the American-based Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, into a regional giant built on diplomacy, business, tourism, entertainment and sports.",
      "The kingdom \u201cis a more visible and energetic player on the world scene than it once was,\u201d said Thomas Lippman, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a new Saudi Arabia \u2014 better educated, well-traveled, and more open to ideas than in the past,\u201d added Lippman, an author of the book \u201cSaudi Arabia on the Edge.\u201d",
      "As well as the Ukraine summit, Trump revealed last week that the first foreign visit of his second term would be to Saudi Arabia, just as it was during his first administration. As then, he said that, in return, the Saudis had agreed to invest a bonanza sum in American businesses, this time $1 trillion.",
      "This relationship has raised questions about ties between Riyadh and the Trump family.",

      "NBC News has requested comment from the White House about concerns over the Trump family\u2019s relations with Riyadh.",
      "But \u201cthere has never been a sharp distinction in Saudi Arabia between family business and the state\u2019s business,\u201d said F. Gregory Gause III, a visiting scholar at the Middle East Institute. \u201cIn the Trump era, that element is entering American politics.\u201d",

      "Saudi Arabia certainly wants to \u201cadvertise itself as a location for such meetings\u201d and is \u201ctrying to set itself up as an alternative to Geneva or Vienna,\u201d Gause said.",
      "Analysts also point out that Saudi Arabia, alongside so-called \u201cmiddle\u201d\u00a0 or \u201cswing\u201d powers such as India, Brazil and South Africa, has been able to maintain its relationship with both the U.S. and China, while being seen as aligned with either.",
      "Bin Salman has also been central, spearheading an epic-scale infrastructure project called Vision 2030, a plan to diversify Saudi\u2019s oil-dominated economy with a series of ambitious infrastructure projects.",
      "It has also become a regular home for concerts by Western pop stars and sports events. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has also invested in the English Premier League team Newcastle United and in 2022, alongside two of the world\u2019s most prominent players, Phil Mickelson and Greg Norman, it created the controversial LIV golf tour which eventually merged with the PGA.",
      "After Riyadh\u2019s \u201ccoming out\u201d party hosting the G20 in 2020, which showed \u201ca more forceful Saudi diplomacy,\u201d the kingdom now stands \u201cnonaligned, developmental state with tremendous resources to transform domestically,\u201d said Karen Young, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. It also has the power to influence international politics \u201cthrough economic statecraft.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s embrace of Riyadh follows an evolution under then-President Joe Biden, who went from condemning Khashoggi\u2019s killing to visiting and fist-bumping MBS, who said he took responsibility for the brutal murder but denied personal involvement.",
      "There have also been significant reforms inside Saudi Arabia, including the removal of the requirement for women to wear headscarves in public, and allowing them to drive and attend soccer matches \u2014 the country plans to host the 2034 soccer World Cup.",

      "Greer said she spoke by phone with one of the ICE agents during the arrest, who said they were acting on State Department orders to revoke Khalil\u2019s student visa. Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.",
      "The arrest appears to be among the first known actions under President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to deport international students who joined the protests against the war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. His administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas, a terror organization.",
      "When ICE agents arrived at the campus building Saturday, they also threatened to arrest Khalil\u2019s wife, an American citizen who is eight months pregnant, Greer said. The authorities declined to say why Khalil was being arrested, according to the attorney.",

      "But as the nation grapples with this surge in violence, here\u2019s what we know about what\u2019s happening on the ground and what it could mean for Syria\u2019s future.",
      "What we know",
      "Syria\u2019s rugged Mediterranean shore was a stronghold of the Assad family\u2019s brutal regime, which lasted 53 years before a rebel alliance led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) ousted Assad three months ago in a lightning-fast offensive that swept across the nation and led HTS leader Sharaa to become the new government\u2019s interim president.",
      "However, Syria\u2019s northwest coast remains a fractured battleground, with armed Assad loyalists holding on to villages and remote pockets of territory.",
      "Sharaa\u2019s government has deployed armed forces to the region in a bid to assert control, but fierce clashes erupted last week that have left hundreds dead.",
      "Video posted on social media and verified by NBC News showed dozens of bodies piled on a blood-soaked street in Latakia. Women gathered around the bloodied corpses. One can be heard sobbing, \u201cMy dad, my brother, oh, God.\u201d",
      "Other verified videos showed military vehicles moving through the countryside amid explosions and gunfire, while another showed soldiers indiscriminately dropping bombs from a helicopter over Latakia\u2019s rural areas.",
      "The SOHR\u00a0is a prominent information office dedicated to documenting human rights abuses in Syria.",
      "The group said that the vast majority of people killed in the current clashes were from the Alawite sect and that women and children were executed by firing squad in the countryside near Tartus.",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the death toll or methods of execution.",
      "The Associated Press reported that Sunni gunmen, perhaps loyal to the government, initiated revenge killings Friday, with residents saying that Alawites were being killed in the streets or at the gates of their homes and that their houses were looted and set on fire.",
      "SOHR also reported that 125 government security forces and 148 militants from Assad-affiliated armed groups were among the dead.",
      "Federico Jachetti,\u00a0Syria country office director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said in a statement Sunday that\u00a0the escalation is \u201ca grim reminder that the situation in the country remains fragile\u201d and cited reports of \u201csummary killings, widespread displacement and thousands more left trapped in their homes.\u201d",
      "\u201cSyrian families across the country are yearning for a respite after long years of uncertainty and fear,\u201d he said, calling on all parties to protect civilians.",
      "Who are the Alawites?",
      "The once-ruling minority is a tight-knit Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. Under Assad, Alawites were appointed to key positions in the military and security forces, positioning them as the elite within Syria\u2019s state bureaucracy and security apparatus.",
      "The rise of HTS, a former Al Qaeda affiliate with an extremist past, raised deep concerns among the Alawite community as it took power.",
      "Sunni dominance has inflicted deep scars on the region, and minorities like the Alawites, as well as Christians, Druze and Yazidis, all have reasons to fear the rise of extremist governance.",
      "Sharaa had tried to quell such fears, telling CNN in December, \u201cNo one has the right to erase another group.\u201d",
      "But the recent surge in violence suggests a different story, challenging Sharaa\u2019s claim that his interim government would protect all groups and foster stability.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, urged\u00a0Syria's leadership to take \u201cswift actions to protect\u00a0Syrians, including by taking all necessary measures to prevent\u00a0any violations and abuses.\u201d",
      "What does this mean for Syria?",
      "Unifying Syria\u2019s diverse ethnic and religious groups has been one of the major challenges of a post-Assad Syria. A significant escalation of violence could threaten the country\u2019s fragile stability and at worst threaten to tip the country back into civil war should the interim government lose control of some areas.",
      "Sharaa has actively sought to rebrand himself as a unifier willing to put down his previous extremist affiliations. For a time, this strategy appeared successful, generating a surge of goodwill and optimism.",
      "In February, a video surfaced showing Sharaa waving from the sunroof of a black vehicle, surrounded by a jubilant crowd during his first visit to Latakia, where he appeared receive a hero\u2019s welcome.",
      "Internationally, the explosion of violence may derail the progress Sharaa has made in reassuring Western leaders that he can ferry in a Syria free of threats."

(Officially, she is registered as a resident of \u00dcberlingen, in Germany, just over the border from Switzerland.)",

    "story": [
      "BEIJING \u2014 As President Donald Trump gave a fiery and divisive speech to a joint session of Congress last week, a much more staid political event was underway on the other side of the world.",
      "The annual gathering of the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s parliament, is tightly choreographed, with all decisions made in advance by the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Security is even tighter than usual around central Beijing and armies of volunteers wearing red armbands are stationed on street corners and at subway stations.",
      "Though there are few surprises and no debate, the weeklong National People\u2019s Congress does offer clues to China\u2019s priorities at home and how it plans to approach the world.",
      "Even as it faces a slowing economy, China appears to be making a strategic decision to present itself as a global stalwart amid a world in turmoil as Trump upends international trade and long-standing alliances, eroding U.S. prestige and creating an opportunity for China to fill the void.",
      "As if to underscore China\u2019s relative steadfastness,\u00a0Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi rarely gestured or moved his hands at his annual news conference on Friday.\u00a0He used the word \u201cstability\u201d at least 14 times during 90 minutes in front of reporters, according to Chinese transcripts.",
      "Some of his sharpest language was directed at the Trump administration, which last week doubled tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% and said there could be more to come.",
      "\u201cNo country should expect to suppress and contain China on one hand while developing good relations with China on the other,\u201d Wang said, slamming what he called a \u201ctwo-faced approach.\u201d",
      "China has long complained about U.S. tariffs, which in the first Trump administration set off a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. But at least outwardly, China doesn\u2019t appear overly concerned about the impact of the new tariffs or in a rush to placate Trump to stave off more.",
      "\u201cNobody worries about it,\u201d tech executive Yao Lijun told NBC News on Wednesday as he walked out of the Great Hall of the People, an ornate building next to Tiananmen Square in Beijing where some 3,000 Chinese leaders and lawmakers were gathered for the NPC.",
      "\u201cWe only focus on ourselves, how we can do much better,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t worry about others.\u201d",
      "China responded to the new tariff on Tuesday by announcing targeted tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, mostly agricultural products, in a measured move similar to the levies it imposed when the first 10% tariff took effect last month.",
      "\u201cAppearing alarmed or alarmist is not something Beijing wants to communicate, because that\u2019s precisely what Trump is trying to elicit,\u201d said Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics and international relations at East China Normal University in Shanghai.",
      "Though Wang avoided saying anything too provocative on Friday, earlier in the week Beijing called back to its more aggressive \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomacy of the past, with the Foreign Ministry saying, \u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end.\u201d",
      "It was the harshest rhetoric from Beijing since Trump returned to office in January.",
      "The message from those comments is clear, said Wang Dong, a professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University in Beijing. China will resolutely defend its national interests, and any U.S. attempt to force it into submission \u201cwill backfire and fail,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cChina will use a \u2018tit for tat\u2019 strategy, meaning if the U.S. shifts to conflict, China will follow suit and retaliate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the U.S. reverts back to cooperation, China will do the same.\u201d",
      "Cooperation did not appear to be on Trump\u2019s mind on Tuesday as he told Congress he would impose reciprocal tariffs on \u201cfriend and foe\u201d starting April 2.",
      "His \u201cAmerica First\u201d speech sent the message that \u201cthe U.S. only cares about its own interests and will pursue them in a relentless and ruthless manner, without caring about international rules or norms,\u201d Wang, the professor, said in written comments.",
      "He noted that Trump had withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, both of which he touted in his address to Congress. Such moves signal the U.S. is no longer interested in upholding the liberal values and rules-based international order it has championed since the end of World War II, Prof. Wang said.",
      "\u201cBy contrast, China\u2019s message is it is willing to work with other stakeholders and the international community to tackle common global challenges such as climate change,\u201d he said.",
      "In keeping with the stability theme, Chinese officials announced the same target for economic growth as last year: 5%. Likewise, China\u2019s 2025 increase in defense spending is staying the same as last year at 7.2%.",
      "Delivering a government work report at the opening session on Wednesday, Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s No. 2 official, did not mention Trump but noted rising unilateralism and protectionism around the world and indicated China would pursue the opposite.",
      "\u201cChina is ready to work with other members of the international community to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world,\u201d he said.",
      "Li acknowledged China\u2019s significant economic challenges, which include a persistent property crisis, high youth unemployment and sluggish consumer spending. And in a nod to U.S. tariffs and other measures, he said, \u201cAn increasingly complex and severe external environment may exert a greater impact on China in areas such as trade, science and technology.\u201d",
      "\u201cRegardless of changes in the external environment, we should remain steadfast in our commitment to opening up,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe will continue to expand our globally oriented network of high-standard free trade areas.\u201d",
      "China is counting on its trade relationships with other countries to help its export-dependent economy withstand Trump\u2019s tariffs, the cost of which U.S. and other experts say will be almost entirely passed on to American consumers and importers.",
      "\u201cTo be frank, with this kind of tariff war, both countries suffer,\u201d said Zhang Weiwei, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai and the director of its China Institute.",
      "\u201cBut the U.S. will suffer more.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Health authorities are calling attention to a looming consequence of the Trump administration\u2019s gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development: the risk of a global surge in tuberculosis cases and deaths.",
      "The World Health Organization warned last week that the sweeping funding cuts could endanger millions of lives, since many countries depend on foreign aid for TB prevention, testing and treatment.",
      "\u201cWithout immediate action, hard-won progress in the fight against TB is at risk,\u201d Dr. Tereza Kasaeva, director of the WHO\u2019s Global Programme on TB and Lung Health, said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Globally, tuberculosis is responsible for the most deaths of any infectious disease. Around 1.25 million people died from the bacterial infection in 2023, the latest data available, and new cases hit an all-time high that year, with around 8.2 million people diagnosed, according to the WHO.",
      "Until recently, USAID provided about a quarter of the international donor funding for tuberculosis services in other countries \u2014 up to $250 million annually, according to the WHO. The agency operated tuberculosis programs in 24 countries.",
      "The WHO said that because of the U.S. funding cuts, drug supply chains in other countries are \u201cbreaking down,\u201d laboratory services are \u201cseverely disrupted\u201d and surveillance systems are \u201ccollapsing,\u201d making it difficult to identify, monitor and treat tuberculosis cases. Some research trials have been halted, as well.",
      "That has incapacitated some national tuberculosis programs, with the WHO warning of devastating impacts in 18 countries with the highest burden of disease, many of which are in Africa.",
      "In Uganda, the rollback of USAID funding has made it hard to pay community health workers, leading to understaffing, said Dr. Luke Davis, a clinical epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health. Such workers play a critical role in notifying people who test positive for tuberculosis, getting them treatment and screening their close contacts for infection.",
      "\u201cPatients may get a diagnosis of TB after they\u2019ve left the clinic because they\u2019re waiting for the results, and they may be at home with TB and not know they have TB. There\u2019s literally not the resources to go out and reach those people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are dying because they have disease that hasn\u2019t been diagnosed, hasn\u2019t been treated, hasn\u2019t been prevented.\u201d",
      "Since Jan. 24, the discontinuation of USAID funding may have led to an estimated 3,600 additional tuberculosis deaths and 6,400 additional infections, according to a project modeling the impact of the cuts. The model is coordinated by the Stop TB Partnership, a United Nations organization that aims to eliminate tuberculosis as a public health problem.",
      "Any increase in the disease\u2019s spread could affect the U.S., since it would allow more people who live or travel abroad to bring the disease in. Already, tuberculosis cases in the U.S. have risen: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded more than 9,600 cases in 2023, a nearly 16% increase from the year prior and a 9% increase over prepandemic levels in 2019.",
      "A persistent outbreak in Kansas has led to 68 active cases since January 2024.",
      "\u201cWhat happens when we travel overseas? I\u2019ve known servicemen and -women who come back with multidrug-resistant TB after a tour of duty. I\u2019ve known of bankers, people from Silicon Valley who work overseas, come back with the disease,\u201d said Dr. Kenneth Castro, a professor of global health at Emory University\u2019s Rollins School of Public Health.",
      "\u201cThe problem with all these infectious diseases is that they know no borders, and neither should our efforts stop at the border,\u201d he said.",
      "A resurgence of tuberculosis in the U.S. from 1985 to 1992 was attributed, in part, to a decline in tuberculosis control programs and rising global cases.",
      "The White House declined to comment.",
      "People with active TB usually develop a bad cough and chest pain. They may cough up blood and mucus and have difficulty breathing. Left untreated, the bacterial infection can damage the lungs and spread to other parts of their body such as the brain, kidneys and spine. It can be fatal for up to two-thirds of people with active cases who aren\u2019t properly treated, according to the WHO.",
      "But treatment is no quick matter: Tuberculosis patients must usually take antibiotics for six months, and stopping in the middle can lead a person to become resistant to the antibiotics, then spread that drug-resistant TB strain to others.",
      "Until the recent cuts, USAID had been instrumental in conducting surveillance to identify new tuberculosis cases, improving supply chains to get medicine to sick patients, and investing in clinical trials for new therapies and diagnostic tests. In communities that lacked radiologists to read X-rays, USAID also funded portable X-ray systems that use artificial intelligence to make diagnoses.",
      "Additionally, the agency helped countries procure drugs at lower costs, in part by funding the Global Drug Facility, a group that negotiates drug prices with suppliers.",
      "Many of those efforts came to a halt when the Trump administration stripped the agency down to bare bones. After firing or furloughing contractors in January, the administration laid off 1,600 staffers, then placed thousands more on administrative leave last month. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that the administration had canceled 83% of USAID programs after a six-week review, and that the remaining programs would be absorbed by the State Department.",
      "In January, Rubio had issued a waiver allowing USAID\u2019s lifesaving humanitarian programs \u2014 including tuberculosis prevention and treatment \u2014 to continue, despite a 90-day freeze on foreign aid. But in a memo to staffers last month, a USAID official said that nearly all of the funding needed to keep those programs going had been terminated.",
      "The official warned of \u201cpreventable death, destabilization, and threats to national security on a massive scale,\u201d then was placed on administrative leave after sending the memo.",
      "The downsizing of USAID has been part of the broader effort to reduce federal spending led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency.

    "story": [
      "Prince Frederik of Luxembourg died on Feb. 28 after years of being diagnosed with a rare mitochondrial disease, according to a statement issued over the weekend by his parents, Prince Robert and Princess Julie. He was 22.",
      "Frederik was born with PolG disease, a genetic mitochondrial disorder that prevents the body\u2019s cells from producing adequate energy, which in turn can cause multiple organ dysfunctions and failures. He was diagnosed with PolG at 14 years old, when his symptoms began showing more clearly, Prince Robert and Princess Julie said in the Saturday statement.",
      "His father remembered him as his \"Superhero.\"",
      "\"Frederik was born with a special capacity for positivity, joy, and determination,\" Robert said. \"When he was little, I would always say that if there is one child of ours that I would never need to worry about, it was him. He has social skills like no other, an amazing sense of humour, an emotional intelligence and compassion that were off the charts, a sense of justice, fairness and decency that knows no bounds.\"",
      "Robert said his son's usual Italian Duolingo and exercise alarm went off on Feb. 28, which was also Rare Disease Day, but it wasn't like any other day. The 22-year-old had been unwell and was barely able to speak for several days.",
      "\"This would be his last in this world,\" Robert said, adding that Frederick found the strength to bid farewell to each of his family members that day.",
      "Frederik had founded The PolG Foundation as a means to help others who suffered with mitochondrial diseases and find a cure, according to Prince Robert. The disease is estimated to affect one in every 500 people, and can be compared to \"having a faulty battery that never fully recharges and is in a constant state of depletion,\" according to the foundation. PolG can also be difficult to diagnose and has no known cure.",
      "Frederick participated in medical trials and donated his DNA to assist doctors with their research on the disease.",
      "\"This is the battle that Frederik fought, and this is the burden that he had to carry throughout his life. He always did so with grace and with humour,\" Robert said.",
      "Even after Frederick's passing, Robert said \"his mission is not complete,\" adding that the young prince and his foundation will continue to work to find a cure for PolG.",
      "\"I cite him as being here in the present because I know that, though physically absent, he is still here, inspiring us and pushing us forward,\" Robert said.",
      "Prince Robert recalled the final conversation he had with son.",
      "\u201cFrederik\u2019s last question to me, prior to his other remarks was: 'Papa, are you proud of me?' He had barely been able to speak for several days, so the clarity of these words was as surprising as the weight of the moment was profound,\" Robert wrote.",
      "\"The answer was very easy, and he had heard it oh so many times\u2026. but at this time, he needed reassurance that he had contributed all that he possibly could in his short and beautiful existence and that he could now finally move on,\u201d he said.\u2063"

    "story": [
      "The wave of violence that has killed hundreds of civilians across Syria reached the major cities of Damascus and Aleppo on Monday, hours after interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa vowed to bring those responsible to justice.",
      "The reported fighting in the capital, Damascus, and the second city of Aleppo marked the first such clashes there since the fall of the regime of Bashar al-Assad. The short-lived violence in the capital followed days of clashes concentrated in former Assad strongholds along Syria's Mediterranean coast.",
      "More than 1,300 people were killed in Syria in the three days to late Sunday, with civilians comprising 973 of the dead, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said in a statement. The death toll as of early Monday was not immediately clear.",
      "\"We must acknowledge the truth that the fallen regime left deep wounds during its rule,\" Sharaa said in a speech late Sunday in which he called for peace and vowed to hold to account those responsible amid reports of executions and firing squads.",
      "\"Syria, with all its components, will remain united by the determination of its people,\" he said, adding that he had formed \u201ca fact-finding committee to investigate the events in the coastal region, to bring the perpetrators to justice, and to reveal the truths to the Syrian people, so that everyone knows who is responsible.\u201d",
      "As of late Sunday, most of the fighting was concentrated in the coastal areas of Latakia, where at least 545 civilians were reported to have been killed, and Tartus, where at least 252 civilians were killed, according to SOHR. Both areas are home to Syria's Alawite community, the small Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs, and have been a focus of security concerns amid Sharaa's rise to power.",
      "According to the SOHR, the vast majority of civilians killed in the outbreak of violence over the past few days have been Alawites. NBC News has not been able to independently verify this or the broader casualty figures.",
      "By Monday, Syrian state radio channel SHAM FM reported intense clashes between security forces and former regime members in the affluent Mazzeh neighborhood of Damascus that homes embassies, hotels and government departments. The Al-Watan newspaper said security forces had repelled an attack by unknown assailants on a checkpoint.",
      "While NBC News was not immediately able to independently confirm the clashes, they would represent the first fighting in the capital since Assad was swept from power in December.",
      "Meanwhile, Syrian Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Hassan Abdul-Ghani told Syrian state news agency SANA that military units had repelled an attack and \"inflicted losses\" in Aleppo on the Syrian Democratic Forces\u00a0\u2014 the U.S.-allied Kurdish-led force that he said had launched the attack.",
      "In a later statement Monday Abdul-Ghani said security forces had been able to \"absorb the attacks of the remnants of the fallen regime and its officers\" from a number of areas, including within Latakia and Tartus. \"This has resulted in thwarting threats and securing the region,\" he said.",
      "He added that new plans had been developed to eliminate future threats, though he did not elaborate.",
      "The violence of recent days marked a grim turn of events, Ahmed Bayram of the Norwegian Refugee Council charity said in a phone interview Monday morning.",
      "\"It's worrying,\" Bayram said. \"The scale of what's happening has not been seen even during the battles to oust the last government.\"",
      "The outbreak of violence raises the question of whether Sharaa can deliver on his promise to lead a more unified and inclusive nation representative of the country's myriad religious and ethnic groups. The recent clashes may even undermine his progress in reassuring Western leaders that his vision for Syria poses no threat to the Syrian people.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u00a0on Sunday condemned the violence, saying in a statement that \u201cthe United States stands by the religious and ethnic minorities in Syria\u201d as he called on the country\u2019s interim leadership to \u201chold accountable the perpetrators of these massacres against the country\u2019s minorities.\u201d",
      "For many Syrians, the fighting will be an unpleasant reminder of the violence they hoped had ended with the rule of Assad.",
      "Bayram said there was a risk that the eruption could hinder efforts to administer humanitarian aid across the country.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want this to drag on,\" he said, \"and you don\u2019t want to go back to cycles of violence, death and destruction and displacement.\""

      "Francis followed the opening of the retreat by videoconference Sunday: He could see and hear the Rev. Roberto Pasolini, preacher of the papal household, but the priests, bishops and cardinals in the Vatican auditorium couldn\u2019t see or hear him.",
      "Pasolini delivered a meditation on \u201cThe hope of eternal life,\u201d a theme that was chosen well before Francis was admitted to Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital Feb. 14 with a complex lung infection.",

      "In its early update Monday, the Vatican said Francis was resting after a quiet night.",
      "At the time of his hospitalization last month, the 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, had what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future.",
      "He has now remained in stable condition for over a week, with no fever or respiratory crises and good oxygen levels in his blood for several days, doctors reported.",
      "The doctors said that such stability was in itself a positive thing and showed he was responding well to therapy. But they kept his prognosis as \u201cguarded,\u201d meaning that he\u2019s not out of danger. Doctors were expected to provide a medical update later Monday.",
      "On Thursday, the Vatican will mark the 12th anniversary of Francis\u2019 election, the first with the pope out of sight but still very much in charge. Francis was elected the 266th pope, the first Jesuit pope and first from Latin America, on March 13, 2013, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI.",
      "On Sunday, Francis met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin and the chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, for the third time at the hospital. Such meetings are the routine way the pope governs, and show that Francis is still keeping up with essential business.",
      "While Francis has previously praised Benedict for his courage and humility in resigning, he has indicated more recently that he believes the job of pope is for life and said as recently as last year that he had no plans to step down.",
      "Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night."

      "On the night of March 10, 1945, hundreds of B-29s raided Tokyo, dumping cluster bombs with napalm specially designed with sticky oil to destroy traditional Japanese-style wood and paper homes in the crowded \u201cshitamachi\u201d downtown neighborhoods.",
      "Takeuchi and her parents had lost their own home in an earlier firebombing in February and were taking shelter at a relative\u2019s riverside home. Her father insisted on crossing the river in the opposite direction from where the crowds were headed, a decision that saved the family. Takeuchi remembers walking through the night beneath a red sky. Orange sunsets and sirens still make her uncomfortable.",
      "By the next morning, everything had burned. Two blackened figures caught her eyes. Taking a closer look, she realized one was a woman and what looked like a lump of coal at her side was her baby. \u201cI was terribly shocked. ... I felt sorry for them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after seeing so many others I was emotionless in the end.\u201d",
      "Many of those who didn\u2019t burn to death quickly jumped into the Sumida River and were crushed or drowned.",
      "More than 105,000 people were estimated to have died that night. A million others became homeless. The death toll exceeds those killed in the Aug. 9, 1945, atomic bombing of Nagasaki.",
      "But the Tokyo firebombing has been largely eclipsed by the two atomic bombings. And firebombings on dozens of other Japanese cities have received even less attention.",
      "The bombing came after the collapse of Japanese air and naval defenses following the U.S. capture of a string of former Japanese strongholds in the Pacific that allowed B-29 Superfortress bombers to easily hit Japan\u2019s main islands. There was growing frustration in the United States at the length of the war and past Japanese military atrocities.",
      "Ai Saotome has a house full of notes, photos and other material her father left behind when he died at age 90 in 2022. Her father, Katsumoto Saotome, was an award-winning writer and a Tokyo firebombing survivor. He gathered accounts of his peers to raise awareness of the civilian deaths and the importance of peace.",
      "Saotome says the sense of urgency that her father and other survivors felt is not shared among younger generations.",
      "Though her father published books on the Tokyo firebombing and its victims, going through his raw material gave her new perspectives and an awareness of Japan\u2019s aggression during the war.",
      "She is digitalizing the material at the Center of the Tokyo Raids and War Damage, a museum her father opened in 2002 after collecting records and artifacts about the attack.",
      "\u201cOur generation doesn\u2019t know much about (the survivors\u2019) experience, but at least we can hear their stories and record their voices,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the responsibility of our generation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn about 10 years, when we have a world where nobody remembers anything (about this), I hope these documents and records can help,\u201d Saotome said.",
      "Postwar governments have provided 60 trillion yen ($405 billion) in welfare support for military veterans and bereaved families, and medical support for survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.",
      "Civilian victims of the U.S. firebombings received nothing.",
      "A group of survivors who want government recognition of their suffering and financial help met earlier this month, renewing their demands.",
      "No government agency handles civilian survivors or keeps their records. Japanese courts rejected their compensation demands of 11 million yen ($74,300) each, saying citizens were supposed to endure suffering in emergencies like war. A group of lawmakers in 2020 compiled a draft proposal of a half million-yen ($3,380 ) one-time payment, but the plan has stalled due to opposition from some ruling party members.",
      "\u201cThis year will be our last chance,\u201d Yumi Yoshida, who lost her parents and sister in the bombing, said at a meeting, referring to the 80th anniversary of Japan\u2019s WWII defeat."

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea Monday, South Korea\u2019s military said, hours after South Korean and U.S. troops kicked off their large annual combined drills, which the North views as an invasion rehearsal.",
      "South Korea\u2019s joint chiefs of staff said the missile firings, North Korea\u2019s fifth missile launch event this year, were detected from the North\u2019s Hwanghae province but gave no further details such as how far they flew. It said South Korea bolstered its surveillance posture and is closely coordinating with the United States.",
      "Earlier Monday, the South Korean and U.S. militaries began their annual joint military exercises, which are scheduled to last 11 days. The Freedom Shield command post exercise began after the South Korean and U.S. militaries paused live-fire training while Seoul investigates how two of its fighter jets mistakenly bombed a civilian area during a warm-up drill last week.",
      "The drill's start drew the condemnation of nuclear-armed North Korea, which issued a government statement calling the exercises a \u201cdangerous provocative act\u201d that increases the risks of military conflict.",
      "About 30 people were injured, two of them seriously, when two South Korean KF-16 fighter jets mistakenly fired eight MK-82 bombs on a civilian area in Pocheon, a town near the North Korean border, on Thursday. The bombing occurred while South Korean and U.S. forces were engaging in a live-fire drill ahead of the larger Freedom Shield exercise.",
      "In a background briefing to domestic reporters Monday, the South Korean air force repeated its initial assessment last week that one of the KF-16 pilots had entered the wrong coordinates for a bombing site.",
      "The unidentified pilot didn\u2019t recognize the error during a pre-takeoff check and, rushing to meet scheduled timing, failed to visually verify the target before proceeding with the bombing. The second pilot had the correct coordinates but focused only on maintaining formation with the other aircraft and dropped the bombs following the first pilot\u2019s instructions, failing to recognize they deviated from the right target, according to the content of the briefing provided to The Associated Press.",
      "Gen. Lee Youngsu, chief of staff of the South Korean air force, bowed and apologized Monday over the injuries and property damage caused by the incident, which he said \u201cshould have never happened and must never happen again.\u201d",
      "Both the South Korean and U.S. militaries have halted all live-fire exercises in South Korea following the mishap. South Korean military officials say live-fire training will resume after they complete the ongoing investigation on the bombing and formulate preventative steps.",
      "The Freedom Shield exercise marks the first large-scale joint exercise since President Donald Trump began his second term. It comes amid growing tensions with North Korea over its nuclear ambitions and its alignment with Russia in President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine.",
      "Trump, who met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times during his first term, has expressed his willingness to reach out to Kim again to revive diplomacy, which collapsed due to disagreements over exchanging U.S.-led sanctions against the North and the North\u2019s denuclearization steps. But Pyongyang has yet to respond to his overture and has continued its fiery rhetoric against Washington and Seoul over their joint military exercises, which Kim portrays as rehearsals for invasion.",
      "In a statement issued through state media Monday, the North Korean Foreign Ministry called the Freedom Shield exercise an \u201caggressive and confrontational war rehearsal\u201d that risks triggering \u201cphysical conflict\u201d on the Korean Peninsula.",
      "The ministry reiterated Kim\u2019s state goals for a \u201cradical growth\u201d of his nuclear force to counter what he claims are growing threats posed by the U.S. and its Asian allies."

    "story": [
      "TORONTO \u2014 Former central banker\u00a0Mark Carney\u00a0will become Canada\u2019s next prime minister after the governing Liberal Party elected him its leader Sunday as the country deals with U.S. President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s trade war\u00a0and annexation threat, and a federal election looms.",
      "Carney, 59, replaces\u00a0Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until his successor is sworn in in the coming days. Carney won in a landslide, winning 85.9% of the vote.",
      "Carney navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.",
      "The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war and his talk of making Canada the\u00a051st U.S. state have\u00a0infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.",
      "The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party\u2019s chances in a parliamentary election expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving steadily in opinion polls.\u201cWe have made this the greatest country in the world and now our neighbors want to take us. No way,\u201d Carney said.",
      "After decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada\u2019s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.",
      "Carney has picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister, but he lacks political experience.",
      "The other top Liberal leadership candidate was former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. Trudeau told Freeland in December that he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.",
      "Carney is expected to trigger an election shortly afterward. Either the new Liberal party leader will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month."
