      "June Lockhart, beloved for her roles in \u201cLassie\u201d and \u201cLost In Space,\u201d has died at 100",
      "LOS ANGELES -- June Lockhart, who became a mother figure for a generation of television viewers whether at home in \u201cLassie\u201d or up in the stratosphere in \u201cLost In Space,\u201d has died. She was 100.",
      "Lockhart died Thursday of natural causes at her home in Santa Monica, family spokesman Lyle Gregory, a friend of 40 years, said Saturday.",
      "\u201cShe was very happy up until the very end, reading the New York Times and LA Times everyday,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day.\u201d",
      "The daughter of prolific character actor Gene Lockhart, Lockhart was cast frequently in ingenue roles as a young film actor. Television made her a star.",
      "From 1958 to 1964, she portrayed Ruth Martin, who raised the orphaned Timmy (Jon Provost), in the popular CBS series \u201cLassie.\u201d From 1965 to 1968, she traveled aboard the spaceship Jupiter II as mother to the Robinson family in the campy CBS adventure \u201cLost in Space.\u201d",
      "Her portrayals of warm, compassionate mothers endeared her to young viewers, and decades later baby boomers flocked to nostalgia conventions to meet Lockhart and buy her autographed photos.",
      "Offscreen, Lockhart insisted, she was nothing like the women she portrayed.",
      "\u201cI must quote Dan Rather,\u201d she said in a 1994 interview. \u201cI can control my reputation, but not my image, because my image is how you see me.",
      "\u201cI love rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and going to the concerts. I have driven Army tanks and flown in hot air balloons. And I go plane-gliding \u2014 the ones with no motors. I do a lot of things that don\u2019t go with my image.\u201d",
      "Early in her career, Lockhart appeared in numerous films. Among them: \u201cAll This and Heaven Too,\u201d \u201cAdam Had Four Sons,\u201d \u201cSergeant York,\u201d \u201cMiss Annie Rooney,\u201d \u201cForever and a Day\u201d and \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis.\u201d",
      "She also made \u201cSon of Lassie,\u201d the 1945 sequel to \u201cLassie, Come Home,\u201d playing the grown-up version of the role created by Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "When her movie career as an adult faltered, Lockhart shifted to television, appearing in live drama from New York and game and talk shows. She was the third actress to play the female lead in \u201cLassie\u201d on TV, following Jan Clayton and Cloris Leachman. (Provost had replaced the show\u2019s original child star, Tommy Rettig, in 1957.)",
      "Lockhart spoke frankly about her canine co-star. In the first place, she said in 1989, Lassie was a laddie, because male collies \u201care bigger, the ruff is bigger, they\u2019re more imposing looking.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cI worked with four Lassies. There was only one main Lassie at a time. Then there was a dog that did the running, a dog that did the fighting, and a dog that was a stand-in, because only humans can work 14 hours a day without needing a nap.",
      "\u201cLassie was not especially friendly with anybody. Lassie was wholly concentrated on the trainers.\u201d",
      "After six years in the rural setting of \u201cLassie,\u201d Lockhart moved to outer space, embarking on the role of Maureen Robinson, the wise, reassuring mother of a family that departs on a five-year flight to a faraway planet in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d",

Throughout the three-year run, Mrs. Robinson offered consolation and a slice of her \u201cspace pie.\u201d",
      "As with \u201cLassie,\u201d Lockhart enjoyed working on \u201cLost in Space\u201d: \u201cIt was like going to work at Disneyland every day.\u201d",
      "In 1968, Lockhart joined the cast of \u201cPetticoat Junction\u201d for the rural comedy\u2019s last two seasons, playing Dr. Janet Craig. The original star, Bea Benaderet, had been diagnosed with cancer and died, also in 1968.",
      "Lockhart remained active long after \u201cLost in Space,\u201d appearing often in episodic television as well as in recurring roles in the daytime soap opera \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d and nighttime soaps, \u201cKnots Landing\u201d and \u201cThe Colbys.\u201d Her film credits included \u201cThe Remake\u201d and the animated \u201cBongee Bear and the Kingdom of Rhythm,\u201d for which she provided the voice for Mindy the Owl.",
      "She also used her own media pass to attend presidential news conferences, narrated beauty pageants and holiday parades, appeared in B pictures and toured in the plays \u201cSteel Magnolias,\u201d \u201cBedroom Farce\u201d and \u201cOnce More with Feeling.\u201d",
      "\u201cHer true passion was journalism,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cShe loved going to the White House briefing rooms.\u201d",
      "Lockhart liked to tell the story of how her parents met, saying they were hired separately for a touring production sponsored by inventor Thomas A. Edison and decided on marriage during a stop at Lake Louise, Alberta.",
      "Their daughter was born June 25, 1925, in New York City. The family moved to Hollywood 10 years later, and Gene Lockhart worked steadily as a character actor, usually in avuncular roles, sometimes as a villain. His wife, Kathleen, often appeared with him.",
      "Young June made her stage debut at 8, dancing in a children\u2019s ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House. Her first film appearance was a small role in the 1938 \u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d playing the daughter of Bob Cratchit and his wife, who were played by her parents.",
      "She was married and divorced twice: to John Maloney, a physician, father of her daughters Anne Kathleen and June Elizabeth; and architect John C. Lindsay.",
      "Throughout her later career, Lockhart was connected in the public mind with \u201cLassie.\u201d",
      "Even though she sometimes mocked the show, she conceded: \u201cHow wonderful that in a career there is one role for which you are known. Many actors work all their lives and never have one part that is really theirs.\u201d",

      "Savvopoulos had died of a heart attack after battling cancer since 2020.",
      "Thousands came to pay their respects to a well-beloved, if sometimes controversial, artist as he lay in state at a chapel of the Athens Metropolitan Cathedral Saturday morning. Hundreds made the nearly 2-kilometer (1.2-mile) walk behind the hearse to the cemetery.",
      "The presence of a Greek navy band playing mournful music was indicative of the change in Savvopoulos\u2019s status, from someone lionized by anarchist-leaning leftists in the 1960s and 1970s and dismissed by the establishment as a long-haired freak, to a figure embraced by the same establishment and cultural mainstream.",

Always a political animal, he didn't shy away from criticizing the left and its illusions, especially on his 1989 album \u201cThe Haircut,\u201d whose sleeve showed him beardless with long locks. A few of his songs drew the enmity of some of his longtime admirers. The beard grew back but his politics remained moderate.",
      "Conservative Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the first of many who eulogized Savvopoulos during the funeral service, used the lyrics of the 1972 song \u201cMessenger Angel\" to portray the artist as a speaker of uncomfortable truths that many did not want to hear. \u201cIf he had no pleasant news to tell/better tell us none,\u201d he quoted the song's ending.",
      "Others who joined in eulogizing Savvopoulos were former President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, fellow musicians, artists and literary figures, some from his hometown of Thessaloniki, and one of his two grandsons.",

But in doing so, I think they took a great record and made it better. And, you know, I called Robbie Williams. He was the first call I made. He said yes, which made it easier for me to call number two, three, four, seven, eight, nine, 10. Because at first, it\u2019s daunting.

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Samara Joy\u2019s voice has the ability to transform listeners to the early jazz clubs, filling them with warm nostalgia for legends like Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan.",
      "At 25, Joy is a five-time Grammy winning recording artist, whose album, \u201cLinger Awhile\u201d won her best new artist and best jazz vocal album in 2023. She\u2019s been praised by artists like Chaka Khan, Regina King and Quincy Jones and has amassed a large following of her Gen-Z peers on TikTok, introducing a new generation to jazz.",
      "Last year, Joy released \u201cPortrait,\u201d her third and most personal studio album allowing listeners into the tension between excitement and feeling overwhelmed that often follows a whirlwind of accolades and success. Her first original song \u201cPeace of Mind\u201d fully captures this moment.",
      "\u201cI wrote it in a time where I was really questioning whether I could continue or not because I was so exhausted,\u201d said Joy. \u201cI reminded myself through that Sun Ra composition that I have experienced something wonderful, and it doesn\u2019t have to be the end all be all. This is just the beginning \u2026 this is just a springboard for all of the other creative ideas that I have and what I feel like I have to offer.\u201d",

And this album, \u201cPortrait,\u201d was the first time I felt like I took the reins of creative direction and band mates and songs.

I\u2019m really thankful to everybody who believed in me enough to allow me to have that moment, who voted, who listened to my music, who support me then and still support me now. Which is why I never want to lose sight of what I do this for.",
      "JOY: A couple years ago I did the Hollywood Bowl and it was a birthday celebration for Quincy Jones \u2014 Patty Austin, I got the chance to sing alongside of her. And backstage, you know, she was funny and sharp and quick, but she was just very supportive and very honest. And that meant a lot to me from somebody who has been in the industry for as long as she has and collaborated with Quincy Jones and George Benson and James Ingram and all these people to be so encouraging on this new journey as I kind of embark on it.\u201d",
      "JOY: I guess I never thought about it that way. There are so many wonderful artists that I draw inspiration from \u2014 Billy Strayhorn, Duke Ellington through the course of their lives contributed to the changing to the evolution of the music that we call jazz. I know that there\u2019s always gonna be a certain sense of nostalgia and a certain artist or song that people can connect to or relate to easily because jazz is not mainstream, at least to me, I don\u2019t think unless it is really, really, really, really watered down, I don\u2019t think it will be.",
      "But it\u2019s an opportunity for me to once again be authentic and show people like, \u201cHave you ever heard of this Abby Lincoln song?\u201d Or maybe this Thelonious Monk song doesn\u2019t have lyrics, but I can put lyrics to them and share a different, you know, a different compositional style. And a different voice in jazz. And so I guess that\u2019s my way of reclaiming it and educating in a way and just introducing people to the sound that they may not recognize at first, but good music is good music.",
      "JOY: I feel very honored and sometimes undeserving because of how new my relationship to their music was initially. I hadn\u2019t really listened to their music or their voices at all growing up and getting introduced to them in college, it just felt like another world had opened up and I felt like I wanna sing, I wanna be able to move people the way that they move me with their voices.",

      "Jodi Picoult faces bans on both her books and a musical based on her novel \u201cBetween the Lines.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Author Jodi Picoult has the dubious honor of being banned in two mediums this fall \u2014 her books and now a musical based on her novel \u201cBetween the Lines.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the first author who has now had censorship occur in two different types of media,\u201d Picoult says. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not out here to be salacious. I am writing the world as it is, and I am honestly just trying to write about difficult issues that people have a hard time talking about because that is what fiction and the arts do.\u201d",
      "The superintendent of Mississinewa High School in Gas City, Indiana, canceled a production last week of \u201cBetween the Lines,\u201d saying concerns were raised over \u201csexual innuendo\u201d and alcohol references in the musical. Jeremy Fewell, the superintendent, did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s devastating for us to know that these kids who put in hundreds of hours of hard work had that torn away from them because of the objections of a single parent,\u201d says Picoult.",
      "\u201cWhat I know, perhaps better than most people, as someone whose books have been banned, is when one parent starts deciding what is appropriate and what is inappropriate for the children of other parents, we have a big problem.\u201d",
      "Picoult noted that the same Indiana high school has previously produced \u201cGrease,\u201d where the sexual innuendo and alcohol abuse is much greater, including a pregnancy scare, sex-mad teens and the line \u201cDid she put up a fight?\u201d",
      "\u201cBetween the Lines\u201d centers on Delilah, an outsider in a new high school, who finds solace in a book and realizes she has the power to write her own story and narrate her own life. \u201cIt is a very benign message. And it\u2019s actually a really important one for adolescents today,\u201d says Picoult.",
      "The original work, which features a nonbinary character, had already been edited with licensed changes to make it more palatable for a conservative audience, including removing any reference to the nonbinary character's gender orientation.",
      "The production was scheduled for Halloween weekend at the Gas City Performing Arts Center. The show has music and lyrics by Elyssa Samsel and Kate Anderson, and a story by Timothy Allen McDonald, based on the 2012 novel by Picoult and her daughter, Samantha van Leer. It played off-Broadway in 2022.",

      "The uptick in book banning has spread to stages as well.

      "Yorgos Lanthimos' movies are farces, fables and experiments that reside in surreal worlds of their own",
      "The twisted filmography of Yorgos Lanthimos has by now trained us to expect darkly comic visions of contemporary life, both savage and mundane. His movies have perhaps inspired the most \u201cWhat?!\u201d reactions of the last decade, partly because they\u2019ve tried so hard to do so.",
      "His movies \u2014 farces, fables, experiments \u2014 reside in surreal worlds of their own. But his latest, \u201cBugonia,\u201d is thrillingly, if tragically, tied to our reality. It might even be his best film. Though I\u2019ve been apprehensive about the flamboyant severity of Lanthimos\u2019 movies, I found \u201cBugonia,\u201d a chamber-piece gut punch, hard to shake. For starters, it\u2019s difficult to resist any movie with a line in it like: \u201cThere\u2019s Andromedan code all over your Instagram.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s one of the things that Teddy (Jesse Plemons), an incel eco-terrorist, says to Michelle (Emma Stone) after kidnapping her with his neurodivergent cousin Donny (newcomer Aidan Delbis) and tying her up in their basement. Teddy and Donny live together in fairly remote, rundown old house. There, Teddy tends to both his bees and to unhinged conspiracy theories.",
      "But as Plemons so deftly plays him, Teddy doesn\u2019t seem like a lunatic. He might reach wildly insane conclusions, such as that Michelle, a pharmaceutical company chief executive, is an alien. But he\u2019s thoughtful in nature and sweetly cares for his cousin. It\u2019s a feat of Plemons\u2019 innate good nature that we kind of like Teddy, even as he shaves Michelle\u2019s head, to prevent \u201cit,\u201d as he calls her, from contacting the mothership.",
      "The opening moments of the script by Will Tracy (\u201cThe Menu,\u201d episodes of \u201cSuccession\u201d) cast these demented shenanigans in an apocalyptic light. The fate of bees is much on Teddy\u2019s mind; colony collapse disorder, often caused by pesticides, is one of his talking points. It\u2019s a phenomenon that, in \u201cBugonia\u201d \u2014 a movie reckoning with, or maybe just lamenting, humanity\u2019s fate \u2014 isn\u2019t just for the bees.",
      "While Stone\u2019s abilities alone might legitimize extraterrestrial suspicions, there\u2019s more to why Teddy has pinpointed Michelle. She\u2019s a lauded corporate leader; her office includes a framed Time magazine with her on the cover and a photograph with Michelle Obama. Her company, Auxolith, operates out of a sleek office building where Michelle presides over her workforce like a queen bee. She has the corporate lingo of \u201ctransparency\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d down pat, but whether she actually adheres to any of those ideals is dubious, at best. Before Teddy and Donny jump her, she announces a \u201cnew era\u201d at Auxolith where employees leave at 5:30 p.m. But not if they haven\u2019t met their quota, she adds. And not if they\u2019re, you know, busy.",
      "In that way, Michelle is a camera-ready cover for whatever Auxolith is up to, which, as the movie goes along, teases out a poisonous history, including opioid manufacturing that affected Teddy\u2019s mother (Alicia Silverstone).",

It\u2019s a conversation, laced with contemporary divides, that is comical for its impossibility. One is addled by paranoia and extremism, the other knows only heartless corporate speak. Understanding each other is futile. Watching Stone, as Michelle, attempt to reason with Teddy is part of the movie\u2019s dark fun, just as is seeing Plemons\u2019 Teddy resolutely stick to his certainty that Michelle is part of an alien infiltration of Earth that he wants gone by the next lunar eclipse.",
      "The source of such a wild narrative can only come, of course, from South Korea. \u201cBugonia\u201d is loosely based on the 2003 Korean film \u201cSave the Green Planet!\u201d All of Lanthimos\u2019 most notable films before have been written with either Efthimis Filippou (\u201cDogtooth,\u201d \u201cThe Lobster\u201d) or Tony McNamara (\u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cThe Favourite\u201d). But, otherwise, \u201cBugonia\u201d has the feel of a quick follow-up to last year\u2019s \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d a black-comedy triptych also led by Stone and Plemons.",

      "The movie drags in the middle, when it\u2019s locked in a prisoner drama that grows a little tiresome and predictable. But the payoff is immense. Teddy calls his torture chamber \u201cthe headquarters of the human resistance.\u201d By the time \u201cBugonia\u201d reaches its unforgettable finale, it's made chillingly clear just how feeble any such movement might be, and the movie's apocalyptic air of resignation, of fait accompli, sounds a chastening death knell.",

      "Goodell addressed the Bad Bunny controversy at his news conference following the annual fall owners meeting.

      "The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Super Bowl on Feb. 8 at Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It is unclear if Trump plans to be there, though he has made appearing in person at major sporting events a significant part of his second term in the White House.",

During that time, Copeland has been raising a son, Jackson, with her husband. The 3-year-old came onstage to hug his mother during curtain calls, wearing a tuxedo.",
      "Copeland has also been continuing her career as an author \u2014 the second volume of her \u201cBunheads\u201d series appeared in September \u2014 and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including \u201cBe Bold,\u201d an afterschool program designed for young children of color.",
      "But she decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage \u2014 including as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet and her personal favorite. Copeland's Romeo in the balcony pas de deux was Calvin Royal III, who in 2020 became ABT's first Black male principal dancer in two decades.",
      "The duo later reappeared for another duet, this time a modern one, in \u201cWrecka Stow,\u201d by Kyle Abraham. For Copeland's final performance of the night, she performed Twyla Tharp's \u201cSinatra Suite\u201d with another of her favorite partners, Herman Cornejo.",
      "The night, which also celebrated ABT's 85th anniversary and was curated in large part by Copeland herself, included speeches and film clips about her career. And her fellow dancers performed excerpts of ballets in her honor. At the end, a beaming Copeland was given a quintessential ballet farewell, as colleagues, teachers, friends and family came out to greet her, one by one, with hugs and bouquets while glittery confetti poured from the rafters.",
      "Though Copeland has not closed the door on dancing altogether, it\u2019s clear an era is ending.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d she told The Associated Press in an interview in June, when she announced her retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.\u201d",

After a stint in the junior company, Copeland joined ABT as a member of the corps de ballet in April 2001, becoming a soloist six years later.",
      "In June 2015, Copeland was promoted to principal dancer.

      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 A major German private art collection accumulated over four generations is going on large-scale show for the first time in Berlin, with a who's who of French art of the 19th and 20th centuries at its core.",
      "The Scharf Collection has its roots in a collection started more than a century ago by Otto Gerstenberg, who led a Berlin life insurance company. It's now in the hands of Gerstenberg's great-grandson, Ren\u00e9 Scharf, and his wife, Christiane, who have expanded it further into contemporary art.",
      "The roughly 150 works going on show this week at Berlin's Alte Nationalgalerie range in time from the early 19th century, with plates from Spanish master Francisco de Goya's series \u201cThe Disasters of War\u201d and \u201cLa Tauromaquia,\u201d to modern abstract works by German artists Katharina Grosse and Anselm Reyle. Compositions by Sam Francis and Jasper Johns bring an American element to the collection.",
      "\u201cWe go from Goya to Grosse,\u201d Ren\u00e9 Scharf said as the exhibition was presented Wednesday. He said that he has a particular passion for impressionism, cubism and contemporary art, and hopes visitors who see Grosse's shimmering pink and blue \u201cNo title\u201d at the end of the show will see a connection to Claude Monet's impressionist \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d from nearly a century earlier.",
      "At the heart of the collection are works by many of the biggest names in French art of the past two centuries. Visitors progress from the romantic paintings of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix to the realist work of Gustave Courbet and the caricatures of Honor\u00e9 Daumier, including a series of busts of French lawmakers by the latter.",
      "One of Claude Monet's earlier, realist works, \u201cFarmyard in Chailly,\" is displayed alongside later impressionist paintings such as \u201cSteep Cliffs near Dieppe\u201d and one of his \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d series. There are works on paper and canvas by Auguste Renoir and Paul C\u00e9zanne, complemented by nudes and dancers by Edgar Degas.",
      "Two of Pierre Bonnard's major works are prominently displayed \u2014 the lively and playful \u201cPlace Clichy,\u201d depicting a Paris square close to his studio, and \u201cThe Large Bathtub,\u201d portraying the artist's wife. They're shown close to pieces by his close friend Henri Matisse as the exhibition heads toward the cubism and the modern day with work from Pablo Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger and others.",

There are lithographs from his \u201cElles\u201d series, based on his observations of sex workers in everyday poses, and posters advertising stars of concert cafes and variety theaters.",
      "Scharf said that, after the Alte Nationalgalerie approached him about showing the collection, \u201cwe asked ourselves what happens if we do nothing? Then maybe 30, 40 or 50 people per year will see the collection and only a very small part of it, because we can't hang everything at home.\u201d",

      "PFAS \u2014 or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances \u2014 resist breaking down and as a result have found their way into drinking water, soil, air and the bloodstreams of 99% of Americans.",
      "This is certainly true for people who live or work near a plume of contamination that has seeped beyond the boundaries of Cannon Air Force Base, where PFAS-laden firefighting foam was used for years.",
      "New Mexico health and environmental officials conducted a $1.2 million testing project, drawing blood from nearly 630 people. They shared the results Thursday night during a public meeting.",
      "The research shows 99.7% of participants had one or more PFAS in their blood, with the most common being associated with firefighting foams.",
      "While the percentage isn't surprising given the overall prevalence of so-called forever chemicals in the environment, officials said some residents living in the plume area showed dramatically higher concentrations than the broader testing group. About one-quarter of them had levels reaching the highest concentration tier used in national guidelines.",
      "The findings suggest a correlation with groundwater contamination migrating from the base, state officials said.",
      "New Mexico Environment Secretary James Kenney said during the meeting that his agency will help the community in any way that it can but that the state is still locked in litigation with the U.S. Defense Department over the damage caused by the contamination.",
      "At Cannon Air Force Base, state officials have reported that PFAS has been detected in groundwater at concentrations of 26,200 parts per trillion, exceeding state and federal drinking water standards by over 650,000%.",
      "Cannon reported earlier this year that it has spent more than $73 million so far on investigating the problem and installing pilot projects to treat contaminated groundwater.",

      "Watchdog groups that track PFAS nationwide say contamination is more widespread than previously thought. They're using data released by the EPA and states to compile maps showing spots across the country where drinking water systems report levels above what's recommended. Contamination has also been confirmed at hundreds of military bases around the country.",

      "It also comes during a moment of uncertainty for Affordable Care Act enrollees, with Congress deadlocked on how to handle expiring subsidies that have made marketplace health insurance less expensive for millions since 2021.

      "It\u2019s a problem that climate change, caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline and coal, is worsening.

Heat leaves your body through your skin, so when the belly gets larger, the heat has farther to travel to escape.",
      "As pregnancy progresses, the body burns more calories, creating internal heat. The heart has to work harder, which can already be strained by extreme heat. And people who are pregnant also need more liquid to stay hydrated, so they might get dehydrated more easily, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",

      "As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House \u2014 not for urgent talks on how to end it, but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House on Tuesday \u2014 not for urgent talks on how to end it, but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands.",
      "Senate Democrats, too, are confident in their strategy to keep voting against a House-passed bill that would reopen the government until Republicans, including Trump, engage them on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.",
      "With both sides showing no signs of movement, it\u2019s unclear how long the stalemate will last \u2014 even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers will miss another paycheck in the coming days and states are sounding warnings that key federal programs will soon lapse completely. And the meeting at the White House appears unlikely, for now, to lead to a bipartisan resolution as Senate Republicans are dug in and Trump has followed their lead.",
      "\u201cI think the president\u2019s ready to get involved on having the discussion\u201d about extending the subsidies, said Senate Republican leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Monday. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they are prepared to do that until (Democrats) open up the government.\u201d",
      "While Capitol Hill remains at a standstill, the effects of the shutdown are worsening. Federal workers are set to miss additional paychecks amid total uncertainty about when they might eventually get paid. Government services like the  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, and Head Start preschool programs that serve needy families are facing potential cutoffs in funding. On Monday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is furloughing 1,400 federal workers. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages and flight delays in cities across the United States.",
      "Still, there has been little urgency in Washington as each side believes the other will eventually cave.",
      "\u201cOur position remains the same, we want to end the shutdown as soon as we can and fix the ACA premium crisis that looms over 20 million hardworking Americans,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday, referring to the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire in December.",
      "Schumer called the White House meeting a \u201cpep rally\u201d and said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of town during the shutdown.",
      "Members of both parties acknowledge that as the shutdown drags on, it is becoming less likely every day that Congress will be able to either extend the subsidies or fund the government through the regular appropriations process. The House GOP bill that Senate Democrats have now rejected 11 times would only keep the government open through Nov. 21.",
      "Thune on Monday hinted that Republicans may propose a longer extension of current funding instead of passing individual spending bills if the shutdown doesn\u2019t end soon. Congress would need to pass an extension beyond Nov. 21, he said, \u201cif not something on a much longer-term basis.\u201d",
      "Democrats are focused on Nov. 1, when next year\u2019s enrollment period for the ACA coverage begins and millions of people will sign up for their coverage without the expanded subsidy help that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. Once those sign-ups begin, they say, it would be much harder to restore the subsidies even if they did have a bipartisan compromise.",

      "More women are defying traditional beauty standards and finding empowerment by going without hair on their heads",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cBeing bald is sexy. It\u2019s an attitude. It\u2019s a luxury. It\u2019s a lifestyle.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s how Brennan Nevada Johnson, who shaved her head voluntarily 14 years ago, opens the video podcast she launched last November to celebrate the advantages of choosing a bald look.",
      "Sensuous, self-assured and glamorous are not the adjectives typically assigned to women with shorn hair. For centuries, many cultures have viewed long hair as a symbol of femininity, health and fertility. But more women are defying that traditional beauty standard and finding empowerment by baring their heads.",
      "\u201cOnce you do it, it brings all this confidence into your life,\u201d Johnson, 34, said. \u201cWhenever you see someone who\u2019s bald and not wearing a wig, just know that they have fully embraced themselves, and I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s really challenging to do.\"",
      "Her initial decision to go baldheaded was practical. Johnson played competitive volleyball in college and found the sweating she did on the court affected the expensive hair relaxing treatments she often had done. Once she started shaving off her hair, though, she was hooked. She was relieved to save money on salon trips.",
      "Johnson now owns a New York public relations firm. \u201cBald and Buzzed with Brennan,\u201d the video podcast she posts on YouTube, was an attempt to fill a void in social media content that affirmed bald people, especially women. She says she always thought baldness was sexy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a fashion statement, and it\u2019s a really powerful look,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Other women without hair, whether voluntarily or due to medical conditions, also have sought ways to support each other, attending conferences, joining \u201cbaldie\u201d groups and swapping grooming and scalp care tips.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole community of us out there,\u201d said Dash Lopez, a content creator who posts a weekly video series of her shaving routine called \u201cFresh Cut Friday.\u201d \u201cWe need to talk about it because we do find comfort and empowerment and beauty in what some people think is weird.\u201d",
      "Lopez said members of her family praised the long curly hair she had growing up. Some of her friends played with different hair colors and styles, but Lopez said she didn't have the same freedom. And she didn't enjoy detangling her hair or spending long afternoons at the salon.",
      "As soon as she turned 18 and could get a haircut without permission, she chopped her locks into a pixie cut. Then she shaved it all off during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt makes me feel powerful in the sense that I\u2019m able to detach from the things that people place so much emphasis on,\u201d Lopez, 29, said. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here planning, \u2018Oh my gosh, when am I going to get my next color appointment done? That\u2019s gonna cost me $300. Oh my gosh. I\u2019ve got to get my hair done before I go to this event.\u2019\u201d",
      "Lopez signed a contract with a modeling agency in 2020, a time when brands wanted to showcase diversity, she said. Back then, being bald worked for her professionally.",
      "\u201cThere was an appreciation for quirks and if you had a gap in your tooth, if you had a bald head, if you had a face full of freckles, that\u2019s what casting directors were looking for,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "She noticed the tide shifting last year, when her bookings for modeling jobs decreased. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, the odds were stacked against me in the modeling world,\" Lopez said. \"I was 5\u2032 4\u2033, 5\u2032 5\u2033 on paper, no hair.\u201d",
      "A client suggested she wear wigs to land more work. Lopez did not want to do that or grow out her hair. Her modeling contract ended. Since then, she has shared glimpses of her life as a bald woman on Instagram and TikTok, where some of her videos have been watched millions of times.",

      "Many women are confronted with how they define beauty when they lose hair due to health conditions such as alopecia or during chemotherapy treatment for cancer.",
      "Felicia Flores, a flight attendant who lives in Atlanta, was diagnosed in 2001 with alopecia, an autoimmune disorder that causes hair to fall out. Six years later, all her hair was gone. Initially, she wore wigs.",
      "Then she came across a group called The Baldie Movement on Facebook. \u201cThe ladies just really inspired me,\u201d Flores, 47, said. \u201cThey really did help to encourage me and give me strength, ... and they were just so confident.\u201d",
      "She eventually decided to stop wearing wigs and embrace being bald in 2015, after a romantic breakup. \u201cI was tired of lying. I felt like I was hiding something. I felt like I wasn\u2019t myself,\u201d she said.",
      "To help uplift and inspire other women, Flores founded an annual conference called Baldie Con. The fourth one drew drew more than 200 attendees to Atlanta last month for a fashion show, guest speakers, a jazz brunch and a black tie gala, she said.",
      "Aicha Soumaoro, who works in Philadelphia as a nurse on weekdays and as a mechanic on weekends, said some of her patients call her \u201csir\u201d instead of \u201cma\u2019am,\u201d but she doesn\u2019t let it bother her. \u201cIt\u2019s new to them, girls that are bald.\u201d",
      "Soumaoro, 27, said that after she shaved her head, her mother told her that most men wouldn't want to marry a woman with no hair. She focuses instead on the compliments she's received while out in public, including \u201cYou wear it with confidence\u201d and \u201cYour face is gorgeous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing bald, it\u2019s like a boost of confidence out of nowhere,\u201d said Soumaoro, who cuts her hair every Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s like a new skin, a new layer, a new personality. I just feel fresh. Like I was born again.\u201d",
      "She also hikes on Sundays, savoring the feeling of cold breezes on her scalp. \u201cHaving that connection with Earth, it feels amazing,\u201d Soumaoro said. \u201cI feel like I can hear everything more clearly. It\u2019s like I have a clear mindset when my head is bald.\u201d",
      "Tiffany Michael Thomas, an Atlanta-based performer who goes by the stage name Amor Lauren, shaved her head in a show of support when her mother was undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer.",
      "After her mother died, Thomas continued receiving compliments from other women. She decided to keep the bald look.",
      "\u201cOnce I began to really embrace it, it just made me feel like I was unstoppable,\u201d Thomas, 37, said. \"There\u2019s nothing that I have to hide behind anymore. ... It forced me to deal with all of my insecurities.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019re thinking about shaving your head, don\u2019t hesitate, Thomas advises. Women tell her they\u2019re concerned that their head isn\u2019t the right shape, or they have a lump or a scar. \u201cDo it without thought,\u201d she said. \u201cDo it scared. Everything in life, just do it scared. The best way to get through that fear is to actually do it.\u201d",

      "A week after thieves stormed the Louvre and ripped eight priceless pieces from France\u2019s Crown Jewels, the country is nursing a deep cultural wound",
      "PARIS -- The robbery at the Louvre has done what no marketing campaign ever could: It has catapulted France\u2019s dusty Crown Jewels \u2014 long admired at home, little known abroad \u2014 to global fame.",
      "One week on, and the country is still wounded by the breach to its national heritage.",
      "Yet the crime is also a paradox. Some say it will make celebrities of the very jewels it sought to erase \u2014 much as the Mona Lisa\u2019s turn-of-the-20th-century theft transformed the then little-known Renaissance portrait into the world\u2019s most famous artwork.",
      "In 1911, a museum handyman lifted the Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece off its hook. The loss went unnoticed for more than a day; newspapers turned it into a global mystery, and crowds came to stare at the empty space. When the painting resurfaced two years later, its fame eclipsed everything else in the museum, and that remains so today.",
      "That's the uneasy question shadowing Sunday\u2019s robbery: whether a crime that cut deep will glorify what's left behind.",
      "\u201cBecause of the drama, the scandal, the heist, the Apollo Gallery itself and the jewels that remain will likely receive a new spotlight and become celebrities, just like the Mona Lisa after 1911,\u201d said Anya Firestone, a Paris art historian and Culture Ministry licensed heritage expert. She toured the gallery the day before the robbery and did not think it looked sufficiently guarded.",
      "The heist has electrified global media. Nightly newscasts from the U.S. to Europe and across Latin America and Asia have beamed the Louvre, its Apollo Gallery and the missing jewels to hundreds of millions \u2014 a surge of attention some say rivals, or even surpasses, the frenzy after Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s 2018 \u201cApes--t\u201d video filmed inside the museum. The Louvre is once again a global set.",
      "For generations, the British monarchy's regalia has captured the popular imagination through centuries of coronations and drawing millions every year to their display in the Tower of London. Meanwhile, France\u2019s jewels lived in the shadow. This week's heist tilts the balance.",
      "One early emblem of that celebrity effect could be the survivor piece itself \u2014 Empress Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s emerald-set crown, dropped in the getaway and studded with more than 1,300 diamonds \u2014 which may now become the gallery\u2019s most talked-about relic.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never even heard of Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s crown until this,\u201d said Mateo Ruiz, a 27-year-old visitor from Seville. \u201cNow it\u2019s the first thing I want to see when the gallery reopens.\u201d",
      "Among the treasures that escaped the thieves\u2019 grasp are storied gems still gleaming under glass \u2014 the Regent Diamond, the Sancy and the Hortensia. Authorities say one other stolen bejeweled piece, besides Empress Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s damaged crown, has since been quietly recovered, though they have declined to identify it.",
      "The heist has not dented the Louvre's pull. The palace-museum reopened to maximum crowds Wednesday, even as the jewels remain missing, and the robbers at large. Long before the robbery, the museum was straining under mass tourism \u2014 roughly 33,000 visitors a day \u2014 and staff warn it cannot easily absorb another surge, especially with the Apollo Gallery sealed and security resources stretched.",
      "For France, the loss is more than precious stones and metal totaling over $100 million; it is pages torn from the national record. The Apollo Gallery reads as a timeline in gold and light, carrying the country from Bourbon ceremony to Napoleon\u2019s self-fashioned empire and into modern France.",

      "Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez called the theft an \u201cimmeasurable\u201d heritage loss, and the museum says the pieces carry \u201cinestimable\u201d historic weight \u2014 a reminder that what vanished is not just monetary.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s staggering that a handful of people couldn\u2019t be stopped in broad daylight,\u201d said Nadia Benyamina, 52, a Paris shopkeeper who visits the gallery monthly. \u201cThere were failures \u2014 avoidable ones. That\u2019s the wound.\u201d",
      "Investigators say the thieves rode a basket lift up the building's Seine-facing fa\u00e7ade, forced open a window, smashed two display cases and fled on motorbikes \u2014 all in minutes. Alarms sounded, drawing security to the gallery and forcing the intruders to bolt, officials say. The haul spanned royal and imperial suites in sapphire, emerald and diamond \u2014 including pieces tied to Marie-Am\u00e9lie, Hortense, Marie-Louise and Empress Eug\u00e9nie.",
      "In Senate testimony, Louvre director Laurence des Cars acknowledged \u201ca terrible failure,\u201d citing gaps in exterior camera coverage and proposing vehicle barriers and a police post inside the museum. She offered to resign; the culture minister refused. The heist followed months of warnings about chronic understaffing and crowd pressure points.",

      "Others feel a flicker of hope. \u201cThey\u2019re ghosts now \u2014 but there\u2019s still hope they\u2019ll be found,\u201d said Rose Nguyen, 33, an artist from Reims. \u201cIt\u2019s the same strange magnetism the Mona Lisa had after 1911. The story becomes part of the object.\u201d",
      "Curators warn that recutting or melting the jewels would be a second violence. In museums, authenticity lives in the original: the mount, the design, the work of the goldsmith\u2019s hand \u2014 and the unbroken story of who made, wore, treasured, exhibited and, yes, stole the object.",
      "Whether loss now brings legend is the Louvre\u2019s uneasy future.",
      "\u201cIn the strange economy of fame, even bad news becomes attention \u2014 and attention makes icons,\u201d Firestone said.",

    "story": [
      "The new director of Rome\u2019s Colosseum, has rejected reports that the ancient site will host electronic dance music parties",
      "ROME -- The man who just took charge of Rome\u2019s top tourist attraction wants to set the record straight: the Colosseum won\u2019t be hosting any electronic dance music parties on his watch.",
      "Simone Quilici, director of the Archaeological Park of the Colosseum, shared his plan to bring concerts to the almost 2,000-year-old amphitheater in an interview with an Italian newspaper earlier this month, and social media proceeded to do what it all too often does. \u201cMassive raves\u201d were imminent, multiple accounts trumpeted alongside AI-generated images of multicolor light beams shooting from the arena into the heavens.",
      "Quilici told The Associated Press that he heard complaints from archaeologists and ordinary Romans, dismayed their cultural heritage could be so desecrated. Even electronic music fans expressed concern online about the damage a whomping bass beat would inflict on an ancient structure that continues yielding new wonders, like the emperor\u2019s secret passage that opens on Oct. 27.",
      "Concerts must respect the Colosseum as a \u201csacred space,\u201d Quilici said, as it is integral to Roman identity and has become imbued with religious significance. Today, it is the site of the Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession during Easter, traditionally presided over by the pope.",
      "\u201cThe music must be carefully controlled. I mentioned certain artists \u2014 not by accident \u2014 who haven\u2019t been \u2018rock\u2019 for some time, who play calm music and attract a calm audience, because the important thing is that it\u2019s not a wild crowd,\u201d Quilici, 55, said Friday in his first interview with foreign media since taking over on Oct. 20. \u201cI joked about rock in moderation \u2014 that\u2019s what I meant, a more subdued kind of music. But it was reported the opposite of what I said.\u201d",
      "Concerts could be acoustic or jazz, he said, offering Sting as an example. The amphitheater could host poetry readings, dance performances and theater productions once the existing small platform is expanded. Also in the plans: historical reenactments of gladiatorial battles rooted in academic research.",
      "\u201cThere are people who are extremely knowledgeable about daily life in past eras, with a remarkable level of scientific accuracy. So these activities are very welcome within the Colosseum park,\u201d Quilici said. He stressed such presentations would be the antithesis of the shabbily costumed centurions who besiege the Colosseum by night, posing for photos with tourists and then harassing them for payment.",
      "The Colosseum's first concerts and performances will take place in no less than two years, he added.",
      "Only a handful of concerts have taken place within the Colosseum over the years, including Ray Charles in 2002, Paul McCartney in 2003 and Andrea Bocelli in 2009. All were billed as special events and audience numbers were severely restricted.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, as everyone knows, tourism is a commercial activity \u2014 an industry that does not always connect with culture,\u201d he said on the Colosseum\u2019s uppermost balcony. \u201cBringing cultural activities into the mix would enrich this place, making it not only a site to visit, but also a place where one can experience and enjoy artistic events.\u201d",
      "Peering down into the arena\u2019s ruins from high above, the bustle of tourists brings to mind the cross-section of an anthill. The Colosseum had almost 9 million visitors last year, up from 7 million the year before, according to data provided by the park.",

      "That\u2019s partly due to the Vatican\u2019s Jubilee year, held once every quarter-century, which continues to draw large tour groups of pilgrims. It\u2019s also because the Colosseum is one of just two must-see spots for short-staying tourists, along with Vatican City, and \u201calready is at maximum capacity,\u201d Quilici said.",
      "Therein lies the other great ambition for his tenure: inducing tourists to go elsewhere.",
      "The park he oversees includes not just the Colosseum, but also other sites directly adjacent like the Roman Forum, which was the heart of the ancient city\u2019s society, and Palatine Hill, where Rome was founded and the emperor\u2019s palace is located.",
      "Tickets lasting 24 hours include all three destinations. Still, one-third of buyers visit only the Colosseum, according to park data. If Rome's an open-air museum, as is often said, that\u2019s like catching a glimpse of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cMona Lisa\u201d through the crowd at the Louvre, then leaving without even looking at the other masterpieces in the room.",
      "\u201cLast year, tourists in Rome didn\u2019t stay just two and a half days; their visits increased to four days. So there\u2019s also the opportunity to use the Colosseum as a starting point for exploring less-visited places,\u201d he said.",
      "Likewise, relatively few visitors go to the nearby Circus Maximus, the sprawling grounds of Rome\u2019s high-adrenaline chariot races, depicted in the 1959 film \u201cBen-Hur.\u201d The Appian Way, known as \u201cthe queen of roads,\u201d goes even more overlooked, despite becoming a UNESCO world heritage site last year. Its giant paving stones provide passage into a golden countryside that evokes long-gone centuries and provides welcome respite from Rome\u2019s tourist-thronged center.",
      "Both the Circus Maximus and the Appian Park, which Quilici administered before the Colosseum, are free to visit.",
      "All these sites and more are near to one another, though somewhat disjointed \u2013 archaeological islands mostly sliced into sections by busy roads. Quilici hopes to create new access points to his park as well as connections with others to better manage the crowds and establish one consolidated area for exploration and discovery.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a collective effort, one that requires cooperation from all the different administrations,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s more a matter of management than of infrastructure costs. Choices that sometimes can be simple decisions like limiting traffic \u2014 not necessarily involving major expenses, but rather a courageous choice to restore life to the heart of the city of Rome.\u201d",

      "Argentines will be heading to the polls in high-stakes midterm elections that could help shape libertarian President Javier Milei\u2019s political path \u2014 and the future of U.S. financial support for his government",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- On the northern bank of Argentina\u2019s Riachuelo River, luxury car dealerships report sales surging since libertarian President Javier Milei scrapped import restrictions.",
      "Streets in the Puerto Madero financial district bustle with bankers who praise Milei for ending a yearslong ban on selling dollars online. Fine restaurants serve sushi and steak to Argentine oil executives who gush about his efforts to draw foreign investment.",
      "On the opposite side of the polluted Riachuelo waterway, Veronica Leguizamon, 34, has only few eggs, a carton of milk and a handful of bread rolls left in her pantry.",
      "Clutching a Tupperware container, she braved heavy rain last Friday to carry home dinner for her four daughters from a soup kitchen in her neighborhood of Isla Maciel \u2014 a new daily routine since Milei slashed subsidies for public services and unwound price controls on staple foods.",
      "\u201cBefore, we could choose what to cook,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we depend on others to know if we\u2019ll eat or not.\"",
      "The contrasting fortunes of these Buenos Aires neighborhoods just over a kilometer apart illustrate the tensions polarizing the Argentine electorate in Sunday's nationwide congressional midterms.",
      "As voters go to the polls, their vastly different perceptions of the economy stand to determine whether Milei succeeds \u2014 and whether the Trump administration presses on with a financial rescue plan for its cash-strapped ideological ally.",
      "\u201cWithin my little circle, everyone\u2019s happy with how things are going,\u201d said Fernanda D\u00edaz, 42, who runs a yacht rental company in Puerto Madero. \u201cWhen I step outside it, I see people worried about making it to the end of the month.\"",
      "Commenting on the midterm elections, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to rescind a $20 billion aid package for Argentina if Milei suffers a defeat at the hands of a \u201csocialist or communist,\" prompting a sell-off in Argentine markets.",
      "Trump was apparently referring to Argentina's loosely populist, broad-based ideological movement known as Peronism that helped deliver the economic shambles that Milei inherited in late 2023.",
      "Reckless public spending under a succession of Peronist governments \u2014 including that of former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, now serving house arrest for corruption \u2014 brought Argentina infamy for its inflationary spirals and sovereign debt defaults.",
      "\u201cWe needed a major change,\u201d said D\u00edaz, who, before launching her yacht business, lost her job as a top executive when Chilean retail group Falabella shut down its Argentine operations over high inflation, import restrictions and a wildly oscillating exchange rate under the previous Peronist government. \u201cI voted for Milei's government and was really enthusiastic at first.\u201d",
      "Markets shudder at the thought of a Peronist return.",
      "When the Peronist coalition beat Milei's libertarian party by a landslide in last month's Buenos Aires provincial elections, investors panicked that the president\u2019s free-market overhaul was losing support and rushed to pull capital out of the country.",
      "In an extremely rare move, the U.S. Treasury came to the rescue \u2014 selling dollars to help meet soaring demand for greenbacks, signing a $20 billion credit line and promising another $20 billion in aid from private banks, rather than U.S. taxpayers.",
      "Assets jumped on each of the Trump administration's announcements. Having dodged a currency crisis, Mileli and his supporters were, briefly, ebullient.",

      "Although Isla Maciel has long been a Peronist stronghold, 42% of the wider Avellaneda municipality voted for Milei as president in 2023, betting on the wild-haired political outsider to stabilize the economy and end triple-digit inflation.",
      "Wielding a diesel-fume-spewing chain saw at rallies, Milei cut tens of thousands of government jobs, slashed state spending and burned through foreign exchange reserves to shore up the chronically depreciating peso.",

      "But almost two years into his economic overhaul, purchasing power has dropped, too. With inflation still hovering over 30% annually, residents of Isla Maciel have watched the value of their wages, pensions and welfare payments shrivel.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t live on 290,000 pesos a month with today\u2019s inflation,\u201d Epifan\u00eda Contreras, 64, said as she packed her plastic bowl with rice and peas at the Foundation of Isla Maciel soup kitchen, referring to her $200 monthly pension. \u201cThe situation is getting worse and worse.

      "Milei has vowed in campaign speeches to press on with his harsh austerity program. But his chain saw prop, once a rally staple, hasn't been seen in months.",
      "Most polls predict a tight race between Milei\u2019s La Libertad Avanza (Liberty Advances) party and the Peronist coalition. Half of Argentina\u2019s lower house, or 127 seats, and a third of the Senate, or 24 seats, are up for grabs in Sunday's elections.",
      "Currently controlling less than 15% of Congress, the government last managed to pass a law in March. La Libertad Avanza hopes to win enough seats to defend austerity measures, uphold presidential vetoes and impose labor and tax reforms.",
      "The stakes are high. A defeat for Milei could pile more pressure on the peso and force a painful devaluation of the currency's controlled exchange rate, raising inflation and undermining the president's main achievement.",
      "Weary Argentines are, again, bracing for impact.",
      "\u201cEach new government comes in, criticizes the last one, promises to do things differently and ends up being the same or worse,\u201d said Mat\u00edas Paredes, 50, a real estate broker whose foreign clientele vanished with Milei's strong exchange rate.",

      "Traditionalist Catholics are celebrating after Pope Leo XIV approved the old Latin Mass at St. Peter's Basilica",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Traditionalist Catholics who felt abandoned after Pope Francis restricted the old Latin Mass rejoiced Saturday as they prepared to celebrate the traditional liturgy in St. Peter's Basilica with the explicit approval of Pope Leo XIV.",
      "Cardinal Raymond Burke, the conservative American figurehead, was to celebrate the old Mass for pilgrims on Saturday during their Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome. Another cardinal, Matteo Zuppi of Italy, celebrated a packed vespers service for them Friday night.",
      "For many traditionalists, the moment was a tangible sign that Leo might be more sympathetic to their plight, after they felt rejected by Francis and his 2021 crackdown on the old liturgy.",
      "Francis had taken action after the spread of the ancient liturgy, especially in the United States, dovetailed with the rise of religiously inspired political conservatism and decline in church attendance at more progressive parishes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very hopeful,\u201d said Rub\u00e9n Peret\u00f3 Rivas, a professor of medieval philosophy at Argentina\u2019s Universidad Nacional de Cuyo and an organizer of the pilgrimage. \u201cThe first signs of Pope Leo are those of dialogue and listening, truly listening to everyone.\u201d",
      "The latest rounds in the liturgy wars date back to the Second Vatican Council, the 1960s meetings that modernized the church. Among the reforms was the celebration of the Mass in the vernacular, rather than Latin, with the priest facing the faithful in the pews rather than the altar.",
      "In the decades that followed, the old Latin Mass was still available but not widespread. In those years too, the Vatican was dealing with the growth of a schismatic group that rejected the Vatican II reforms and celebrated the Latin Mass exclusively, the Society of St. Pius X.",
      "Pope Benedict XVI, both as a cardinal and later as pontiff, tried to heal the schism and bring the SSPX group back under Rome\u2019s wing, fearing the spread of a parallel, pre-Vatican II church.",
      "In 2007, Benedict relaxed restrictions on celebrating the old Latin Mass as part of his overall outreach to traditionalists.",
      "\u201cWhat earlier generations held as sacred remains sacred and great for us too,\u201d Benedict wrote at the time.",
      "In one of the most controversial acts of his pontificate, Francis in 2021 reversed Benedict\u2019s 2007 reform and reinstated restrictions on celebrating the old Mass. Francis said its spread had become a source of division in the church and been exploited by Catholics opposed to Vatican II.",
      "Under Francis' restrictions, bishops must petition Rome if, say, a newly ordained priest wants to celebrate the ancient rite. The Holy See must give its OK if a bishop wants to designate an additional parish church for the Masses, forcing some celebrations to be held in far-flung church halls.",
      "Rather than heal the divisions, though, Francis\u2019 crackdown seemed to further drive a wedge.",
      "\u201cWe are orphans,\u201d said Christian Marquant, a French organizer of the pilgrimage.",
      "Leo, history's first American pope, was elected with a broad consensus among cardinals and has said his aim is unity and reconciliation in the church. Many conservatives and traditionalists urged him to heal the liturgical divisions that spread over the Latin Mass, especially.",
      "After Leo's election, Marquant wrote Leo a letter on behalf of some 70 traditionalist groups asking, among other things, for permission to celebrate a Mass according to the ancient rite in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica during the traditionalists' annual pilgrimage to Rome.",

      "Francis, too, had allowed Latin Masses to be celebrated in the basilica even in the immediate aftermath of his 2021 crackdown, but only by low-ranking priests. In 2023 and 2024, the traditionalists couldn't find anyone willing to approach Francis to ask permission, and no Mass was celebrated, Marquant said.",
      "In July, leaked Vatican documents undermined Francis\u2019 stated reason for having imposed the restrictions in the first place: Francis had said he was responding to \u201cthe wishes expressed\u201d by bishops around the world who had responded to a 2020 Vatican survey, as well as the Vatican doctrine office\u2019s own opinion.",
      "But the documents suggested that the majority of Catholic bishops who responded to the survey had expressed general satisfaction with the old Latin Mass and warned that restricting it would \u201cdo more harm than good.\u201d",
      "James Rodio, a psychiatrist and father of three, has been attending the traditional Latin Mass with his family for nearly three decades in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "\u201cI was just struck by the reverence and beauty and symbolism in action and gesture, and of course the content too,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.",
      "Even though Rodio had always had access to a traditional Mass in Cleveland, he and other parishioners felt \u201cfrustration\u201d at Francis\u2019 crackdown and the restrictions that he imposed.",
      "\u201cBehind it all, there was a sadness\u201d and sense that Francis didn\u2019t understand them, he said. \u201cHow could any organization have an approach for 16 or 17 centuries and then say it wasn\u2019t valid anymore?\u201d",
      "Rodio said he and his fellow parishioners are optimistic about Leo and hope he will allow more parishes to offer the traditional liturgy. While Rodio would welcome something explicit, Leo need not overturn Francis outright: He can just instruct the Vatican liturgy office to generously approve individual requests from bishops as they come in.",
      "In recent weeks, the diocese of Cleveland received a two-year extension to keep allowing the Latin Mass at two diocesan churches.",
      "\u201cMy guess is Leo may try to do a lot by not doing a lot publicly,\u201d Rodio said.",

      "U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned Sunday that he\u2019s about make good on a threat to revoke millions in federal funds for California because he says the state is illegally issuing commercial driver\u2019s licenses to noncitizens.",
      "In an appearance on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d Duffy said California Gov. Gavin Newsom has refused to comply with U.S. Department of Transportation rules that require the state to stop issuing such licenses and review those already issued.",
      "\u201cSo, one, I\u2019m about to pull $160 million from California,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cAnd, as we pull more money, we also have the option of pulling California\u2019s ability to issue commercial driver\u2019s licenses.\u201d",
      "Newsom\u2019s press office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the matter Sunday, but California has defended its practices previously. When Duffy threatened to revoke funds last month, a spokesperson for Newsom dismissed the attack and noted that CDL holders from California have a significantly lower rate of crashes than both the national average and the Texas average, which is the only state with more licensed commercial drivers.",
      "Last month, the Transportation Department tightened commercial driver\u2019s license requirements for noncitizens after three fatal crashes that officials said were caused by immigrant truck drivers. Only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible for CDLs under the new rules and states must verify an applicant\u2019s immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant\u2019s visa expires sooner.",
      "Duffy said last month that California should never have issued 25% of 145 licenses investigators reviewed. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver\u2019s work permit expired \u2014 sometimes years after.

California defended its practices in a formal response to the Transportation Department, but federal officials were not satisfied.",
      "The investigation launched after the Florida crash found what Duffy called significant failures in the way California is enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders.

      "South Carolina's state-owned utility is negotiating with Brookfield Asset Management to revive a nuclear power project abandoned eight years ago",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina's state-owned utility is looking to a private company to revive a project to build two nuclear power plants that was abandoned eight years ago, losing more than $9 billion without generating a watt of power.",
      "Santee Cooper's board agreed Friday to start six weeks of negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management that they hope will lead to a deal that lets the private company build the nuclear plants at the V.C. Summer site near Jenkinsville at their own risk to generate power that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers.",
      "Santee Cooper said Brookfield preliminarily agreed to provide the utility with some of the power generated. But that and probably thousands of other details will have to be negotiated. In a twist, Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building new nuclear reactors.",
      "Utility officials said the agreement gives hope the state can get something out of a debacle that led to four executives going to prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity.",
      "\u201cThe risk to the ratepayer is nil. The risk to the taxpayer is nil,\u201d Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.",
      "There are still too many hurdles for the project to get past to consider this a win right now, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.",
      "After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.",
      "\u201cI still believe that the cost, technical and regulatory hurdles are too big to lead to completion of the project,\u201d Clements said, adding the agreement appears to let Brookfield walk away if it decide it's not feasible.",
      "Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors. Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Anyone who watched U.S. President Donald Trump vow to condition financial aid to cash-strapped Argentina on the outcome of a \u201cvery big\u201d and \u201cvery important\u201d vote in the South American country would be forgiven for thinking that his close ideological ally, Argentine President Javier Milei, was up for reelection.",
      "But no. The vote that Trump was talking about earlier this month is, in fact, a midterm election for less than half of the Argentine Congress.",
      "Now the explosive comments, combined with a dizzying series of scandals and setbacks for Milei, have cranked up the pressure on Argentina\u2019s libertarian president and transformed Sunday's limited vote into a major political test that could help determine the fate of Milei\u2019s free-market experiment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve made it to the elections on our feet, and on Sunday Argentina will really change,\u201d Milei said in a fiery final campaign speech late Thursday from the port city of Rosario.",
      "At the start of the year, pollsters and pundits were predicting a smashing success for Milei in the midterms.",
      "His huge cuts to state spending delivered Argentina's first fiscal surplus in nearly 15 years and pulled down monthly inflation from 25.5% to 2%. Argentines celebrated relief from ever-rising prices and took comfort in a strong peso that made it cheaper for them to snap up imported goods and vacation abroad.",
      "With his approval ratings high, Milei took victory laps through Europe, Latin America and, most frequently, Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, railing against the evils of socialism and the corruption of the political elite. He pushed key deregulation laws through an opposition-dominated Congress, allying with the right-wing PRO party of former President Mauricio Macri and striking deals with moderate governors.",
      "How quickly the mood turned.",
      "Milei's aura of infallibility first began to crack in February, when he promoted a dodgy memecoin on his social media account that quickly collapsed, leading to $250 million in losses for investors. Then in August, Milei's powerful sister was accused of taking bribes from a government medicine supplier. She denies wrongdoing.",
      "The latest blow came earlier this month, when Milei\u2019s leading candidate in Buenos Aires province, Jos\u00e9 Luis Espert, dropped out of the midterm race after admitting he received $200,000 from a businessman indicted in the U.S. for drug trafficking. He says it was for consulting services.",
      "The controversies have hurt Milei's reputation as a straight-talking outsider determined to tear down the corrupt establishment, experts say, particularly at this time of harsh austerity.",
      "\u201cIt was the first wake-up call when people started to ask, maybe (Milei and Karina) are asking us to make sacrifices that they're not making themselves,\" said Eugenia Mitchelstein, the chair of the social sciences department at Buenos Aires\u2019 San Andr\u00e9s University.",
      "Tactical errors compounded matters. Milei ran an aggressive campaign strategy in some two dozen provincial elections in recent months that pitted a slew of unknowns from his scrappy libertarian party against more established rivals.",
      "His decision to forgo any attempt at coalition-building alienated potential political allies, who punished Milei by passing spending measures in Congress and overturning his vetoes.",
      "The run-up to the midterms \u2014 in which half the seats in the lower house of Congress and a third of the Senate are up for grabs \u2014 has also been rough. Although veteran politician Diego Santilli is now at the top of the party's Buenos Aires list after Espert stood down over the scandal, voters will still see Espert on the ballot Sunday after electoral authorities ruled it was too late to print new ones.",
      "The other Buenos Aires candidate, Karen Reichardt, is a former model and actress who has recently come under fire for old social media posts attacking national soccer hero Lionel Messi and insulting her political enemies with racially insensitive language. She did not respond to a request for comment.",

Bessent said he was working on another $20 billion loan from private banks, and Trump said the U.S. would even boost beef imports from Argentina to bring down U.S. meat prices.",
      "But it seems that not even such dramatic moves from the world's biggest economy could restore faith in the famously volatile peso. Argentine investors \u2014 who can more easily take money out of Argentina since Milei's government scrapped capital controls this year \u2014 continued ditching pesos.

      "Doris Brown\u2019s home in Northeast Houston becomes a refuge for neighbors during power outages thanks to her solar panel and battery system",
      "HOUSTON -- Doris Brown was nearly asleep when a neighbor knocked on her door, telling her to look outside. \u201cThere were no lights, nowhere,\u201d said Brown, recalling the power outage that summer night in 2023. \u201cI didn't even know it.\u201d",
      "Brown's solar panel and battery system was keeping her power on. She'd prepared for a night like this. \u201cCall everybody,\u201d she told the neighbor.",
      "Soon around 15 \u201cneighbors and neighbors' neighbors\u201d were inside Brown's three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath home in Northeast Houston. They charged phones, cooked, and showered before work and school. Some slept over.",
      "\u201cThere were people sleeping everywhere,\u201d said Brown, 75. She was happy to be \u201ca port in a storm,\u201d despite one downside: \u201cThey ate all my snacks.\u201d",
      "Brown's house is a \u201chub home,\u201d one of seven in a Northeast Houston pilot program meant to create emergency safe havens \u2014 not at shelters or community centers, but inside neighbors' houses.",
      "The idea was a grassroots response to decades of community disinvestment and neglect that got neighbors talking about what they could do to be ready for extreme weather and power outages.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s us helping us,\u201d said Brown.",
      "The project was set to reach 30 more homes, until the Environmental Protection Agency in August canceled the $7 billion Solar for All program which would have funded its expansion. Harris County, which includes Houston, is now a plaintiff in one of multiple lawsuits over the cancellation.",
      "People involved with the program acknowledge hub homes are unconventional \u2014 requiring trust and community cooperation and impacting fewer people than a larger resilience center.",
      "But they also say they're effective in creating pockets of preparedness in communities confronting more extreme weather but lacking resources to do more.",
      "\u201cIt was a way to increase resilience in those neighborhoods that are often forgotten,\u201d said Sam Silerio, Texas program director at Solar United Neighbors, one of the nonprofits involved with the pilot program which is also suing over the cuts.",
      "The hub homes idea started after Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when freezing temperatures crippled Texas' power grid for five days and led to 246 storm-related deaths, according to the Texas Department of Health Services.",
      "Power loss contributed to many of the deaths, as people with health conditions couldn't refrigerate medicines or run life-sustaining medical devices. Nineteen people died from carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly using generators and grills to stay warm.",
      "\u201cWe were like, \u2018Shoot, power grid failure is a serious thing that we are not prepared for\u2019,\u201d said Becky Selle, co-director of disaster preparedness, organizing, and operations at West Street Recovery, a Northeast Houston nonprofit founded after Hurricane Harvey in 2017.",
      "WSR bought some generators for residents willing to share the resource. Brown, who almost froze to death herself in Uri, stepped up.",
      "WSR added more supplies to the hubs, like life jackets and kayaks for flood evacuations, and held preparedness trainings for members.",
      "When the D.C.-based nonprofit Solar United Neighbors approached them with a private grant from the Hive Fund to add free solar panels and batteries to several houses, WSR knew exactly where to install them.",
      "The pilot had its challenges \u2014 some roofs had to be repaired before they could hold solar panels, and hub captains had to learn how to manage their batteries to not deplete them.",
      "Success also required neighborly connection that modern communities often lack.",
      "\u201cYou have to build that trust,\u201d said David Espinoza, a hub home captain and West Street Recovery\u2019s co-director of community organizing and language access. The 34-year-old went door-to-door on his block, introducing himself to sometimes wary neighbors. \u201cI got to know my neighborhood a lot better,\u201d he said.",
      "About a dozen people are signed up on Espinoza's \u201croster,\u201d but he said the hub is there for anyone in need, prioritizing older neighbors and those with children or medical conditions.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s the missing link in the disaster resilience ecosystem,\u201d said Hanvin. \u201cAt the end of the day, the first thing you need (in an emergency) to help you is a person.\u201d",

      "Solar United Neighbors and West Street Recovery planned to expand the program this fall as part of a $54 million grant awarded to Harris County by the EPA.",

      "NEW YORK -- The stunning indictment that led to the arrest of more than 30 people, including Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and other NBA figures, on charges of illegal sports betting has drawn new scrutiny of the booming business of professional sports gambling across the U.S.",
      "Since widespread legalization, the multibillion-dollar industry has made it easy to place wagers on everything from the outcome of games to that of a single play with just a few taps of a cellphone. It\u2019s just about impossible to go to a basketball, football, baseball or other pro game today \u2014 or watch a matchup on TV \u2014 without seeing ads for sports betting.",
      "Fans can place wagers from their stadium seats, while \u201cBet\u201d tickers scroll on TV sports broadcasts. Star athletes are frequently at the center of ads promoting it all.",
      "In Thursday\u2019s indictment, federal investigators accused Rozier and other defendants of breaking the law by exploiting private information about players to win bets on NBA games. Rozier\u2019s lawyer, Jim Trusty, said in a statement that his client is \u201cnot a gambler\u201d and \u201clooks forward to winning this fight.\u201d",
      "A separate indictment alleges Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and others participated in a conspiracy to fix high-stakes card games. Billups' attorney declined to comment Thursday.",
      "Regulating sports wagering has proven to be a challenge \u2014 and experts warn about the ramifications for gamblers who typically lose money. Professional leagues' own role in promoting gambling has raised eyebrows.",
      "Here's what we know.",
      "Sports betting is probably as old as sports itself. But in the U.S., legal gambling really took off in 2018.",
      "That's when the Supreme Court struck down the Professional Amateur Sports Protection Act, which barred sports betting in most states. Once allowed only in Nevada, sports betting is now permitted online or in retail locations in 38 states and Washington, D.C. Missouri will become the 39th state on Dec. 1.",
      "Experts say the biggest jump has been online, through smartphone apps and platforms like DraftKings and FanDuel. Through the third quarter of this year, legal sports betting generated $10 billion in revenue, up about 19% from the same period a year ago, according to the American Gaming Association.",
      "The industry argues that legal wagering generates money for states and can deter illegal betting. Major operators point to technology they use to monitor suspicious activity. FanDuel said Thursday's news illustrates \u201cthe stark contrast between legal and illegal betting markets.\u201d",
      "There is plenty of money on the table both for those who place winning bets and the platforms that make it possible. The NBA and other pro sports leagues have also created revenue streams by partnering with sportsbooks and reaping advertising dollars.",
      "Live game stats provided by leagues are key to the sports world\u2019s relationship with the gambling industry. When you're able to bet what the next pitch in a baseball game is going to be, that's because Major League Baseball is selling data to platforms \u201cfor a pretty high price,\" according to Isaac Rose-Berman, whose research focuses on sports betting as a fellow at the American Institute for Boys and Men.",
      "The NBA has a partnership with Sportradar for its data rights. Sportradar, in turn, provides FanDuel Sportsbook official NBA statistics. When the deal was announced in 2022, Sportradar touted it as a way \u201cto monetize our long-term partnership with the NBA.\"",
      "Each state has its own regulations and tax rates for sports betting. A handful restrict where you can place bets \u2014 allowing users to use mobile apps, but only while they're physically inside a casino or within a certain radius of a stadium, for example. Others limit which betting platforms you can use or what you can bet on.",
      "\u201cStates sort of opened up a can of worms, and now some of them are starting to realize just how crazy this sports betting world sort is,\u201d said Wayne Taylor, a professor of marketing at Southern Methodist University.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump will be in Japan and South Korea next week and he's expected to promote an epic windfall in investments for U.S. factories and projects",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is going to Japan and South Korea next week to promote an epic financial windfall \u2014 at least $900 billion in investments for U.S. factories, a natural gas pipeline and other projects.",
      "Japan and South Korea made those financial commitments in August to try to get Trump to ratchet down his planned tariff rates from 25% to 15%. But as the U.S. president is set to depart Friday night for Asia, the pledges are more of a loose end than money in the bank for American industry.",
      "Japan pledged $550 billion in investments, but it wants the money to benefit its own companies, making that a condition in a memorandum released in September. As of Monday, Japan has a new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, who has expressed respect for Trump but is operating in an untested coalition government.",
      "South Korea offered $350 billion \u2014 but wants a swap line for U.S. dollars to facilitate its investments and seeks to fund the transactions through loan guarantees. Otherwise, the commitment could sink its own economy.",
      "The investment arrangements are unusual for trade frameworks, and Trump maintains that he will personally direct how the money is spent, enabling him to pick winners and losers. Weeks of talks have yet to produce any breakthroughs on how the investments would go forward even though both nations want to preserve their relationship with America.",
      "Still, ahead of the trip, Trump was radiating optimism that his tariffs had forced investments to fuel what he believes will be an economic boom starting next year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done well, as you know, with Japan, with South Korea,\u201d Trump told Republican senators Tuesday. \u201cWithout the tariffs, you could have never made the deal. I\u2019ll tell you what. Tariffs equal national security.\u201d",
      "For Trump, the investments are also about demonstrating America\u2019s strength before a planned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping while he is in South Korea. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Monday described Trump's strategy in part as \u201cencouraging allied investment in America\u2019s industrial future\u201d to counter Chinese manufacturers.",
      "But Japan and South Korea are also competing against China \u2014 which is pivoting aggressively into electric vehicles, computer chips and other technologies. There is a risk that mandating investment in the U.S. could weaken allies that are closer geographically to China, said Christopher Smart, managing partner at the Arbroath Group, a geopolitical strategy firm.",
      "\u201cThey need to invest in their own countries,\u201d said Smart, who was a senior economic aide in the Obama White House. He said Trump was \u201cgoing to extract investment money\u201d from the countries while also erecting \"tariff walls\u201d that could make it harder for them to sell goods in America, a rather lopsided view of how alliances work.",
      "Few experts believe Japan and South Korea would agree with the Trump administration's framing that their U.S. investments are a way to compete against China.",
      "\u201cIt is really about lowering tariffs and avoiding Trump\u2019s wrath,\u201d said Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Asia Policy Studies.",
      "There is an expectation that Japan and South Korea both want to resolve any hurdles on the investments and will take steps to achieve \u201cprogress\u201d in talks with Trump, said William Chou, a senior fellow focused on Japan at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank.",
      "Chou pointed to Nippon Steel's agreement to purchase U.S. Steel this year as an example of how Japan can work with the Trump administration. The president had initially opposed the merger, but later backed it with an agreement that gave the U.S. government some control over the acquired company.",
      "Similarly, the memorandum of understanding on Japan\u2019s $550 million investment would also give the U.S. government input on how the money would be spent. It provides for a committee led by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to propose investments, giving Japan 45 days to respond, with the understanding that the deals would give preference to Japanese contractors and suppliers.",
      "\"Japan came through with the paperwork,\" Lutnick said in a September CNBC interview. \u201cThey gave us $550 billion to invest for the benefit of America, build the Alaska pipeline, build nuclear power plants, make your grid better, do generic antibiotics in America.\"",

      "Target said Thursday that it is eliminating about 1,800 corporate positions in an effort to streamline decision-making and accelerate initiatives to rebuild the flagging discount retailer\u2019s customer base.",
      "About 1,000 employees are expected to receive layoff notices next week, and the company also plans to eliminate about 800 vacant jobs, a company spokesperson said. The cuts represent about 8% of Target's corporate workforce globally, although the majority of the affected employees work at the company's Minneapolis headquarters, the spokesperson said.",
      "Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, who is set to become Target's next CEO on Feb. 1, issued a note to personnel on Thursday announcing the downsizing. He said further details would come on Tuesday, and he asked employees at the Minneapolis offices to work from home next week.",
      "\u201cThe truth is, the complexity we\u2019ve created over time has been holding us back,\u201d Fiddelke, a 20-year Target veteran, wrote in his note. \u201cToo many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.\u201d",
      "Target, which has about 1,980 U.S. stores, lost ground to Walmart and Amazon in recent years as inflation caused shoppers to curtail their discretionary spending. Customers have complained of messy stores with merchandise that did not reflect the expensive-looking but budget-priced niche that long ago earned the retailer the jokingly posh nickname \u201cTarzhay.\u201d",
      "Fiddelke said in August when he was announced as Target's next CEO that he would step into the role with three urgent priorities: reclaiming the company\u2019s position as a leader in selecting and displaying merchandise; improving the customer experience by making sure shelves are consistently stocked and stores are clean; and investing in technology.",

      "\"Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us. It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution,\" he wrote.",
      "Target has reported flat or declining comparable sales \u2014 those from established physical stores and online channels \u2014 in nine out of the past 11 quarters. The company reported in August that comparable sales dipped 1.9% in its second quarter, when its net income also dropped 21%.",
      "The job cuts will not affect any store employees or workers in Target's sorting, distribution and other supply chain facilities, the company spokesperson said.",
      "The corporate workers losing their jobs will receive pay and benefits until Jan. 8 as well as severance packages, the spokesperson said.",

The proposal would have to receive more than 870,000 signatures by next spring to qualify for the ballot in November 2026. If it qualifies, it's not guaranteed to pass. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, for example, has opposed tax hikes in the past, including those specifically targeting the rich.",

      "Billionaires would have to pay for tax year 2026, and the money could start being appropriated in 2027. The tax would generate $100 billion in revenue for the state, backers say. The initiative says it's \u201cdesigned to make the State tax system more equitable.\u201d",

      "The report on the consumer price index is being issued more than a week late because of the government shutdown, now in its fourth week.

Fed officials are cutting their short-term interest rate to buoy the economy and hiring, but they are taking some risk doing so because inflation is still above their 2% target.",
      "The issues of affordability and the cost of necessities are gaining in political importance. Concerns over the costs of rent and groceries have played a key role in the mayoral race in New York City. And Trump, who has acknowledged that the spike in grocery prices under President Joe Biden helped him win the 2024 election, has been considering importing Argentine beef to reduce record-high U.S. beef prices, angering U.S. cattle ranchers.",
      "The cost of ground beef has jumped to $6.32 a pound, a record, in part because of tariffs on imports from countries such as Brazil, which faces a 50% duty. Years of drought that have reduced cattle herds have also raised prices.",
      "Friday's report is forecast to show that inflation rose 3.1% in September from a year earlier, according to a survey of economists by data provider FactSet. That would be up from 2.9% in August and the highest in 18 months. On a monthly basis, inflation is projected to be 0.4% in September, the same as in August.",
      "Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core inflation in September was likely 3.1% for the third straight month. On a monthly basis, core prices likely rose 0.3%, economists project, also for the third straight month.",
      "Such figures are unlikely to deter the Fed from cutting its key rate by another quarter-point when it meets next week, to about 3.9%. It would be the second cut this year and is driven by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's concerns that hiring is weakening and poses a threat to the economy.",
      "Even as inflation has fallen sharply from its peak of 9.1% more than three years ago, it remains a major concern for consumers. About half of all Americans say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, according to an August poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",

      "The state of Michigan is suspending incentives and seeking to claw back millions from a Chinese business behind an electric vehicle battery plant project in northern Michigan after the project has been riddled with pushback from locals and national Rep...",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Michigan is demanding millions of dollars in incentives back from a Chinese company after plans to build an electric vehicle battery plant collapsed following years of pushback against the project from neighbors and members of Congress.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer supported the $2.36 billion factory in 2022, and state lawmakers approved nearly $175 million in incentives for the project. The state is now holding Gotion Inc. in default of $23.6 million, accusing the company of abandoning the project.",
      "\u201cWhile this is not the outcome we hoped for, we recognize the tremendous responsibility we have to the people we serve to make sure their hard-earned tax dollars are spent wisely and appropriately,\u201d Danielle Emerson, a spokesperson with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, said in a statement.",
      "Representatives for Gotion, which is headquartered in California, did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment.",
      "In a letter dated Sept. 17, Michigan informed Gotion that it was in default of economic development grant obligations because no \u201celigible activities\u201d had occurred on the site's property in over 120 days.",
      "According to the MEDC, the state is seeking to claw back $23.6 million that was disbursed toward the purchase of the site\u2019s land near Big Rapids, about 200 miles (322 kilometers) northwest of Detroit. $26.4 million remaining from the grant that was not spent will be returned to the state, Emerson said. Citing a lack of progress on the project, a different $125 million grant was not distributed to Gotion.",
      "The news was first reported by Crain\u2019s Detroit Business.",
      "The state also said two project-related lawsuits are imposing a \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d on its progress, which counts as grounds for default. The letter said that if the defaults are not resolved in 30 days, the state expects repayment of $23.6 million. That deadline passed Oct. 17.",
      "Residents of nearby Green Township so firmly opposed the project, some over environmental concerns, that voters in 2023 recalled five local elected officials who supported bringing the factory to the area.",

      "Whitmer's office did immediately respond to a request for comment.",

John Moolenaar, who represents a swath of rural Michigan, had been the loudest and most prominent critic of the project, accusing Gotion of ties with forced labor and the Chinese Communist Party.

Moolenaar's bill was signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year.",

      "China's endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys have joined pandas as diplomatic envoys to Europe",
      "With their distinctive shaggy orange manes, pale blue faces and dense fur covering their hands and feet, it's hard to mistake China's endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys for any other animal.",
      "These rare and charismatic monkeys, unique to the frigid mountains of central China, have recently joined the country's famous pandas as furry envoys to zoos in Europe for the first time \u2014 on loan for 10 years from the same government-overseen group that coordinates official panda exchanges.",
      "As with \u201c panda diplomacy,\u201d some observers cheer new opportunities for scientific and conservation collaboration, while others raise concerns about the welfare of individual animal ambassadors transported around the world.",
      "Three golden monkeys arrived at France\u2019s Beauval Zoo in the city of Saint-Aignan this April, following an agreement to mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People\u2019s Republic of China and France.",
      "Another trio of golden monkeys arrived at the Pairi Daiza zoo in Hainaut, Belgium, in May. The zoo distributed Belgian and Chinese hand flags to visitors on the day the monkeys arrived.",
      "After a monthlong quarantine, the two sets of monkeys made their public debuts. So far, they appear to be in good health, according to the two zoos, adapting to new climates outside Asia for the first time.",
      "At Pairi Daiza, the habitat enclosure for Liu Yun, Lu Lu and Juan Juan includes traditional Chinese gazebos with red columns and gray-tiled roofs, where the monkeys spend much of their time jumping between logs and rope ladders and scrambling over roofs.",
      "\u201cThe diplomatic aspect comes from this cultural awareness,\u201d said Pairi Daiza spokesperson Johan Vreys.",
      "The hope is to build longstanding scientific exchanges between the zoos and Chinese authorities, said Ana\u00efs Maury, the communications director for the Beauval Zoo.",
      "The zoo is in discussions with China to launch joint research and conservation programs \u201csimilar to those already in place for other emblematic species like pandas,\u201d Maury said.",
      "Both giant pandas and golden snub-nosed monkeys are endangered animals that are unique to China and they can only be moved outside the country with approval from the central government, said Elena Songster, an environmental historian at St. Mary\u2019s College of California.",
      "While both species are considered national treasures, only monkeys have deep roots in Chinese art and culture, appearing in countless paintings and as characters in classic literature, including the wily Monkey King in the 16th century novel \u201cJourney to the West.\"",
      "When pandas stepped, rolled, scratched and stumbled onto the world stage in recent decades, they quickly became symbols of modern China \u2014 in part to due to their own \u201ccuddly cuteness\u201d and deft diplomatic presentation, said Susan Brownell, a China historian at the University of Missouri, St. Louis.",
      "The original soft power couple from post-war China was a pair of giant pandas, Ping Ping and Qi Qi, sent to the Soviet Union in 1957 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, which led to the establishment of the world\u2019s first Communist state.",
      "In 1972, a pair of pandas was sent to the U.S. for the first time, following President Richard Nixon\u2019s historic visit to Beijing. In 1984, China switched from gifting pandas to loaning them.",
      "Following outcry from animal-rights activists, China ended the practice of short-term loans and began longer leases, usually around a decade. In this arrangement through the China Wildlife Conservation Association, part of the money that an overseas zoo pays annually to China must be earmarked for habitat conservation or scientific research to benefit the species.",

      "In some of the most agriculturally rich regions in the U.S., researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand how climate change is impacting heat in rural areas and the farmworkers who toil in them",
      "In the summers, the sky is jet black when Raul Cruz arrives at this Imperial Valley sugarcane field to start his day. He chops, cleans and bundles the crop, taking heed as the sun rises. It's hard work, but so is starting at 4 a.m., even though he knows it's the safest thing when temperatures in this California desert frequently soar into the triple digits.",
      "\u201cWe just have to because we need to beat the heat,\" said Cruz, who\u2019s worked here for 15 years. They finish work by 9 or 10 a.m. to avoid the risk of heat stroke, he added, but when heat starts creeping up around 8 a.m., \"mentally, it's stressful.\"",
      "The hot climate that makes this Southern California region a farming powerhouse is also what makes it dangerous for farmworkers, who are increasingly vulnerable to rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal, oil and natural gas. Researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand the health consequences of heat stress on farmworkers and where heat is most extreme in this rural landscape. They hope their findings can lead to a better understanding of rural heat islands, identify gaps in research and help develop interventions that better protect them in the face of climate change.",
      "\u201cWorkers could potentially be dying or having some serious issues,\" said project leader Nicolas Lopez-Galvez, assistant professor in the School of Public Health at SDSU. \u201cIt\u2019s better to start acting sooner.\"",
      "Since the start of the 20th century, California temperatures have increased almost 3 F (about 1.7 C), according to state and federal data. Warming has accelerated, and seven of the state\u2019s last eight years through 2024 were the warmest on record. While all areas of the state have warmed, Southern California is heating up about twice as fast as Northern California.",
      "Ana Solorio, an organizer with the farmworker advocacy group L\u00edderes Campesinas that is working with researchers, remembered feeling \u201csuffocated\u201d in the Coachella Valley summer heat when she was a farmworker. \"With the humidity, it felt awful,\" said Solorio, who's lived in the Imperial Valley for more than 30 years. The heat was so intense she didn\u2019t return for another season, preferring instead the cooler winter harvesting months of lettuce in the Imperial Valley.",
      "\u201cThis (heat) can cause a lot of harm to their health,\" she said.",
      "Researchers are trying to understand how farmworkers' heat stress might vary depending on the crops, the season and the number of breaks they take.",
      "Over the past two years, they've collected year-round data from some 300 farmworkers. Body sensors measure things like core body temperature and heart rate while they work. Elsewhere in the fields, environmental monitors measure the day's temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover, also known as the wet-bulb globe temperature, considered the best metric to understanding heat stress. Using satellite imagery along with historical and current wet-bulb globe temperature data, researchers are mapping areas of extreme heat, particularly in the Imperial and Coachella valleys.",
      "Researchers are learning that ground level crops can expose workers to higher heat levels compared to tree crops, for example, but it also depends on their harvesting months. In the summers, farmworkers who prepare fields for planting or help maintain irrigation systems are also more exposed.",
      "Rural heat can vary based on things like tree cover, proximity to a body of water and empty fields, which may be hotter. \u201cIt creates this island where people might be living or working that are higher in terms of heat stress compared to other places,\u201d said Lopez-Galvez.",

It grows two-thirds of winter vegetables consumed nationally and provides thousands of jobs. From 2023 to 2024 alone, about 17,579 migrant and seasonal farmworkers were employed in Imperial County, according to the state.",

The county has one of the largest Latino populations and the highest number of heat-related illnesses among workers than anywhere else in the state.",

      "One study found that irrigating crop fields in the Imperial Valley reduced the wet-bulb globe temperature on summer days, thanks to the cooling effect of evaporating water. But on summer nights, the opposite occurred: irrigation increased the wet-bulb globe temperature as humidity spiked. Irrigation also heightened heat in nearby urban and fallow areas adjacent to crop fields due to moisture transport.",

      "Through this research, the authors were able to recommend how frequently farmworkers should take rest breaks to protect themselves from heat stress, based on how often wet-bulb globe temperatures exceed safety thresholds across seasons and work shifts. While California has heat rules, they're not strictly enforced, he added.",

      "The inquiry found both companies had violated the Digital Services Act, the EU\u2019s trailblazing digital rule book that imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online, including making it easier to report counterfeit or unsafe goods or flag harmful or illegal content like hate speech, as well as a ban on ads targeted at children.",

That means platforms must empower users, respect their rights, and open their systems to scrutiny. The DSA makes this a duty, not a choice.\u201d",
      "The 27-nation bloc launched investigations in 2024 into both Meta and TikTok. They found that the companies did not allow easy access to data for researchers. They also found that Meta's Instagram and Facebook did not make it easy for users to flag illegal content and effectively challenge moderation decisions. \u201cAllowing researchers access to platforms\u2019 data is an essential transparency obligation under the DSA, as it provides public scrutiny into the potential impact of platforms on our physical and mental health,\u201d according to a statement by the European Commission, the EU's executive body. The inquiry found both Facebook and Instagram deployed \u201cdark patterns\u201d or deceptive interface designs for its protocol for flagging malicious content like child sex abuse or terrorist content. That led to a kind of obfuscation, with the Commission saying it was \u201cconfusing and dissuading\u201d and \u201cmay therefore be ineffective.\u201d",

TikTok said Friday that it would review the findings but said that the transparency obligations of the DSA conflict with the EU's strict privacy rules, the General Data Protection Regulation. \"If it is not possible to fully comply with both, we urge regulators to provide clarity on how these obligations should be reconciled,\u201d said Paolo Ganino, a spokesperson for TikTok.",

      "Some public figures carry threats to their livelihood in the palms of their hands",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Some politicians carry threats to their livelihood in the palms of their hands.",
      "News stories in recent weeks about offensive or ill-advised text messages have blown up the careers of several young Republicans in a chat group, led a nominee for a White House job to drop out, threatened the campaign of a Democrat running for Virginia attorney general and embarrassed a federal prosecutor.",
      "Memories are still fresh of this spring's inadvertent inclusion of a journalist on a Signal chain where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other leaders discussed military strikes, possibly the second Trump administration's most embarrassing moment.",
      "For journalists, it's something else entirely. Bad smartphone behavior is fertile ground for reporters seeking insight into people who look to lead us \u2014 and presents a challenge to nail down stories when \u201cthat's fake\u201d looms as a default defense.",
      "Paul Ingrassia, who was President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Office of Special Counsel, withdrew his name from consideration Tuesday. His Senate support had crumbled following Politico's Oct. 20 report that Ingrassia said in a text chain that he had a \u201cNazi streak\u201d and believed the federal holiday honoring the birth of Martin Luther King Jr. should be tossed into hell.",
      "Less than a week earlier, Politico exposed a Telegram chat group with leaders of youthful Republican groups across the country involved in casually racist and violent talk. So far, the outlet says seven people have lost jobs due to the story.",
      "\u201cPart of the reason this is such an important line of coverage for Politico right now is it gives readers as close to an unfiltered look at the way powerful people think and express themselves in private as they're going to get,\u201d said Alex Burns, its senior executive editor.",
      "He described texts as one of the few remaining frontiers of inadvertent authenticity. They recall past moments of infamy, like when President Richard Nixon made the ill-advised decision to tape his White House conversations, transcripts of which brought the phrase \u201cexpletive deleted\u201d into the American lexicon.",
      "There are countless cringeworthy moments caught on \u201chot\u201d microphones, such as during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, when President Ronald Reagan joked before a 1984 radio address that \u201cwe begin bombing in five minutes.\" Most public figures now know that virtually everyone around them carries a video camera-equipped smartphone.",
      "Some of the recently-unearthed text messages \u2014 Black people called monkeys or \u201cwatermelon people,\u201d images of gas chambers or urinating on the graves of opponents \u2014 are stunning and dark. You can't help but wonder: what were they thinking? Were they thinking?",
      "Probably not, in part because texting is such a ubiquitous, low-friction form of communication in today's world, said Cal Newton, professor of computer science at Georgetown University. Guards that people have up when talking with other people \u2014 be reasonable, civil, careful \u2014 are often missing.",
      "Some parts of our brain \u201cdon't recognize text on a glowing piece of glass as \u2018I\u2019m in a conversation with other people,'\u201d Newton said. Bad impulses, and the tendency to amplify or exaggerate, slip out because they can't see reactions.",
      "Still, it's not like people don't understand, on some level, that they're communicating on a medium where conversations can be saved on screen shots. There were nervous warning signs in some of the chats: \u201cIf we ever had a leak of this chat we would be cooked,\u201d one young Republican said.",
      "It reminds Sarah Kreps, a Cornell University professor who teaches about the intersection of politics and technology, of politicians whose careers are ruined by affairs. Everyone sees the cautionary tales, but it doesn't stop the behavior.",
      "\u201cThere's this overconfidence \u2014 \u2018it can\u2019t happen to me. It happens to other people and it won't bring me down,'\u201d Kreps said.",
      "Beyond texts, Burns said Politico is in the market for other insightful open source reporting, such as audio, video or behind-the-scenes memos. He would not say whether the Ingrassia texts came as direct result of how Politico handled its previous story, but he believes his outlet has proven it has handled these stories responsibly.",

      "While the Politico stories immediately impacted careers, voters will ultimately decide the impact of the National Review's Oct. 3 story on Jay Jones, the Virginia attorney general candidate.

      "In a statement to Politico for its story, Ingrassia attorney Edward Andrew Paltzik said he did not concede the authenticity of the \u201cpurported\u201d messages. \u201cIn this age of AI, authentication of allegedly leaked messages, which could be outright falsehoods, doctored, or manipulated, or lacking critical context, is extremely difficult,\u201d he said.",
      "The ability now to concoct something that sounds real, coupled with public mistrust in the media, compels news organizations to tell readers as much as possible about how the material was verified without breaking agreements to confidential sources.",
      "In its story about the January 2024 chat that Ingrassia was involved in, Politico said it interviewed two other participants. It explained why the sources were granted anonymity and had the person who showed reporters the entire chain say why they came forward. The second person verified Ingrassia's phone number.",
      "For a story in Lawfare this week about how Lindsey Halligan, the Virginia prosecutor behind the case against New York Attorney General Letitia James, messaged reporter Anna Bower on Signal to complain about some of her reporting, Bower detailed how she made sure it was really her. Bower had assumed it was a hoax; it's rare for a U.S. attorney in a high-profile case to contact a journalist.",
      "She had met Halligan one time years before, and asked the texter to say when that meeting was and who she was with. After the person answered correctly, Bower checked through another source to see if the phone number the messages came from was indeed Halligan's.",
      "Halligan later complained that their text conversation was off the record. Bower explained the rules of journalism to readers: A source must assume that a conversation with a reporter is on the record unless there's an explicit agreement otherwise ahead of time \u2014 and this wasn't done.",
      "The Atlantic editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, wrote at length about how he handled being added to the Signal text chain about military operations. He, too, initially thought it was a hoax. He removed himself from the chat group when he became convinced it was real, then received confirmation from the National Security Council.",
      "Said Burns: \u201cThe burden is always on us to show the reader why we are completely convinced the material is authentic.\"",

      "Elon Musk literally left a government job with a black eye, has seen profits at his car company sink and must worry about federal regulators disrupting his plans to unleash a fleet of driverless taxis on America's roads in the next few years",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 If someone left a government job with a black eye, literally, ran a company with shrinking profits, and suddenly had federal investigators crawling over their business, you might say they\u2019re having a bad year.",
      "But most people are not Elon Musk.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man has only gotten richer this year and shareholders at Tesla, his electric car company, may make him wealthier yet by approving a trillion-dollar pay package in a bet he will succeed with new plans for a \u201crobot army\u201d and other technological breakthroughs even as some past promises remain unfulfilled.",
      "\u201cThe genius of Elon Musk is keeping investors focused on what the company might look in like 5 or 10 years \u2014 while ignoring very near-term challenges,\u201d marvels Garrett Nelson of CFRA Research. Or put more bluntly by Zacks Investment's Brian Mulberry, \"Your average CEO would likely not survive this.\"",
      "Musk started out the year with a side hustle \u2014 promising to cut $2 trillion in government spending as head of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, before cutting that pledge in half. In the end, DOGE posted only $240 billion in savings, according to its own notoriously unreliable estimates, and it's not even clear those savings will hold as the Trump administration scrambles to refill many essential jobs DOGE cut that it shouldn't have.",
      "\u201cThere is a pattern of them announcing great big firings, and then turning about and saying, \u2019No, that\u2019s a mistake,\u2019\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a Brookings Institute senior fellow who has compiled a list of 17,000 positions being refilled. \u201cThey cut without a plan, without regard to function.\u201d",
      "Musk used the same slash-and-burn tactics after he took over Twitter and evidence of that backfiring has emerged this year, too.",
      "In the past two months, he\u2019s settled a pair of lawsuits filed by 2,000 former Twitter employees and executives alleging that they were pushed out under false pretenses or never given severance as promised. The amount the ex-workers got was undisclosed, but if they received even a fraction of the combined $628 million they were demanding, the cost will cut deeply for a company whose advertising has plunged since his takeover.",
      "More bad news for Musk came Wednesday when Tesla announced earnings had plunged 37% in the third quarter. Vehicle sales rose 6% as customers rushed to take advantage of a federal tax credit before it expired last month, but the figure for the full year is expected to drop significantly as car buyers turned off by Musk's right-wing political stances have boycotted the business.",
      "This time a year ago Musk was telling investors sales could grow 20% to 30%.",
      "The stock fell earlier this year as the bad news piled up. But after Musk appeared in the Oval Office in May for his farewell to DOGE sporting a shiner, it has doubled and is now posting a year-to-date gain of nearly 9% after the close of regular trading Wednesday. His net worth has also jumped \u2014 up $62 billion this year to $483 billion, according to Forbes magazine.",

To make his task worth while, Tesla\u2019s directors are asking shareholders to sign off on his enormous new pay package at an annual meeting next month.",
      "But there are big questions surrounding these endeavors, particularly the driverless cabs.",
      "Musk's robotaxis, which began picking up passengers in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco this summer, can\u2019t yet be called driverless because they still require \u201csafety monitors\u201d who are ready to seize control in case something goes wrong, which occasionally happens. One of them drove down the opposing lane, for example.",
      "The robotaxi plans need approval from regulators in various states even as the ones in Washington have swarmed the company.",
      "They've opened four investigations into Tesla so far this year, including one into why it hasn't reported accidents involving its self-driving software quickly to the government as required. Another launched earlier this month is looking into dozens of reported accidents in which Teslas using self-driving software ran red lights and broke other traffic rules, occasionally crashing into other vehicles and causing injuries.",
      "Musk has disappointed before, talking big and missing deadlines repeatedly, only to deliver for shareholders eventually. Tesla investors who held on through a tough 2018 as the company struggled to produce its Model 3 vehicle at a profit, eventually saw their stock soar as sales jumped.",
      "One money manager who rode that earlier surge then bought again earlier this year, says she\u2019s confident Musk's magic is still there and he can pull off the seemingly impossible again.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Researchers have unearthed a spooky pair of dinosaur mummies that seem to have been preserved in an unexpected way.",
      "These dinosaur remains are different from the wrapped mummies of Egypt or natural human mummies that get accidentally preserved in bogs or deserts. Mummified dinosaurs are so old that their skin and soft tissues fossilize. Scientists use these rare remnants, along with dinosaur bones, to recreate what these prehistoric creatures may have looked like.",
      "Scientists have been uncovering dinosaur mummies for over a century. Some were buried quickly after dying, while others sank into bodies of water or dried out.",
      "Many of them \u2014 including a duck-billed dinosaur mummy discovered in 1908 \u2014 hail from an area in eastern Wyoming. In the new study, scientists returned to this so-called mummy zone and found new remains, including the mummy of a duck-billed dinosaur that was only a few years old when it died.",
      "\u201cThis is the first juvenile of a dinosaur that really is mummified,\u201d said Paul Sereno, a University of Chicago paleontologist who was involved in the discovery.",
      "Surprisingly, the new mummies seem to have been preserved without any evidence of fossilized skin. Instead, they left impressions of their skin and scales on a thin layer of clay that hardened with help from microbes.",
      "This style of mummification has preserved other organisms before, but scientists didn't think it could happen on land. It\u2019s possible that other mummies found at the Wyoming site could have formed in a similar way, Sereno said.",

He promised the federation would take \u201cappropriate action\u201d in any case where public harassment or bullying is observed.",
      "The body requires substantial evidence to launch a cheating investigation and may sanction a player who makes unfounded accusations based on emotion or insufficient data, according to its anti-cheating laws. There were no documented reports of the federation investigating Naroditsky.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 For little ghosts, witches, KPop Demon Hunters and superheroes, Halloween is one of the most exciting nights of the year. But it's also one of the busiest for parents as they try to keep track of their trick-or-treaters, give out candy and watch over their homes.",
      "Fortunately, there are some tech tricks out there that can help families stay safe this Halloween, and have a little more fun too.",
      "If your children are outfitted with Apple or Google-branded smart phones or watches or tracking tags, you can use the Find My or Family Link apps to keep tabs on them as they embark on their candy journeys. But don't think of these apps as basic. Because branded peripherals \u2014 like Apple Air Tags or Pixel smartwatches \u2014 are built to be used with Apple and Google platforms, their tracking platforms can be more reliable than some third-party services.",
      "One trick I discovered last Halloween is that I can set up a geofence with Find My. This gave my kids a little more freedom to navigate a set trick-or-treating area while I struggled to keep up with them. If anyone broke from the pack and left the designated area, I would get a notification. Here's how to set it up:",
      "Go to the Find My app on your iPhone. Scroll and tap on the name of the person or device you want to be notified about. Below notifications, tap \u201cAdd,\u201d then \u201cNotify me.\u201d Continue through the menu options until you get to a location option. Choose \u201cNew Location\u201d and you will be given the option to set a location radius. Then you will be asked how often you wish to be notified if the tracked individual leaves the area.",
      "Next is a critical step if you wish to set a recurring notification. Unless it's an air tag, your child must give a one-time authorization to the request. They will receive an alert asking for approval when they arrive at or leave the location you chose for the first time.",
      "Google users have a similar geofencing option. First, you need to set up a new Family Location in the Family Link app. Then select your child in the main menu of the app and tap Family Locations, add the place you just created and select how often you'd like to be notified when they enter or exit the area.",

If your device isn't hardwired, the extra motion from trick-or-treaters could drain your doorbell's batteries quickly (as I discovered). You can also avoid a flood of notifications if you do so.",
      "Smart phones have flashlights, sure, but they're not the brightest nor are they the best option if you're carrying jackets, candy baskets, water bottles or costume parts. Instead, give yourself or your children more portable lumens so they can see (and be seen) easily in the dark.",
      "There are plenty of options for all budget ranges, but I'm partial to lights that you can clip onto jackets or costumes to keep your hands free.",

      "Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is naturally found in every cell and it contains genetic instructions for our bodies to make proteins.

      "Grippin and his Florida colleagues had been developing personalized mRNA cancer vaccines when they realized that even one created without a specific target appeared to spur similar immune activity against cancer.",

      "Data centers needed to fuel AI accounted for about 1.5% of the world\u2019s electricity consumption last year, and those facilities' energy consumption is predicted to more than double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. That increase could lead to burning more fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which release greenhouse gases that contribute to warming temperatures, sea level rise and extreme weather.",
      "But when AI's computing power is used to analyze energy usage and pollution, it can also make buildings more efficient, charge devices at optimal times, make oil and gas production less polluting and schedule traffic lights to reduce vehicle emissions.",

      "AI can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient by automatically adjusting lighting, ventilation, heating and cooling based on weather data, electricity usage and other factors, said Bob French, chief evangelist at the building automation company 75F. Around one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution comes from homes and buildings.",
      "Letting AI schedule air conditioning and heating around workers' arrivals and departures can be more efficient than manually adjusting the thermostat. Otherwise, a worker's instinct might be to blast the air to quickly adjust the temperature. Automated thermostats can be particularly useful for smaller buildings where it's not cost-effective to overhaul the entire heating and cooling system.",
      "For building ventilation, automation can balance the intake of outside air against how much heating or cooling is needed to maintain indoor temperatures.",
      "AI can also monitor the maintenance needs of HVAC systems and other equipment to predict and detect failures before they lead to costlier repairs.",
      "Combined, these automations can reduce a building's energy consumption by between 10% and 30%, experts said.",

      "AI can schedule the most efficient charging of electric vehicles and other devices such as smartphones.",
      "This means setting a schedule for when it is best to draw power from the grid, such as overnight, when demand and rates are lower so it\u2019s less likely to make the grid burn more fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s say it\u2019s a peak period when everybody\u2019s got their air conditioning on, and I walk in my house and I plug in my car and I have it set up such that my car doesn\u2019t start charging right away because it\u2019s peak period time,\u201d Abramson said.",

      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \u201csuperintelligence\u201d that threatens humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says:",
      "\u201cWe call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\u201d",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\u201d",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\u201d",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\u201cThis is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It\u2019s simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\u201d",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",

      "\u201cYeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \u201cBut does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don\u2019t want that.\u201d",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\u201cIn the past, it\u2019s mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\u201d said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cI feel what we\u2019re really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\u201d",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of stuff that\u2019s overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\u201d Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to pause the development of more powerful AI models temporarily. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\u201cI really empathize for them, frankly, because they\u2019re so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\u201d Tegmark said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\u201d",

      "Chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky has died at the age of 29",
      "Daniel Naroditsky, a 29-year-old standard-bearer in the world of competitive speed chess that flourished in the COVID-19 pandemic, died over the weekend and leaves behind a legacy as one of the greats of the game who helped usher in its digital era.",
      "The American grandmaster won several championships and amassed hundreds of thousands of subscribers on YouTube, Twitch and other platforms, where he would livestream matches and explain strategy in real time. But he also struggled with the cyberspace he helped build.",
      "High-speed games became wildly popular online during the pandemic, creating a chess community that was soon rife with cheating allegations as players gained access to sophisticated computer programs that could give them an unfair advantage.",
      "Naroditsky's untimely death has shined a spotlight on the dark underbelly of the game that fellow pros say brought undue hostility upon the chess star in his final months.",
      "Naroditsky had been accused of cheating, and the allegations, never proven, had taken a toll. Ukrainian grandmaster Oleksandr Bortnyk, a competitor and friend of Naroditsky, was concerned and went to check on him Sunday. He and a friend found Naroditsky, known to many as Danya, unresponsive on a couch in his North Carolina home, Bortnyk recounted during an emotional livestream Monday.",
      "The cause of death has not been made public.",
      "\u201cDanya was not only a brilliant grandmaster, but also a tireless ambassador for chess, and above all \u2014 a kind, compassionate and truly good person,\u201d said Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation.",
      "The unsubstantiated claims of cheating came from from Russian grandmaster and former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik, whom Naroditsky had called one of the \u201cheroes\u201d he looked up to as a kid.",
      "Naroditsky had denied the claims as he excelled at blitz and bullet chess, where players have mere minutes to finish intense matches.",
      "\u201cEver since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,\u201d Naroditsky said Saturday in the last livestream he filmed before his death. \u201cThe issue is just the lingering effect of it.\u201d",
      "He ruminated about his legacy and hoped other top players would trust that he played with integrity.",
      "Chess pros from around the world have since praised Naroditsky as an honorable player who used his online platform to make chess more accessible. His family said in a statement that they hope he will be remembered for the joy and inspiration he brought people.",
      "Meanwhile, grandmasters have slammed Kramnik on social media for how he treated Naroditsky. American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura went on an expletive-laden rant on his latest livestream, and Indian grandmaster Nihal Sarin accused the Russian pro of trying to destroy Naroditsky's life in a post on X.",
      "Kramnik continued to post about Naroditsky on the day his death was announced, calling it a tragedy and speculating about the cause.",

He was consistently ranked in the top 200 worldwide for traditional chess and was a top 25 blitz player, winning the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August. He spent much of his time training young players.",
      "\u201cDaniel was an incredible teacher and explainer of chess and concepts and ideas,\u201d said Daniel Weissbarth, a renowned chess instructor and the co-owner of Silver Knights Chess Academy in Virginia.",
      "Many pros this week called for an end to the constant finger-pointing that seemed to follow players like Naroditsky who thrived in fast-paced play.",
      "Kenneth Regan, a chess international master and computer science professor at the University at Buffalo, said the opportunity to cheat has exploded as the cerebral sport has shifted online. There are ways to police the game online, but Regan said they are intrusive.",
      "\u201cThe rate of cheating online is 100 to 200 times higher than the rate over the board,\u201d Regan said. \u201cFrom my point of view, there are five to 10 cases per year over the board.\u201d",
      "The popular internet chess server Chess.com shut down Kramnik\u2019s blog on the site in 2023, saying he had used it to spread baseless cheating allegations about \u201cmany dozens of players.\u201d At the time, the platform warned of \u201cKramnik\u2019s escalating attacks\u201d against some of the most respected members of the chess community and some promising young talents.",
      "The speedy style of play popularized in chess' digital arena is somewhat reliant on the honor system.",
      "Top talents analyze the board so quickly and move with such precision that cheating allegations have become common. Bullet chess is so fast, Regan said, that it's essentially \u201cplaying chess entirely with your gut.\u201d",
      "Last week, Naroditsky posted a video in his popular Speedrun series on YouTube, telling viewers he was \u201cback, better than ever\u201d after a short \u201ccreative break.\u201d His videos, in which he gave tips and discussed strategy, were great tools for chess players of various abilities, said Benjamin Balas, a psychology professor at North Dakota State.",
      "\u201cHe would tell you \u2018This is the kind of mistake you\u2019re going to see at this level,\u2019 and he would make mistakes, too, and talk to you how to manage them,\u201d Balas said.",
      "Nakamura and five-time World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen are also using social media to take chess to a wider audience, increasing its popularity around the world.",
      "\u201cPeople, they see Daniel or other streamers and they start to play online chess,\u201d said John Hartmann, editor of Chess Life magazine. \u201cThe streaming personalities, they lead people into the chess world.\u201d",
      "Carlsen credited Naroditsky for his work in the streaming space, saying he was \u201csuch a resource to the chess community.\u201d",

      "Netflix missed the earnings target set by stock market analysts during the video streamer\u2019s latest quarter, a letdown that the company blamed on a tax dispute in Brazil.",
      "The results announced Tuesday broke Netflix's six-quarter streak of posting a profit that eclipsed analysts' projections.",
      "The Los Gatos, California, cited an unexpected $619 million expense tied to the Brazilian tax dispute for the earnings shortfall while hailing its lineup of distinctive TV series and films for keeping its audience engaged and delivering a mix of subscriber fees and increased ad sales that helped it deliver revenue that matched analyst forecasts.",
      "Investors, though, weren't placated by the explanation as Netflix's shares still fell by about 6% in extended trading after the numbers came out.",
      "Analysts varied in their interpretation of the third-quarter report.",
      "Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro worries Netflix is using the Brazilian tax hit as a way to mask signs of a slowdown in subscriber growth and advertising amid economy uncertainty. \u201cThe truth is that the company failed to deliver the kind of growth we\u2019ve grown used to over the past couple of years,\u201d he said.",
      "But Zacks analyst Jeremy Mullin said he sees little reason for concern, asserting Netflix's \u201cunderlying story remains solid.\u201d",
      "Netflix earned $2.5 billion, or $5.87 per share, in its July-September quarter, an 8% increase from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 17% from last year to $11.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted the Los Gatos, California, company to earn $6.96 per share on revenue of $11.5 billion.",
      "Delivering solid financial growth has become more important than ever for Netflix as management has steered investors from fixating on how many subscribers its service gains from one quarter to the next. As part of that process, Netflix stopped disclosing its subscribers at the end of last year.",
      "The shift has paid off so far, with Netflix\u2019s stock price rising about 40% so far this year, although the downturn in extended trading signaled some of those gains are about to evaporate.",
      "Although Netflix no longer reveals the specific, this year\u2019s revenue growth signals that its worldwide subscriber count has increased from the roughly 302 million it had at the end of last year \u2013 by far the most among video streamers, even as rivals with deeper pockets such as Amazon and Apple expand their programming selections.",

      "And now Netflix may have another opportunity to add even more compelling programming with Warner Bros. Discovery announcing it may sell all or part of its holdings, which include HBO, DC Studios and CNN. Analysts are already speculating that Netflix may join the bidders looking to grab a piece of Warner Bros. Discovery.",
      "In response to a question about Netflix's acquisition strategy, Sarandos noted that the company traditionally has been \u201cmore builders than buyers\u201d without ruling out a potential bid for some of Warner Bros. Discovery's properties other than cable TV networks like CNN and TBS. \u201cWe can be and will be choosey,\u201d Sarandos said.",
      "The company has also mining a new vein of revenue by selling commercials as part of a low-priced option of its service it introduced three years ago.",
      "Although the advertising business still isn\u2019t large enough to require the company to disclose its sales, management expects its revenue to more than double from last year. A recent analyst by S & P forecast $1.1 billion in ad sales for Netflix this year \u2014 a figure that would represent about 2% of its projected total revenue.",
      "It\u2019s getting to the point that Netflix may be in danger of trying to juggle too many ball at once, said Forrester Research analyst Mike Proulx. \u201cIf the company goes too broad to become all things entertainment, it risks diluting its core.\u201d",

      "U.S. and Chinese officials reached what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described as a \"very successful framework\" for discussions between Trump and Xi.",
      "Bessent told reporters Sunday that the talks covered a wide range of issues, including trade, rare earths, fentanyl, TikTok, agricultural purchases and the broader bilateral relationship.",
      "He characterized the discussions as \"constructive, far-reaching, in depth and giving us the ability to move forward and set the stage for the leaders meeting, in a very positive framework.\"",
      "The negotiations were led by Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and took place inside the Merdeka 118 skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur. Bessent noted that this marks his fifth meeting with the Chinese vice premier.",
      "Bessent said that coming out of the meeting, he would say \"yes\", that the trade truce between the two countries would be extended, while adding that it's ultimately the president's decision.",

      "Following his stop in Malaysia, Trump will then travel to Japan where he's expected to sit down with Japan's new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. A political conservative, Takaichi is the country's first female leader. While the U.S. and Japan have already secured a trade deal, the two will highlight that aspect of the U.S.-Japan relationship.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump is also expected to visit South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit. While there, Trump will hold a bilateral meeting with the president of the Republic of Korea, deliver keynote remarks at the APEC CEO luncheon and participate in APEC working dinner.",
      "The visit comes after major tensions between South Korea and the U.S. after more than 400 South Korean workers were arrested, detained and deported at a Hyundai plant in Georgia as part of Trump's immigration crackdown.",
      "It came after Hyundai poured billions into the factory to align with Trump's vision of manufacturing in America in order to avoid the brunt of Trump's tariff policies.",

      "Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney also is expected to attend APEC and the other Asia meetings, and one of Trump's top economic advisers said Friday Trump and Carney will speak while there about their latest tariff dispute.",
      "Just before leaving for Asia, Trump abruptly ended trade talks with Canada, saying he was angry about a TV ad put out by the province of Ontario featuring Ronald Reagan in 1987 criticizing tariffs. Trump claimed it was an attempt to \"illegally influence\" the U.S. Supreme Court, which is set to hear arguments next month over whether he has the power to unilaterally impose tariffs.",
      "His visit also comes just days after he slapped more sanctions on Russian oil companies and continues to call on allies to pull back on purchases of Russian crude.",
      "On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said those sanctions are already having an impact on, with China and India \"scaling back\" their contracts.",

      "Centuries-old private libraries are bringing modern comfort and awe to book lovers and history buffs in New England",
      "BOSTON -- When David Arsenault takes down a worn, leather-bound 19th-century book from the winding shelves of the Boston Athenaeum, he feels a sense of awe \u2014 like he\u2019s handling an artifact in a museum.",
      "Many of the half a million books that line the library's seemingly endless maze of reading room shelves and stacks were printed before his great-great-grandparents were born. Among fraying copies of Charles Dickens novels, Civil War-era biographies and town genealogies, everything has a history and a heartbeat.",
      "\u201cIt almost feels like you shouldn\u2019t be able to take the books out of the building, it feels so special,\u201d said Arsenault, who visits the institution adjacent to Boston Common a few times a week. \u201cYou do feel like, and in a lot of ways, you are, in a museum \u2014 but it\u2019s a museum you get to not feel like you\u2019re a visitor in all the time, but really a part of.\u201d",
      "The more than 200-year-old institution is one of only about 20 member-supported private libraries in the U.S. dating back to the 18th- and 19th-centuries. Called athenaeums, a Greek word meaning \u201ctemple of Athena,\u201d the concept predates the traditional public library most Americans recognize today. The institutions were built by merchants, doctors, writers, lawyers and ministers who wanted to not only create institutions for reading \u2014 then an expensive and difficult-to-access hobby \u2014 but also space to explore culture and debate.",
      "Many of these athenaeums still play a vibrant role in their communities.",
      "Patrons gather to play games, join discussions on James Joyce, or even research family history. Others visit to explore some of the nation\u2019s most prized artifacts, such as the largest collection from George Washington \u2019s personal library at Mount Vernon at the Boston Athenaeum.",
      "In addition to conservation work, institutions acquire and uplift the work of more modern creatives who may have been overlooked. The Boston Athenaeum recently co-debuted an exhibit by painter Allan Rohan Crite, who died in 2007 and used his canvas to depict the joy of Black life in the city.",
      "One thing binds all athenaeums together: books and people who love them.",
      "\u201cThe whole institution is built around housing the books,\u201d said Matt Burriesci, executive director of Providence Athenaeum in Rhode Island. \u201cThe people who come to this institution really appreciate just holding a book in their hands and reading it the old-fashioned way.\u201d",
      "Built to mimic an imposing Greek temple, staffers at the Providence Athenaeum often talk about the joy of watching people enter for the first time.",
      "Visitors must climb a series of cold, granite steps. Only then are they met with a thick wooden door that ushers them into a warm world filled with cozy reading nooks, hidden desks to leave secret messages to fellow patrons, and almost every square inch bursting with books.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the actual time capsule of people\u2019s reading habits over 200 years,\u201d Burriesci said, while pointing to a first-edition of Little Women, where the pages and spine proudly showcase years of being well read.",
      "Many athenaeums are designed to pay tribute to Greek influence and their namesake, the goddess of wisdom. In Boston, a city once dubbed \u201cthe Athens of America,\u201d visitors to the athenaeum are greeted by a nearly 7-foot-tall (2.1-meter-tall) bronze statue of Athena Giustiniani.",

      "The 12-level building includes five gallery floors where ornate busts of writers and historical figures decorate reading rooms with wooden tables overlooked by book-lined pathways reachable by spiral and hidden staircases.",
      "Natural light shines in from large windows where guests can look down to see one of Boston's most historic cemeteries where figures like Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, and John Hancock are buried.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re able to leave many of these things out for people to peruse, and I think people can often get curious about something and just follow their curiosity into things that they didn\u2019t even know that they were going to be fascinated by,\u201d said Boston Athenaeum executive director Leah Rosovsky.",
      "When athenaeums were founded, they were exclusive spaces that only people with education and money could access.",
      "Some are now free. Most are open to the public for day passes and tours. Memberships to the Boston Athenaeum can range from $17 to $42 a month per person, depending on whether the patron is under 40 or is sharing the membership with family members.",
      "Charlie Grantham, a wedding photographer and aspiring novelist, said she first visited during one of the institution\u2019s annual community days, where the public can explore for free. She said she was surprised by how accessible it was and describes the space as \u201cBoston\u2019s best kept secret \u2014 an oasis in the middle of the city.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so peaceful. Even if I\u2019m still working... doing things I\u2019m stressed out about at home, when I\u2019m here, there\u2019s like a stillness about it and things feel more manageable, things feel enjoyable here,\u201d she said.",
      "Some people visit every day to work remotely, read or socialize, said Salem Athenaeum executive director Jean Marie Procious.",
      "\u201cWe do have a loneliness crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we want to encourage people to come and see us as a space to meet up with others and a safe environment that you\u2019re not expected to buy a drink or buy a meal.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "More anti-abortion pregnancy centers have been offering medical services such as testing for sexually transmitted infections",
      "Pregnancy centers in the U.S. that discourage women from getting abortions have been adding more medical services \u2014 and could be poised to expand further.",
      "The expansion \u2014 ranging from testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections to even providing primary medical care \u2014 has been unfolding for years. It gained steam after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three years ago, clearing the way for states to ban abortion.",
      "The push could get more momentum with Planned Parenthood closing some clinics and considering shuttering others following changes to Medicaid. Planned Parenthood is not just the nation's largest abortion provider, but also offers cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and other reproductive health services.",
      "\u201cWe ultimately want to replace Planned Parenthood with the services we offer,\u201d said Heather Lawless, founder and director of Reliance Center in Lewiston, Idaho. She said about 40% of patients at the anti-abortion center are there for reasons unrelated to pregnancy, including some who use the nurse practitioner as a primary caregiver.",
      "The changes have frustrated abortion-rights groups, who, in addition to opposing the centers' anti-abortion messaging, say they lack accountability; refuse to provide birth control; and most offer only limited ultrasounds that cannot be used for diagnosing fetal anomalies because the people conducting them don't have that training. A growing number also offer unproven abortion-pill reversal treatments.",
      "Because most of the centers don't accept insurance, the federal law restricting release of medical information doesn't apply to them, though some say they follow it anyway. They also don't have to follow standards required by Medicaid or private insurers, though those offering certain services generally must have medical directors who comply with state licensing requirements.",
      "\u201cThere are really bedrock questions,\u201d said Jennifer McKenna, a senior adviser for Reproductive Health and Freedom Watch, a project funded by liberal policy organizations that researches the pregnancy centers, \u201cabout whether this industry has the clinical infrastructure to provide the medical services it\u2019s currently advertising.\u201d",
      "Perhaps best known as \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers,\u201d these mostly privately funded and religiously affiliated centers were expanding services such as diaper banks ahead of the Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling.",
      "As abortion bans kicked in, the centers expanded medical, educational and other programs, said Moira Gaul, a scholar at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of SBA Pro-Life America. \u201cThey are prepared to serve their communities for the long-term,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "In Sacramento, California, for instance, Alternatives Pregnancy Center in the last two years has added family practice doctors, a radiologist and a specialist in high-risk pregnancies, along with nurses and medical assistants. Alternatives \u2014 an affiliate of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of pregnancy centers in the U.S \u2014 is some patients' only health provider.",
      "When The Associated Press asked to interview a patient who had received only non-pregnancy services, the clinic provided Jessica Rose, a 31-year-old woman who took the rare step of detransitioning after spending seven years living as a man, during which she received hormone therapy and a double mastectomy.",
      "For the last two years, she\u2019s received all medical care at Alternatives, which has an OB-GYN who specializes in hormone therapy. Few, if any, pregnancy centers advertise that they provide help with detransitioning. Alternatives has treated four similar patients over the past year, though that's not its main mission, director Heidi Matzke said.",
      "\u201cAPC provided me a space that aligned with my beliefs as well as seeing me as a woman,\u201d Rose said. She said other clinics \"were trying to make me think that detransitioning wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do.\u201d",
      "As of 2024, more than 2,600 anti-abortion pregnancy centers operated in the U.S., up 87 from 2023, according to the Crisis Pregnancy Center Map, a project led by University of Georgia public health researchers who are concerned about aspects of the centers. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 765 clinics offered abortions last year, down more than 40 from 2023.",
      "Over the years, pregnancy centers have received a boost in taxpayer funds. Nearly 20 states, largely Republican-led, now funnel millions of public dollars to these organizations. Texas alone sent $70 million to pregnancy centers this fiscal year, while Florida dedicated more than $29 million for its \u201cPregnancy Support Services Program\u201d",
      "This boost in resources is unfolding as Republicans have barred Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds under the tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. While federal law already blocked the use of taxpayer funds for most abortions, Medicaid reimbursements for other health services were a big part of Planned Parenthood's revenue.",

      "Thomas Glessner, founder and president of the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, a network of 1,800 centers, said the centers do have government oversight through their medical directors. \u201cTheir criticism,\u201d he said, \u201ccomes from a political agenda.\u201d",
      "In recent years, five Democratic state attorneys general have issued warnings that the centers, which advertise to people seeking abortions, don't provide them and don't refer patients to clinics that do.

      "Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, with limited experience in international affairs, will have to manage Trump's demands and unpredictability and China's wariness of her strong support for a military build-up and her right-wing views on Japan's invasion of China before and during World War II.",
      "She arrives in Malaysia on Saturday for meetings with Southeast Asian leaders, then returns to Japan to meet Trump before heading to South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit at the end of the week.",
      "In her first news conference as prime minister, she described her schedule as \u201cpacked\u201d with diplomatic events and said it will be a valuable opportunity to meet other regional leaders.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping will also attend the summit in South Korea, where talks with Trump are planned, but a one-on-one meeting with Takaichi would be a surprise.",
      "Neither Xi nor Chinese Premier Li Qiang has publicly congratulated Takaichi since she became prime minister on Tuesday. They extended immediate congratulations to her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, who held more moderate positions on China.",
      "America has long been Japan\u2019s most important ally and protector, but as with NATO and other allies, Trump has demanded Japan contribute more for its defense. His tariffs on imports have also delivered a blow to the country\u2019s economy.",
      "Takaichi pledged Friday to accelerate a plan to increase defense spending to 2% of Japan's GDP, a measure of the size of the economy. The target would be reached in March instead of 2027, she said.",
      "\u201cIn the region around Japan, military activities and other actions from our neighbors China, North Korea and Russia are causing grave concerns,\u201d she said in a policy speech to parliament.",
      "Trump may be more focused in both Japan and South Korea on his demands for more investment in the United States, particularly for factories that would create jobs for American workers.",
      "Takaichi could benefit from being a political prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who appeared to have won Trump\u2019s trust during the American president\u2019s first term.",
      "She shares Abe's views on wartime history, perhaps even more strongly than he did. Before becoming prime minister, she was among conservative lawmakers who regularly paid respects to Japan\u2019s war dead at Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo.",
      "The visits anger both China and South Korea because the enshrined include former leaders convicted of war crimes for their actions during World War II.",
      "Takaichi notably skipped a visit during the autumn festival earlier this month, when it appeared likely she would become Japan\u2019s leader.",
      "Her paramount mission now is political stability, and experts think she will refrain from expressing her views on the war and stay away from the shrine to avoid any flareups that could shake her weak and untested coalition government.",

      "The allegations of fraud appeared to be motivated by the defendants' desire to make money and keep their jobs and was not an effort to influence the election results, said Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday, a Republican.",
      "Guillermo Sainz, 33, described by prosecutors as the director of a company's registration drives in Pennsylvania, was charged with three counts of solicitation of registration, a state law that prohibits offering money to reach registration quotas. A message seeking comment was left on a number associated with Sainz, who lives in Arizona. He did not have a lawyer listed in court records.",
      "The six canvassers are charged with unsworn falsification, tampering with public records, forgery and violations of Pennsylvania election law. The charges relate to activities in three Republican-leaning Pennsylvania counties: York, Lancaster and Berks.",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the motive behind these crimes was personal financial gain, and not a conspiracy or organized effort to tip any election for any one candidate or party,\u201d Sunday said in a news release. Prosecutors said the forms included all party affiliations.",
      "In a court affidavit filed with the criminal charges on Friday, investigators said Sainz, an employee of Field+Media Corps, \"instituted unlawful financial incentives and pressures in his push to meet company goals to maintain funding which in turn spurred some canvassers to create and submit fake forms to earn more money.\"",
      "The chief executive of Field+Media Corps, based in Mesa, Arizona, said last year the company was proud of its work to expand voting but had no information about problematic registration forms. A message seeking comment was left Friday for the CEO, Francisco Heredia. The Field+Media Corps website did not appear to be operative.",
      "Field+Media was funded by Everybody Votes, an effort to improve voter registration rates in communities of color. The affidavit said Everybody Votes \u201cfully cooperated\u201d with the investigation and noted its contract with Field+Media prohibited payments on a per-registration basis.",

Another told investigators that most of the registration forms he collected were \u201cnot real.\u201d A third reported that when she realized she was not going to reach a daily quota, \u201cshe would make up names and information,\u201d police wrote, \u201cdue to fear of losing her job.\u201d",

At a campaign event, he declared there was \u201ccheating\u201d involving \u201c2,600\u201d votes.

      "Statues of Rosa Parks and Helen Keller, pivotal figures who fought for justice and inspired change across the world, were unveiled Friday on the grounds of the Alabama Capitol.",
      "The monuments honoring the Alabama natives whose advocacy helped dismantle racial segregation and promoted the rights of people with disabilities are the first statues of women to be installed on the lawn of the Alabama Capitol, broadening the history reflected on the grounds that also include tributes to the Confederacy, which was formed at the site in 1861.",
      "Gov. Kay Ivey, currently the nation's longest serving female governor, said Parks and Keller \u201crose to shape history through quiet strength and unwavering conviction.\u201d",
      "\u201cCourage changes the course of history, and today, these statutes stand as symbols of that courage \u2014 testaments to what one person, especially one determined one, can do to make the world a better place,\u201d Ivey said.",
      "Known as the mother of the Civil Rights Movement, Parks was arrested on Dec. 1, 1955, when she refused to leave her bus seat for a white passenger. While Parks was not the first woman arrested for defying bus segregation laws, her arrest became the catalyst for the yearlong boycott by Black passengers and helped usher in change nationwide.",
      "Born in 1880 in Tuscumbia, Alabama, Keller became deaf and blind after a serious illness before her second birthday. Her tutor, Anne Sullivan, taught her to communicate through sign language and Braille, and she became a well-known writer and lecturer who championed the rights of workers, poor people, women and people with disabilities.",
      "The statue of Parks, themed as \"a step into equality,\" shows her as if boarding a bus, just across the Capitol steps from a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, a fitting location for an icon who showed \"how to fight against racial segregation and inequality in a non violent way,\u201d the Rev. Agnes M. Lover said.",
      "Parks appears to peer down Dexter Avenue. That's the street where she boarded the bus that history-making day, and also the site of slave markets in the 1800s as well as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Dexter Avenue Church, where mass meetings were held to organize the bus boycott.",
      "Park's statue looks over the grounds where a huge crowd formed at the end of the 1965 voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery. That her monument is also just a stone's throw from Davis, who helped tear the nation apart trying to preserve slavery \u2014 is likely to raise some eyebrows.",
      "The removal of memorials to Confederate figures like Davis was a key goal of the wave of activism that followed the 2015 slaughtering of nine Black church parishioners by a white supremacist gunman who idolized Confederate symbols. More than 480 symbols and statues were removed nationwide since then, according to the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s \u201cWhose Heritage?\u201d campaign.",
      "But Alabama forbids the removal of longstanding monuments, and while few cities, such as Birmingham, have defied that law, the Davis statue remains.",

      "Within a month, more than 2,300 National Guard troops from eight states and the district were patrolling the city under the command of the Secretary of the Army. Trump also deployed hundreds of federal agents to assist in patrols.",
      "It Is unclear how long the deployments will last, but attorneys from Schwalb\u2019s office said Guard troops are likely to remain in the city through at least next summer.",
      "\u201cOur constitutional democracy will never be the same if these occupations are permitted to stand,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Government lawyers said Congress empowered the president to control the D.C. National Guard\u2019s operation. They argued that Schwalb\u2019s lawsuit is a frivolous \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d threatening to undermine a successful campaign to reduce violent crime in the district.",
      "Republican governors from several states also sent units to D.C. Although the emergency period ended in September, more than 2,200 troops remain. Several states told The Associated Press they would bring their units home by Nov. 30, unless extended.",
      "Among the states that sent troops to the nation's capital was West Virginia. A civic organization called the West Virginia Citizen Action Group says Gov. Patrick Morrisey exceeded his authority by deploying 300 to 400 National Guard members to support Trump's efforts there.",
      "Under state law, the group argues, the governor may deploy the National Guard out of state only for certain purposes, such as responding to a natural disaster or another state\u2019s emergency request.",

      "Morrisey has said West Virginia \u201cis proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation\u2019s capital,\" and his office has said the deployment was authorized under federal law. The state attorney general's office has asked Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Richard D. Lindsay to reject the case, saying the group has not been harmed and lacks standing to challenge the governor's decision.",

      "Doris Brown\u2019s home in Northeast Houston becomes a refuge for neighbors during power outages thanks to her solar panel and battery system",
      "HOUSTON -- Doris Brown was nearly asleep when a neighbor knocked on her door, telling her to look outside. \u201cThere were no lights, nowhere,\u201d said Brown, recalling the power outage that summer night in 2023. \u201cI didn't even know it.\u201d",
      "Brown's solar panel and battery system was keeping her power on. She'd prepared for a night like this. \u201cCall everybody,\u201d she told the neighbor.",
      "Soon around 15 \u201cneighbors and neighbors' neighbors\u201d were inside Brown's three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath home in Northeast Houston. They charged phones, cooked, and showered before work and school. Some slept over.",
      "\u201cThere were people sleeping everywhere,\u201d said Brown, 75. She was happy to be \u201ca port in a storm,\u201d despite one downside: \u201cThey ate all my snacks.\u201d",
      "Brown's house is a \u201chub home,\u201d one of seven in a Northeast Houston pilot program meant to create emergency safe havens \u2014 not at shelters or community centers, but inside neighbors' houses.",
      "The idea was a grassroots response to decades of community disinvestment and neglect that got neighbors talking about what they could do to be ready for extreme weather and power outages.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s us helping us,\u201d said Brown.",
      "The project was set to reach 30 more homes, until the Environmental Protection Agency in August canceled the $7 billion Solar for All program which would have funded its expansion. Harris County, which includes Houston, is now a plaintiff in one of multiple lawsuits over the cancellation.",
      "People involved with the program acknowledge hub homes are unconventional \u2014 requiring trust and community cooperation and impacting fewer people than a larger resilience center.",
      "But they also say they're effective in creating pockets of preparedness in communities confronting more extreme weather but lacking resources to do more.",
      "\u201cIt was a way to increase resilience in those neighborhoods that are often forgotten,\u201d said Sam Silerio, Texas program director at Solar United Neighbors, one of the nonprofits involved with the pilot program which is also suing over the cuts.",
      "The hub homes idea started after Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when freezing temperatures crippled Texas' power grid for five days and led to 246 storm-related deaths, according to the Texas Department of Health Services.",
      "Power loss contributed to many of the deaths, as people with health conditions couldn't refrigerate medicines or run life-sustaining medical devices. Nineteen people died from carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly using generators and grills to stay warm.",
      "\u201cWe were like, \u2018Shoot, power grid failure is a serious thing that we are not prepared for\u2019,\u201d said Becky Selle, co-director of disaster preparedness, organizing, and operations at West Street Recovery, a Northeast Houston nonprofit founded after Hurricane Harvey in 2017.",
      "WSR bought some generators for residents willing to share the resource. Brown, who almost froze to death herself in Uri, stepped up.",
      "WSR added more supplies to the hubs, like life jackets and kayaks for flood evacuations, and held preparedness trainings for members.",
      "When the D.C.-based nonprofit Solar United Neighbors approached them with a private grant from the Hive Fund to add free solar panels and batteries to several houses, WSR knew exactly where to install them.",
      "The pilot had its challenges \u2014 some roofs had to be repaired before they could hold solar panels, and hub captains had to learn how to manage their batteries to not deplete them.",
      "Success also required neighborly connection that modern communities often lack.",
      "\u201cYou have to build that trust,\u201d said David Espinoza, a hub home captain and West Street Recovery\u2019s co-director of community organizing and language access. The 34-year-old went door-to-door on his block, introducing himself to sometimes wary neighbors. \u201cI got to know my neighborhood a lot better,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s the missing link in the disaster resilience ecosystem,\u201d said Hanvin. \u201cAt the end of the day, the first thing you need (in an emergency) to help you is a person.\u201d",

      "Running strips you down. The less clothing you wear, the faster you go. The lighter your shoes, the faster you go. As you go faster, your head empties too. At a certain point, all you can register is the sensation of each foot striking the pavement. Mind and matter briefly become one.",

And no sport shows the relentless decline of the aging body more clearly than running. If you can't do what you did a year or a month ago, the evidence is right there on your watch.",
      "Sometimes, I use running as a form of meditation. I put on my shoes and go out. I connect my watch to satellites and then try to disconnect my mind from the swirl inside. Eventually, I'm alone in my head. Sometimes, I'll focus on a musical mantra: \"one-two-three, one-two-three,\" tracking my steps and making sure I keep my left and right feet alternating symmetrically on the downbeat. Other times, I focus on my breath or on the sounds and motion around me, whether the blue jays in the Catskills or the trucks rumbling by on Broadway. Sometimes, as with all meditation, my attention wanders, like a stream flowing haphazardly through my mind, collecting sticks and carrying them until they wash to the side.",
      "When I run a workout, though, everything changes. I'm not trying to open my mind; I'm trying to close it. I shut out the blue jays and the trucks. I have to focus. If I'm with a training partner, I lock my attention on their shoulder if I'm behind or on their breath if I'm ahead. Usually, though, I'm on my own. I look for runners up the road and set imaginary races against them: Can I catch the lady in the purple sweatshirt before the second oak tree? Can I stay an even twenty meters behind the cyclist playing John Coltrane on a boom box? I check my watch and try not to let my pace deviate from the goal. I try to identify the parts of my body that hurt and then I push the pain away from them. I remind myself that I have run this fast before. Self-doubt is a smoldering fire. In a workout, the embers often flash. I don't want to give them any air. Every action we take helps to build our habits. Quit once and it'll be easier to quit the second time too.",
      "I don't listen to music while I run. Every workout is a physical challenge \u2014 I'm trying to strengthen the muscles in my legs and my heart \u2014 but it's also a mental challenge. I'm trying to teach my body how to move quickly and with good coordination through space. Running is a process of learning about your body and developing habits deep inside it. Music can confuse the signals. I want to deepen my understanding of the relationship between my stride, my pace, my breath. I don't want a bassline, or the adrenaline that can flow with it, to get in the way.",
      "When I race in a marathon, my goal early on is to spend as little energy as possible thinking about anything extraneous. I think about posture and form and balance. I try not to think about the people cheering. I try not to think about past fail\u00adures or successes. I try to glance as infrequently as possible at my watch. It takes energy, after all, to turn your head, and it takes energy to think. When people in my pack ask questions, or offer commentary, I respond in grunts. On easy runs with friends in the park, I'm a chatterbox. When I race, I'm a vault.",
      "Over the years, the sport has shifted my imagination and my sense of self. When I travel by train, I find myself looking out the window and noting spots to run by the creeks and forests nearby. When I arrive in a new city, I like to circle it with a run. I've seen more of the world while running than I have while walking. I have recurring dreams of mountains I've run up. But I spend much of the day at a desk, mind-wired to my to-do list. Running is my one connection to na\u00adture and to a younger, adventurous self who only and always wanted to be outside.",

      "Over the past three decades, Kenny Chesney has been one of the most celebrated singers in music. In his first book, \"Heart Life Music\" (written with journalist Holly Gleason, to be published Tuesday by William Morrow), Chesney recounts his life's journey, from East Tennessee, to No Shoes Nation and beyond.",
      "Read an excerpt below, in which he writes about a soulful collaboration with singer-songwriter Grace Potter \u2013 and don't miss Lee Cowan's interview with Kenny Chesney on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" October 26!",
      "\"Heart Life Music\" by Kenny Chesney with Holly Gleason",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Grace",
      "There was a show on tv called \"Let's Make A Deal.\" People would be contestants, hoping host Monty Hall would pick them to compete for prizes. New cars, new kitchens with all the appliances, expensive watches. You had to pick.",
      "",
      "One of two things: color tvs and washer/dryer sets, or what was behind Door No. 3, knowing it could be a wheelbarrow with some grass seed, or a new car.",
      "I've always been attracted to what's behind Door No. 3. That idea of the big unknown you can't see always appealed to me. The seeker inside has chased the unknown all my life.",
      "When you're a dreamer, you can't not take Door No. 3. That mentality fuels you. Seeking inspiration, wanting to find out has risk involved. Some Door No. 3s don't work out. But Grace Potter? She's the epitome of why Door No. 3 is always better than playing it safe.",
      "\"You & Tequila\" showed up in my email in the middle of the night.",
      "I remember listening, thinking, \"Damn\u2026,\"",
      "That idea of a person you can't quit, because they're so addictive is real. You can't resist, only overdo it to the point of poisoning yourself hit me. I called Matraca Berg, asked if there was a demo with a man singing it; she had one. Hearing Tim Krekel sing it hit me even harder.",
      "We cut it really simple. That pull between what you want and knowing you shouldn't made \"You & Tequila\" burn into people.",
      "We were about done with Hemingway's Whiskey. I wanted something to make it shine. Buddy Cannon and I were talking about who might sound good; Clint Higham, my co-manager, even reached out to Irving Azoff about the Eagles, since this sounded like a classic Laurel Canyon song.",
      "Then the woman who sent me the demo asked, \"Why don't you get Grace Potter? She captures that haunted and haunting feeling.\"",
      "What makes Grace Potter, the ultimate Door No. 3, was the mystery. The hippie songwriter/rock girl.",
      "Once she was suggested, as much as it made no sense on paper, I knew she was the person we needed.",
      "I listen to a lot of music at night in the Virgin Islands. No light pollution, you can drift in the sounds. I'd been given Grace's live CD. \"Apologies\" poured out of the speakers.",
      "Motionless on a chaise lounge, when I heard Grace's voice \u2013 so soulful, but beautiful and real \u2013 I was floored. Nobody in my life had heard this voice except my friend. I felt blessed.",
      "She wrote her own songs. She had a band, wasn't overproduced. Really listening, it was how she played that B-3 organ, but especially how she sang those songs.",
      "I looked up at the sky and exhaled. She sounded like coming home.",
      "When we put her on \"You & Tequila,\" all she knew about me was \"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy\" because the Eagle in Burlington, Vermont had played it to death.",
      "Was it even possible? Grace had finished a European tour, traveled 24 hours with no sleep and was landing in America. We laugh now, but she listened to the demo on the rental car shuttle having cleared customs.",
      "She was tired. She missed her family. And we needed her in Nashville within 48 hours to make the deadline for mastering \u2013 or we'd have to move the record. Her manager wasn't optimistic. My friend insisted, \"Give her the song.\"",
      "",
      "Thirty minutes later, we had a yes. Thirty hours later, Grace Potter landed in Nashville in a flowy leopard print dress, walked into Blackbird Recording Studios and changed both of our lives. Brash, smart and funny, she oozed music. She told wild stories, made some people blush and asked us what we were thinking.",
      "Buddy suggested, \"Get in the booth and put your headphones on. See how it feels to you.\"",
      "Probably warming up, she was humming. Then that \"ooooohOOOOOHohhhh\" she does on the record rolled out.",
      "\"Do some more of that.\"",
      "Two or three takes later, we were done. We'd talked longer than she was in the vocal booth. Even before it was mixed, we knew it was something. That's the thing: you know.",
      "It was my birthday. I asked her and her boyfriend if they'd like to have dinner. We went to Sunset Grille, sat outside on the patio and laughed. We came from musically different places; her country music was Willie, Townes Van Zandt and Lucinda Williams. But we were of the same heart, same small town, family-oriented life.",
      "She was tired, so we didn't hang long. When I got up to leave, she followed me, jumped in the passenger seat of my car, and announced, \"I don't know what the future holds, but we're going to be friends for life.\"",
      "Grace Potter knew things. I've always believed there are things in our lives that were pre-determined; set into motion by some larger power. Grace was absolutely one.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:24:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Nicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic and author of \"The Running Ground,\" talks about how his father inspired him to become a world-class long-distance runner.",
    "story": [
      "One of the first things you realize about Nick Thompson is just how busy he is, as CEO of The Atlantic; as a public speaker; and on top of it all, as a family man. But he is also a world-class long-distance runner.",
      "He ran to the office on the day we talked. \"I did, of course,\" he said.",
      "\"Why do you like it?\" I asked.",
      "\"Every time I go running, I'm opening my mind up, I'm engaging with nature,\" he said. \"I have a chance to think. I like to have my body in motion. It's a break from the rest of life. It's something I've always loved.\"",
      "And if you can imagine, Thompson has actually gotten faster as he's gotten older, shaving 14 minutes off his best marathon time at 44 \u2013 and just this year, posting the fastest 50-mile time in the world for his age group.",
      "If you're wondering how he does it, and why, he explains in \"The Running Ground\" \u2013 part memoir, part call to the runner in all of us.",
      "\"Everybody can run,\" he said. \"Go to Prospect Park, right, and look at the incredible, beautiful variety. Short people, tall people, really skinny people, wide people. Everybody can run. Humans were made to run.\"",
      "Thompson says he started running because his father was a runner. \"There was always energy and chaos and life around him,\" he said. \"He never slowed down, he never stopped.\"",
      "But in a life of great professional success \u2013 teaching and working in both the Ford and Reagan administrations \u2013 Scott Thompson also suffered personal turmoil.",
      "Thompson writes that one of his father's refrains was to tell him that his life is going to crack apart when he turns 40. \"He told me that all the time,\" he said. \"You know, his father, his life had gotten much harder and kind of fallen apart at 40. And then my dad felt that his life had kind of fallen apart at 40.\"",
      "Scott left the family when Nick was just a kid, and then struggled with just about everything. \"He was an alcoholic and he was a sex addict,\" said Thompson. \"But he wasn't a mean drunk, a fall-over drunk. He just drank way too much. And then in his later life, after he came out of the closet \u2013 in his 40s and 50s, 60s, 70s \u2013 he had a terrible problem with sex addiction.\"",
      "For Nick, running became both a way to be like his father, while also rejecting the chaos that followed him. \"In some ways, running is a way of mourning him after he passed away,\" he said. \"I also am well aware that he could not control his emotions. He could not control what he did during the course of a day. I felt like one of the ways I could prevent that from happening to me was to run, that running gave me discipline through the rest of my life.\"",
      "So, Thompson ran. He ran in high school, and briefly in college at Stanford. And after a break, he picked it up again in his late 20s, which is when he got the news: \"I had just run my first really good marathon and felt on top of the world. And it's two weeks later, the next week I go in and see the doctor and he is like, 'I feel something.'\"",
      "It turned out to be thyroid cancer. \"I was diagnosed when I was 30 years old and it was just a shock,\" he said.",
      "Shocking as it was, it was treatable, and it gave Thompson a new goal. He said, \"One of the reasons I kept marathoning in my 30s and in my 40s was because I wanted to feel like the person I had been before I got sick.\"",
      "As he got faster, his career took off, too. He joined Cond\u00e9 Nast, where he would eventually become editor of newyorker.com and editor-in-chief of Wired. Longtime viewers of \"Sunday Morning\" may remember he even reported for this show, in stories on QAnon, the 2020 election, and Wikipedia.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think you'd be where you are professionally without running?\"",
      "\"Definitely not,\" he replied. \"I think running has been a great tool professionally. It is a way for me to add discipline to my days, for me to have time where my mind can just wander, where I can think through things.\"",
      "But for Thompson, now 50, what's really unexpected is what happened next. He is faster today than he was at age 35. \"I like to think of it as the aging process as a moving sidewalk, you know, pushing you backwards, right? Like, every year I get a little bit weaker. But you can do things to kind of move forward faster than the moving sidewalk is going backwards. You can figure out how to train more intelligently. You can get a better understanding of your body. You can eat differently.\"",
      "Which is not to say that's it's easy.",
      "I asked, \"If you're trying to encourage people to run, why do you post from time to time pictures of yourself looking in absolute agony? Like crossing a finish line? I mean, terrible photos. Some of the all-time worst anyone's ever put out in public voluntarily!\"",
      "\"So, that race was really hard,\" he said. \"It was the Lake Waramaug 50-miler, and I wanted to set the American record for my age group. And I was on pace through 45, 46 miles. And then the last few miles, I knew I was gonna be close, and so I was pushing so hard. I was just \u2026 hurting so much everywhere. But I still won the race. I still ran the fastest time in the world this year. It was still like a pretty good result.\"",
      "Running continues to be a family tradition for the Thompsons. Nick runs with his own three sons, and coaches weekly track sessions with his youngest son's soccer team. He said, \"It feels like full circle to have learned the sport from my father when I was about 5 or 6, and now being able to pass it to my children \u2013 James is 11, Zachary's 15, Ellis is 17. It's a great thing. And there's all these other kids!\"",
      "And as it turns out, life hasn't fallen apart like his father warned.",
      "\"You've kind of done it!\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I mean, I keep going because I enjoy it, right?\" Thompson laughed. \"I keep running because, you know, my life didn't fall apart at 40 'cause I didn't lose my discipline at 40, but could still fall apart at 50, which I just turned. And so, I don't wanna let it go. The really interesting transition in my life will be at some point I won't be able to do this, and then I'll have to figure out how else to hold on.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:14:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The Oscar-winning director is adding his spin to the mythic tale of a scientist creating a man from body parts. He talks about his lifelong fascination with Mary Shelley's story, and how \"in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
    "story": [
      "Director Guillermo del Toro (\"Pan's Labyrinth,\" \"The Shape of Water\") hovered over a model representing the creature in his latest film, \"Frankenstein.\" \"We made, I think, the most extensive, minute, anatomical putting together of the monster in the history of cinema,\" he said.",
      "He considered every tendon, every suture, every organ, and admits for some that can be a bit much. \"Sorry about breakfast!\" he laughed.",
      "But to bring Victor Frankenstein's monster to life in cinema, the filmmaker first was playing creator himself. Del Toro, who resurrected \"Frankenstein\" for Netflix as writer, producer and director, took \"Sunday Morning\" around a London exhibition detailing his elaborate vision for the gothic classic \u2013 from wardrobe and props, to his extensive notes, which he spent years writing.",
      "There is also, in a glass case, the original text, inscribed from Mary Shelley to Lord Byron. \"This is the one I would steal,\" he joked. \"I would do a full Pink Panther.\"",
      "The groundbreaking novel about a scientist who creates a living, feeling being mixes horror, romance, and humanity. It was penned by Mary Shelley, who finished it when she was just 19, more than 200 years ago.",
      "So, why does her story endure? \"Well, first of all, it was written by a teenager that was full of questions and rage and rebellion,\" del Toro said. \"You know, it's the same questions we have now: What are we? Why am I human? Why am I here?\"",
      "Is it a coincidence that the film comes out around Halloween? \"No! No!\" he said. \"To me, Halloween is all year long.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\" I asked.",
      "\"I live a house that has secret passages. I live in a house that is inhabited full of monsters,\" he said.",
      "\"In your mind?\"",
      "\"No, I built it! When I was forty-something, I invested everything I had into creating the house I wanted when I was 7.\"",
      "\"Well, no wonder you wanted to make 'Frankenstein'!\"",
      "\"I have a room dedicated to 'Frankenstein.' I call it the living room.\"",
      "And what does he do in that room? \"I say hello to all the figures in the morning, I write, I investigate, I design.\"",
      "He started experiencing life through literature, he says, growing up in Guadalajara, Mexico. But for him, \"Frankenstein\" was not just any story he'd read. \"You really wanted to make this film,\" I said.",
      "\"I gave it over 50 years of my life, so yes,\" del Toro said. \"It's in all of my movies. All 13 movies have elements   of the film. 'Pinocchio' is another prodigal father asking for forgiveness of his child. My first movie, 'Cronus,' deals with eternal life. 'Shape of Water,' certainly, the idea of the monster being of the same essence than the main female character, and the female character recognizing herself in it.\"",
      "\"We are all creatures,\" he said. \"I mean, we have a world that tells you you shouldn't be a creature, but in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
      "And in what ways is del Toro weird? \"I was this strange, pale creature that liked to read, and I was a hypochondriac at age seven. I thought I had trichinosis. I thought have cirrhosis. And I studied medical manuals, and I would go to my mom and say, 'I think I have a terminal cancer.' So I was a weird, weird kid.\"",
      "And for del Toro, there is an appeal to monsters: \"Monsters tell you, look, it's okay to be you. It's okay to be imperfect.\"",
      "\"You say someone needs to tell you it's okay to be you. Who was that person for you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Boris Karloff, Godzilla, the Creature from the Black Lagoon! What is beautiful about monsters is they become patron saints of imperfection.\"",
      "Boris Karloff's 1931 portrayal of Mary Shelley's monster is film history. In del Toro's reimagination, Oscar Isaac is Victor Frankenstein, birthing a creature played by Jacob Elordi.",
      "\"Every day there was some new, beautiful, strange thing waiting for me to try and do,\" said Isaac. \"To be invited to do these kinds of things as a performer, it was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing.\"",
      "Asked what he did to become the creature, Elordi replied, \"I don't know if that will really fit into a news bit. I couldn't tell you. It's this elusive thing. Guillermo and I shared a language together immediately. I was, like, fully creatively ready to play something like that.\"",
      "Asked why he picked Isaac and Elordi for the roles, del Toro replied, \"Eyes. I cast the eyes.\"",
      "I asked, \"What do you see in their eyes?\"",
      "\"Oscar had brilliance, madness, seduction and pain. And Jacob was completely open. He had an innocence and an openness and a purity in his eyes that was completely disarming.\"",
      "And did the filmmaker want his monster to be beautiful? \"Oh yeah. 100%, it has to look like something newly minted,\" he said. \"Not like a repair job in an ICU.\"",
      "\"But, there's also a handsomeness, a sexiness to Jacob as the creature,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I was raised Catholic, and a lot of those crucifixions in Mexico have the loin cloth a little too low!\"",
      "\"Were you thinking about that?\"",
      "\"No,\" del Toro said, \"but my grandma certainly was!\"",
      "Del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" is rich with Catholic imagery, and inspired by all the monsters he grew up with \u2013 fuelling his lifelong cinematic mission.",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel any connection to the Frankensteins of the past?\"",
      "\"To the myth,\" he replied. \"I mean, my first crush was Mary Shelley. I truly can tell you this, you are born to sing one or two songs in your lifetime. This is my song.\"",
      "\"So, what do you do now? \"",
      "\"Oh, I don't know,\" del Toro replied. \"Macrame? Pottery?\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:10:19 -0400",
    "summary": "He's one of country music's most celebrated singers. But Kenny Chesney's latest work is a book, \"Heart Life Music,\" in which he describes his life's journey, from East Tennessee, to No Shoes Nation and beyond.",
    "story": [
      "Just as the sun was going down in the heart of old Key West, Florida, a self-described pirate rode his rust-ravaged bike to the Blue Heaven restaurant to meet a friend \u2013 a friend we just happened to be in the middle of interviewing. \"She said come in!\" David Wegman laughed, as he joined Kenny Chesney.",
      "But that's the thing about Chesney \u2013 down here, he's not really a country music superstar. He's just another laid-back local. \"We know a lot of the same people,\" Chesney laughed.",
      "He collects characters like seashells \u2013 he met Wegman at Ivan's Stress-Free Bar down in the British Virgin Islands. \"Above the bar was written in shells: 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem,'\" Wegman recalled.",
      "That 2002 song, \"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems,\" helped make Chesney one of the biggest touring acts around. Almost every summer he turns stadiums into beach parties. Among his many accolades: the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year Award, which he won four years in a row. And just last week, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame \u2013 a career-topping accomplishment that he credits to taking that tropical turn in his career.",
      "\"You know what's crazy?\" he said. \"I had an 18-song Greatest Hits album, and nobody knew who I was. They knew the songs, but I wasn't comfortable in my skin yet. I didn't know who I was supposed to be as an artist yet. I would go do shows and they would go, 'Oh yeah, that's the guy that sings that song.' And then, 'That's the guy that sings that song.' When I started being my true, authentic self, that's when everything changed.\"",
      "He could have taken us to some Tiki bar down in the Keys to keep up his tropical brand. But instead, he wanted to show us the room where Ernest Hemingway worked on \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"Green Hills of Africa.\"",
      "I said, \"The space, it's almost like sacred place.\"",
      "\"Yeah, do you feel it? I feel it,\" Chesney said. \"I spent so much, almost two weeks straight on the bow of my boat in the Virgin Islands reading those books.\"",
      "Which might explain why he came down here to work on his first book, out next month: \"Heart Life Music.\" \"This book forced me to pause,\" he said.",
      "For all of his love of the islands, he writes it was his own mom who first realized that he may have drifted too far from his East Tennessee roots. \"She wanted her 12-year-old boy back in ways, and he was gone. Gone gone gone,\" he said.",
      "\"She had a hard time finding you, kind of had a hard time reaching you?\" I asked.",
      "\"It hit me a little bit, but I was so already so addicted to seeking an adventure and all of it, and all these new things happening in my life that I dismissed it.\"",
      "He kept going, kept touring, kept writing, until a concert in Indianapolis back in 2009, which he describes as hitting a wall, and crying on stage. \"In that moment I was so exhausted and numb to all of it, that it wasn't making me happy,\" he said. \"I wasn't creating the same way.\u00a0 I wasn't connecting to the audience. It just hit me.\u00a0 It took sports to get me out of that funk.\"",
      "He grew up playing baseball and football \u2013 loving every inning, every down. So, when a song called \"The Boys of Fall\" crossed his path, he didn't only record it; he began interviewing coaches and players about sports and life, and turned it into a documentary for ESPN, \"Boys of Fall.\" \"I needed Joe Namath, I needed Bill Parcells,\" he said. \"I sat in Bobby Bowden's living room and he talked to me like a deacon in a Baptist church! I woke up one day, and I went, I'm back.\"",
      "Now he's the one doing pre-game pep talks backstage, like at Sphere in Las Vegas. Many on his team have been with him for decades. There's confidence in familiarity. \"If I had to sit on the bus and think about what I'm getting ready to go do, it would \u2013 yeah, I don't do well with that,\" he said.",
      "He put on the kind of show his fans expect \u2013 a kaleidoscope of sand, sunsets and songs.",
      "When me met him the next morning, he was still buzzing about performing in Sphere. \"The first couple of nights, I caught myself singing a song and I was like, Well, this is so cool! \u00a0And then, I forgot the words to a song that I actually wrote!\"",
      "On stage with him this night was Grace Potter, the singer-songwriter he recruited for a duet, even though country really wasn't her thing. The two are now lifelong friends.",
      "\"There's people who have always seen him as just the iconic, you know, Statue of David of country music,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm gonna go to Florence and stand beside it!\" he laughed.",
      "\"But there's just so much more underneath it that's more interesting than the sculpture itself,\" Potter added.",
      "Indeed, the off-stage Kenny Chesney is a more complicated guy, a more thoughtful guy, even a little shy if you can believe it. That's the East Tennessee part that will always remain even as he's chasing sunsets.",
      "Chesney said, \"It takes a certain amount of ego to be up there on stage and to do what I do, right? But I try really hard to leave that person up there. I can't live that person every day. And I don't want that person in my life every day, but I'm really glad to meet him when I go back up there.\"",

      "Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm in a teaser for the new season of her family's reality TV show, \"The Kardashians.\" She appears to blame the diagnosis on stress \u2014 but doctors say that usually isn't a direct cause.",
      "In the clip shared Thursday, Kardashian, 45, is seen going in for an MRI scan and telling her family, \"There was a little aneurysm.\" She then appears to say she was told the cause was \"just stress.\" Footage from the teaser also features a sometimes emotional Kardashian talking about her difficult divorce with ex-husband Kanye West, who now goes by Ye.",
      "While stress itself doesn't create an aneurysm, it can raise blood pressure, which is related to aneurysm formation and growth, said Dr. Brian Snelling, director of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery and director of the stroke program at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida.",
      "\"The real culprits are genetics, elevated blood pressure, smoking and age-related changes in the arteries,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"It is not proven that stress alone causes an aneurysm,\" said Dr. Greg Albers, co-founder of health platform RapidAI and director of the Stanford Stroke Center, but adds stress can over time cause an increase in blood pressure which can make an individual more vulnerable to one.",
      "A brain aneurysm is a \"bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain,\" the\u00a0Mayo Clinic explains.",
      "You can think of it as a weak spot in the artery \u2014 imagine a garden hose that has one spot where the rubber's thin like balloon, instead of thick, said Dr. Adam Arthur, neurosurgeon and a chief medical officer at Medtronic, a medical device company.",
      "\"Over time, with pressure going through that hose, it's caused a little sack,\" he explained.",
      "Brain aneurysms, which tend to be more prevalent in women, aren't uncommon: \"Around 1 in 50 adults have a brain aneurysm,\" Snelling said. But, most people never know they have one.",
      "\"They are often found incidentally on scans done for unrelated reasons. Unless they grow large or rupture, they're usually silent,\" he said.",
      "Most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small, as most don't rupture and usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"Aneurysms themselves aren't dangerous unless they leak or burst, which leads to a life-threatening brain bleed,\" Snelling said.",
      "Hemorrhagic strokes and subarachnoid hemorrhages are two types of brain bleeds related to ruptured brain aneurysms, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The best prevention is controlling blood pressure, avoiding smoking and stimulants, screening at-risk populations and monitoring with imaging, he added.",
      "Alleviating stress can be important in preventing a rupture, Arthur added, noting the development of aneurysms is \"something that can happen to anybody, regardless of risk factors.\"",
      "Arthur said if a patient has risks factors \u2014 for example, two close relatives with aneurysms \u2014 screenings can be done to check for them.",

    "story": [
      "Under the bright lights of the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, Misty Copeland took her final bow, a moment that marked not just the end of a performance but the close of a chapter that transformed American ballet. The trailblazing dancer, who shattered racial barriers in the art form, retired on Wednesday as a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre after 25 years with the company.",
      "But she told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview that the decision to perform one last time wasn't something she initially wanted.",
      "\"It's been such an interesting kind of lead up to this moment, because I in all honesty I didn't wanna come back to the stage and have this moment,\" she told Gayle King.",
      "When asked why, Copeland explained that by 2019, her last year performing with the American Ballet Theatre\u00a0before taking a 5-year hiatus, she had begun to feel drained after decades of dancing.",
      "\"I really was starting to feel burnt out, kind of losing that passion that I've had my whole career and whole life for dance,\" she said. \"And I always promised myself I wouldn't go onstage if I didn't feel that I was delivering from my heart and, you know, my soul.\"",
      "She said that after taking time away, she viewed her return as an opportunity for closure and gratitude.",
      "\"In taking these five years, and really thinking about what this moment means in terms of just closure and saying thank you, that, I think, is what has gotten me back onstage for the show,\" Copeland said.",
      "The final bow",
      "At Copeland's farewell gala at Lincoln Center, Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who honored her career and impact.",
      "\"Misty Copeland didn't just perform ballet, she changed it,\" Winfrey said. \"She did. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\"",
      "Allen also praised Copeland's influence. \"You are a prophecy come true. A prophecy of goodness, and genius and grace and power,\" she said.",
      "Copeland helped organize the evening's program, which included a scene from \"Romeo and Juliet.\"",
      "\"I really wanted to do this piece because Calvin Royal, he's the second Black male principal dancer in ABT's history,\" Copeland said. \"And we were set to perform the full-length ballet, the first two Black dancers to perform the leads together at ABT right before the pandemic hit. And then that never came to fruition. So I thought, even though it's not the full ballet, to be able to perform just a piece of it.\"",
      "The night ended with a standing ovation. Copeland received bouquets from her husband, Olu Evans, and their 3-year-old son, Jackson, who saw her perform for the first time.",
      "Redefining ballet",
      "Copeland looked back on the moment that made history, becoming the first Black woman promoted to principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre. She said the title carried a deeper meaning beyond personal recognition.",
      "\"I think that and I've gone back and forth over the years in terms of, like, what that really means and the title is what has opened the doors for the next generation,\" she said.",
      "Her 2015 promotion was celebrated around the world, but it also brought new challenges. Copeland said the attention came with intense pressure and unfair expectations. \"There were articles being written, 'If Misty doesn't go onstage and perform Swan Lake perfectly does she deserve to be a principal dancer? Is this because she's Black? Is this why she's getting this opportunity?'\" she recalled.",
      "For Copeland, ballet was never just about perfect lines or technical mastery. \"I know deep down, like, to me the art form and dance is not even, it's not about, these technical feats. It's not about, to me, the aesthetic and, and what's on the outside. To me what's saved my life is the storytelling, and being able to kind of step into this beautiful world and express myself in ways that I couldn't as a child,\" she said.",
      "Her relationship with dance began at 13, an age when most professional ballerinas were already years into their training. Growing up amid uncertainty and instability, she said ballet became a place of safety and self-discovery.",
      "\"I felt beautiful and I felt powerful and I felt strong and I felt like I had a voice. I felt confident and I felt stability for the first time in my life,\" she said. \"Because the way I grew up there was no stability. There was a lot of chaos and movement, and, didn't always have a home and food on the table. And so ballet became, dance allowed me to flourish. It gave me structure. It gave me discipline. It gave me grace. It gave me a purpose.\"",
      "As diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives face growing criticism, Copeland said she believes this is the right time to step away from performing.",
      "\"I think it's the exact right time for me to be stepping off the stage for this,\" she said. \"Because I think that the impact that I can have off the stage is, is going to be, greater than what I've done. It's been 25 years that I've been a Black body on this stage, and I think that there's been a lot of movement and shifts.\"",
      "She said progress in ballet must also happen behind the curtain.",
      "\"It's more than just seeing yourself on the stage. It's what's being implemented behind the scenes,\" she said. \"It's the schools. It's how are we getting teachers in schools who look like the children they're serving? It's getting board members who are making these decisions who represent a greater group of people. There's so much work to be done.\"",
      "Copeland also announced that she will \u00a0be joining ABT's board of trustees.",
      "\"You know, it's not common that you see artists come onto boards and that you see women of color. And so to be able to have a seat at the table \u2014 in a really impactful way \u2014 I think is progress. And that, to me, is \u2014 is so thrilling and so exciting to be able to stay connected to this company that has been everything to me. I mean, it's been my dream since I was 13 years old. And I still to this day can't believe I've been able to live it out the way that I have.\"",
      "Copeland said the timing of her departure was important.",
      "\"I always said to myself, like, I'm not gonna be that ballerina that they're pulling off by the pointe shoes, like, 'Girl, it's time.' You know, that I wanna be able to say, you know, like, I feel good in this moment, and now is time for me to bow,\" she said.",

      "Copeland made history in 2015 when she became the first Black woman to be promoted to principal dancer in the history of the company, which was founded in 1939. Her farewell performance at Lincoln Center was a celebration of her transformative career, drawing stars and supporters from across the performing arts world.",

      "\"I think it was 'Firebird.' You know, I was still a soloist, and it was a really big deal for me as a black woman to be performing this role,\" she said.",
      "She added, \"I remember just knowing that the audience had completely shifted and changed that night. Seeing young and old and Black and brown and everything in between step into the theater because they felt that they could be in there, they were represented. They saw themselves, and that was a real shift in my career. I think it was a real shift in where we are in the ballet world today, and it happened that night.\"",

    "summary": "The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said.",
    "story": [
      "The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday, reaffirming a decision to put the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist on the league's biggest stage that led to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and some of his supporters.",
      "Goodell addressed the Bad Bunny controversy at his news conference following the annual fall owners meeting. It is the first time he has commented on the move announced in late September that garnered worldwide attention, including an increase in streams of Bad Bunny's music, along with backlash.",
      "\"It's carefully thought through,\" Goodell said. \"I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism. It's pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.\"",
      "The 31-year-old born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. He decided to do a 31-day residency in Puerto Rico, avoiding stops in the mainland U.S., citing concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos.",
      "He performs in Spanish and is expected to do so at the Super Bowl.",
      "\"We're confident it's going to be a great show,\" Goodell said, acknowledging there could be more talent added to the lineup along with Bad Bunny. \"He understands the platform that he's on, and I think it's going to be exciting and a united moment.\"",
      "The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Super Bowl on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It is unclear if Trump plans to be there, though he has made appearing in person at major sporting events a significant part of his second term in the White House.",
      "Trump in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax said he had \"never heard of\" Bad Bunny.",
      "\"I don't know who he is,\" Trump said. \"I don't know why they're doing it. It's, like, crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it's absolutely ridiculous.\"",
      "Goodell defended the decision on Wednesday, explaining it was made because of Bad Bunny's immense popularity.",
      "\"He's one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,\" Goodell said. \"That's what we try to achieve. It's an important stage for us. It's an important element to the entertainment value.\"",
      "Echoing what senior VP of football operations Troy Vincent said Tuesday, Goodell said there has not been much discussion about the tush push quarterback sneak since an effort to ban it narrowly failed to pass in the spring.",
      "Vincent said the primary concern is how tough it is to officiate the maneuver that the Philadelphia Eagles have successfully executed so often. It was not on the formal agenda at this meeting, though owners did get an update on penalties and other football matters.",
      "\"It's something we will continue to monitor on all phases, just like we do every other aspect of the game,\" Goodell said. \"We don't have any proposals to bring it back up. It wouldn't surprise me if something does evolve. But it's not something we're really focused on during the season.\"",
      "Asked about replay reviews and the length of time they are taking, Goodell said game times are actually down through the first seven weeks compared to last season, despite a surge in kick returns after an adjustment was made to the so-called dynamic kickoff.",
      "\"That's quite remarkable when you add the number of kickoffs,\" Goodell said. \"You're going to get more fouls. You're going to get different sets of fouls. You're going to have a little bit (more) length of the game.\"",
      "Goodell said he had breakfast with interim Players Association executive director David White before one of the league's international games this season but expects any talk about a move to an 18-game regular season and other collective bargaining discussions to wait until the union chooses its long-term leader.",
      "The current CBA runs through the 2031 league year. White told The Associated Press last month that an 18-game season was not inevitable.",
      "\"The negotiations will be a lot more than just simply the 18 and two (exhibition games),\" Goodell said. \"There are a lot of issues that we are going to raise and I'm certain that the players will raise, and that's what it should be. That's what collective bargaining is all about. They're going to need time to make sure that they're prepared, that they're ready for the negotiations (and) they have their priorities straight, and then we can begin negotiations.\"",
      "Goodell said work is being done to choose sites for the Super Bowl to cap the 2028 and '29 seasons and expects an announcement on those next year.",

    "summary": "With open enrollment starting soon, employees could get sticker shock, with their costs expected to rise 6% to 7% for 2026, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "Open enrollment \u2014 the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits \u2014 may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from consultant Mercer.",
      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 09:50:46 -0400",
    "summary": "Jim Farley discusses the difficulties of tariffs in imported parts, which have cost Ford $2 billion \u2013 and may give an advantage to their competitors. He also explains why he drives a Chinese-made electric vehicle.",
    "story": [
      "At Ford's Michigan Assembly outside Detroit, more than 4,500 hourly employees turn out about 100,000 Broncos a year \u2013 a new one every 60 seconds.",
      "For obvious reasons Ford's been touting its commitment to American manufacturing. It advertises itself as employing the most hourly workers in the country \u2013 and more than 80 percent of its vehicles sold in the U.S. are indeed made in America. That's the highest share of any Detroit automaker.",
      "But Ford imports many parts, and has been hit hard by President Trump's tariffs. Ford CEO Jim Farley says it's not affordable to make all the parts here, and that if Ford only used American-made parts, American-made cars would be too expensive for many Americans to buy.",
      "And there are some components, Farley says, that no one even makes in America: \"There are parts, fasteners, wiring looms from other countries. And we pay our tariffs, sometimes up to 70 percent on those parts. That's giving us a $2 billion bill. About 20 percent of our global profit is going away in tariffs.\"",
      "And who is paying for those tariffs? \"Well, the company right now,\" he said. \"And in the end of the day, it's all these workers.\"",
      "Farley has deep roots in Michigan. His grandfather was Ford Motor Company's 389th employee \u2013 one of the first to help build the Model T. \u00a0But Farley himself is not a Ford lifer. Before joining the company in 2007, he spent nearly two decades at Toyota.",
      "And how did that go over in the Farley family when he went to Toyota? \"Not well,\" Jim laughed. \"Because at the time, you know, they were just, all through the '70s, there was just job loss after job loss across southeast Michigan. And my grandfather was thinking about all the people that lost their jobs. And they were like, Why? Why are you doing this?\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you see similarities between the '80s, when the U.S. auto industry was facing the increased competition from Japan, to today where it's China?\"",
      "\"Oh, I think it's exactly the same thing, but it's on steroids,\" Farley replied.",
      "\"A completely different level of risk for our industry\"",
      "Ironically, it's a Biden-era tariff that has so far spared Detroit from that competition. In May of last year, the U.S. imposed a 100% surcharge on Chinese-made electric vehicles, which effectively bans them from the American road. But Chinese EVs are gaining ground in Europe, Latin America, and especially China, the world's largest market.",
      "Farley has called these small, inexpensive, tech-savvy cars an existential threat. \"They have enough capacity in China with existing factories to serve the entire North American market, put us all out of business,\" he said. \"Japan never had that. So, this is a completely different level of risk for our industry.\"",
      "\"Are the Chinese cars being made today something Americans would want to buy?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Farley. \"I drive a Xiaomi SU7. High quality, great digital experience.\"",
      "\"You're driving a Chinese car? Why?\"",
      "\"Because of the competition. And to beat them, you have to know them.\"",
      "Farley's firsthand experience with Chinese EVs is a big reason Ford is pivoting to smaller, more affordable electric vehicles. This past summer, in announcing production of a new midsize electric pickup truck to sell for $30,000, Farley said, \"It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T.\"",
      "That hands-on approach is one holdover from his days at Toyota. Another is his annual road trip to see his products in action. \"I believe in genchi genbutsu. It's a Japanese word that means 'go and see where the work is actually done.' I took a Lightning through California with my son. And it became pretty clear that we had a big problem with our charging network. So, after that trip, I called Elon [Musk]. Out of the blue, never met him or anything. I was like, is there any way you would share your supercharging network with Ford?\"",
      "If you heard his name and noticed the resemblance to the late actor Chris Farley, you weren't wrong: the \"Saturday Night Live\" star was Jim Farley's cousin. \"I think there's, uh, a little bit of kid in all of us Farleys, a little bit of that kind of devilish, little snarky tomfoolery,\" he said. \"On the other hand, I would say I was, you know, kind of on the pretty serious side of the Farley spectrum!\"",
      "Jim Farley will need every bit of that serious side to steer Ford through one of its biggest economic and political tests in decades \u2013 building a future that keeps tens of thousands of American auto workers on the line. \"What I care about is that transformation of Ford,\" he said. \"I'd like to be able to come back here in 20 years, if I'm still alive, and see all the people, that they're still busy, like my grandfather. My grandfather had nothing until he had the Ford job. Our jobs as leaders are about them.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 20:05:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Inflation last month rose at an annual rate of 3%, coming in below economists' forecasts as the impact of President Trump's tariffs remain muted.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in below economists' forecasts as the impact of President Trump's tariffs remain muted.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet had forecast CPI rose at a 3.1% annual clip last month. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "While most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the government shutdown, the Department of Labor is\u00a0making an exception\u00a0for the September CPI data. That's because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "The September CPI report could be the last inflation data economists see for a while. The Labor Department is unlikely to release inflation figures next month because of difficulty collecting data during the shutdown, the Trump administration said Friday in an email.",
      "What economists say",
      "Inflation is inching higher partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, according to economists. U.S. businesses are eating some of the costs in the form of lower profits, which has blunted the impact of the import duties on consumers.",
      "Still, companies are also passing on\u00a0as much as 55%\u00a0of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis. Other research shows a lower rate of passthrough tariff costs to shoppers.",
      "\"Tariffs have put upward pressure on prices, particularly in the goods-producing sector of the economy,\" Brandon Zureick, senior managing director and chief economist at investment firm Johnson Investment Counsel, told CBS News. \"We're definitely a little higher than where we started the year, and above the Fed's target\" of 2% annual inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a tool for protecting U.S. manufacturing, as well as to convince businesses to reshore their factories within the country, and for generating billions of new federal revenue.",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and set the Federal Reserve on a path of hiking interest rates. Higher borrowing costs can temper inflation because it makes loans and credit cards more expensive, which can cause consumers and businesses to pare spending.",
      "What does the CPI mean for interest rates?",
      "The recent rise in inflation is complicating the Fed's decision on interest rates, with the central bank scheduled to make its next rate decision on Oct. 29. But today's inflation data could provide additional support for another cut, analysts said Friday.",
      "\"There was little in today's benign CPI report to 'spook' the Fed and we continue to expect further easing at next week's Fed meeting,\" Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a Friday email. \"A December rate cut also remains likely with the current data drought providing the Fed with little reason to deviate from the path set out in the dot plot.\"",
      "Still, inflation is edging higher, which could be an argument for keeping rates steady. But at the same time, the job market is experiencing a\u00a0sharp slowdown in hiring, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited last month when the central bank made its first rate cut of 2025. Lower borrowing costs can help support the job market by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, encouraging them to expand and hire.",
      "That means the combination of rising inflation and weakening job growt is putting the Fed's dual mandate \u2014 to keep both inflation and unemployment low \u2014 in conflict. Powell said earlier this month that the risks posed by the labor market may be outweighing concerns about rising inflation.",
      "\"The Fed has recognized the trends in the labor market as changing their directives,\" Zureick said. \"We've been dangerously close to a zero level of job growth for a few months.\"",
      "Given the Fed's focus on the labor market risks, the higher CPI rate isn't likely to derail expectations for a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's next meeting later this month, economists say.",
      "The probability of a 0.25-percentage point cut at the Fed's Oct. 29 meeting is pegged at 98.9%, according to CME FedWatch.",

      "German businessman Alexander B\u00f6cker was reading the news with his wife last Sunday when she told him about a robbery at the Louvre in Paris.",
      "\"My wife said, 'Well, look at this: Somebody broke into the Louvre. There's a robbery going on!'\" he recalled in an interview with CBS News.",
      "Right away, his wife, Julia Scharwatz, noticed something familiar: the lift used in the robbery looked just like one that their company makes.",
      "\"If you know the product, you can really quickly identify that it was your product,\" B\u00f6cker said on Friday. \"It became clear to us that this is a reprehensible act, and they have used our machine for it.\"",
      "The machine was the B\u00f6cker Agilo, a lift that can be used in construction or to hoist furniture to apartments through upper-story windows.",
      "It is just one of the machines that B\u00f6cker's company \u2014 called B\u00f6cker \u2014 manufactures. And as more details of the robbery emerged \u2014 particularly that no one had been hurt \u2014 B\u00f6cker and Scharwatz, who works alongside her husband as the company's head of marketing, began getting messages from colleagues and employees asking: \"Can't we make something out of it?\"",
      "The next day, the brainstorming began as they tried to think of new ways to advertise in the wake of the heist, which saw thieves run off with an estimated $102 million\u00a0in jewels. The robbers used the B\u00f6cker lift to get to a second-story balcony where they accessed the Louvre by cutting through a window, and officials say they got in and out in just four minutes.",
      "One proposed ad slogan was: \"'Well even criminal professionals are using the best machinery,' something like that,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "But it was Scharwatz who had the winning idea \u2014 to focus on the speed of B\u00f6cker machines.",
      "\"We bought the picture, and then we had to decide: Shall we do it or not? And I said, 'Well, I hope everybody gets our sense of humor.' You know, normally, the Germans are not very famous for having a sense of humor,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "He said he felt like it was \"a very thin line,\" but because no one had been hurt, \"we said: 'Let's go for it.'\"",
      "The final ad, published on social media, shows an image of the B\u00f6cker machine positioned outside the Louvre after the robbery.",
      "\"If you're in a hurry,\" the tagline says. That's followed by details about the product: \"The B\u00f6cker Agilo carries your treasures up to 400 kg at 42 m/min \u2014 quiet as a whisper thanks to its 230 V electric motor.\"",
      "A post shared by B\u00f6cker Maschinenwerke GmbH (@boeckermaschinenwerke)",
      "The response to the campaign has been mixed. Many have found it funny, with some who work in marketing and advertising reaching out to the company calling it smart.",
      "It has also gotten a lot of attention. Posts on the company's social media sites typically draw 15,000-20,000 views per post, B\u00f6cker said, but this one garnered more than 4.3 million views on Instagram and Facebook.",
      "\"So, yeah, it is quite an unusual event for us,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "That publicity, though, has not translated into sales, at least yet.",
      "\"The normal customer base, especially in Europe, they know the product pretty well. We are (a) market leader in that segment,\" B\u00f6cker said. \"Maybe now, in other countries where this product is not so well known or not so known at all, there is maybe an interest.\"",
      "B\u00f6cker wanted to make clear, though, that neither he nor his company support the robbery at the Louvre.",
      "\"We are against, completely against, criminal activities, and we are also a serious company. 620 employees in Germany.

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 13:43:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment is aimed at helping the program's 75 million beneficiaries keep pace with inflation.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration on Friday announced a 2.8%\u00a0cost-of-living adjustment for 2026, an increase that will automatically boost monthly payments for the program's roughly 71 million beneficiaries starting early next year.",
      "The increase represents an uptick from the last year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, which set the 2025 increase at 2.5%. Inflation has edged higher this year. The Labor Department said Friday that the Consumer Price Index, a closely watched gauge of U.S. inflation, rose at an annual rate of 3% in September.",
      "Next year's COLA increase will boost the average Social Security payment by about $56 to an average monthly benefit of $2,071, starting in January, the Social Security Administration said. People who receive Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income and disabled people, will see their first COLA increase with their Dec. 31, 2025 check, the agency said.",
      "The annual COLA is designed to ensure that seniors, disabled Americans and other Social Security beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power to inflation. Even so, a recent poll by the AARP, an advocacy group for older Americans, found that many seniors think the retirement program's inflation adjustments are falling short and that they need an annual COLA of about 5% to keep up with their daily expenses.",
      "\"The cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security is one of the few inflation-adjusted programs for retirees,\" Jenn Jones, AARP's vice president of government affairs, told CBS News. \"It is incredibly important to millions of Americans, and so although it may not feel like it's quite enough, especially after the last few years, it's critically helpful for keeping pace with rising costs.\"",
      "In a statement, Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano said the cost-of-living adjustment \"is one way we are working to make sure benefits reflect today's economic realities and continue to provide a foundation of security.\"",
      "How SSA calculates its annual COLA",
      "The Social Security Administration announces the COLA each fall based on a metric known as the \"Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers,\" or\u00a0CPI-W, which tracks the average change in prices paid by workers for a basket of commonly bought goods and services.",
      "The COLA is based on that inflation data from July through September.",
      "Some advocates for older Americans say the CPI-W fails to accurately reflect seniors' financial needs because it tracks younger workers, while retirees tend to face higher costs for health care, housing and some other items. Seniors on Medicare, the health insurance program for those over 65, spend 13.6% of their income on health-related expenses, more than double that of younger people, according to KFF.",
      "Meanwhile, poverty is on the rise among America's seniors, with the poverty rate among seniors rising to 15% last year, up from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to recent Census data. The AARP said more older adults are struggling with the rising cost of housing and utility costs.",
      "\"Most Social Security beneficiaries aren't working \u2014 you are on a fixed income, so any inflation increase you feel,\" Jones said. \"If the increases continue, it becomes difficult to figure out how you're going to pay for all of your monthly expenses.\"",
      "How Medicare costs could impact benefits",
      "Advocates for senior citizens say the COLA is likely to fall short, especially given forecasts for increases in Medicare's premiums and deductibles for 2026. The Medicare premium is taken directly from seniors' Social Security checks.",
      "While Medicare hasn't yet announced its 2026 premiums, its trustees report issued earlier this year projected that the standard monthly premium for Part B \u2014 which covers doctors visits and outpatient care \u2014 would likely rise to $206.50, or a 12% boost from its current rate. Deductibles are also projected to rise about 12% next year, the report said.",
      "The result: Seniors could see most of their 2026 COLA eaten up by higher Medicare costs, the National Council on Aging said in a statement.",
      "\"COLA might reflect the inflation rate, but it is woefully insufficient for older Americans who already have high health care costs and are facing even greater increases in their Medicare costs in 2026,\" Ramsey Alwin, CEO of the NCA, said in the statement.",
      "Seniors are likely to be disappointed by the 2026 COLA, which represents the second-smallest bump since 2021. Many are at risk of falling behind, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group.",
      "The Consumer Price Index for September, also released on Friday, showed that medical and elderly care costs are surpassing the 3% annualized pace of inflation. Costs for caring for the elderly at home jumped 11.6% last month on an annual basis, while medical services rose 3.9%.",
      "\"Seniors on fixed incomes are rightly concerned that the Social Security COLA is not keeping pace with the true impact of inflation on their living costs, especially in areas where prices are soaring.\u00a0 Medical, housing and grocery costs are outstripping the COLA,\" Max Richtman, the group's CEO, said in a statement.",

      "While roughly 670,000 federal employees are furloughed, approximately 730,000 other government employees deemed essential \u2014 such as air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers\u00a0\u2014 continue to work without pay during the shutdown, according to estimates from the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "Hornick, whose annual income is about $75,000 a year, is now scrambling to stay afloat. That means paring her spending and contacting her mortgage lender and other creditors to ask for lenience.",
      "\"I got a letter from mortgage company saying I was approved for deferred payment and that they wouldn't take foreclosure action against me,\" she said, although she remains anxious about what the future will bring.",
      "\"Who knows how long my mortgage company will allow this to go on before they foreclose on my house,\" Hornick added.",
      "Hornick said she has eliminated what she describes as \"all nonessential spending.\"",
      "\"I had a hair appointment for Saturday that I made before the shutdown and it's canceled because I have dogs, so I am making sure they are fed and have veterinarian care,\" she said.",
      "Government jobs no longer \"safe\"",
      "Mae apGovannon, 49, works in Portland, Oregon, at a regional office for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, where he processes claims for veterans benefits.",
      "apGovannon said some of his home appliances, including his oven, have stopped working, but repairs will have to wait until he gets paid. To reduce their costs, he and his partner are also cutting back on entertainment, such as going to the movies and eating out.",
      "\"It's something we were considering anyway with the economy going the way it is, but it's much more urgent now. It's important to hunker down,\" apGovannon said.",
      "Asked if he would consider leaving the federal government for the private sector, apGovannon, who has been in his current role since 2019, said he is \"in it for the long haul.\" But he can appreciate why some colleagues might want to leave government service.",
      "\"lt's hard to say to younger people, 'Hey, come work for us \u2014 you never know if you're going to be fired or not.'\" apGovannon told CBS News. \"Their perception is that government work, which was once safe, no longer is.\"",
      "Hornick, who is nearing the end of her career at the SSA and plans to retire from government work, said she would \"not recommend anyone come work for the federal government with everything that's going on.\"",
      "Accruing interest as shutdown continues",
      "Brooke Hardison, 47, a furloughed communications director at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service, said she is accruing interest on unpaid credit card bills and feels like she \"has to protect every penny, because we just don't know what happens next.\"",
      "That's meant canceling travel and delaying repairing a faulty door in her home, Hardison said. Her husband works for a government contractor focused on information technology, potentially putting his income in jeopardy as long as federal funding remains frozen.",
      "\"It is up in the air,\" she said. \"We are bracing for impact to both of our jobs.\"",
      "Like other federal workers, Hardison, who lives in Bowie, Maryland and who has worked for the government for 20 years, said that for the first time she is considering leaving public service for the private sector.",
      "\"I had started thinking about looking outside the government because of the changes that have happened in being a government employee, and the totality of the job,\" she told CBS News. \"I always assumed I would retire from the government. But this year, it has been really hard to be a federal employee.\"",

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",

    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email.",

      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "That could be an issue for SNAP recipients like Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident who receives around $260 a month in SNAP benefits. Powers said she'll be OK if benefits don't come through in November, but a longer delay would force her to change how she shops. The fresh produce she buys to keep a healthy diet would no longer be in her budget, she said.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Powers told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on plans under consideration.",
      "Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, said in an email note that the administration is legally required to use contingency funds to pay for November SNAP benefits.",
      "\"It could have, and should have, taken steps weeks ago to be ready to use these funds,\" she said.",
      "In a separate move Thursday, the United States Conference of Mayors, a nonpartisan organization that represents mayors in over 1,000 cities, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, calling on the USDA to use \"all available resources, including the SNAP contingency fund\" to prevent SNAP benefits from being delayed.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, according to Plata-Nino.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states.",
      "The fate of WIC funding",
      "Another social safety net program that could be affected by the government shutdown is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. Known as WIC, the program provides nutrition assistance, including infant formula, to around 6.7 million people.",
      "The National WIC Association (NWA), the nonprofit education arm for the government program, warned Tuesday that millions of families could lose access to their WIC benefits as early as Nov. 1, when certain state agencies are set to run out of funds.",
      "The group said the White House provided temporary emergency funds that will stabilize the program through Oct. 31, but noted that those funds are rapidly depleting. To keep the programing running for the first two weeks of November, an additional $300 million is needed, according to NWA.",
      "\"Without additional funding, State WIC Agencies may be forced to take drastic measures that prevent families from accessing the services they need, such as halting food benefits,\" NWA said in a statement.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cpi-report-inflation-september-2025-forecast-social-security-cola/",
    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 10:34:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists think inflation around the U.S. continued to climb in September, edging\u00a0farther away from the Fed's 2% annual target.",
    "story": [
      "A delayed inflation report on Friday is expected to deliver sobering data about the direction of U.S. prices, with economists forecasting that the Consumer Price Index in September rose at its fastest pace in 16 months.",
      "CPI last month is projected to have risen 3.1% on an annual basis, which would be the highest since the inflation gauge hit 3.3% in May of 2024, according to economists polled by FactSet. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the September CPI report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time, or nine days later than it had originally been scheduled to issue the report before the U.S. government shutdown.",
      "Most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the stalemate. The Department of Labor is making an exception for the September CPI data because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "Inflation has crept higher this year, edging farther away from the Federal Reserve's annual 2% target, partly due to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, according to economists. U.S. companies that import goods from other nations are on the hook for paying the tariffs, and they are passing on as much as 55% of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.",
      "\"The forthcoming September CPI data will confirm a renewed acceleration in inflation, with price momentum evident across both goods and services,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco predicted Thursday a research note. \"The tariff impact is increasingly visible, though pass-through remains gradual and uneven.\"",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June of 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and spurred the Federal Reserve to ratchet up interest rates in a bid to quash inflation. When borrowing becomes more expensive, consumers and businesses tend to cut back on spending, which helps temper inflation.",
      "But the recent uptick in inflation is souring some Americans on the economy, with 59% of those\u00a0polled by CBS News earlier this month saying they feel the economy is getting worse. About two-thirds said they had noticed prices going up in recent weeks.",
      "How will inflation impact the Social Security COLA?",
      "The Social Security Administration on Friday is also expected to release its annual cost-of-living adjustment, basing its calculation on the inflation rate from July through September.",
      "That yearly financial bump, which ensures that 75 million Social Security recipients don't lose purchasing power as prices rise, is expected to come in at around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025, according to the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group.",
      "A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly Social Security payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062. Yet some advocates for senior citizens are concerned that retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continue to climb beyond their 2026 Social Security adjustment.",
      "What's the inflation outlook?",
      "Despite the recent rise in consumer prices, the Federal Reserve and most private economists expect inflation to ease next year. In September, the Fed forecast\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures \u2014 a measure of consumer spending and the central bank's preferred barometer of inflation \u2014 would show prices rising at a 3% annual rate in 2025, but then drop to 2.6% next year.",
      "The impact of U.S. tariffs on inflation has been more muted than what many economists were forecasting earlier this year, Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. Companies have helped blunt the impact by expanding their inventories before the tariffs took effect, as well as absorbing some of the costs in the form of lower profits, she said.",
      "But there's a risk those strategies might not work for long, she added.",
      "\"As inventories deplete, trade routes narrow and margins continue to shrink, firms may be forced to pass on higher costs to consumers,\" she wrote. \"As such, upside risks remain. If pricing pressures spill over into services, it could signal a broader and more persistent inflationary trend.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has pardoned a billionaire cryptocurrency exchange founder who pleaded guilty to a\u00a0money laundering-related charge, claiming the man was a victim of political prosecution by the Biden administration.",
      "Changpeng Zhao, a Chinese-born Canadian founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, pleaded guilty in November 2023 to charges of enabling money laundering while serving as CEO of the exchange. The plea was part of a multi-billion-dollar settlement Binance reached with the Biden-era Justice Department in 2023, and Zhao stepped down from his role as CEO.",
      "He served four months in prison after his April 2024 sentencing, and his company was barred from operating in the U.S.",
      "\"President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden administration pursued Mr. Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims.\"",
      "\"The Biden administration sought to imprison Mr. Zhao for three years, a sentence so outside sentencing guidelines that even the judge said he had never heard of this in his 30-year career. These actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States' reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation. The Biden administration's war on crypto is over.\"",
      "Zhao has a net worth of roughly $86 billion, according to Forbes. Zhao, who founded Binance in 2017, still owns the vast majority of the exchange, according to Forbes.",
      "Zhao and Binance also have ties to the Trump family's investments in the cryptocurrency industry.",
      "Mr. Trump's sons, Eric and Donald Jr., founded World Liberty Financial last year. An investment fund in the United Arab Emirates picked World Financial Liberty's stablecoin, USD, to back its purchase of a stake in Binance, according to The Associated Press.",
      "When asked about the move at the time, Mr. Trump said, \"I don't know anything about it,\" the AP reported.",
      "Asked on Thursday why he chose to pardon Zhao and if the decision had anything to do with Zhao's connection to his family's crypto business, Mr. Trump said, \"A lot of people said that he wasn't guilty of anything.\"",
      "\"I don't know him. I don't believe I've ever met him,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"He had a lot of support, and what they said that he did is not even a crime. It wasn't a crime. That he was persecuted by the Biden administration. And so I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people.\""

      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike next week.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 12,000 workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in May 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. gross national debt has surpassed $38 trillion for the first time, U.S. Treasury Department data shows.",
      "The country's mounting debt comes as the government remains closed, disrupting the economy as hundreds of thousands of federal workers go unpaid.",
      "Government shutdowns can boost the national debt because they delay economic activity and postpone fiscal decisions, while pausing federal programs and starting them up again can also increase costs. The Office of Management and Budget estimated that a 2013 U.S. government shutdown cost $2 billion in lost worker productivity.",
      "\"Reaching $38 trillion in debt during a government shutdown is the latest troubling sign that lawmakers are not meeting their basic fiscal duties,\" Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on fiscal policy, said in a statement.",
      "\"If it seems like we are adding debt faster than ever, that's because we are. We passed $37 trillion just two months ago, and the pace we're on is twice as fast as the rate of growth since 2000,\" he added.",
      "The federal deficit is the gap between what the federal government spends each year and what it collects in revenue, while the debt is the total amount it owes over time.",
      "The U.S. debt reached $34 trillion in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024 and $36 trillion in November 2024.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history, the 35-day stalemate in 2018, cost the economy $11 billion, largely to a reduction in spending by federal workers, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "In September, 81% of voters surveyed by the Peterson Foundation highlighted the national debt an issue of concern. According to economists, the growing mountain of debt leads to higher interest costs for the U.S. government.",

      "Credit rating agency Moody's\u00a0downgraded the U.S. credit rating\u00a0in May from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1, reflecting investor concerns about the government's growing debt. The two other major credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, have also lowered the U.S. rating.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a prominent voice on the nation's fiscal policies, also expressed concern at the national debt topping $38 trillion.",
      "\"The reality is that we're becoming distressingly numb to our own dysfunction. We fail to pass budgets, we blow past deadlines, we ignore fiscal safeguards and we haggle over fractions of a budget while leaving the largest drivers untouched,\" she said in a statement. \"Social Security and Medicare, for example, are just seven years from having their trust funds depleted \u2014 and you don't hear anything from our political leaders on how to avoid such a disaster.\"",

    "summary": "Wholesale prices for frozen turkeys are expected to be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from last year's average.",
    "story": [
      "Turkeys aren't known for flying but their prices are soaring ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A September outlook report from the United States Agriculture Department estimates that wholesale prices for frozen turkeys will be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from 2024's\u00a0average of $0.94 per pound.",
      "The wholesale price is what retailers pay to buy items in bulk. Retailers then decide how much they want to charge consumers.",
      "The reason the birds \u2014 traditionally the centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table \u2014 are getting more expensive comes down to supply. The number of available turkeys has shrunk in recent years amid slightly weakened demand and avian flu outbreaks, according to USDA\u00a0data.",
      "More than 3 million turkeys have been impacted by bird flu outbreaks this year, including over half a million this month alone, USDA data shows.",
      "That translates to less turkeys: USDA forecasts that farmers raised around 195 million turkeys in 2025 compared with 200 million in 2024, a 3% decrease. To be sure, the number of turkeys in supply has been sliding over the last decade. In 2016, farmers raised around 245 million turkeys, roughly 50 million more than today's supply.",
      "Deals abound",
      "Amid the rise in wholesale turkey prices, several companies are floating deals in an attempt to win over budget-conscious customers.",
      "Walmart announced Tuesday that it is offering Butterball turkeys for $0.97 per pound this year. The retailer also said its 10-person meal deal will cost under $4 per person. Grocery chain Aldi has\u00a0offered a similar deal, at $40 for 10 people.",
      "\"Retailers typically use turkeys as a loss leader,\" David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, told CBS News. \"That is, they price them very competitively \u2014 sometimes even below cost \u2014 to draw shoppers into stores ahead of Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Both deals represent a decrease in the average cost for a Thanksgiving meal from 2024, which was $58 for 10 people, according to a\u00a0report from the American Farm Bureau Federation. Frozen turkeys that year accounted for a large share of Americans' holiday grocery bill, at an average retail cost of $25 for a 16-pound bird.",
      "Despite the surge in wholesale turkey prices in 2025, Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation\u00a0 doesn't expect consumer prices to increase much.",
      "\"We see that uptick right now in the wholesale price by about 40%, so we'll definitely see some price increases there, but I don't think they're going to go a whole lot higher above where they are at,\" he said on a Farm Bureau podcast.",
      "\"Higher wholesale prices for turkeys are likely to translate into somewhat higher prices at the grocery store, but the increase consumers see will probably be smaller than what's happening upstream,\" Ortega explained.",
      "In other welcome news for shoppers, CBS News' price tracker shows that prices for Thanksgiving dinner ingredients like butter, milk and potatoes haven't budged much compared with prices the same time last year.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:10:49 -0400",
    "summary": "New tax cuts in the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act are retroactive to 2025, which means many Americans may get bigger refunds in early 2026. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans could see heftier tax refunds next year when they file their 2025 tax returns, largely due to new provisions enacted through the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act that are retroactive to the start of the current year, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "Total taxpayer savings could amount to an additional $50 billion through bigger tax refunds or a cut in their 2026 taxes, Oxford lead economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in the Oct. 21 report.",
      "A $50 billion boost in tax refunds would represent an 18% increase from the $275 billion in refunds the IRS sent this year to nearly 94 million taxpayers who overpaid on their 2024 federal tax returns, according to data\u00a0from the agency. The average refund in 2025 was $2,939, according to the IRS.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill,\" signed into law by Mr. Trump in July, extended the tax reductions enacted under th 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But the new law also added an array of new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income. It also lifted the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000, a change that is expected to primarily help higher-income Americans.",
      "Although the tax changes are effective this year, the IRS hasn't yet updated its\u00a0withholding tables, which provide guidance to employers on how much in federal tax to withhold from their employees' paychecks, Vanden Houten wrote. As a result, many taxpayers are unlikely to have taken the step of lowering their withholding amounts on their own, she noted.",
      "\"[M]any taxpayers will pay too much in tax this year and see larger tax refunds or smaller tax bills next year than otherwise would be the case,\" Vanden Houten said, adding that will likely produce a \"windfall at tax time in 2026 through larger refunds and lower tax bills.\"",
      "The Oxford analysis doesn't estimate the average size of individual tax refunds next year, but it noted that a \"disproportionate share of the benefits will accrue to upper-income households.\"",
      "That echoes earlier analyses from tax specialists who said that higher-income Americans are likely to see a bigger relative boost from the new tax law compared with lower-income households. For instance, $6 of every $10 in new tax breaks from the \"big, beautiful bill\" will go to the top 20% of households, or people with incomes over $217,000 per year, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis published in July.",
      "Wealthy households also will benefit from the higher SALT cap, which can only be tapped by tax filers who itemize \u2014 typically high-income households with sizable deductions that surpass the standard deduction. That boost from the bigger SALT break will deliver an extra $5.1 billion in total tax savings, Oxford estimated.",
      "Seniors are also likely to enjoy a bigger tax refund in early 2026, with the new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 years old under the \"big, beautiful bill\" providing as much as $9.3 billion in tax savings, the Oxford estimated.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-benefits-90-percent-americans-will-claim-before-70/",
    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:15:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Financial pros recommend waiting as long as possible to claim your Social Security benefits. Most Americans say they're ignoring that advice.",
    "story": [
      "Nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore one of the most common pieces of financial advice about Social Security: waiting until age 70 to claim benefits, which ensures higher monthly payments, according to a new study from investment firm Schroders.",
      "Social Security allows employees to claim their benefits as soon as they turn 62, years before the so-called \"full retirement age,\" which now stands at 67. But claiming Social Security early has a tradeoff \u2014 it lowers your monthly payment by about 30%, with those lower benefits locked in for the rest of your life.",
      "By contrast, delaying Social Security until age 70 results in a roughly 24% higher monthly payment than if you claimed benefits at age 67 \u2014 also locked in as long you're collecting benefits. As a result, financial experts often recommend that seniors hold off as long as they can, with one study finding that filing early for benefits can cost $182,000 in foregone payments.",
      "The Schroders survey\u00a0suggests that many Americans who haven't yet retired aren't buying that advice. In the survey of 1,500 adults, most respondents said they understand the trade-offs of claiming early, but only 10% plan to wait until age 70, while 44% expect to file for benefits before they reach full retirement age.",
      "Social Security provides an online calculator that lets users plug in their birthdate, then calculate the percentage difference in their monthly payment based on the age at which they plan to claim the retirement benefit.",
      "Another\u00a0new study, released Tuesday by the Allianz Center for the Future of Retirement, finds that a majority of Americans say they don't know much about Social Security or how it will fit into their retirement plan. And about 1 in 5 believe Social Security will provide all the retirement income they need, even though it generally replaces only 40% of a worker's wages when they retire, the study found.",
      "\"Not an oversight\"",
      "The disconnect illustrates the financial reality facing most workers, Deb Boyden, head of U.S. defined contribution at Schroders, told CBS News.",
      "\"The decision to sacrifice extra Social Security income is not an oversight for most Americans,\" she said. \"According to our research, 70% of Americans are aware that waiting longer to claim Social Security leads to higher payments, and yet so few are willing to hold off.\"",
      "Many retirees are facing a shortfall in their own retirement savings, a financial gap that's been well documented as a growing share of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Many workers \"need the income generated by Social Security to meet their expenses immediately upon retiring,\" Boyden noted.",
      "Why many seniors start Social Security early",
      "While the advice to wait as long as possible to claim Social Security makes financial sense, it also doesn't fully account for people's individual needs and circumstances. Many older adults claim benefits early out of financial necessity, while others may do so because health issues or chronic conditions lead them to expect a shorter-than-average lifespan.",
      "Some seniors also weigh the so-called break-even point \u2014 the age at which the total money you've collected from starting benefits early equals what you would have collected if you had delayed claiming Social Security in oder to get a higher monthly check. In other words, someone who starts collecting at 62 will have banked eight years of benefits, as opposed to claiming at age 70.",
      "Based on today's average monthly Social Security benefit of $2,000, that early claimer would receive a reduced benefit of about $1,400 a month. Over the following eight years, that would amount to $134,400 in total benefits received by the time the person started collecting Social Security at age 70.",
      "By filing for benefits at 70, that individual would receive a monthly payment $2,480, but it would take 10.4 years for the extra amount in their monthly payment to surpass the $134,400 that an early filer collected in the prior eight years. That makes the break-even age about 80.4 years old.",
      "The upshot: Some seniors, especially those with health issues, might decide they're unlikely to reach that break-even age and opt to have money in their pockets earlier rather than waiting to start collecting Social Security.",
      "The average life expectancy for a 62-year-old man today is an additional 22 years, or about age 83.6, while a woman the same age is expected to live to around 86.5, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "Concerns about Social Security's future",
      "There's another reason why many Americans plan on claiming their Social Security benefits before reaching full retirement age, she added. That's due to concerns about the future of Social Security, which is fueling concerns that \"the money may not be there if they wait,\" Boyden said.",
      "Social Security is indeed facing a financial crunch, with an aging U.S. population resulting in its payments now outpacing contributions from workers. Without changes to the program, that will result in its trust funds becoming insolvent by 2034, according to the most recent calculation from the Social Security Board of Trustees.",
      "Yet many people wrongly believe that means Social Security will halt payments if the trust funds become insolvent. Payments would continue in such an event, but benefits would be reduced by about 20% \u2014 a potentially major financial hit to the program's more than 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "Still, there are ways lawmakers can shore up the program, such as by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100, according to experts. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "In the meantime, non-retired Americans told Schroders they believe they need $5,032 in monthly income to retire comfortably. But today's retirees on average generate about $3,250 in monthly retirement income, Boyden said, adding that the gap signals the need to help workers plan better for retirement.",
      "A recent analysis from Goldman Sachs found three-quarters of younger working Americans say they're struggling to save for retirement because basic expenses such as housing are eating up a bigger share of their income compared with prior generations.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Experts say the incident revealed what can happen when a such a broad spectrum of companies rely on singular cloud provider.",
    "story": [
      "The 15-hour\u00a0disruption to Amazon Web Services, a cloud-based computing service, on Monday shook internet users around the world, disrupting everything from travel to financial transactions \u2014 and underscoring the fragility of a system reliant on only a handful of tech giants.",
      "Monday's problems at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, spawned 11 million total outage reports, with 3 million reports stemming from U.S. users, Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages,\u00a0said\u00a0on Facebook.",
      "While other cloud providers support the world's businesses \u2014 including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure \u2014 AWS has the largest foothold in the market. Since it debuted in 2006, the company has grown to control 38% of the cloud computing infrastructure market,\u00a0according to research and advisory firm Gartner.",
      "Experts say Monday's outage reveals the vulnerabilities of a system where a small number of companies provide such a large chunk of the internet's backbone.",
      "\"[The] outage is a stark reminder of the massive 'concentration risk' the global economy has accepted by building on a handful of cloud providers,\" Dave McCarthy, who leads global research for cloud services at the International Data Corporation, told CBS News.",
      "AWS' rolodex of customers include government departments, universities and businesses, and platforms such as Venmo, Netflix and Snapchat.",
      "\"Frankly, many customers may have been unaware that a service they used relied upon AWS and are only learning that now, due to system failures,\" said Craig Shue, a professor and the head of the computer science department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.",
      "As Shue explained, companies that are not technology-centric may seek out a cloud service like AWS to host their web servers and databases, allowing them to focus on their day-to-day operations. Amazon, meanwhile,\u00a0 handles the more technical aspects such as server maintenance and responses to fluctuations in customer demand, he added.",
      "Amazon declined to comment directly on the incident, instead sharing a statement from their\u00a0website\u00a0published on Oct. 20.",
      "How the AWS outage started",
      "The outage started Monday morning in Northern Virginia, home to AWS' oldest and biggest cloud computing hub in the U.S. AWS refers to the cluster of data centers in Virginia as US-EAST-1. The company also has cloud computing hubs in California, Ohio and Oregon.",
      "According to expert accounts and Amazon's own\u00a0explanation, the issue was partially tied to AWS' domain name system (DNS) servers. As Shue explained, this is the part of the internet that takes domain names like Amazon.com and converts them to IP addresses, numerical labels that identify locations on the internet.",
      "The service can be used to distribute traffic to multiple servers to make things faster, Shue said.",
      "\"It is akin to waiting in a checkout line that then splits off to multiple cashier lanes,\" Shue explained. \"A staff member can direct the customer at the front of the line to the first available server that can handle the job.\"",
      "This function was disrupted on Monday, leading to a backlog of server requests without anything to route them. It's still unclear how the disruption began, experts said.",
      "For people on the ground, this meant they were unable to carry out simple web-based functions like checking their flight time on an airline app or sending a payment on Venmo.",
      "While the issue started in the eastern U.S. region, its effects were global. Experts say it's difficult to quantify the impact in dollar figures. McCarthy, however, noted that it appears to be one of the most significant outages in recent years.",
      "Amazon said that the issue was resolved around 6 p.m. EDT on Monday, or more than 15 hours after the company first reported a problem on the AWS Health Dashboard, where it tracks service disruptions.",
      "\"This wasn't a minor glitch; it was a cascading failure originating in US-EAST-1, the very nerve center of AWS, which took down everything from gaming and social media to critical financial and educational platforms,\" he said.",
      "Will the outage impact AWS?",
      "While the incident may have sparked a small reckoning with cloud services, it's not expected to shake up the landscape too much, experts told CBS News.",
      "McCarthy doesn't expect the outage to lead to a mass exodus of AWS customers, but he said it could compel companies to diversify their cloud services so they're not reliant on a single provider. That way if one goes down, the company can still keep some operations going.",

    "story": [
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\"",

      "OpenAI said Tuesday it is launching an artificial intelligence-powered website browser, heightening the company's competition with Google, the Alphabet-owned unit that has long dominated online search.",
      "The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.",
      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology.",

      "Although government labor statistics track how many Americans are employed and how much they earn, the official data doesn't offer a full picture of the state of the job market, researchers behind Jobs for the Future's new study said.",
      "\"We recognize that not only has the way we measure the economy not kept up with way work and the economy is changing, but it has never been sufficient in terms of letting us understand what's going on under hood of economy and across the workforce, which is the engine of economic prosperity in the U.S.,\" said Molly Blankenship, a director in solutions design and delivery at Jobs for the Future, which lobbies for policies aimed at spurring innovation,",

      "A quality job is defined by five main criteria, according to Jobs for the Future:",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employmentWorkplace culture and safety, meaning the worker is free from discrimination or harassmentGrowth and development opportunities, allowing employees to develop skills and advance their careerAgency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's jobWork structure and agency, including a predictable schedule and manageable workload",

      "Agency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's job",
      "Work structure and agency, including a predictable schedule and manageable workload",
      "By those measures, only 40% of the more than 18,000 workers surveyed by the group said they are employed in quality jobs, while the remaining 60% said their jobs fall short of those standards. For example, 62% of employees said they have unpredictable work schedules, while about one-third said they are struggling financially, according to the survey.",
      "Only 27% of those surveyed by Jobs for the Futures said their jobs pay enough for them to feel financially comfortable; nearly 3 in 10 described themselves as \"just getting by\" or \"finding it difficult to get by.\"",
      "Beyond fair pay, workers also want to feel safe and respected in their jobs, while opportunities for growth are also valued, the study noted. One in four employees say they have no opportunities for promotion or advancement at work, the survey found.",
      "Another issue affecting how employees perceive their jobs is how employers use new technologies, such as artificial intelligence.",
      "\"There is tremendous concern over technology, how it's being adopted and how it will impact people's jobs in the future,\" Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and a contributor to the the report, told CBS News. \"The research indicates that they lack input on these issues.\"",
      "The degree of autonomy employees have in their jobs also shapes their daily routine and can affect their overall work-life balance, Jobs for the Future found.

      "\"There is an urgent need to reopen the government, which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature,\"\u00a0House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have written to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins requesting that she use contingency funds to cover the bulk of next month's benefits.",
      "But a USDA memo that surfaced Friday says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "The memo cited Hurricane Melissa, which has strengthened into a major hurricane, as an example of why it's important to have the money available to mobilize quickly in the event of a disaster.",
      "The prospect of families not receiving food aid has deeply concerned states run by both parties.",
      "Some states have pledged to keep SNAP benefits flowing even if the federal program halts payments, but there are questions about whether U.S. government directives may allow that to happen. The USDA memo also says states would not be reimbursed for temporarily picking up the cost.",
      "Other states are telling SNAP recipients to be ready for the benefits to stop. Arkansas and Oklahoma, for example, are advising recipients to identify food pantries and other groups that help with food.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut accused Republicans and President Trump of not agreeing to negotiate.",
      "\"The reality is, if they sat down to try to negotiate, we could probably come up with something pretty quickly,\" Murphy said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"We could open up the government on Tuesday or Wednesday, and there wouldn't be any crisis in the food stamp program.\""

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 26, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. He joins us from Seneca, South Carolina. Welcome back to Face The Nation. Senator--",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, Defense Secretary Hegseth ordered the deployment of the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Gerald Ford, to Latin America. President Trump was asked if he planned to ask Congress for a declaration of war. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK. We're going to kill them. You know, they're going to be, like, dead.",
      "[SOUNDS OF TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't need an aircraft carrier to hit drug boats are land strikes planned?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, I think that's a real possibility. I think President Trump's made a decision that Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, is an indicted drug, drug trafficker, that it's time for him to go, that Venezuela and Colombia have been safe havens for narco-terrorists for too long, and President Trump told me yesterday that he plans to brief members of Congress when he gets back from Asia about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia. So there will be a congressional briefing about a potential expanding from the sea to the land. I support that idea, but I think he has all the authority he needs. Senator Gallego, on another network, accused President Trump and our military of committing murder by attacking these drug boats. To our men and women in uniform, you're not murdering anybody. You're making America safer by going after a narco-terrorist. You're following lawful orders. When President Bush, 41, took Ortega out in Panama, Reagan went into Grenada to deal with the Cuban influence from Grenada in our backyard, he has all the authority in the world. This is not murder. This is protecting America from being poisoned by narco-terrorists coming from Venezuela and Colombia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a lot there. But just to clarify the examples you're citing, also involved ground troops. You said time for Maduro to go. That sounds a lot like regime change. Are you talking about troops on the ground?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I'll let the President speak to that. I'm talking about a briefing that would expand military operations potentially from the sea to the land. It is time for Maduro to go. It was time for Ortega to go. You know, the Monroe Doctrine has been robustly applied by President Trump. So these military assets are moving forward to deal with a country that's got blood on its hands when it comes to Americans by flooding our country with drugs from Venezuela and Colombia. So I hope Maduro would leave peacefully, but I don't think he's going to stay around much longer. I think President Trump is tired of Venezuela being used as a staging platform to poison America?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN Well, there's a lot there, sir, but you cited a Democratic senator's criticism. He's not the only one. Some of your Republican colleagues have been uncomfortable with what little information has been shared with Congress. Take a listen:",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: If they want all out war where we kill anybody and everybody that is in the country of Venezuela or coming out that has to have a declaration of war. It's something that is not pretty, very expensive, and I'm not in favor of declaring war on Venezuela, but the Congress should vote. And the President shouldn't do this by himself.",
      "SEN. JAMES LANKFORD: If this was happening with this level of insight under the Biden administration, I'd be apoplectic.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Todd Young also criticized this, what exactly is the end game? Because you're talking about regime change in Venezuela, the President says this is about drug boats.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. Well, I think the end game is to make sure that Venezuela and Colombia cannot be used to poison America, that the narco-terrorist dictator Maduro no longer be able to threaten our country and to send in drugs to kill Americans. As to Rand Paul, I just disagree fundamental with his approach. We didn't have a declaration to go into Panama. Bush 41 went into Panama to replace the leadership there, because the Panama leadership, Panamanian leadership, were working with drug cartels to threaten our country. Reagan didn't have a declaration of war congressional authorization to deal with Cuban influence. So this idea- Rand Paul, I just fundamentally disagree with. To the other senators, you deserve more information, and you're going to get more information, but there is no requirement for Congress to declare war before the commander-in-chief can use force. Panama and Grenada are two examples in our backyard, where Republican presidents chose to go after countries and leaders that were threatening our people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there seemed to be a number of issues wound up in here. I know you personally used to serve as a judge advocate in the Air Force. We looked at the JAG manual: preventative self defense employed to counter non imminent threats is illegal under international law. So if we are not at war and these suspected criminals pose no threat of imminent violence, isn't this potentially a war crime to be killing the people on these boats and then to be taking out a leader?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: No, not at all. I don't know what man you're referring to, but I know what President Bush, 41 did. He took down Ortega [sic], the leader of Panama, because he was involved in drug trafficking threatening our country. Venezuela is now partnering with Hezbollah. Hezbollah is running out of money because Iran is weak.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 That's not new.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Partnering with drug cartels in Venezuela. No, it should have stopped. Here's what, here's what's new. You got a commander-in-chief's not going to put up with this crap. We're not going to sit on the sidelines and watch boats full of drugs come to our country. We're going to blow them up and kill the people that want to poison America, and we're now going to expand operations, I think, to the land. So please be clear about what I'm saying today. President Donald Trump sees Venezuela and Colombia as direct threats to our country, because they house Narco terrorist organizations. The leader of Venezuela is an indicted drug dealer in American courts. So yeah, the game is changing when it comes to drug traffickers and drug cartels. We're going to use military force like we have in the past to protect our country. That's the new game we're playing, and I'm glad we're playing that game, and if I were Maduro, I'd find a way to leave before heat goes down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is trafficking cocaine an armed attack on the United States? That's what you're equating it to?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I am saying that there's plenty of law under article, Article Two powers of the President are designed to protect our countries from threats foreign and domestic. Was it illegal for Bush to take Ortega out in Panama? Was it illegal for Reagan to go into Grenada to stop Cuban influence building this big, long runway? There's plenty of precedent here to do what he's doing. But the game has changed. The game has changed when it comes to narco trafficking, drug organizations. We're going to take you out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you referenced something earlier. Sorry. I want to come back to you said to the men and women of the military that they are carrying out lawful orders. Secretary Hegseth removed the top uniformed lawyers in the Air Force, you know this, the Navy and the Army, because he called them roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander-in-chief. There have been other departures as well. This raises concern that commanders are not being given adequate legal counsel. That is why you just said that sentence, to assure them.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: That's that's garbage, that's absolute garbage\u2013",
      "(Crosstalk)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which that Hegseth said that?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: No, no. I'm saying that- the theory that President Trump's doing something here illegally, dealing with a country that's run by an indicted drug dealer. It's the same as Panama. There's a better case to go into Venezuela than there was Panama. There's a better case to deal with Colombia than there was Grenada. Yeah, I've been doing this all of my adult life. I have all the confidence in the world that President Trump has the legal authority, but more importantly, he's doing the right thing. More Americans have died from cocaine and fentanyl poisoning than any terrorist group in the world. I am very pleased that we now have a president who's going to use the full force of, of the American people, the might of America, to protect us from narco terrorist states and drug organizations. Keep it up, Mr. President, we're not committing murder. We're protecting our nation from people who want to poison us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's obviously buyers on the other end of it, which is why the cartels are selling, right?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well yeah, we'll deal with both. We'll deal with both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well I want to come back to\u2013 when we talk about lawful orders here, I myself spoke to a former senior commander who said he'd want that in writing because of concern that, that this is going to be down the line questionable.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: What in writing?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've already heard the orders to carry out operations. You've already heard Democratic lawmakers, including on this program, say that they have concerns about future prosecutions of officers.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well act on your concerns. Why don't you- Why don't you- Okay, if you've got concerns, here's what we can do as members of Congress. We can cut off funding for military operations we don't like. So if you're concerned as a Democrat or Republican, why don't you introduce legislation to cut off all funding to the military when it comes to attacking drug votes and going after narco terrorist states through the military. You can do that. Go ahead and do it. I'll vote no. I think it has all the authority in the world under Article Two and international law to make sure that countries like Venezuela can't be staging areas to infiltrate drugs into our country. It's not a, I think it has all the legal authority in the world. I'm just really glad he's doing this and Mr. President, keep it up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look forward to hearing those justifications when they are shared with Congress. You made some news there, Senator. Thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment.",
      "Editor's Note: A previous version of this transcript mistakenly attributed a quote to Sen. Todd Young instead of Sen. James Lankford. The text has been updated.",

      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, first \u2013 first of all, the text from Secretary Rollins was talking \u2013 talking about a purchase of soybeans that the Chinese did.",
      "And, Margaret, those soybeans were always going to get purchased. They just did it at a time when the Argentines had lifted their export taxes. So those \u2013 those soybeans were always going to be on the market. It's a global market. The three leading suppliers are Brazil, Argentina and the U.S.",
      "And I believe that we have brought the market back into equilibrium, and I believe that the Chinese will be making substantial purchases again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you dispute the idea that America hurt itself by giving this $20 billion lifeline to Argentina? Can you guarantee Americans they'll be made whole on that?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, I can tell you that the Exchange Stabilization Fund has never lost money. It will not lose money this time. And we are not giving money to Argentina. It is a swap line, which the U.S. has done many times in the past, and we've never lost money.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the Chinese, I saw that you mentioned TikTok was discussed. Are the details of the president's executive order released in September, are those finalized? Has China agreed to give up control of the algorithm that determines what users see?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, we reached a final deal on TikTok. We reached one in Madrid, and I believe that, as of today, all the details are ironed out, and that will be for the two leaders to consummate that transaction on Thursday in Korea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you tell us any details of that transaction?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, I'm not part of the commercial side of the transaction. The \u2013 my \u2013 my remit was to get the Chinese to agree to approve the transaction, and I believe we successfully accomplished that over the past two days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Over the past two days, did the U.S. make any concessions here, beyond what we discussed with the tariffs? Are you dropping restrictions on exports of, for example, semiconductor chips or restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: There have been no \u2013 no changes via \u2013 in our export controls.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When Presidents Xi and Trump are able to speak on Thursday, do you believe that the president's position here, his ability to negotiate a deal with China, is going to be hurt by the fact that he's been unable to get a deal here at home to reopen the U.S. government?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, look, I \u2013 I don't think it's going to \u2013 I don't think it's going to hurt. It's a global embarrassment what these Democratic senators are doing, keep \u2013 keeping the government shut down.",
      "I mean, look at the numbers. It's 52 to three, 52 Republican senators. Three Democratic senators have come across the line. So I just think it's an embarrassment. Doesn't affect his ability on the international stage.",
      "Now, what it does affect, it's starting to affect the economy. It's starting to slow down air traffic. And I would urge moderate Democrats to be heroes, come across the aisle, like they did in the spring, and pass a clean C.R.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A continuing resolution just to fund the government without any add-ons.",
      "Does that mean, when the president comes back to the United States, he's going to summon congressional leaders to the White House to end what you call the global embarrassment?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: I don't know what good it does to summon them to the White House. This is a Democratic-led boycott, and I'm just not sure what they're doing.",
      "What's changed between now and March, other than Chuck Schumer's poll numbers? And I think Hakeem Jeffries is now going to be primaried from the left, and I didn't think there was a lot of room over there. So both of them are worried about their primaries, and not the American people, not the government employees, not our military employees, because we were able to pay the military employees from excess funds at the Pentagon middle of this month.",
      "I think we'll be able to pay them beginning in November. But by November 15, our troops and service members, who are willing to risk their lives, aren't going to be able to get paid. What an embarrassment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. We'll talk to Hakeem Jeffries later in the program.",
      "I want to ask you about what the president just announced in regard to Canada. Today, the president said he wants to raise tariffs on Mexico. Yesterday, he said he's going to raise tariffs on Canada by 10 percent. He blames what he called a fraudulent ad that featured Ronald Reagan advocate \u2013 advocating for free trade.",
      "It was put up by the province of Ontario. Is this ad really the issue here, or is it just a tactic in this negotiation? Does the president want the USMCA free trade deal renegotiated, or is he looking to do two separate deals, one with Canada, one with Mexico?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, a lot of questions there, Margaret, but let's go to the first one.",
      "I have read that the province of Ontario is spending up to $75 million on these advertisements, and it's propaganda coming across our border to decry the tariffs. So the premier of Ontario seems to have come off the rails a little. He has taken the ads down.",
      "But what's the purpose of that, other than to try to sway U.S. public opinion? We've seen the \u2013 I'm sure you at your network have decried election interference. Well, this is interference in U.S. sovereign matters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it really the premise for damaging negotiations with a top trading partner?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, it's clearly damaged our relationship the - - with the most populous province in Canada.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to inflation here at home, the president said it's been defeated. But, as you know, that core inflation edged up to 3 percent in September, less than forecast, hotter than August.",
      "But for people at home, they are seeing prices still high on furniture, energy, gardening, lawn care, apparel. Do you expect these things to cool off, and when?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, it is cooling off, because the core inflation number that you referenced was 0.2 percent, which is down the \u2013 from the previous sequence over the previous months.",
      "And you listed the things that are up, but we're seeing plenty of things that are down, whether it's energy and rents. Inflation is a composite number. And I think we are on a glide path to lower inflation over the coming months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lower inflation, but not necessarily that Americans will look around and things have gotten cheaper.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, again, there's affordability and then there is inflation.",
      "So, some of the things that can get cheaper, rent has gotten cheaper. Mortgages have gotten cheaper. We are at, I believe, an 11- or 12-month low on mortgage rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, before I let you go, I want to ask you.",
      "The U.S. sanctioned Russia's top oil and gas companies this past week, but Vladimir Putin's envoy, who is here in the United States, Kirill Dmitriev, I know you know him, said the sanctions will have \u2013 quote \u2013 \"absolutely no effect on Russia's economy. They will simply lead to higher prices at gas stations in the United States.\"",
      "Is Dmitriev wrong? And when will Russia actually feel the pain?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I think Russia is going to feel the pain immediately.",
      "I can tell you that we've already seen India has done a complete halt of Russian oil purchases. Many of the Chinese refineries have stopped. And, Margaret, are you really going to \u2013 the \u2013 publish what a Russian propagandist says?",
      "I mean, what else is he going to say, that, oh, it's going to be terrible and it's going to bring Putin to the table? Of course. The Russian economy is a wartime economy. Growth is virtually zero. Inflation, I believe, is over 20 percent.",
      "And everything we do is going to bring Putin to the \u2013 to the table. It's oil that funds the Russian war machine, and I think we can make a substantial dent in his profits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understood. You had some competing noise there.",
      "But, just to be clear, Dmitriev is in the United States because sanctions were \u2013 were lifted on him to conduct meetings here, including with President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff. When you say he's a propagandist, do you mean that we shouldn't listen to anything he says?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: I \u2013 what do you think \u2013 what do you think is going to happen to him if he goes back home and says the \u2013 the \u2013 good lord, what if he had said on TV, this is terrible, President Trump just did the right thing, this is a maximum pressure campaign that's going to work?",
      "Margaret, what's he going to say? Of course he's going to say this. If you go through and look at every Russian talking point, they seem to use the word we have immunized the economy against this. Well, they haven't immunized the economy.",
      "Their oil earnings are down 20 percent year over year. I would suspect that this could take them down another 20 or 30 percent. So, again, President Trump was criticized for not doing enough. He takes his bold maneuver, and then you're quoting a Russian propagandist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, we'll leave it there with you. Mr. Secretary, I know you've had a long day. Thank you for your time.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Leader Jeffries, Treasury Secretary Bessent said the shutdown is starting to affect the economy, and, by November 15, the troops will not be paid. Do you expect the shutdown to last that long?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: I certainly hope not. This is day 26 of the Trump-Republican shutdown.",
      "And, as Democrats, we have maintained from the very beginning and continue to maintain we will sit down anytime, any place, with anyone either at the Capitol or back at the White House to reopen the government to negotiate a bipartisan spending agreement that actually meets the needs of the American people and to decisively address the Republican health care crisis, particularly as it relates to the urgent need to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, so we can prevent tens of millions of Americans from experiencing dramatically increased health insurance premiums that will make access to a doctor unaffordable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to come back to health care in a moment, but the treasury secretary accused you of playing politics personally.",
      "And I know that your Democratic Whip, Katherine Clark, said on FOX this past week that shutdowns are terrible, but, as she put it, it's one of the few leverage items Democrats have. Do you think Democrats are gaining from this fight?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: No, our focus continues to be on driving down the high cost of living for everyday Americans.",
      "Donald Trump and Republicans promised that they would lower costs on day one. We know costs haven't gone down. They're going up. Inflation is moving in the wrong direction. The Trump tariffs have made life more expensive for the American people, to the tune of thousands of additional dollars per year.",
      "We know that electricity bills are through the roof. Housing costs are too high, childcare costs are too high, groceries too expensive. And now tens of millions of Americans are at risk of having their premiums explode\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: \u2026 in some cases by $1,000 to $2,000 per year. That's what this fight for us is all about.",
      "Republicans have come up with a new conspiracy theory every week for the last six weeks. The Democratic position, Margaret, has been clear, cancel the cuts, lower the cost, save health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that was the quote from the whip herself when she said leverage.",
      "But I hear you on rising health care costs. But the immediate term, people aren't getting paid; 750,000 federal workers are on unpaid leave. Eighty percent of the folks who work on our nuclear program are included in that figure. The agriculture secretary said there will be delays in food staps - - stamps for many of the 41 million people who rely on SNAP.",
      "And then at airports across the country, half of the flight delays, according to the transportation secretary, are because of staffing shortages. This pain is real now. So, is there a point at which it becomes too great to justify continuing the shutdown?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, there is an urgent need to reopen the government, which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature.",
      "That's what we've called for from the very beginning. Unfortunately\u2026",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 they won't do that until you pass the funding bill, the clean funding bill that already passed the House. Why can't Democrats in the Senate get on board with that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, we've made clear \u2013 and I'm thankful for the leadership of Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats \u2013 that we \u2013 we're not going to support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the health care of the American people in an environment where Republicans have already enacted the largest cut to Medicaid in American history.",
      "Hospitals, nursing homes and community-based health centers are closing all across the country. There is the possibility that Medicare could face a $536 billion cut, the largest cut to Medicare in history, if Congress doesn't act by the end of this year, because of what Republican policies have done in their one big, ugly bill.",
      "And now they refuse to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. That impacts working-class Americans, middle-class Americans and everyday Americans throughout the country, including in rural America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013 well, they haven't refused. Leader Thune said he'd even put that up for a vote if you open the government first.",
      "But next Saturday is the beginning of open enrollment. I mean, people are going to see what that bill is going to look like. Practically speaking, aren't you out of time here? Insurance companies have set these premiums in place. That's how they're already in the mail for people to open and see on Saturday.",
      "What becomes the strategy after November 1 if this shutdown lasts that long?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, listen, we want to reopen the government, and we need to stand by our hard working federal employees who are doing all that they can to make sure that taxpayer dollars are spent effectively and efficiently, even under the most adverse circumstances.",
      "Remember, in terms of federal employees, the Trump administration has fired or dismissed more than 200,000 civil servants prior to them shutting the government down on October 1. We want to reopen the government now. In terms of health care, part of the reality is that tens of millions of people are already receiving notices in October that their premiums are about to skyrocket\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: \u2026 because of the Republican refusal to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credit.",
      "And, by the way, they have had the opportunity, both House Republicans and Senate Republicans, repeatedly throughout the year to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. And they've consistently voted against it. That's why we need action, not simply words, a wing-and-a-prayer promise from people who have tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act more than 70 different times since 2010.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But aren't the premiums already locked in here? Or are you saying Republicans are right when you can make up for it at the end of the year with the tax credit?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: The premiums are not locked in, in terms of the reality that, if we can act legislatively and act now, we can extend the open enrollment period. We can push it back.",

      "Leader Jeffries, I want to ask you about some other matters as well. In New York City, a city of more than eight million people, there's about to be an election of a new mayor. You waited until this Friday, the day before early voting began, to endorse the Democratic socialist candidate, Zohran Mamdani. Why did you wait so long?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Well, as I indicated, the last several weeks we've been immersed in the intensity around the government shutdown and the run-up to that in advance of September 30th and the expiration of the fiscal year.",
      "But I support the Democratic nominee, as I indicated. And we're in alignment in terms of the issue related to affordability and the need to address it decisively for the city of New York. And, of course, affordability is an issue for people all across the country.",
      "From a public safety standpoint, I supported the notion that he would retain Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch to continue to lead the NYPD forward. That's incredibly important from a public safety standpoint for every community, including as a high priority the safety and security of the Jewish community. And in terms of the moment that we find ourselves in, Donald Trump represents an existential threat to the city of New York and beyond because of the extreme assault that has taken place throughout this year on the economy, on healthcare, on farmers, on veterans, on law-abiding immigrant communities, on due process, on the rule of law, and, of course, on the American way of life itself. And we all, as Americans, are going to have to be aligned in pushing back so we can end this national nightmare that Donald Trump has visited upon the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you still waited until Friday and the election is upon us. But you're leaving room in your answer there for understanding that you don't agree with the candidate on some other issues, though you agree with him on affordability.",
      "Since Democrats are running for re-election in the midterm races, you want to retake the House. Would you recommend they mimic some of the Mamdani's messages as a progressive model for the party?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: No, what we've said from the very beginning is that we have to decisively address the affordability crisis that Donald Trump and Republican policies have made worse in the United States of America. We need to lower the high cost of living. We need to fix our broken healthcare system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: And we need to, of course, clean up corruption in the United States of America.",
      "No, what we're going to mimic is our own views as it relates to the need to make life more affordable here in America. When you work hard and play by the rules in this country, you should be able to live a comfortable life, live the good life. Good-paying job, good housing, good healthcare, good education for your children and a good retirement. But far too many people are struggling to live paycheck to paycheck and can barely get by.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: That's unacceptable in the wealthiest country in the history of the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something you said. You said Democrats \u2013 \"there are no election deniers on our side of the aisle.\" You said that back in January. But recently you've been using the term \"rigged elections\" in reference the upcoming midterms. Democrats were appalled when President Trump used language like that. How do you justify using that now? Doesn't that undermine faith for voters you need to show up?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: No, I've been using that term in the context of Donald Trump's unprecedented effort to gerrymander congressional maps in a partisan fashion all across the country in order to rig the midterm elections and deny the ability of the American people to actually decide who should be in the majority as it relates to the House of Representatives. The framers of the constitution were very clear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know Democrats are also going through \u2013 through gerrymandering and redistricting.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: No, no, no, \u2013 well, Democrats are going to push back aggressively to make sure that we have fair maps across the country, not partisan gerrymandering \u2013",

I think President Trump's made a decision that Maduro, the \u2013 the leader of Venezuela, is an indicted drug \u2013 drug trafficker, that it's time for him to go. That Venezuela and Colombia have been safe havens for narco terrorists for too long. And President Trump told me yesterday that he plans to brief members of Congress when he gets back from Asia about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia.",
      "So, there will be a congressional briefing about a potential expanding from the sea to the land. I support that idea. But I think he has all the authority he needs.",

      "When President Bush 41 took Ortega out in Panama, Reagan went into Grenada to deal with the Cuban influence on Grenada in our backyard. He has all the authority in the world. This is not murder, this is protecting America from being poisoned from narco terrorists coming from Venezuela and Colombia.",

      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, it is.",

      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I'll let the president speak to that. I'm talking about a briefing that would expand military operations potentially from the sea to the land. It is time for Maduro to go. It was time for Ortega to go. You know, the Monroe Doctrine has being robustly applied by President Trump. So, these military assets are moving forward to deal with a country that's got blood on its hands when it comes to Americans by flooding our country with drugs from Venezuela and Colombia.",
      "So, I hope Maduro would leave peacefully, but I don't think he's going to stay around much longer. I think President Trump is tired of Venezuela being used as a staging platform to poison America.",

      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president saying this is about drug boats.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Well, I think the end game is to make sure that Venezuela and Colombia cannot be used to poison America. That the narco terrorist dictator, Maduro, no longer be able to threaten our country and to send in drugs to kill Americans.",
      "As to Rand Paul, I just disagree fundamentally with his approach. We didn't have a declaration to go into Panama. Bush 41 went into Panama to replace the leadership there because the Panama leadership, Panamanian leadership, were working with drug cartels to threaten our country.",
      "Reagan didn't have a declaration of war, congressional authorization, to deal with Cuban influence.",
      "So, this idea of \u2013 Rand Paul, I just fundamentally disagree with.",
      "To the other senators, you deserve more information and you're going to get more information. But there is no requirement for Congress to declare war before the commander in chief can use force. Panama and Grenada are two examples in our backyard where Republican presidents chose to go after countries and leaders that were threatening our people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there \u2013 there seemed to be a number of issues wound up in here. I know you personally used to serve as a judge advocate in the Air Force.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We looked at the JAG manual. \"Preventive self-defense employed to counter non-imminent threats is illegal under international law. So, if we are not at war and these suspected criminals pose no threat of imminent violence, isn't this potentially a war crime to be killing the people on these boats and then to be taking out a leader?",
      "GRAHAM: No, not at all. I don't know what manual you're referring to, but I know what President Bush 41 did. He took down Ortega, the leader of Panama, because he was involved in drug trafficking, threatening our country.",
      "Venezuela is now partnering with Hezbollah. Hezbollah is running out of money because Iran is weak. They're partnering with drug cartels in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not new.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: No, it should have stopped.",
      "Here's what \u2013 here's what's new. You've got a commander in chief that's not going to put up with this crap. We're not going to sit on the sidelines and watch boats full of drugs come to our country. We're going to blow them up and kill the people that want to poison America. And we're now going to expand operations, I think, to the land. So, please be clear about what I'm saying today. President Donald Trump sees Venezuela and Colombia as direct threats to our country because they house narco terrorist organizations. The leader of Venezuela is an indicted drug dealer in American courts.",
      "So, yes, the game is changing when it comes to drug traffickers and drug cartels. We're going to use military force, like we have in the past, to protect our country. That's the new game we're playing, and I'm glad we're playing that game. And if I were Maduro, I'd find a way to leave before he goes down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, is trafficking cocaine an armed attack on the United States? That's what you're equating it to?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I am saying that there's plenty of law under article \u2013 Article II powers of the president are designed to protect our country from threats, foreign and domestic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Was it illegal for Bush to take Ortega out in Panama? Was it illegal for Bush \u2013 Reagan to go into Grenada to stop Cuban influence building this big, long runway. There's plenty of precedent here to do what he's doing.",
      "But the game has changed. The game has changed when it comes to narco trafficking drug organizations. We're going to take you out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you referenced something earlier, sir, I want to come back to. You said to the men and women of the military that they are carrying out lawful orders.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes, I believe that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Hegseth removed the top uniformed lawyers in the Air Force, you know this, the Navy and the Army, because he called them road blocks to orders that are given by a commander in chief. There have been other departures as well.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This raises concern that commanders are not being given adequate legal counsel. That is why you just said that sentence to assure them.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: That's \u2013 that's garbage. That's absolute garbage to say that President Trump doesn't have the \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which, that Hegseth said that?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: No, no, I'm saying the \u2013 the \u2013 the theory that President Trump is doing something here illegally, dealing with a country that's run by an indicted drug dealer, is the same as Panama. There's a better case to go into Venezuela than there was Panama. There's a better case to deal with Colombia than there was Grenada.",
      "Yes, I've been doing this all of my adult life. I have all the confidence in the world that President Trump has the legal authority, but more importantly, he's doing the right thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: More Americans have died from cocaine and fentanyl poisoning than any terrorist group in the world. I am very pleased that we now have a president who is going to use the full force of \u2013 of the American people, the might of America, to protect us from narco terrorist states and drug organizations. Keep it up, Mr. President. We're not committing murder, we're protecting our nation from people that want to poison us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's obviously buyers on the other end of it, which is why the cartels are selling, right?",
      "But I want to \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, well \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, we'll do a vote. We'll do a vote.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to come back to, when we talk about lawful orders here, I myself spoke to a former senior commander who said he'd want that in writing because of concern that \u2013 that this is going to be down the line questionable. You've already heard \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Wants what in writing?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The orders to carry out operations.",
      "You've already heard Democratic lawmakers, including on this program, say that they have concerns about future prosecutions of \u2013 of officers.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, act on your concerns. Why don't you \u2013 why don't you \u2013 I'd \u2013 OK, if you've got concerns, here's what we can do as members of Congress. We can cut off funding for military operations we don't like. So, if you're concerned as a Democrat or a Republican, why don't you introduce legislation to cut off all funding to the military when it comes to attacking drug boats and going after narco terrorist states through the military. You can do that. Go ahead and do that. I'll vote no. I think he has all the authority in the world under Article II and international law to make sure that countries like Venezuela can't be staging areas to infiltrate drugs into our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: It's not \u2013 I think he has all the legal authority in the world and I'm just really glad he's doing this. And, Mr. President, keep it up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look forward to hearing those justifications when they are shared with Congress. You made some news there, Senator. Thank you for your time today.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And joining us now is the chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, Michigan Republican Representative John Moolenaar.",
      "Welcome, Congressman.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR, (R-MI): Thank you, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So much to get to with you. But just quickly, if the prime adversary and threat to the United States is in China, in the Pacific, is bringing them to the \u2013 all the military to the western hemisphere in such full force and focus the thing to do?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Well, I think we're sending an important message that we're no longer going to allow drug trafficking coming in and killing American lives. And, you know, China is very much behind the fentanyl crisis that's killed hundreds of thousands of Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: And so \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's out of Mexico, primarily.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Well, and \u2013 and I think the president takes the western hemisphere very seriously. And getting the drugs out of our backyard I think is an important step forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the committee work that you've been doing, I'm sure you heard from Treasury Secretary Bessent at the top of the program that he says China has agreed to the TikTok deal. One hundred and seventy million Americans use this social media app. Congress had passed a law to force the sale and cited it as a national security threat if it continued to operate the way it has.",
      "Have your national security concerns about the app and about this transaction been addressed?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Well, I think it's important that we note that it \u2013 the law requires a divestment. And getting the Chinese Communist Party control away from the app, as well as the algorithm, and it allows ownership only up to 20 percent for the Chinese entity ByteDance. And, to me, it's very important that that's carried out. We don't know all the specifics of this, but we know that American companies are very interested in participating. There's the proposal for a lease agreement. But how you get that algorithm completely out of the Chinese control is going to be up to the experts. You know, there's six million pieces of code in this algorithm, and we need to make sure that it's protected for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that algorithm is the data tracking system that's pulled from a user's habits. And so the accusation was also that this was basically manipulating consumers in terms of what they were able to see. So, will that algorithm be maintained, and will upgrades only be conducted by, for example, American engineers?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: That would be my recommendation because ultimately we don't want a Chinese propaganda effort.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Affecting 170 million Americans. We also want to make sure that data from Americans is \u2013 is kept secure. And as long as the Chinese are involved, I think there's reasons for distrust and",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even with the 20 percent stake?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: I \u2013 I'm still concerned about it. Quite frankly, you know, the Chinese report to the Chinese Communist Party. And they will leverage every advantage they get. But the president has set a goal of making this available to the American people following the law that was passed in a bipartisan way, and I trust that they are doing that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president has not been following the letter of the law that you voted for. You know that.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Well, I think \u2013 I think the goal has been to come to an agreement, to come to a deal. And they've been working very hard to do that. But when you have the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, with direct leverage on this in terms of what they will do, what they won't do, it's very difficult to continue to make that available.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: But I trust the people who are negotiating that recognize, we've got to get the control of the algorithm away from the Chinese Communist Party, the app, and make sure that the ownership is controlled by America, not China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, let's talk about that ownership. The president said the investors would include Michael Dell, Lachlan Murdoch, whose family owns Fox News, and Larry Ellison, whose son owns Paramount, parent company of CBS News.",
      "Do you have concerns that people who are boosters of the president will have ownership of social media in this way?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: You know, I think there's \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Since it's so powerful.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Well, there are some, I'm sure, investors. Not everybody is simply a supporter of the president. But I \u2013 I believe that in this case Congress has a role for oversight. And we will be meeting with the parties of transaction. We also will have hearings on this because, at the end of the day, we want this controlled by American companies, regardless of what their political affiliation. We don't want it controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Secretary Bessent said he got the Chinese to say yes. And on Thursday he used the word \"consummated,\" that this deal will be signed off between Xi and Trump. So, are your hearings just after the fact or, you know, what effect do you hope they will have?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Well, oversight. Congress has a legitimate role of oversight. We passed a law \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning you assume this deal is done, that this transaction is happening and you're just going to monitor it?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: I \u2013 I would assume that if the president comes to an agreement, which he's charged to do under the law, and if that happens on Thursday, then it will move forward. And there may be challenges to that law or the implementation of it, but Congress has a role of oversight to ensure that the law is followed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Xi Jinping called TikTok, quote, \"spiritual opium,\" and he saw this as just like a low-cost bargaining chip for China. Do you think that that's what's happening here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: I believe \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That this is just an easy thing to hand over to \u2013 to President Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: I believe it's a very addictive app. China has made a lot of money because of that. But they've also used it in a way that allows, you know, their information, their propaganda, to be propagated. They control the algorithm. And that's why we passed that bipartisan law.",
      "So, I \u2013 I believe Xi Jinping views this as a strategic asset. That's why he didn't want to sell it to some of the other American companies that were interested in purchasing it. So, as long as they're involved, I think we have to recognize that TikTok, even an American version, still could be open to influence from the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or whoever owns it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Whoever owns it.",

    "summary": "California's Democratic governor talked with \"CBS Sunday Morning\" about redistricting, the \"future of this republic,\" and his own plans for a presidential run.",
    "story": [
      "In an exclusive interview with Robert Costa for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" California Governor Gavin Newsom described the Democrats' redistricting in his state as an effort to ensure \"the future of this republic\" \u2013 and a necessary measure to counter President Trump's push to expand Republican gains in the U.S. House and secure its narrow majority.",
      "The vote on Proposition 50 this November 4 was just one of the issues the Democrat discussed, including his own plans for the 2028 election.",
      "Proposition 50",
      "Newsom has been stumping across his state advocating for redistricting, in response to President Trump's redistricting push in Republican-controlled states, like Texas.",
      "Rather than gerrymander districts in the state legislature, as Texas did, California is putting a ballot initiative, Proposition 50, before the voters on November 4 in order to allow for redistricting in next year's midterm election.",
      "If Proposition 50 succeeds next week, Democrats will change the boundaries of U.S. House districts in California, making it easier for their party to win up to five   more seats. (The state currently has 43 U.S. House seats held by Democrats, and 9 by Republicans.)",
      "Newsom is framing the effort as something about more than California's Congressional delegation, but about oversight of the Trump administration. \"I think it's about our democracy,\" he said. \"It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about, you know, what the founding fathers lived and died for, this notion of the rule of law, and not the rule of Don. This rule of popular sovereignty fundamentally, of co-equal branches of government, system of checks and balances.",
      "Newsom believes that if his party takes back control of the House and replaces Republican Speaker Mike Johnson with a Democrat, the Trump presidency will effectively be over. \"[Trump's] presidency de facto ends, if we are successful, we the people are successful, in taking back the House,\" he said. \"You'll have rebalanced the system. Co-equal branch of government begins to assert itself. It appears again.\"",
      "But he fears what may happen if Democrats do not gain control in the House: \"If you have a Speaker Johnson, we may have a third-term of President Trump, I really believe that,\" a nod to Mr. Trump's public musing about seeking a third term despite the U.S. Constitution limiting presidents to two terms in office.",
      "Trump's military deployments",
      "Newsom has fought Mr. Trump's deployment of federal agents in California \u2013 from Immigration and Customs Enforcement  officers in Los Angeles, to the threat of federalized National Guard troops in San Francisco and the Bay Area (which the president later pulled back). In fact, the state has filed 43 lawsuits against the Trump administration since Inauguration Day.",
      "Costa asked, \"What's it's like being the governor of the state of California, and not knowing, day-to-day, if the federal government's going to be sending agents or not to your state?\"",
      "\"It's a hell of a way to govern,\" Newsom replied. \"I mean, we're just governing just profound uncertainty, the sort of tectonic plates that we're familiar with out here on the West Coast, but on the nature of our politics. I've said this \u2013 may not be a sort of prudent thing to say about a President of the United States \u2013 but I mean, he's an invasive species.\"",
      "\"For California?\"",
      "\"For the country. For the world,\" Newsom said. \"He's a wrecking ball. Not just the symbolism and substance of the East Wing; he's wrecking alliances, truth, trust, tradition, institutions.\"",
      "He also rejected suggestions that ICE agents are needed in California because of what the White House called \"third-world insurrection riots on American soil.\"",
      "\"California cooperates as it relates to criminals,\" he said. \"We continue to cooperate out of our state penitentiary system hundreds of people every month that we coordinate with ICE to go after the 'worst of the worst.' That's not what this is about, and everybody knows it. You don't just randomly show up at a car wash and tell me it's about the 'worst of the worst.' You don't randomly show up at the showrooms or the parking lots of every Home Depot.\"",
      "Podcasting as a means to understand Trump supporters",
      "Newsom isn't just opposing Mr. Trump; he's also trying to understand the MAGA movement. His podcast, \"This Is Gavin Newsom,\" not only welcomes figures on his side of the political aisle, but also the president's allies, from Steve Bannon and Newt Gingrich to the late Charlie Kirk.",
      "Newsom said his own son has reminded him about paying attention to other voices. \"We've got a crisis in this country besides the crisis that we've discussed around the future of this republic,\" he said. \"We also have a crisis with masculinity and men. Men are struggling. \u2026 I mean, suicide rates are off the chart, dropout rates, suspension rates, loneliness, despair, depths of despair. It's a serious crisis, what's going on in this country.",
      "\"Democrats haven't focused on that issue. And I'm very proud of the work, substantive work we're doing in this, but I've also been using the podcast to highlight that.\"",
      "Mocking Trump on social media",
      "The governor also uses satire to tweak the president, aping Mr. Trump's prolific use of social media. Newsom's communications team regularly parodies President Trump's use of all-caps and AI-generated images, even signing off, \"THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. \u2014 GCN\"",
      "Newsom has said that his social-media posts are driven by both his desire to add a sense of humor to politics, and to challenge President Trump by using Trump-style tactics.",
      "2028 plans",
      "This past July, \"Sunday Morning\" spent a day following Newsom across South Carolina, a key state in the 2028 presidential race. Newsom worked the crowds, shaking hands and even pulling espresso shots at a coffee bar.",
      "Newsom's visit sparked interest among those at his events and in political circles that he might be mulling his own White House bid.",
      "\"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people. They'll make that determination,\" Newsom said in the interview this past week.",
      "Costa asked, \"Is it fair to say after the 2026 midterms, you're going to give it serious thought?\"",
      "\"Yeah. I'd be lying otherwise. I'd just be lying. And I'm \u2013 I can't do that.\"",
      "He said it would be important for a candidate to impart to voters exactly why they are running. \"Nietzsche said, 'If you have a compelling why, you can endure any how.' And so, I think the biggest challenge for anyone who runs for any office is people see right through you if you don't have that why. You're doing it for the wrong reasons.\"",
      "\"When I saw you slinging shots behind the coffee bar, I thought, 'This guy might run for president.'\" Costa said.",
      "Newsom, who as a child was diagnosed with dyslexia, said,   \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom \u2013 the idea that you even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary,\" he laughed. \"Who the hell knows?\"",

    "summary": "In an exclusive interview, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that he will consider a presidential campaign after the 2026 midterm elections.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become one of President Trump's most high-profile adversaries, told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" in an exclusive interview that he will consider whether to run for president after the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "In an interview taped Thursday in San Jose, Newsom was asked whether he would give \"serious thought\" to a White House bid once next year's midterm elections are over.",
      "\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom replied. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not \u2014 I can't do that.\"",
      "Newsom, whose term ends in January 2027 and is prevented from running again due to term limits, cautioned that any decision is years away.",
      "\"Fate will determine that,\" he said, when asked about whether he is moving closer to working out a reason for a national candidacy.",
      "Newsom, 58, has made trips to key battleground states, including a visit this past July to South Carolina, which as of now is slated to host the first Democratic primary in the 2028 presidential election, although that could change.",
      "During that trip, which featured multiple stops and was covered by \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" Newsom met with state Democratic leaders and stopped by a coffee shop to rally activists and help employees serve espresso drinks.",
      "\"I happen to, and thank God, I'm in the right business,\" Newsom said in the interview, when asked about his evident enjoyment in meeting Democrats in South Carolina. \"I love people. I actually love people.\"",
      "Newsom said talk of him possibly running for president, after facing challenges throughout his life, including dyslexia, is a reminder to him that lives can go in surprising directions.",
      "\"I have no idea,\" Newsom said of whether he will decide to run. \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary. Who the hell knows? I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people.\"",
      "Newsom said his focus now is on passing Proposition 50, a California ballot measure he has championed that would allow state Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to the party. Newsom has cast his effort, which will be decided in a special election next week, as a response to Mr. Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps so the GOP has a better chance at holding on to its narrow House majority next year.",
      "\"I think it's about our democracy. It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about, you know, what the Founding Fathers lived and died for, this notion of the rule of law, and not the rule of Don,\" Newsom said.",
      "Tensions have run high ahead of the vote, with both parties seeing redistricting efforts as critical\u00a0 to achieving their goal of winning the U.S. House majority next year. Whichever party holds control of the House has subpoena and oversight powers over the Executive Branch.",
      "\"We've got hundreds and hundreds, ICE and Border Patrol,\" Newsom told Proposition 50 supporters on Thursday at a labor event, referring to federal agents in the state. Newsom predicted their presence might increase ahead of the Nov. 4 special election.",
      "\"Don't think for a second we're not going to be seeing more of that through Election Day,\" Newsom said. \"These guys are not screwing around.\"",
      "In recent days, the Justice Department said it would send its own monitors to supervise the special election in California and the gubernatorial election in New Jersey. Newsom has denounced the move, calling it a Trump administration move to intimidate Democrats. The goal, according to the Justice Department, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"",
      "While Newsom has long been a fixture in California, his foray into presidential politics generated intense interest last year when he was a fierce defender of President Joe Biden, especially in the wake of Biden's debate performance against Mr. Trump, which prompted many Democrats to call for Biden to exit the 2024 race.",
      "Newsom, however, never wavered on Biden's candidacy. In the days before Biden dropped out of the race, Newsom stumped for him nationwide, including in New Hampshire.",
      "Speaking with \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" there in July 2024, about a week before Biden left the race, Newsom said he was \"all in\" on Biden.",
      "\"No daylight,\" Newsom said of his alliance with Biden at the time.",
      "According to sources close to both Newsom and Biden, the two men are close and have stayed in touch since Biden left the White House. Newsom is also friendly with former President Barack Obama, who has offered support for Proposition 50 and joined Newsom and volunteers on a video call last week.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 26, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with the top Democrat in the House, Leader Hakeem Jeffries. He joins us from his Brooklyn, New York district. Good morning.",
      "DEMOCRATIC LEADER REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Good morning. Great to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Leader Jeffries, Treasury Secretary Bessent said the shutdown is starting to affect the economy, and by November 15, the troops will not be paid. Do you expect the shutdown to last that long?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: I certainly hope not. This is day 26 of the Trump, Republican shutdown. And as Democrats, we have maintained from the very beginning, and continue to maintain, we will sit down anytime, any place, with anyone, either at the Capitol or back at the White House, to reopen the government to negotiate a bipartisan spending agreement that actually meets the needs of the American people. And to decisively address the Republican healthcare crisis, particularly as it relates to the urgent need to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits so we can prevent tens of millions of Americans from experiencing dramatically increased health insurance premiums that will make access to a doctor unaffordable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to come back to healthcare in a moment, but the Treasury Secretary accused you of playing politics, personally. And I know that your Democratic Whip, Katherine Clark said on Fox this past week that shutdowns are terrible, but as she put it, it's one of the few leverage items Democrats have. Do you think Democrats are gaining from this fight?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: No, our focus continues to be on driving down the high cost of living for everyday Americans. Donald Trump and Republicans promised that they would lower costs on day one. We know costs haven't gone down. They're going up. Inflation is moving in the wrong direction. The Trump tariffs have made life more expensive for the American people to the tune of thousands of additional dollars per year. We know that electricity bills are through the roof. Housing costs are too high, childcare costs are too high, groceries too expensive. And now tens of millions of Americans are at risk of having their premiums explode, in some cases by 1000 to 2000 dollars per year. That's what this fight for us is all about. Republicans have come up with a new conspiracy theory every week for the last six weeks. The Democratic position, Margaret, has been clear, cancel the cuts, lower the cost, save health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that was the quote from the whip herself when she said leverage. But I hear you on rising healthcare costs. But the immediate term, people aren't getting paid. 750,000 federal workers are on unpaid leave. Eighty percent of the folks who work on our nuclear program are included in that figure. The agriculture secretary said there will be delays in food stamps, stamps for many of the 41 million people who rely on SNAP. And then at airports across the country, half of the flight delays, according to the transportation secretary, are because of staffing shortages. This pain is real now. So is there a point at which it becomes too great to justify continuing the shutdown?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: Well, there is an urgent need to reopen the government, which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature. That's what we've called for from the very beginning. Unfortunately--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Republicans are saying--",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: --Republicans have refused to sit down--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --they won't do that until you pass the funding bill, the clean funding bill that already passed the house. Why can't Democrats in the Senate get on board with that?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: Well, we've made clear, and I'm thankful for the leadership of Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats, that we will not going to support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the healthcare of the American people, in an environment where Republicans have already enacted the largest cut to Medicaid in American history. Hospitals, nursing homes and community-based health centers are closing all across the country. There is the possibility that Medicare could face a $536 billion cut, the largest cut to Medicare in history, if Congress doesn't act by the end of this year, because of what Republican policies have done in their one big, ugly bill. And now they refuse to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, that impacts working class Americans, middle class Americans and everyday Americans throughout the country, including in rural America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they haven't refused. Leader Thune said he'd even put that up for a vote if you open the government first, but next Saturday is the beginning of open enrollment. I mean, people are going to see what that bill is going to look like. Practically speaking, aren't you out of time here? Insurance companies have set these premiums in place. That's how they're already in the mail for people to open and see on Saturday. What becomes the strategy after November 1, if this shutdown lasts that long?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: Well, listen, we want to reopen the government, and we need to stand by our hard working federal employees who are doing all that they can to make sure that taxpayer dollars are spent effectively and efficiently, even under the most adverse circumstances. Remember, in terms of federal employees, the Trump administration has fired or dismissed more than 200,000 civil servants prior to them shutting the government down on October 1. We want to reopen the government now. In terms of health care, part of the reality is that tens of millions of people are already receiving notices in October that their premiums are about to skyrocket--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Exactly.",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: --because of the Republican refusal to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credit. And by the way, they have had the opportunity both House Republicans and Senate Republicans, repeatedly throughout the year, to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. And they've consistently voted against it. That's why we need action, not simply words, a wing and a prayer promise from people who have tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act more than 70 different times since 2010.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But aren't the premiums already locked in here? Or are you saying Republicans are right when you can make up for it at the end of the year with the tax credit?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: The premiums are not locked in in terms of the reality that if we can act legislatively and act now. We can extend the open enrollment period. We can push it back. And we can intervene as a Congress in order to actually protect the affordability of health insurance for tens of millions of people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Leader, stay with us. I have to take a quick commercial break.",
      "[ COMMERCIAL BREAK ]",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: Welcome back to 'Face The Nation.' We return now to our conversation with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Leader Jeffries, I want to ask you about some other matters as well. In New York City, a city of more than 8 million people, there's about to be an election of a new mayor. You waited until this Friday, the day before early voting began, to endorse the Democratic Socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani. Why did you wait so long?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: Well, as I indicated, last several weeks, we've been immersed in the intensity around the government shutdown and the run up to that in advance of September 30 and the expiration of the fiscal year. But I support the Democratic nominee, as I indicated, and we're in alignment in terms of the issue related to affordability and the need to address it decisively for the city of New York. And of course, affordability is an issue for people all across the country. From a public safety standpoint, I supported the notion that he would retain police commissioner Jessica Tisch to continue to lead the NYPD forward. That's incredibly important, from a public safety standpoint for every community, including as a high priority, the safety and security of the Jewish community. And in terms of the moment that we find ourselves in, Donald Trump represents an existential threat to the city of New York and beyond, because of the extreme assault that has taken place throughout this year on the economy, on health care, on farmers, on veterans, on law abiding immigrant communities, on due process, on the rule of Law, and, of course, on the American way of life itself, and we all as Americans are going to have to be aligned and pushing back so we can end this national nightmare that Donald Trump has visited upon the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you still waited until Friday, and the election is upon us, but you're leaving room in your answer there for understanding that you don't agree with the candidate on some other issues, though you agree with him on affordability. Since Democrats are running for re-election in the midterm races, you want to retake the house, would you recommend they mimic some of Mamdani's messages as a progressive model for the party?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: No, what we've said from the very beginning is that we have to decisively address the affordability crisis that Donald Trump and Republican policies have made worse in the United States of America. We need to lower the high cost of living. We need to fix our broken health care system--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So no?--",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: -- And we need to, of course, clean up corruption in the United States of America. No, what we're going to mimi- mimic is our own views as it relates to the need to make life more affordable. Here in America, when you work hard and play by the rules, in this country, you should be able to live a comfortable life, live the good life, good paying job, good housing, good health care, good education for your children and a good retirement but far too many people are struggling to live paycheck to paycheck and can barely get by. That's unacceptable in the wealthiest country in the history of the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something you said. You said, Democrats- there are no election deniers on our side of the aisle, you said that back in January. But recently, you've been using the term \"rigged elections\" in reference to the upcoming midterms. Democrats were appalled when President Trump used language like that. How do you justify using that now? Doesn't that undermine faith for voters you need to show up?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: No, I've been using that term in the context of Donald Trump's unprecedented effort to gerrymander congressional maps in a partisan fashion all across the country in order to rig the midterm elections and deny the ability of the American people to actually decide who should be in the majority as it relates to the House of Representatives--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You know Democrats are also going through--",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: --the framers of the Constitution were very clear--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --through gerrymandering and redistricting.",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: No, no. no. Well, Democrats are going to push back aggressively to make sure that we have fair maps across the country, not partisan gerrymandering, which Republicans have initiated in state after state after state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Leader Jeffries, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that service members will miss paychecks by Nov. 15 if the government shutdown stretches on, despite the Trump administration's previous assurances that members of the military will be paid amid the funding lapse.",
      "\"I think we'll be able to pay them beginning in November, but by Nov. 15 our troops and service members who are willing to risk their lives aren't going to be able to get paid,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President Trump directed the Pentagon to use unspent research and development funds to pay the military earlier this month, with around $8 billion in funds from the previous fiscal year identified to cover the mid-month paychecks. But officials have warned that the move was a temporary fix, and that members of the military risked missing their next paychecks at the end of the month, and beyond, if the shutdown continues.",
      "Bessent suggested that members of the military will receive their upcoming paycheck, but he warned that if the shutdown continues, the U.S. would be unable to pay the service members by mid-November.",
      "\"What an embarrassment,\" Bessent said, putting the blame on Democratic leaders in Congress who he claimed are \"worried about their primaries, and not the American people.\"",
      "Democrats and Republicans have been locked in a stalemate over how to fund the government for weeks as Democrats have demanded an extension of health insurance tax credits as a condition for reopening the government. Meanwhile, Republicans have been clear that they are willing to discuss the health care issue, but only once the government reopens, despite Democrats' repeated requests for negotiations.",
      "Asked about the possibility of a meeting between the president and leaders in Congress after a request from Democrats last week, Bessent said \"I don't know what good it does.\"",
      "\"This is a Democratic-led boycott, and I'm just not sure what they're doing,\" Bessent added.",
      "The treasury secretary warned that the shutdown is \"starting to affect the economy,\" urging moderate Democrats to \"be heroes\" by breaking with their party to vote in favor of the House-passed measure to reopen the government that has fallen short of the 60 votes needed a dozen times in the Senate.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 26, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin this morning with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is traveling with President Trump. He joins us from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Good evening to you.",
      "TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, good to speak to you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been negotiating directly with the Chinese. You said today a truce may have been reached. The threat on the table was a 155% tariff on China. The President said that would be effective November 1. Is that off the table? What are the terms?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, I think we had a very good two day meeting. I would believe that the- so it would be an extra 100% from where we are now, and I believe that that is effectively off the table. I'm not going to get ahead of the two leaders who will be meeting in Korea on Thursday, but I can tell you we had a very good two days. So I would expect that the threat of the 100% has gone away, as has the threat of the immediate imposition of the Chinese initiating a worldwide export control regime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That export control on rare earths, which is used in all sorts of electronics and automobiles. That will be lifted?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, it was never imposed, so they threatened to impose it in December, and President Trump, to give me and the trade team leverage, decided that it would be a good idea for him to threaten a 100% additional tariff, and it did give us a great deal of leverage. President Trump's very good at creating leverage for us. This is the fourth meeting- excuse me, the fifth meeting that we've had with the Chinese. My Chinese counterpart is the Vice Premier, He Lifeng, so we had a very good two days. We discussed a wide variety of issues, from the rare earth- from the rare earth magnets to trade, to substantial purchases of American agricultural products, to the Chinese helping us in this fentanyl crisis that we have in the US.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the purchases of American goods. American farmers have been hit hard by China's boycott of American soybeans that went into place after the tariff war began here. The administration is pumping at least $3 billion in financial aid to farmers to help make them whole, or at least offset the pain. Can farmers expect to sell their soybeans to China again and when?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, I'm not going to give you the details here, but I can tell you that the soybean farmers are going to be extremely happy with this deal for this year and for the coming years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A few weeks ago, there was a photographer who snapped a photo of you texting with the agricultural Secretary about this. She indicated concern about the unintended damage to American farmers from the U.S. financial lifeline being given to Argentina because that country was able to sell more to China, that gave Beijing leverage over the United States. Is that leverage still a problem today?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, first- first of all, the text from Secretary Rollins was talking- talking about a purchase of soybeans that the Chinese did and Margaret, those soybeans were always going to get purchased. They just did it at a time when the Argentines had lifted their export taxes. So those- those soybeans, were always going to be on the market. It's a global market. The three leading suppliers are Brazil, Argentina and the U.S. And I believe that we have brought the market back into equilibrium, and I believe that the Chinese will be making substantial purchases again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you dispute the idea that America hurt itself by giving this $20 billion lifeline to Argentina? Can you guarantee Americans, they'll be made whole on that?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, I can tell you that the Exchange Stabilization Fund has never lost money. It will not lose money this time. And we are not giving money to Argentina. It is a swap line, which the U.S. has done many times in the past, and we've never lost money",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the Chinese, I saw that you mentioned TikTok was discussed. Are the details of the President's Executive Order, released in September, are those finalized? Has China agreed to give up control of the algorithm that determines what users see?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, we reached a final deal on TikTok. We reached one in Madrid, and I believe that as of today, all the details are ironed out, and that will be for the two leaders to consummate that transaction on Thursday in Korea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you tell us any details of that transaction?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, I'm not part of the commercial side of the transaction. The- my, my remit was to get the Chinese to agree to approve the transaction, and I believe we successfully accomplished that over the past two days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Over the past two days, did the U.S. make any concessions here beyond what we discussed with the tariffs? Are you dropping restrictions on exports of, for example, semiconductor chips, or restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: There have been no, no changes via- in our export controls.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When presidents Xi and Trump are able to speak on Thursday. Do you believe that the president's position here, his ability to negotiate a deal with China, is going to be hurt by the fact that he's been unable to get a deal here at home, to reopen the US government?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, look, I don't think it's going to, I don't think it's going to hurt. It's a global embarrassment what these Democratic senators are doing, keep- keeping the government shut down. I mean, look at the numbers. It's 52-3, 52 Republican senators, three Democratic senators have come across the line. So I just think it's an embarrassment, doesn't affect his ability on the international stage. Now what it does affect, it's starting to affect the economy. It's starting to slow down air traffic. And I would urge moderate Democrats to be heroes, come across the aisle, like they did in the spring, and pass a clean CR.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A continuing resolution just to fund the government without any add-ons. Does that mean when the President comes back to the United States, he's going to summon congressional leaders to the White House to end what you call the global embarrassment?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: I don't know what good it does to summon them to the White House. This is a Democratic-led boycott, and I'm just not sure what they're doing. What's changed between now and March other than Chuck Schumer's poll numbers? And I think Hakeem Jeffries is now going to be primaried from the left, and I didn't think there was a lot of room over there. So both of them are worried about their primaries, and not the American people, not the government employees, not our military employees, because we were able to pay the military employees from excess funds at the Pentagon, middle of this month. I think we'll be able to pay them beginning in November. But by November 15 our troops and service members who are willing to risk their lives aren't going to be able to get paid. What an embarrassment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. We'll talk to Hakeem Jeffries later in the program. I want to ask you about what the President just announced in regard to Canada. Today, the President said he wants to raise tariffs on Mexico. Yesterday, he said he's going to raise tariffs on Canada by 10%. He blames what he called a fraudulent ad that featured Ronald Reagan advocate- advocating for free trade. It was put up by the province of Ontario. Is this ad really the issue here, or is it just a tactic in this negotiation? Does the President want the USMCA free trade deal renegotiated, or is he looking to do two separate deals, one with Canada, one with Mexico?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: A lot of questions there, Margaret, but let's go to the first one. I've read that the province of Ontario is spending up to $75 million on these advertisements, and it's propaganda coming across our border to decry the tariffs. So the Premier of Ontario seems to have come off the rails a little. He has taken the ads down. But what's the purpose of that other than to try to sway U.S. public opinion? We've seen the- I'm sure the- you at your network have decried election interference. Well, this is interference in U.S. sovereign matters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it really the premise for damaging negotiations with a top trading partner?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, it's clearly damaged our relationship the- with the most populous province in Canada.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to inflation here at home, the president said it's been defeated. But as you know, that core inflation edged up to 3% in September, less than forecast, hotter than August. But for people at home, they are seeing prices still high on furniture, energy, gardening, lawn care, apparel. Do you expect these things to cool off and when?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, it is cooling off because the core inflation number that you referenced was 0.2% which is down the- from the previous sequence over the previous months. And you listed the things that are up, but we're seeing plenty of things that are down, whether it's energy and rents. Inflation is a composite number, and I think we are on a glide path to lower inflation over the coming months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lower inflation, but not necessarily that Americans will look around and things have gotten cheaper.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, again, there's affordability and then there is inflation. So some of the things that can get cheaper, rent has gotten cheaper, mortgages have gotten cheaper. We are at, I believe, an 11 or 12 month low on mortgage rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, before I let you go, I want to ask you, the U.S. sanctioned Russia's top oil and gas companies this past week, but Vladimir Putin's envoy, who is here in the United States, Kirill Dmitriev, I know you know him, said the sanctions will have, quote, \"absolutely no effect on Russia's economy. They will simply lead to higher prices at gas stations in the United States.\" Is Dmitriev wrong? And when will Russia actually feel the pain?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, I think Russia is going to feel the pain immediately. I can tell you that we've already seen India has done a complete halt of Russian oil purchases. Many of the Chinese refineries have stopped. And Margaret, are you really going to- the- publish what a Russian propagandist says? I mean, what else is he going to say? That oh, it's going to be terrible, and it's going to bring Putin to the table. Of course- the Russian economy is a wartime economy. Growth is virtually zero. Inflation, I believe, is over 20% and everything we do is going to bring Putin to the- to the table. It's oil that funds the Russian war machine, and I think we can make a substantial dent in his profits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understood, you had some competing noise there, but just to be clear, Dmitriev is in the United States because sanctions were- were lifted on him to conduct meetings here, including with President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff. When you say he's a propagandist, do you mean that we shouldn't listen to anything he says?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: I- what do you- what do you think is going to happen to him if he goes back home and says the- the- good lord. What if he had said on TV, this is terrible, President Trump just did the right thing. This is a maximum pressure campaign that's going to work. Margaret, what's he going to say? Of course, he's going to say this. If you go through and look at every Russian talking point, they seem to use the word, we have immunized the economy against this. Well, they haven't immunized the economy. Their oil earnings are down 20% year over year. I would suspect that this could take them down another 20 or 30%. So again, President Trump was criticized for not doing enough. He takes his bold maneuver, and then you're quoting a Russian propagandist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, we'll leave it there with you, Mr. Secretary. I know you've had a long day. Thank you for your time.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 'Face the Nation' will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",

      "Bessent, who has been leading trade talks with China, appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where President Trump began a three-country visit to Asia. Mr. Trump is expected to meet with China's president at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea on Thursday.",
      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, and tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Earlier this month, President Trump threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports by early November in a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "Mr. Trump warned that the tariffs would take effect if Beijing couldn't reach a deal with the U.S., citing new Chinese export controls.

      "Mr. Trump said last month that Chinese President Xi Jinping had signed off on the deal during a call. The deal represented a \"qualified divestiture,\" satisfying a law passed by Congress in April 2024 that required TikTok's China-based parent company to divest or face a ban. The move also delayed enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for the agreement on the video sharing social media app's operations in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "The White House outlined last month that the deal would establish a U.S.-based \"joint venture\" made up of a majority of U.S. investors and owners, along with a board of directors with a majority of Americans. ByteDance and its affiliates were set to own less than 20% of the new entity. The White House said a consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" Moolenaar, who previously expressed concern about the TikTok deal, said Sunday that said \"as long as the Chinese are involved, I think there's reason for distrust.\"",
      "When asked about ByteDance and its affiliates continuing to own up to 20% of the new entity, Moolenaar added, \"I'm still concerned about it.\"",
      "\"The Chinese report to the Chinese Communist Party, and they will leverage every advantage they get,\" Moolenaar said. \"But the president has set a goal of making this available to the American people, following the law that was passed in a bipartisan way, and I trust that they are doing that.\"",

      "President Trump announced Saturday that he is raising U.S. tariffs on Canada by an additional 10% in response to the continued airing of\u00a0an anti-tariff advertisement\u00a0created by the local government of the Canadian province of Ontario.",
      "In a post\u00a0to Truth Social Saturday afternoon, Mr. Trump described the airing of the ad during Friday night's Game 1 of the World Series as a \"hostile act.\"",
      "\"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",

      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment on when such an increase would take effect and what imports it would apply to, and to Global Affairs Canada.",
      "Earlier this month, Ontario officials\u00a0began airing an ad\u00a0featuring excerpts from\u00a0a 1987 radio address\u00a0by the late President Ronald Reagan in which he said tariffs work \"only for a short time\" and \"hurt every American worker and consumer.\"",
      "The ad drew the ire of Mr. Trump Thursday, who reacted by terminating trade negotiations with Canada. The president also pointed to a statement from the Ronald Reagan Foundation alleging that the ad had misrepresented Reagan's original radio address.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's comments, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the ad campaign will be put on hold starting Monday \"so that trade talks can resume.\"",
      "\"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,\" Ford wrote on social media Friday. \"We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.\"",
      "In his post Saturday, however, Mr. Trump claimed that Ontario officials had indicated the ad \"was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY.\"",

      "Trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada have been ongoing for months amid the White House's global trade war. Over the summer, Mr. Trump\u00a0hiked tariffs on the country\u00a0to 35%, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump headed for Asia for the first time this term, a trip on which he's expected to work on investment deals and peace efforts before meeting face-to-face with Chinese President\u00a0Xi Jinping\u00a0to try to de-escalate a\u00a0trade war.",
      "\"We have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Friday night as he left the White House. \"I think we'll have a good meeting.\"",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said that US-China trade talks reconvened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at around 9:15 a.m. local time on Sunday morning.",
      "The president had a long-haul flight where he arrived in Malaysia on Sunday morning, the first stop of a three-country visit.",
      "Aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Mr. Trump told reporters he may be discussing its\u00a0purchases of Russian oil with Xi. He said China is substantially cutting back on its future purchases after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Moscow's two biggest oil companies. Chinese national oil companies will, at least in the short term, refrain from buying Russian oil, Reuters reported last week.",
      "When asked when he hopes to accomplish from the meeting with China, the president said, \"I think a complete deal.\"",
      "\"I want our farmers to be taken care of, and he wants things also. We're going to be talking about fentanyl,\" Mr. Trump said Saturday. \"I think we have a really good chance of making a very comprehensive deal.\"",
      "During a refueling stop in Qatar, Mr. Trump met with the country's emir and prime minister Saturday aboard Air Force One. The Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, said that as soon as he heard the president was coming to Qatar, he wanted to have a conversation.",
      "Mr. Trump thanked the emir and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani for bringing \"peace to the Middle East,\" after they served as intermediaries during the Israel-Hamas peace deal, calling them a \"great ally.\"",
      "His trip comes as the U.S. government shutdown drags on. Many federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, there are flight disruptions as already-squeezed air traffic controllers work without pay, and states are confronting the possibility that federal food aid could dry up. As Republicans reject Democratic demands to extend health care tax credits, there's no sign of a break in the impasse. But Mr.Trump himself appears to be maintaining a business-as-usual approach, including by embarking on this latest foreign trip.",
      "\"America is shut down and the President is skipping town,\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said.",
      "Mr. Trump's first stop is at a regional summit in Kuala Lumpur. Trump attended the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit only once during his first term, but this year it comes as Malaysia and the U.S. have been working to address a skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia.",
      "On Sunday, he's scheduled to have a meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, followed by a joint signing ceremony with the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia.",
      "\"I am on my way to Malaysia, where I will sign the great Peace Deal, which I proudly brokered between Cambodia and Thailand,\" Mr. Trump said Saturday in a Truth Social post. He also sent condolences to the people of Thailand following the death of Queen Mother Sirikit.",
      "\"I will be seeing their wonderful Prime Minister when we land. In order to accommodate everyone for this major event, we will be signing the Peace Deal immediately upon arrival,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump threatened earlier this year to withhold trade deals with the countries if they didn't stop fighting, and his administration has since been working with Malaysia to nail down an expanded ceasefire.",
      "From there, Mr. Trump heads to Japan and South Korea, where he's expected to make progress on talks for at least $900 billion in investments for U.S. factories and other projects that those countries committed to in return for easing Trump's planned tariff rates down to 15% from 25%.",
      "The trip to Tokyo comes a week after Japan elected its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. Trump is set to meet with Takaichi, who is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Mr. Trump was close to Abe, who was assassinated after leaving office.",
      "Mr. Trump said Takaichi's relationship with Abe was \"a good sign\" and \"I look forward to meeting her.\"",
      "While there, Mr. Trump is expected to be hosted by Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and meet with U.S. troops who are stationed in Japan, according to a senior U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity about the planned trip.",
      "In South Korea, Mr. Trump is expected to hold a highly anticipated meeting with China's Xi on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.",
      "While the APEC summit is set to be held in Gyeongju, the Trump-Xi meeting is expected to take place in the city of Busan, according to the U.S. official.",

      "Asked in her BBC interview\u00a0whether former President Joe Biden's last-minute withdrawal from the race stymied her chance to become president, Harris said it was a question to which she will never know the answer.",
      "She said warnings she made about President Trump on the campaign trail had been proved right, calling him a \"tyrant.\" She said she believed her predictions about Mr. Trump running an authoritarian government had been realized. Harris also called out businesses and universities for, in her view, toeing the line and bowing too easily to the president's demands.",

      "Harris told the BBC her grandnieces would, \"in their lifetime, for sure,\" see a female president. She then mused on her political future, saying she still sees herself having one.",

      "When asked whether she would consider another presidential run, Harris didn't commit, but didn't rule it out,\u00a0 saying \"possibly,\" and adding, \"I'm not focusing on that right now.\"",
      "However, when CBS News\u00a0polled\u00a0residents in her home state of California this week on whether Harris or Gov. Gavin Newsom should run for president in 2028, fewer than a third of voters endorsed her having another try.",
      "Even among registered Democrats in California, which Harris won in 2024, just under half think she should run again.",

    "story": [
      "A pardoned Capitol rioter was arrested for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "Court documents obtained by CBS News said Christopher Moynihan was arrested Sunday after saying in text messages that he planned to \"eliminate\" Jeffries when the top House Democrat spoke at the Economic Club of New York in New York City on Monday, Oct. 20.",
      "Moynihan was arraigned Tuesday and entered a plea of not guilty. He was released on bond on Saturday, prosecutors told CBS News, pending future court proceedings.",
      "According to a court filing by prosecutors in the New York state criminal case, Moynihan wrote, \"Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live.\"",
      "Moynihan also allegedly stated: \"Even if I am hated, he must be eliminated, I will kill him for the future,\" the filing said.",
      "Moynihan faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat, according to court filings shared by prosecutors.",
      "In a statement on Tuesday, Jeffries noted that Moynihan had been pardoned by Mr. Trump on his first day in office and that \"many of the criminals released have committed additional crimes throughout the country.\" But Jeffries added that \"threats of violence will not stop us from showing up, standing up and speaking up for the American people.\"",
      "Moynihan's father declined to comment on the case when reached by phone by CBS News on Monday. He said Moynihan has not yet been appointed a defense attorney.",
      "Dutchess County, New York district attorney Anthony Parisi said in a statement to CBS News that \"although my office was not contacted during the investigative stage of this matter, we are now reviewing the case for legal and factual sufficiency.\"",
      "Moynihan was pardoned by President Trump nine months ago, along with more than 1,500 other Capitol riot defendants who were granted clemency hours after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "Moynihan was found guilty in August 2022 of obstructing an official proceeding, and pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor charges. He was sentenced in February 2023 to 21 months in prison.",
      "Prosecutors described Moynihan as being among the first rioters to breach police barricades and enter the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Moynihan was also among a smaller group of riot defendants who were on the Senate floor during the siege. Prosecutors argued in Moynihan's sentencing memorandum: \"While inside, Moynihan rifled through a notebook on top of a Senator's desk, saying 'There's gotta be something in here we can f*cking use against these scumbags.'\"",
      "Prosecutors said Moynihan \"occupied the dais of the Senate, joining other rioters in shouts and chanting,\" and didn't leave the chamber until police made him leave.",
      "Moynihan's arrest for allegedly threatening Jeffries was made by New York State Police, according to a statement by the agency that was confirmed by a state official. The investigation was initiated by the FBI, according to state police.",
      "A state police statement said Moynihan was arraigned in local court in Clinton, a town in New York's Hudson Valley region. He was remanded to the Dutchess County Justice and Transition Center \"in lieu of $10,000 cash bail, a $30,000 bond, or an $80,000 partially secured bond.\"",
      "State police declined a request to immediately release a copy of the agency's incident report or a booking photo.",
      "Moynihan is not the first pardoned Capitol rioter to be arrested on new, separate charges. But he is the first to be charged with making a violent threat against a member of Congress.",
      "Critics of the president's blanket pardons of Jan. 6 defendants have warned about the risk of recidivism by rioters, many of whom remained defiant and unapologetic about their roles in the attack. The rioters have been defended and lionized publicly as \"hostages\" by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a March 2025 floor speech, Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of Senate Democratic leadership from Illinois, listed the names of accused rioters who had been arrested again. Durbin cited the case of Matthew Huttle, who was accused of \"raising a firearm at police\" in early 2025 and \"acknowledged he was a January 6th defendant who stormed the Capitol,\" according to Durbin. Huttle was fatally shot by police during the traffic stop.",
      "Zachary Alam, who was convicted of eight felonies for his role in the Capitol riot, was arrested weeks after his 2025 presidential pardon for allegedly breaking and entering a home near Richmond, Virginia.",
      "Other Jan. 6 defendants have since been arrested for other alleged criminal infractions that occurred before the siege or in the years between 2021 and the pardon.",
      "The alleged threat against Jeffries is also part of a fast-growing wave of threats against legislators. In a statement last month, Capitol Police said the number of threat investigations in 2025 had already eclipsed 14,000, more than the number of cases in all of 2024.",
      "The Capitol riot injured more than 140 police officers and caused millions of dollars of damage to the Capitol complex. It interrupted the certification of the electoral vote from the 2020 election and triggered the evacuation of Congress, with leadership sent to a secure, secret location.",
      "Some rioters chanted to hang then-Vice President Mike Pence, threatened to kill then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and beat police officers with dozens of makeshift weapons, including bats, sticks, poles, bear spray and beams. Some were accused of carrying guns, knives and handmade weapons.",

      "President Trump late Friday pushed for several Biden-era Justice Department officials to be prosecuted over an FBI investigation into the fallout of the 2020 election.",
      "In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump accused four high-ranking officials \u2014 former Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray, special counsel Jack Smith and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco \u2014 of signing off on an FBI probe in which investigators allegedly looked at nine Republican lawmakers' phone records.",
      "\"These Radical Left Lunatics should be prosecuted for their illegal and highly unethical behavior!\" the president wrote. He did not specify what crimes he believes they committed.",
      "The message marks the latest instance of Mr. Trump urging the prosecution of people he has singled out as political foes. Last month, he pushed Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. Since then, Comey and James have been criminally indicted.",
      "The GOP-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee revealed earlier this month that the FBI obtained phone data for about eight GOP senators and one GOP representative in 2023 as part of Arctic Frost, an investigation into Mr. Trump and his allies' attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss.",
      "Earlier this week, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the judiciary panel, released documents that appeared to indicate Wray, Garland and Monaco approved the opening of the Arctic Frost probe in the spring of 2022. Later that year, Garland appointed Smith to independently oversee the criminal investigations into Mr. Trump.",
      "In Friday's post, Mr. Trump alleged the four former officials \"spied on Senators and Congressmen/women, and even taped their calls\" \u2014 though the Judiciary Committee said in a statement earlier this month the records obtained by the FBI didn't include the content of calls. Instead, the data covered who the lawmakers called and when, and the length of their calls.",
      "The president also claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 they \"cheated and rigged the 2020 Presidential Election.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to representatives for Smith, Garland and Monaco for comment.",
      "Grassley excoriated the FBI over its handling of Arctic Frost earlier this month, calling the revelations about lawmakers' phone records \"disturbing and outrageous\" and part of a pattern of \"weaponization\" that was \"arguably worse than Watergate.\"",
      "Smith's attorneys called his actions \"entirely lawful, proper and consistent with established Department of Justice policy\" in a letter to Grassley earlier this week.",
      "The phone records that were scrutinized by the FBI covered several days both before and after Jan. 6, 2021, when Mr. Trump pressed lawmakers to vote against certifying former President Joe Biden's election win. The gambit was unsuccessful as Congress ended up voting to certify, but the process was interrupted by rioting at the Capitol.",
      "Mr. Trump was charged by Smith's team in August 2023 for conspiring to overturn the results, but the case was abandoned after Mr. Trump's win the following year because of a Justice Department legal opinion that states sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.",
      "Smith's investigation delved into phone calls between lawmakers and the president on the evening of Jan. 6, which Smith alleged were part of a last-ditch attempt to talk congressional Republicans into blocking Biden's victory. The 2023 indictment against Mr. Trump lists several attempts by him and his alleged co-conspirators to reach lawmakers by phone. It argued the president \"attempted to exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol by calling lawmakers to convince them, based on knowingly false claims of election fraud, to delay the certification.\"",
      "Last year, a final report penned by Smith also pointed to phone calls placed by Mr. Trump and members of his circle. It cited toll records from two unindicted co-conspirators who are unnamed, one of them widely believed to be Rudy Giuliani.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing to auction offshore oil drilling leases across new portions of the U.S. coast as soon as 2026, according to internal Department of Interior draft documents viewed by CBS News.",
      "New leases would include waters off New England, the Carolinas and California.",
      "Offshore oil leases are common along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana, as well as parts of Alaska, but there are currently no active oil leases on the Atlantic coast, and California has not had a new oil lease since 1984.",
      "This comes as the Department of Interior formally\u00a0announced\u00a0plans this week to reopen 1.56 million aces in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas leasing, reversing a Biden administration decision to limit oil drilling in the Arctic.",
      "That decision drew a strong rebuke from Democrats, including Sen. Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, who accused the administration of rewarding the fossil fuel industry for its support of the president. \"This decision is not about energy dominance\u2014it's about donor dominance,\" Markey said in a statement. \"The Trump administration must immediately reverse its shortsighted decision. The Arctic Refuge is not for sale.\"",
      "The Department of Interior is\u00a0assessing new oil leases\u00a0as part of the National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program, which issues oil leases in five-year increments. The Biden administration set the previous plan and had the fewest leases on record, with only three.",
      "Documents reviewed by CBS News included assessments of whether state governments favored offshore drilling, and indicated that the states opposed it. The documents also included potential dates for leasing each tract of seafloor.",
      "If the plan is approved by the Interior secretary and moves forward, California could see lease sales as soon as 2027 and the Beaufort Sea in Alaska, which includes the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, could see lease sales as early as 2026. Under the terms of the lease, a company would then have five to 10 years, depending on the water depth in the area, to explore and develop oil and gas production.",
      "The Trump administration opened\u00a0a public comment period in April\u00a0for a new five-year gas leasing policy. Lawmakers from both parties voiced concerns about offshore drilling, including members of Congress and state governors, and the process drew more than 34,000 comments.",
      "Governors Josh Stein (D, North Carolina) and Henry McMaster (R, South Carolina),\u00a0issued a joint statement\u00a0opposing the idea, saying there has been broad bipartisan consensus against offshore drilling because of, \"the risks that these activities pose to the economy and environment of our states.\"",
      "In a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in June, McMaster\u00a0wrote, \"Every coastal municipality in South Carolina has passed a resolution opposing oil and gas exploration activities offshore. I stand firmly with them. We simply cannot afford to accept the risk of the adverse environmental impact attendant to offshore drilling.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to McMaster for comment, but his office did not respond.",
      "Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican who is running for governor of South Carolina, issued a\u00a0similar letter\u00a0to Burgum, writing, \"In South Carolina, there is widespread bipartisan agreement in opposing offshore drilling off the coast of our state.\"",
      "The Trump administration tried to open new offshore oil leases during his first term, but backtracked when Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina lawmakers from both parties criticized the effort. The Trump administration instituted bans on offshore drilling in waters surrounding those states shortly before the 2020 election. The current iteration of the plan does not include offshore oil leases off Florida's coast, but it is unclear whether those bans will continue off the Carolinas.",
      "CBS News reached out to the White House and Department of Interior for more information about the plans. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on ongoing policy discussions.",
      "The Biden administration issued a record low number of offshore oil leases, and withdrew 625 million acres along the Pacific, Atlantic and Alaska coasts from offshore oil development. The Trump administration rescinded those Biden withdrawals, and a federal court in Louisiana ruled this month that the Biden withdrawals were illegal.",
      "Offshore oil leases have been unpopular for decades. Congress had a moratorium preventing drilling on both coasts and the eastern Gulf from 1981 to 2008, and President George H.W. Bush issued an executive order preventing offshore drilling which stood until 2008, when his son\u00a0lifted the order.",
      "The Obama administration had once considered opening the Atlantic coast to offshore oil leases but changed its stance following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf.",
      "The Department of Interior is expected to publish its first proposal on the subject in the coming weeks. There will be two additional comment periods before a final plan is proposed and implemented.",

      "Patel and President Trump have made combating precursor chemicals produced overseas and related funding streams a cornerstone of the administration's anti-drug policies, blaming China for fostering the United States' addiction crisis.",
      "The FBI did not immediately reply to a request for comment. It is unclear whom Patel plans to meet with during the trip.",

      "\"This operation has already seized enough fentanyl powder to kill 70 million Americans and enough fentanyl pills to kill another 270,000,\" Patel said. \"And we have now indicted the Chinese precursor companies and exposed the funding streams that facilitate this deadly trade.\"",
      "During Senate testimony on Sept. 16, Patel added that the agency has also seized cryptocurrency wallets tied to mainland Chinese businesses and enterprises suspected of involvement in fentanyl production."

    "story": [
      "Scientists have long debated whether dinosaurs were in decline before an\u00a0asteroid smacked the Earth 66 million years ago, causing mass extinction.",
      "New research suggests dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike, but it's only one piece of the global picture, independent experts say.",
      "\"Dinosaurs were quite diverse and now we know there were quite distinct communities\" roaming around before being abruptly wiped out, said Daniel Peppe, a study co-author and paleontologist at Baylor University.",
      "The latest evidence comes from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "Scientists now say those fossils and the surrounding rocks date from around 400,000 years before the asteroid struck, which is considered a short interval in geologic time. The age was determined by analyzing small particles of volcanic glass within sandstone and by studying the direction of magnetic minerals within the mudstone of the rock formation.",
      "The results show \"the animals deposited here must have been living close to the end of the Cretaceous,\" the last dinosaur era, said Peppe.",
      "The findings were published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Differences between the dinosaur species found in New Mexico and those found at a site in Montana that were previously dated to the same time frame \"run counter to the idea that dinosaurs were in decline,\" Peppe said.",
      "The fossils previously found at the New Mexico site include Tyrannosaurus rex and a Triceratops-like horned herbivore.",
      "The biggest dinosaur examined in the study was the plant-eating Alamosaurus, which could weigh more than 30 tons and measure about 100 feet long.",
      "\"Nothing illustrates how dinosaurs were thriving up to the very end more than the fact that Alamosaurus, one of the biggest dinosaurs ever - in fact, one of the very biggest animals to ever live on land in the entire history of the Earth - was there to witness the asteroid,\" University of Edinburgh paleontologist and study co-author Steve Brusatte told the Reuters news agency.",
      "\"So not only were sauropods still around when the asteroid hit, they were still thriving, still sublime, still colossal, still glorious,\" Brusatte told Reuters. \"I can imagine the scene: one minute, a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid.\"",
      "A research team in 2019 found that the steroid strike ignited a chaotic day of fires, earthquakes, and tsunamis, which led to a prolonged period of global cooling.",
      "Scientists who weren't involved in the study cautioned that evidence found at a single location might not point to a broader trend.",
      "\"This new evidence about these very late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is very exciting,\" said University of Bristol paleontologist Mike Benton, who was not involved in the study. But he added, \"This is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world.\"",
      "Although scientists have found dinosaur fossils on every continent, accurately dating them can be a challenge, said paleontologist and study co-author Andrew Flynn of New Mexico State University. Easily datable material, such as carbon, doesn't survive in fossils, so scientists must look for surrounding rocks with precise characteristics that can be used to determine ages.",
      "Further research might help complete the picture of what range of dinosaur species was alive globally on the eve of the asteroid crash, said Flynn.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "There are many big names in a group of unlikely allies seeking a ban, for now, on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\"",

      "The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.",
      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology.",

      "The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it suddenly breaks down.",
      "About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to recover, but it wasn't until 6 p.m. Eastern that \"services returned to normal operations,\" Amazon said on its AWS health website, where it tracks outages.",
      "Cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple said \"a slow and bumpy recovery process\" is \"entirely normal.\"",
      "Amazon pinned the outage on issues related to its domain name system that converts web addresses into IP addresses, which are numeric designations that identify locations on the internet. Those addresses allow websites and apps to load on internet-connected devices.",
      "Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages, said in a Facebook post that it received over 11 million user reports of problems at more than 2,500 companies.",
      "The Amazon division provides remote computing services to many apps, websites, governments, universities and companies. Early Monday, users reported issues with Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, online broker Robinhood, the McDonald's app and many others, according to Downdetector.",
      "Even Amazon's own services weren't immune. Users of the company's Ring doorbell cameras and Alexa-powered smart speakers posted on DownDetector that they weren't working, while others said they were unable to access the Amazon website or download books to their Kindle.",
      "By mid-morning, Amazon said it had started to recover, but around 1 p.m. ET, users were still reporting problems. Thousands of Venmo users reported difficulties at about 1:30 p.m. ET, while people also reported problems with AI chatbot Claude, the Wall Street Journal and Amazon services like Alexa around the same time, according to Downdetector.",
      "Some companies and apps posted on social media to alert their users that the AWS outage was impacting their services.",
      "\"An Amazon Web Services outage is impacting information in Transit app. The length of disruption is currently unknown. We apologize for any inconvenience,\" said RTC Southern Nevada, the transit authority for the region, on X at 1:54 p.m. ET.",
      "The outage also had ripple effects in the travel industry, with major airline carriers\u00a0reporting issues.",
      "A Southwest spokesperson said the outage affected the airline's ability to efficiently dispatch some early morning flights, while United said it disrupted customers' access to the United app and website overnight. Delta said the issue caused a small numbers of minor delays Monday morning.",
      "The nation's railroad services were also affected. Amtrak reported at 1:30 p.m. EDT that it was experiencing \"intermittent technical difficulties\" which hobbled SMS, email and push notifications, and prevented customers from booking reservations through Amtrak.com or the mobile app.",
      "\"If you are traveling today, please arrive at your station at your regularly scheduled time typically 30 minutes prior to your train's departure,\" Amtrak said in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "How did this start?",
      "Amazon first reported the outage issue at 3:11 a.m. ET. Shortly after, it said its services in its eastern U.S. region were disrupted and engineers were working to understand what was causing the problem. At 5:27 a.m. ET, AWS began reporting progress, saying, \"We are seeing significant signs of recovery.\"",
      "A little more than a half-hour later, it said, \"We continue to observe recovery across most\" of the affected services.",
      "AWS customers include some of the world's biggest businesses and organizations.",
      "\"So much of the world now relies on these three or four big (cloud) compute companies who provide the underlying infrastructure that when there's an issue like this, it can be really impactful across a broad range, a broad spectrum\" of online services, said Patrick Burgess, a cybersecurity expert at U.K.-based BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT.",
      "\"The world now runs on the cloud\" and the internet is seen as a utility like water or electricity as we spend so much of our lives on our smartphones, Burgess said.",
      "And because so much of the online world's plumbing is underpinned by a handful of companies, when something goes wrong \"it's very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don't see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox,\" Burgess said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has posted a notice on its website saying federal food aid will not go out on Nov. 1, raising the stakes for families nationwide as the government shutdown drags on.",
      "The new notice comes after the Trump administration said it would not tap roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP, flowing into November. That program helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the\u00a0USDA notice\u00a0says. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.\"",
      "The shutdown, which began on Oct. 1, is now the second-longest on record. While the Republican administration took steps leading up to the shutdown to ensure SNAP benefits were paid this month, the cutoff would expand the impact of the impasse to a wider swath of Americans \u2014 and some of those most in need \u2014 unless a political resolution is found in just a few days.",
      "The administration blames Democrats, who say they will not agree to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate with them on extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say Democrats must first agree to reopen the government before negotiations.",
      "\"There is an urgent need to reopen the government, which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature,\"\u00a0House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have written to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins requesting that she use contingency funds to cover the bulk of next month's benefits.",
      "But a USDA memo that surfaced Friday says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "The memo cited Hurricane Melissa, which has strengthened into a major hurricane, as an example of why it's important to have the money available to mobilize quickly in the event of a disaster.",
      "The prospect of families not receiving food aid has deeply concerned states run by both parties.",
      "Some states have pledged to keep SNAP benefits flowing even if the federal program halts payments, but there are questions about whether U.S. government directives may allow that to happen. The USDA memo also says states would not be reimbursed for temporarily picking up the cost.",
      "Other states are telling SNAP recipients to be ready for the benefits to stop. Arkansas and Oklahoma, for example, are advising recipients to identify food pantries and other groups that help with food.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut accused Republicans and President Trump of not agreeing to negotiate.",
      "\"The reality is, if they sat down to try to negotiate, we could probably come up with something pretty quickly,\" Murphy said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"We could open up the government on Tuesday or Wednesday, and there wouldn't be any crisis in the food stamp program.\""

      "The NCAA owes a former college football player and his wife $18 million, a South Carolina jury decided while finding college sports' major governing body negligent in failing to warn the player about the long-term effects of concussions.",
      "Following a civil trial that wrapped up late last week, Orangeburg County jurors awarded $10 million to 68-year-old Robert Geathers, who played at South Carolina State University from 1977 to 1980 as a defensive end. His wife, Debra, was awarded $8 million, according to a court document.",
      "A physician diagnosed Robert Geathers with dementia several years ago, The Times and Democrat newspaper in Orangeburg\u00a0reported.\u00a0Now he has trouble with day-to-day tasks such as dressing himself and helping make meals.",
      "Other physicians who testified at the trial said Geathers displays symptoms of\u00a0chronic traumatic encephalopathy,\u00a0a degenerative brain disease found in former football players who received repeated blows to their heads while playing. CTE can be diagnosed only posthumously.",
      "The couple's attorneys argued to jurors that blows Geathers took during practices and games for the historically Black school in Orangeburg caused trauma that didn't show up until decades later, the newspaper reported.",
      "Geathers' attorney, Bakari Sellers, alleged the NCAA knew about concussion risks since the 1930s and when Robert Geathers' college career ended but didn't tell coaches or players about those risks until later.",
      "\"All of the information they knew, they withheld,\" Sellers told jurors, adding that \"their job was to keep the boys safe.\"",
      "The verdict can be appealed. NCAA spokesperson Greg Johnson said Saturday in an email that the organization disagreed with the verdict and that it \"was prepared to pursue our rights on post-trial motions and on appeal, if necessary.\"",
      "Johnson said the \"NCAA has prevailed in every other jury trial around the country on these issues\" and that the South Carolina State team standards \"followed the knowledge that existed at the time, and college football did not cause Mr. Geathers' lifelong health problems.\"",
      "NCAA trial attorney Andy Fletcher said at the trial that Robert Geathers has several health conditions that influence dementia-like symptoms, and that the NCAA's football rules committee is composed of representatives of member schools who could propose rules.",
      "\"There's going to be head-hits. That's inherent to the game. You can't take head-hits out of football,\" Fletcher said in closing arguments.",

      "After the trial, Sellers said the result provided justice: \"I felt good to hug Debra Geathers. She gets to go home and tell her husband some good news.\"",

      "Melissa strengthened rapidly into a Category 4 hurricane on Sunday and was forecast to bring \"life-threatening and catastrophic\" flash flooding and landslides to Jamaica and the southern parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic over the next few days, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center warned.",

      "As of Sunday afternoon, Melissa's core was about 110 miles south of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 285 miles south-southwest of Guantanamo, Cuba,\u00a0the hurricane center said. Maximum sustained winds were 140 mph, with hurricane-force winds extending some 25 miles from the storm's center and tropical storm-force winds extending 175 miles. It was inching west at 7 mph.",
      "Melissa is now considered a major hurricane, which is defined as a Category 3 or higher, having winds of at least 111 mph. It was forecast to remain a major hurricane when it makes landfall in Jamaica later this week, the hurricane center said.",
      "It was forecast to move near or over Jamaica during the weekend through Tuesday, across southeastern Cuba by Tuesday night and then across the southeastern Bahamas by the middle of the week.",
      "Melissa could be the most powerful hurricane to hit Jamaica, CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak said Saturday.",
      "\"The island's terrain makes it even worse,\" Kozak said. \"Jamaica's mountains force the air to rise, and that creates more rain.\"",
      "The strongest hurricane to hit Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, Kozak said, which killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That export control on rare earths, which is used in all sorts of electronics and automobiles, that will be lifted?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, it was never imposed, so they threatened to impose it in December.",

President Trump's very good at creating leverage for us. This is the fourth meeting \u2013 excuse me - - the fifth meeting that we've had with the Chinese.",
      "My Chinese counterpart is the vice premier, He Lifeng. So we had a very good two days. We discussed a wide variety of issues, from the rare earth mag \u2013 from the rare earth magnets, to trade, to substantial purchases of American agricultural products, to the Chinese helping us in this fentanyl crisis that we have in the U.S.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the purchases of American goods. American farmers have been hit hard by China's boycott of American soybeans that went into place after the tariff war began here.",
      "The administration is pumping at least $3 billion in financial aid to farmers to help make them whole, or at least offset the pain. Can farmers expect to sell their soybeans to China again, and when?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A few weeks ago, there was a photographer who snapped a photo of you texting with the agricultural secretary about this. She indicated concern about the unintended damage to American farmers from the U.S. financial lifeline being given to Argentina because that country was able to sell more to China.",
      "That gave Beijing leverage over the United States. Is that leverage still a problem today?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, first \u2013 first of all, the text from Secretary Rollins was talking \u2013 talking about a purchase of soybeans that the Chinese did.",
      "And, Margaret, those soybeans were always going to get purchased. They just did it at a time when the Argentines had lifted their export taxes. So those \u2013 those soybeans were always going to be on the market. It's a global market. The three leading suppliers are Brazil, Argentina and the U.S.",
      "And I believe that we have brought the market back into equilibrium, and I believe that the Chinese will be making substantial purchases again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you dispute the idea that America hurt itself by giving this $20 billion lifeline to Argentina? Can you guarantee Americans they'll be made whole on that?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, I can tell you that the Exchange Stabilization Fund has never lost money. It will not lose money this time. And we are not giving money to Argentina. It is a swap line, which the U.S. has done many times in the past, and we've never lost money.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the Chinese, I saw that you mentioned TikTok was discussed. Are the details of the president's executive order released in September, are those finalized? Has China agreed to give up control of the algorithm that determines what users see?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, we reached a final deal on TikTok. We reached one in Madrid, and I believe that, as of today, all the details are ironed out, and that will be for the two leaders to consummate that transaction on Thursday in Korea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you tell us any details of that transaction?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, I'm not part of the commercial side of the transaction. The \u2013 my \u2013 my remit was to get the Chinese to agree to approve the transaction, and I believe we successfully accomplished that over the past two days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Over the past two days, did the U.S. make any concessions here, beyond what we discussed with the tariffs? Are you dropping restrictions on exports of, for example, semiconductor chips or restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: There have been no \u2013 no changes via \u2013 in our export controls.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When Presidents Xi and Trump are able to speak on Thursday, do you believe that the president's position here, his ability to negotiate a deal with China, is going to be hurt by the fact that he's been unable to get a deal here at home to reopen the U.S. government?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, look, I \u2013 I don't think it's going to \u2013 I don't think it's going to hurt. It's a global embarrassment what these Democratic senators are doing, keep \u2013 keeping the government shut down.",
      "I mean, look at the numbers. It's 52 to three, 52 Republican senators. Three Democratic senators have come across the line. So I just think it's an embarrassment. Doesn't affect his ability on the international stage.",
      "Now, what it does affect, it's starting to affect the economy. It's starting to slow down air traffic. And I would urge moderate Democrats to be heroes, come across the aisle, like they did in the spring, and pass a clean C.R.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A continuing resolution just to fund the government without any add-ons.",
      "Does that mean, when the president comes back to the United States, he's going to summon congressional leaders to the White House to end what you call the global embarrassment?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: I don't know what good it does to summon them to the White House. This is a Democratic-led boycott, and I'm just not sure what they're doing.",
      "What's changed between now and March, other than Chuck Schumer's poll numbers? And I think Hakeem Jeffries is now going to be primaried from the left, and I didn't think there was a lot of room over there. So both of them are worried about their primaries, and not the American people, not the government employees, not our military employees, because we were able to pay the military employees from excess funds at the Pentagon middle of this month.",
      "I think we'll be able to pay them beginning in November. But by November 15, our troops and service members, who are willing to risk their lives, aren't going to be able to get paid. What an embarrassment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. We'll talk to Hakeem Jeffries later in the program.",
      "I want to ask you about what the president just announced in regard to Canada. Today, the president said he wants to raise tariffs on Mexico. Yesterday, he said he's going to raise tariffs on Canada by 10 percent. He blames what he called a fraudulent ad that featured Ronald Reagan advocate \u2013 advocating for free trade.",
      "It was put up by the province of Ontario. Is this ad really the issue here, or is it just a tactic in this negotiation? Does the president want the USMCA free trade deal renegotiated, or is he looking to do two separate deals, one with Canada, one with Mexico?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, a lot of questions there, Margaret, but let's go to the first one.",
      "I have read that the province of Ontario is spending up to $75 million on these advertisements, and it's propaganda coming across our border to decry the tariffs. So the premier of Ontario seems to have come off the rails a little. He has taken the ads down.",
      "But what's the purpose of that, other than to try to sway U.S. public opinion? We've seen the \u2013 I'm sure you at your network have decried election interference. Well, this is interference in U.S. sovereign matters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it really the premise for damaging negotiations with a top trading partner?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, it's clearly damaged our relationship the - - with the most populous province in Canada.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to inflation here at home, the president said it's been defeated. But, as you know, that core inflation edged up to 3 percent in September, less than forecast, hotter than August.",
      "But for people at home, they are seeing prices still high on furniture, energy, gardening, lawn care, apparel. Do you expect these things to cool off, and when?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, it is cooling off, because the core inflation number that you referenced was 0.2 percent, which is down the \u2013 from the previous sequence over the previous months.",
      "And you listed the things that are up, but we're seeing plenty of things that are down, whether it's energy and rents. Inflation is a composite number. And I think we are on a glide path to lower inflation over the coming months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lower inflation, but not necessarily that Americans will look around and things have gotten cheaper.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, again, there's affordability and then there is inflation.",
      "So, some of the things that can get cheaper, rent has gotten cheaper. Mortgages have gotten cheaper. We are at, I believe, an 11- or 12-month low on mortgage rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, before I let you go, I want to ask you.",
      "The U.S. sanctioned Russia's top oil and gas companies this past week, but Vladimir Putin's envoy, who is here in the United States, Kirill Dmitriev, I know you know him, said the sanctions will have \u2013 quote \u2013 \"absolutely no effect on Russia's economy. They will simply lead to higher prices at gas stations in the United States.\"",
      "Is Dmitriev wrong? And when will Russia actually feel the pain?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I think Russia is going to feel the pain immediately.",
      "I can tell you that we've already seen India has done a complete halt of Russian oil purchases. Many of the Chinese refineries have stopped. And, Margaret, are you really going to \u2013 the \u2013 publish what a Russian propagandist says?",
      "I mean, what else is he going to say, that, oh, it's going to be terrible and it's going to bring Putin to the table? Of course. The Russian economy is a wartime economy. Growth is virtually zero. Inflation, I believe, is over 20 percent.",
      "And everything we do is going to bring Putin to the \u2013 to the table. It's oil that funds the Russian war machine, and I think we can make a substantial dent in his profits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understood. You had some competing noise there.",
      "But, just to be clear, Dmitriev is in the United States because sanctions were \u2013 were lifted on him to conduct meetings here, including with President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff. When you say he's a propagandist, do you mean that we shouldn't listen to anything he says?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: I \u2013 what do you think \u2013 what do you think is going to happen to him if he goes back home and says the \u2013 the \u2013 good lord, what if he had said on TV, this is terrible, President Trump just did the right thing, this is a maximum pressure campaign that's going to work?",
      "Margaret, what's he going to say? Of course he's going to say this. If you go through and look at every Russian talking point, they seem to use the word we have immunized the economy against this. Well, they haven't immunized the economy.",
      "Their oil earnings are down 20 percent year over year. I would suspect that this could take them down another 20 or 30 percent. So, again, President Trump was criticized for not doing enough. He takes his bold maneuver, and then you're quoting a Russian propagandist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, we'll leave it there with you. Mr. Secretary, I know you've had a long day. Thank you for your time.",

      "Donald Trump and Republicans promised that they would lower costs on day one. We know costs haven't gone down. They're going up. Inflation is moving in the wrong direction. The Trump tariffs have made life more expensive for the American people, to the tune of thousands of additional dollars per year.",

Eighty percent of the folks who work on our nuclear program are included in that figure. The agriculture secretary said there will be delays in food staps - - stamps for many of the 41 million people who rely on SNAP.",
      "And then at airports across the country, half of the flight delays, according to the transportation secretary, are because of staffing shortages. This pain is real now. So, is there a point at which it becomes too great to justify continuing the shutdown?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, there is an urgent need to reopen the government, which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature.",

      "Hospitals, nursing homes and community-based health centers are closing all across the country. There is the possibility that Medicare could face a $536 billion cut, the largest cut to Medicare in history, if Congress doesn't act by the end of this year, because of what Republican policies have done in their one big, ugly bill.",
      "And now they refuse to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. That impacts working-class Americans, middle-class Americans and everyday Americans throughout the country, including in rural America.",

Insurance companies have set these premiums in place. That's how they're already in the mail for people to open and see on Saturday.",
      "What becomes the strategy after November 1 if this shutdown lasts that long?",

And they've consistently voted against it. That's why we need action, not simply words, a wing-and-a-prayer promise from people who have tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act more than 70 different times since 2010.",

      "Leader Jeffries, I want to ask you about some other matters as well. In New York City, a city of more than eight million people, there's about to be an election of a new mayor. You waited until this Friday, the day before early voting began, to endorse the Democratic socialist candidate, Zohran Mamdani. Why did you wait so long?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Well, as I indicated, the last several weeks we've been immersed in the intensity around the government shutdown and the run-up to that in advance of September 30th and the expiration of the fiscal year.",
      "But I support the Democratic nominee, as I indicated. And we're in alignment in terms of the issue related to affordability and the need to address it decisively for the city of New York. And, of course, affordability is an issue for people all across the country.",
      "From a public safety standpoint, I supported the notion that he would retain Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch to continue to lead the NYPD forward. That's incredibly important from a public safety standpoint for every community, including as a high priority the safety and security of the Jewish community. And in terms of the moment that we find ourselves in, Donald Trump represents an existential threat to the city of New York and beyond because of the extreme assault that has taken place throughout this year on the economy, on healthcare, on farmers, on veterans, on law-abiding immigrant communities, on due process, on the rule of law, and, of course, on the American way of life itself. And we all, as Americans, are going to have to be aligned in pushing back so we can end this national nightmare that Donald Trump has visited upon the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you still waited until Friday and the election is upon us. But you're leaving room in your answer there for understanding that you don't agree with the candidate on some other issues, though you agree with him on affordability.",
      "Since Democrats are running for re-election in the midterm races, you want to retake the House. Would you recommend they mimic some of the Mamdani's messages as a progressive model for the party?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: No, what we've said from the very beginning is that we have to decisively address the affordability crisis that Donald Trump and Republican policies have made worse in the United States of America. We need to lower the high cost of living. We need to fix our broken healthcare system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: And we need to, of course, clean up corruption in the United States of America.",
      "No, what we're going to mimic is our own views as it relates to the need to make life more affordable here in America. When you work hard and play by the rules in this country, you should be able to live a comfortable life, live the good life. Good-paying job, good housing, good healthcare, good education for your children and a good retirement. But far too many people are struggling to live paycheck to paycheck and can barely get by.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: That's unacceptable in the wealthiest country in the history of the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something you said. You said Democrats \u2013 \"there are no election deniers on our side of the aisle.\" You said that back in January. But recently you've been using the term \"rigged elections\" in reference the upcoming midterms. Democrats were appalled when President Trump used language like that. How do you justify using that now? Doesn't that undermine faith for voters you need to show up?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: No, I've been using that term in the context of Donald Trump's unprecedented effort to gerrymander congressional maps in a partisan fashion all across the country in order to rig the midterm elections and deny the ability of the American people to actually decide who should be in the majority as it relates to the House of Representatives. The framers of the constitution were very clear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know Democrats are also going through \u2013 through gerrymandering and redistricting.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: No, no, no, \u2013 well, Democrats are going to push back aggressively to make sure that we have fair maps across the country, not partisan gerrymandering \u2013",

I think President Trump's made a decision that Maduro, the \u2013 the leader of Venezuela, is an indicted drug \u2013 drug trafficker, that it's time for him to go. That Venezuela and Colombia have been safe havens for narco terrorists for too long. And President Trump told me yesterday that he plans to brief members of Congress when he gets back from Asia about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia.",

      "When President Bush 41 took Ortega out in Panama, Reagan went into Grenada to deal with the Cuban influence on Grenada in our backyard. He has all the authority in the world. This is not murder, this is protecting America from being poisoned from narco terrorists coming from Venezuela and Colombia.",

      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you talking about troops on the ground?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I'll let the president speak to that. I'm talking about a briefing that would expand military operations potentially from the sea to the land. It is time for Maduro to go. It was time for Ortega to go. You know, the Monroe Doctrine has being robustly applied by President Trump. So, these military assets are moving forward to deal with a country that's got blood on its hands when it comes to Americans by flooding our country with drugs from Venezuela and Colombia.",
      "So, I hope Maduro would leave peacefully, but I don't think he's going to stay around much longer. I think President Trump is tired of Venezuela being used as a staging platform to poison America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's a lot there, sir, but you cited a Democratic senator's criticism. He's not the only one.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",

It's something that is not pretty, very expensive. And I'm not in favor of declaring war on Venezuela. But the Congress should vote. The president shouldn't do this by himself.",

      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president saying this is about drug boats.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Well, I think the end game is to make sure that Venezuela and Colombia cannot be used to poison America. That the narco terrorist dictator, Maduro, no longer be able to threaten our country and to send in drugs to kill Americans.",
      "As to Rand Paul, I just disagree fundamentally with his approach. We didn't have a declaration to go into Panama. Bush 41 went into Panama to replace the leadership there because the Panama leadership, Panamanian leadership, were working with drug cartels to threaten our country.",
      "Reagan didn't have a declaration of war, congressional authorization, to deal with Cuban influence.",
      "So, this idea of \u2013 Rand Paul, I just fundamentally disagree with.",
      "To the other senators, you deserve more information and you're going to get more information. But there is no requirement for Congress to declare war before the commander in chief can use force. Panama and Grenada are two examples in our backyard where Republican presidents chose to go after countries and leaders that were threatening our people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there \u2013 there seemed to be a number of issues wound up in here. I know you personally used to serve as a judge advocate in the Air Force.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We looked at the JAG manual. \"Preventive self-defense employed to counter non-imminent threats is illegal under international law. So, if we are not at war and these suspected criminals pose no threat of imminent violence, isn't this potentially a war crime to be killing the people on these boats and then to be taking out a leader?",
      "GRAHAM: No, not at all. I don't know what manual you're referring to, but I know what President Bush 41 did. He took down Ortega, the leader of Panama, because he was involved in drug trafficking, threatening our country.",
      "Venezuela is now partnering with Hezbollah. Hezbollah is running out of money because Iran is weak. They're partnering with drug cartels in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not new.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: No, it should have stopped.",
      "Here's what \u2013 here's what's new. You've got a commander in chief that's not going to put up with this crap. We're not going to sit on the sidelines and watch boats full of drugs come to our country. We're going to blow them up and kill the people that want to poison America. And we're now going to expand operations, I think, to the land. So, please be clear about what I'm saying today. President Donald Trump sees Venezuela and Colombia as direct threats to our country because they house narco terrorist organizations. The leader of Venezuela is an indicted drug dealer in American courts.",
      "So, yes, the game is changing when it comes to drug traffickers and drug cartels. We're going to use military force, like we have in the past, to protect our country. That's the new game we're playing, and I'm glad we're playing that game. And if I were Maduro, I'd find a way to leave before he goes down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, is trafficking cocaine an armed attack on the United States? That's what you're equating it to?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I am saying that there's plenty of law under article \u2013 Article II powers of the president are designed to protect our country from threats, foreign and domestic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Was it illegal for Bush to take Ortega out in Panama? Was it illegal for Bush \u2013 Reagan to go into Grenada to stop Cuban influence building this big, long runway. There's plenty of precedent here to do what he's doing.",
      "But the game has changed. The game has changed when it comes to narco trafficking drug organizations. We're going to take you out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you referenced something earlier, sir, I want to come back to. You said to the men and women of the military that they are carrying out lawful orders.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes, I believe that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Hegseth removed the top uniformed lawyers in the Air Force, you know this, the Navy and the Army, because he called them road blocks to orders that are given by a commander in chief. There have been other departures as well.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This raises concern that commanders are not being given adequate legal counsel. That is why you just said that sentence to assure them.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: That's \u2013 that's garbage. That's absolute garbage to say that President Trump doesn't have the \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which, that Hegseth said that?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: No, no, I'm saying the \u2013 the \u2013 the theory that President Trump is doing something here illegally, dealing with a country that's run by an indicted drug dealer, is the same as Panama. There's a better case to go into Venezuela than there was Panama. There's a better case to deal with Colombia than there was Grenada.",
      "Yes, I've been doing this all of my adult life. I have all the confidence in the world that President Trump has the legal authority, but more importantly, he's doing the right thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: More Americans have died from cocaine and fentanyl poisoning than any terrorist group in the world. I am very pleased that we now have a president who is going to use the full force of \u2013 of the American people, the might of America, to protect us from narco terrorist states and drug organizations. Keep it up, Mr. President. We're not committing murder, we're protecting our nation from people that want to poison us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's obviously buyers on the other end of it, which is why the cartels are selling, right?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, we'll do a vote. We'll do a vote.",

We can cut off funding for military operations we don't like. So, if you're concerned as a Democrat or a Republican, why don't you introduce legislation to cut off all funding to the military when it comes to attacking drug boats and going after narco terrorist states through the military. You can do that. Go ahead and do that. I'll vote no. I think he has all the authority in the world under Article II and international law to make sure that countries like Venezuela can't be staging areas to infiltrate drugs into our country.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Well, I think we're sending an important message that we're no longer going to allow drug trafficking coming in and killing American lives. And, you know, China is very much behind the fentanyl crisis that's killed hundreds of thousands of Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's out of Mexico, primarily.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Well, and \u2013 and I think the president takes the western hemisphere very seriously. And getting the drugs out of our backyard I think is an important step forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the committee work that you've been doing, I'm sure you heard from Treasury Secretary Bessent at the top of the program that he says China has agreed to the TikTok deal. One hundred and seventy million Americans use this social media app. Congress had passed a law to force the sale and cited it as a national security threat if it continued to operate the way it has.",
      "Have your national security concerns about the app and about this transaction been addressed?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Well, I think it's important that we note that it \u2013 the law requires a divestment. And getting the Chinese Communist Party control away from the app, as well as the algorithm, and it allows ownership only up to 20 percent for the Chinese entity ByteDance. And, to me, it's very important that that's carried out. We don't know all the specifics of this, but we know that American companies are very interested in participating. There's the proposal for a lease agreement. But how you get that algorithm completely out of the Chinese control is going to be up to the experts. You know, there's six million pieces of code in this algorithm, and we need to make sure that it's protected for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that algorithm is the data tracking system that's pulled from a user's habits. And so the accusation was also that this was basically manipulating consumers in terms of what they were able to see. So, will that algorithm be maintained, and will upgrades only be conducted by, for example, American engineers?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: That would be my recommendation because ultimately we don't want a Chinese propaganda effort.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Affecting 170 million Americans. We also want to make sure that data from Americans is \u2013 is kept secure. And as long as the Chinese are involved, I think there's reasons for distrust and",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even with the 20 percent stake?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: I \u2013 I'm still concerned about it. Quite frankly, you know, the Chinese report to the Chinese Communist Party. And they will leverage every advantage they get. But the president has set a goal of making this available to the American people following the law that was passed in a bipartisan way, and I trust that they are doing that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president has not been following the letter of the law that you voted for. You know that.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Well, I think \u2013 I think the goal has been to come to an agreement, to come to a deal. And they've been working very hard to do that. But when you have the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, with direct leverage on this in terms of what they will do, what they won't do, it's very difficult to continue to make that available.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: But I trust the people who are negotiating that recognize, we've got to get the control of the algorithm away from the Chinese Communist Party, the app, and make sure that the ownership is controlled by America, not China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, let's talk about that ownership. The president said the investors would include Michael Dell, Lachlan Murdoch, whose family owns Fox News, and Larry Ellison, whose son owns Paramount, parent company of CBS News.",
      "Do you have concerns that people who are boosters of the president will have ownership of social media in this way?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: You know, I think there's \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Since it's so powerful.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Well, there are some, I'm sure, investors. Not everybody is simply a supporter of the president. But I \u2013 I believe that in this case Congress has a role for oversight. And we will be meeting with the parties of transaction. We also will have hearings on this because, at the end of the day, we want this controlled by American companies, regardless of what their political affiliation. We don't want it controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Secretary Bessent said he got the Chinese to say yes. And on Thursday he used the word \"consummated,\" that this deal will be signed off between Xi and Trump. So, are your hearings just after the fact or, you know, what effect do you hope they will have?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: Well, oversight. Congress has a legitimate role of oversight. We passed a law \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning you assume this deal is done, that this transaction is happening and you're just going to monitor it?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: I \u2013 I would assume that if the president comes to an agreement, which he's charged to do under the law, and if that happens on Thursday, then it will move forward. And there may be challenges to that law or the implementation of it, but Congress has a role of oversight to ensure that the law is followed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Xi Jinping called TikTok, quote, \"spiritual opium,\" and he saw this as just like a low-cost bargaining chip for China. Do you think that that's what's happening here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: I believe \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That this is just an easy thing to hand over to \u2013 to President Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MOOLENAAR: I believe it's a very addictive app. China has made a lot of money because of that. But they've also used it in a way that allows, you know, their information, their propaganda, to be propagated. They control the algorithm. And that's why we passed that bipartisan law.",
      "So, I \u2013 I believe Xi Jinping views this as a strategic asset. That's why he didn't want to sell it to some of the other American companies that were interested in purchasing it. So, as long as they're involved, I think we have to recognize that TikTok, even an American version, still could be open to influence from the Chinese Communist Party.",

    "summary": "In an exclusive interview, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that he will consider a presidential campaign after the 2026 midterm elections.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become one of President Trump's most high-profile adversaries, told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" in an exclusive interview that he will consider whether to run for president after the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "In an interview taped Thursday in San Jose, Newsom was asked whether he would give \"serious thought\" to a White House bid once next year's midterm elections are over.",
      "\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom replied. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not \u2014 I can't do that.\"",
      "Newsom, whose term ends in January 2027 and is prevented from running again due to term limits, cautioned that any decision is years away.",
      "\"Fate will determine that,\" he said, when asked about whether he is moving closer to working out a reason for a national candidacy.",
      "Newsom, 58, has made trips to key battleground states, including a visit this past July to South Carolina, which as of now is slated to host the first Democratic primary in the 2028 presidential election, although that could change.",
      "During that trip, which featured multiple stops and was covered by \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" Newsom met with state Democratic leaders and stopped by a coffee shop to rally activists and help employees serve espresso drinks.",
      "\"I happen to, and thank God, I'm in the right business,\" Newsom said in the interview, when asked about his evident enjoyment in meeting Democrats in South Carolina. \"I love people. I actually love people.\"",
      "Newsom said talk of him possibly running for president, after facing challenges throughout his life, including dyslexia, is a reminder to him that lives can go in surprising directions.",
      "\"I have no idea,\" Newsom said of whether he will decide to run. \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary. Who the hell knows? I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people.\"",
      "Newsom said his focus now is on passing Proposition 50, a California ballot measure he has championed that would allow state Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to the party. Newsom has cast his effort, which will be decided in a special election next week, as a response to Mr. Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps so the GOP has a better chance at holding on to its narrow House majority next year.",
      "\"I think it's about our democracy. It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about, you know, what the Founding Fathers lived and died for, this notion of the rule of law, and not the rule of Don,\" Newsom said.",
      "Tensions have run high ahead of the vote, with both parties seeing redistricting efforts as critical\u00a0 to achieving their goal of winning the U.S. House majority next year. Whichever party holds control of the House has subpoena and oversight powers over the Executive Branch.",
      "\"We've got hundreds and hundreds, ICE and Border Patrol,\" Newsom told Proposition 50 supporters on Thursday at a labor event, referring to federal agents in the state. Newsom predicted their presence might increase ahead of the Nov. 4 special election.",
      "\"Don't think for a second we're not going to be seeing more of that through Election Day,\" Newsom said. \"These guys are not screwing around.\"",
      "In recent days, the Justice Department said it would send its own monitors to supervise the special election in California and the gubernatorial election in New Jersey. Newsom has denounced the move, calling it a Trump administration move to intimidate Democrats. The goal, according to the Justice Department, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"",
      "While Newsom has long been a fixture in California, his foray into presidential politics generated intense interest last year when he was a fierce defender of President Joe Biden, especially in the wake of Biden's debate performance against Mr. Trump, which prompted many Democrats to call for Biden to exit the 2024 race.",
      "Newsom, however, never wavered on Biden's candidacy. In the days before Biden dropped out of the race, Newsom stumped for him nationwide, including in New Hampshire.",
      "Speaking with \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" there in July 2024, about a week before Biden left the race, Newsom said he was \"all in\" on Biden.",
      "\"No daylight,\" Newsom said of his alliance with Biden at the time.",
      "According to sources close to both Newsom and Biden, the two men are close and have stayed in touch since Biden left the White House. Newsom is also friendly with former President Barack Obama, who has offered support for Proposition 50 and joined Newsom and volunteers on a video call last week.",

    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that service members will miss paychecks by Nov. 15 if the government shutdown stretches on, despite the Trump administration's previous assurances that members of the military will be paid amid the funding lapse.",
      "\"I think we'll be able to pay them beginning in November, but by Nov. 15 our troops and service members who are willing to risk their lives aren't going to be able to get paid,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President Trump directed the Pentagon to use unspent research and development funds to pay the military earlier this month, with around $8 billion in funds from the previous fiscal year identified to cover the mid-month paychecks. But officials have warned that the move was a temporary fix, and that members of the military risked missing their next paychecks at the end of the month, and beyond, if the shutdown continues.",
      "Bessent suggested that members of the military will receive their upcoming paycheck, but he warned that if the shutdown continues, the U.S. would be unable to pay the service members by mid-November.",
      "\"What an embarrassment,\" Bessent said, putting the blame on Democratic leaders in Congress who he claimed are \"worried about their primaries, and not the American people.\"",
      "Democrats and Republicans have been locked in a stalemate over how to fund the government for weeks as Democrats have demanded an extension of health insurance tax credits as a condition for reopening the government. Meanwhile, Republicans have been clear that they are willing to discuss the health care issue, but only once the government reopens, despite Democrats' repeated requests for negotiations.",
      "Asked about the possibility of a meeting between the president and leaders in Congress after a request from Democrats last week, Bessent said \"I don't know what good it does.\"",
      "\"This is a Democratic-led boycott, and I'm just not sure what they're doing,\" Bessent added.",
      "The treasury secretary warned that the shutdown is \"starting to affect the economy,\" urging moderate Democrats to \"be heroes\" by breaking with their party to vote in favor of the House-passed measure to reopen the government that has fallen short of the 60 votes needed a dozen times in the Senate.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday and said \"there is an urgent need to reopen the government.\"",
      "\"Which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature,\" Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said. \"That's what we've called for from the very beginning.\"",
      "On the health care issue, Jeffries said Democrats \"need action, not simply words\" or a \"wing and a prayer promise\" from Republicans.",

    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that additional 100% tariffs on China are \"effectively off the table\" after a \"very good two-day meeting\" with Beijing's top trade negotiator.",
      "\"I'm not going to get ahead of the two leaders who will be meeting in Korea on Thursday, but I can tell you we had a very good two days,\" Bessent said of President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "Bessent, who has been leading trade talks with China, appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where President Trump began a three-country visit to Asia. Mr. Trump is expected to meet with China's president at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea on Thursday.",
      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, and tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Earlier this month, President Trump threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports by early November in a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "Mr. Trump warned that the tariffs would take effect if Beijing couldn't reach a deal with the U.S., citing new Chinese export controls. But after the meetings, Bessent said he expects \"the threat of the 100% has gone away, as has the threat of the immediate imposition of the Chinese initiating a worldwide export control regime.\"",
      "The treasury secretary praised Mr. Trump for giving him and his team an advantage, saying the threat of a 100% additional tariff \"did give us a great deal of leverage\".",
      "\"President Trump's very good at creating leverage for us,\" Bessent added.",
      "At the trade meetings, Bessent said he and his Chinese counterpart discussed \"a wide variety of issues,\" from rare-earth magnets to purchases of American agricultural products to the Chinese helping combat the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. He also said the TikTok deal announced last month is set to be finalized on Thursday."

    "summary": "Millions struggle with an intense fear of something that poses little or no threat, from flying to cockroaches to a trip to the dentist. How do they overcome their phobias?",
    "story": [
      "As an ICU nurse and EMT, Kathy Machuga has seen it all, and yet she is still scared to death of going to the dentist. \"It is like anxiety on steroids,\" she said. \"It's a terrible thing. I cannot explain what happens.\"",
      "Machuga, who seems calm at home, becomes an emotional wreck at the dentist's office, and has even fled an appointment before it was over: \"I felt like I couldn't breathe, and I felt like I couldn't swallow. So, I climbed out of the chair, and I left \u2013 bib, chain and all.\"",
      "She accepts that she has a phobia. \"I mean, by definition, it is,\" she said.",
      "Whether it's going to the dentist, getting on a plane, or crossing a bridge, an estimated 33 million American adults will struggle with a phobia at some point, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.",
      "Psychologist Luana Marques, a phobia specialist, describes the condition as \"an intense fear of something that poses little or no threat.\"",
      "And she is not immune \u2013 Marques has a phobia of her own: \"I'm afraid of cockroaches,\" she said. If she says one, \"I scream, my heart starts to pound, my blood comes out of my brain, and I run for dear life.\"",
      "But when she's not running from roaches, Marques, an associate professor at Harvard, helps patients manage (or even better, conquer) their intractable fears. She says patients who come to her have been unsuccessful in dealing with their fears for an average of ten years.",
      "She practices exposure therapy, forcing patients to face their phobias \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 until the brain learns not to be afraid. \"I recently went to India to help somebody that was afraid of flying, and we took 20 flights in five days,\" she laughed. \"It did work.\"",
      "Marques insists her claustrophobic patients get in the REALLY TINY elevator in her office; then she makes them ride it up and down, over and over. \"They usually tell me that I'm the devil and they want to run out of here,\" she said.",
      "The list of recognized phobias is long \u2013 and some are quite baffling. Genuphobia is described as a fear of knees. Pogonophobia is a fear of beards. Supermodel Tyra Banks has had a lifelong fear of dolphins (delphinophobia). And when he wasn't scaring the wits out of us, Alfred Hitchcock had a fear of eggs (ovaphobia).",
      "And while there are some fears that may be accepted, such as a fear of the dark (nyctophobia), or fear of heights (acrophobia), Jill Coleman says embarrassment may come when coping with a less-common fear. She knows that from watching her dad, Carl Multon, a weather phobic, who admits he sometimes hides in the closet during thunderstorms.",
      "If black clouds appeared and thunder rumbled, how would Carl react? \"I don't think I would just get up and leave, and say, 'You're on your own and I'm gonna go into the closet,'\" he said. \"But I would get anxious and, you know, wondering, 'Well, okay. Hopefully, it's not gonna get real bad.'\"",
      "And are his hands getting clammy as he describes this? \"Little bit!\" he laughed.",
      "Although they live in Muncie, Indiana, Carl keeps tabs on the weather nationwide, monitoring multiple radars every day.",
      "Married 54 years, his wife, Karen, says she's known about his unusual relationship with weather since they were dating.",
      "\"Is it hard to live with somebody who has this sort of fear?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm okay, I moved out of the house,\" Coleman laughed.",
      "Coleman, an associate dean at Ball State University and a climatologist, and Karen Multon, professor emerita of psychology at the University of Kansas, cowrote a research study on weather phobia. \"Based on our study, about 10% of the population has some, you know, fear,\" said Karen. \"But the extreme is probably about 2%.\"",
      "Meanwhile, back in New York, Kathy Machuga reluctantly dragged herself to the dentist to get a crown repaired. \"For me to do this is probably, like, somebody else having, like, a major brain surgery or life-threatening surgery,\" she said.",
      "Machuga's dentist, Louis Siegelman, specializes in anxious dental-phobic patients. She travels 270 miles to see him.",
      "I asked Siegelman, \"Studies have shown that about one in every five Americans has some sort of fear of the dentist. Does that strike you as about right?\"",
      "\"I would be surprised if it was that low,\" he replied. \"I like to call every new patient myself beforehand, to reassure them, but just to make some connection with them.\"",
      "But beyond support, Siegelman, a board-certified dental anesthesiologist, also offers sedation. Her phobia forgotten, Machuga slept peacefully though most of her two-hour procedure. And at the end of the day, \"I have a nice, shiny new tooth!\"",
      "Luana Marques says people do get over their phobias: \"I am not afraid of heights anymore,\" she said. \"I do think, though, that you have to continue to do exposure, for most people.\"",
      "But she hasn't gotten over all her fears: \"I am still afraid of cockroaches!\" she laughed.",
      "Karen Multon says that people who experience phobia should recognize that it is not uncommon: \"I mean, a lot of people have some fear that's higher than normal. You're not alone.\"",

      "\"We reached a final deal on TikTok. We reached one in Madrid, and I believe that as of today, all the details are ironed out, and that will be for the two leaders to consummate that transaction on Thursday in Korea,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President Trump signed an executive order last month that paved the way for a deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors. But the details were not immediately clear. Asked about the details of the TikTok transaction Sunday, Bessent said he is \"not part of the commercial side of the transaction.\"",
      "\"My remit was to get the Chinese to agree to approve the transaction, and I believe we successfully accomplished that over the past two days,\" he said",
      "Bessent spoke from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where President Trump began a three-country visit to Asia. Mr. Trump is expected to meet with Xi at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea on Thursday.",
      "Mr. Trump said last month that Chinese President Xi Jinping had signed off on the deal during a call. The deal represented a \"qualified divestiture,\" satisfying a law passed by Congress in April 2024 that required TikTok's China-based parent company to divest or face a ban. The move also delayed enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for the agreement on the video sharing social media app's operations in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "The White House outlined last month that the deal would establish a U.S.-based \"joint venture\" made up of a majority of U.S. investors and owners, along with a board of directors with a majority of Americans. ByteDance and its affiliates were set to own less than 20% of the new entity. The White House said a consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" Moolenaar, who previously expressed concern about the TikTok deal, said Sunday that said \"as long as the Chinese are involved, I think there's reason for distrust.\"",
      "When asked about ByteDance and its affiliates continuing to own up to 20% of the new entity, Moolenaar added, \"I'm still concerned about it.\"",
      "\"The Chinese report to the Chinese Communist Party, and they will leverage every advantage they get,\" Moolenaar said. \"But the president has set a goal of making this available to the American people, following the law that was passed in a bipartisan way, and I trust that they are doing that.\"",

      "Change has always been a part of the White House's story. First lady Jacqueline Kennedy said as much during her famed televised tour of the mansion in 1962: \"The house will always grow, and should,\" she said.",

      "By 1948, the White House was in danger of collapsing. It would've been cheaper to level the place and rebuild it. But President Harry Truman decided that preserving the exterior walls was crucial to the country's sense of continuity. Instead, the interior was entirely gutted. Truman also added a balcony, an alteration which provoked an outcry.",
      "The latest alteration by President Trump is much more significant. The East Wing has been demolished, with critics saying that in doing so Mr. Trump has broken a promise that the new construction would not interfere with the current building, and the\u00a0planned 90,000-square-foot ballroom\u00a0is nearly double the size of the main house. The president himself has estimated it will cost $300 million, to be paid for, he says, by private donations.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Experts say the incident revealed what can happen when a such a broad spectrum of companies rely on singular cloud provider.",
    "story": [
      "The 15-hour\u00a0disruption to Amazon Web Services, a cloud-based computing service, on Monday shook internet users around the world, disrupting everything from travel to financial transactions \u2014 and underscoring the fragility of a system reliant on only a handful of tech giants.",
      "Monday's problems at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, spawned 11 million total outage reports, with 3 million reports stemming from U.S. users, Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages,\u00a0said\u00a0on Facebook.",
      "While other cloud providers support the world's businesses \u2014 including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure \u2014 AWS has the largest foothold in the market. Since it debuted in 2006, the company has grown to control 38% of the cloud computing infrastructure market,\u00a0according to research and advisory firm Gartner.",
      "Experts say Monday's outage reveals the vulnerabilities of a system where a small number of companies provide such a large chunk of the internet's backbone.",
      "\"[The] outage is a stark reminder of the massive 'concentration risk' the global economy has accepted by building on a handful of cloud providers,\" Dave McCarthy, who leads global research for cloud services at the International Data Corporation, told CBS News.",
      "AWS' rolodex of customers include government departments, universities and businesses, and platforms such as Venmo, Netflix and Snapchat.",
      "\"Frankly, many customers may have been unaware that a service they used relied upon AWS and are only learning that now, due to system failures,\" said Craig Shue, a professor and the head of the computer science department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.",
      "As Shue explained, companies that are not technology-centric may seek out a cloud service like AWS to host their web servers and databases, allowing them to focus on their day-to-day operations. Amazon, meanwhile,\u00a0 handles the more technical aspects such as server maintenance and responses to fluctuations in customer demand, he added.",
      "Amazon declined to comment directly on the incident, instead sharing a statement from their\u00a0website\u00a0published on Oct. 20.",
      "How the AWS outage started",
      "The outage started Monday morning in Northern Virginia, home to AWS' oldest and biggest cloud computing hub in the U.S. AWS refers to the cluster of data centers in Virginia as US-EAST-1. The company also has cloud computing hubs in California, Ohio and Oregon.",
      "According to expert accounts and Amazon's own\u00a0explanation, the issue was partially tied to AWS' domain name system (DNS) servers. As Shue explained, this is the part of the internet that takes domain names like Amazon.com and converts them to IP addresses, numerical labels that identify locations on the internet.",
      "The service can be used to distribute traffic to multiple servers to make things faster, Shue said.",
      "\"It is akin to waiting in a checkout line that then splits off to multiple cashier lanes,\" Shue explained. \"A staff member can direct the customer at the front of the line to the first available server that can handle the job.\"",
      "This function was disrupted on Monday, leading to a backlog of server requests without anything to route them. It's still unclear how the disruption began, experts said.",
      "For people on the ground, this meant they were unable to carry out simple web-based functions like checking their flight time on an airline app or sending a payment on Venmo.",
      "While the issue started in the eastern U.S. region, its effects were global. Experts say it's difficult to quantify the impact in dollar figures. McCarthy, however, noted that it appears to be one of the most significant outages in recent years.",
      "Amazon said that the issue was resolved around 6 p.m. EDT on Monday, or more than 15 hours after the company first reported a problem on the AWS Health Dashboard, where it tracks service disruptions.",
      "\"This wasn't a minor glitch; it was a cascading failure originating in US-EAST-1, the very nerve center of AWS, which took down everything from gaming and social media to critical financial and educational platforms,\" he said.",
      "Will the outage impact AWS?",
      "While the incident may have sparked a small reckoning with cloud services, it's not expected to shake up the landscape too much, experts told CBS News.",
      "McCarthy doesn't expect the outage to lead to a mass exodus of AWS customers, but he said it could compel companies to diversify their cloud services so they're not reliant on a single provider. That way if one goes down, the company can still keep some operations going.",

    "story": [
      "Six in 10 U.S. workers say their jobs fall short of the standards for a \"quality\" position \u2014 one that offers basics such as fair pay, a steady schedule and career growth \u2014 according to research from advocacy group Jobs for the Future.",
      "Although government labor statistics track how many Americans are employed and how much they earn, the official data doesn't offer a full picture of the state of the job market, researchers behind Jobs for the Future's new study said.",
      "\"We recognize that not only has the way we measure the economy not kept up with way work and the economy is changing, but it has never been sufficient in terms of letting us understand what's going on under hood of economy and across the workforce, which is the engine of economic prosperity in the U.S.,\" said Molly Blankenship, a director in solutions design and delivery at Jobs for the Future, which lobbies for policies aimed at spurring innovation,",
      "The group surveyed workers across industries and different types of jobs, in partnership with Gallup, the Families & Workers Fund and the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.",
      "\"We suspected when we started this work that the majority of Americans were not in jobs that were helping them,\" Blankenship added. \"This data confirms what we suspected, which is that the majority of American workers are not in quality jobs.\"",
      "What makes for a good job?",
      "A quality job is defined by five main criteria, according to Jobs for the Future:",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employmentWorkplace culture and safety, meaning the worker is free from discrimination or harassmentGrowth and development opportunities, allowing employees to develop skills and advance their careerAgency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's jobWork structure and agency, including a predictable schedule and manageable workload",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employment",
      "Workplace culture and safety, meaning the worker is free from discrimination or harassment",
      "Growth and development opportunities, allowing employees to develop skills and advance their career",
      "Agency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's job",
      "Work structure and agency, including a predictable schedule and manageable workload",
      "By those measures, only 40% of the more than 18,000 workers surveyed by the group said they are employed in quality jobs, while the remaining 60% said their jobs fall short of those standards. For example, 62% of employees said they have unpredictable work schedules, while about one-third said they are struggling financially, according to the survey.",
      "Only 27% of those surveyed by Jobs for the Futures said their jobs pay enough for them to feel financially comfortable; nearly 3 in 10 described themselves as \"just getting by\" or \"finding it difficult to get by.\"",
      "Beyond fair pay, workers also want to feel safe and respected in their jobs, while opportunities for growth are also valued, the study noted. One in four employees say they have no opportunities for promotion or advancement at work, the survey found.",
      "Another issue affecting how employees perceive their jobs is how employers use new technologies, such as artificial intelligence.",
      "\"There is tremendous concern over technology, how it's being adopted and how it will impact people's jobs in the future,\" Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and a contributor to the the report, told CBS News. \"The research indicates that they lack input on these issues.\"",
      "The degree of autonomy employees have in their jobs also shapes their daily routine and can affect their overall work-life balance, Jobs for the Future found. More than six in 10 employees said they lack control over their schedules, while more than half of workers said they often or sometimes work more than scheduled.",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa strengthened into a major Category 4 hurricane on Sunday, unleashing torrential rain and threatening to bring flash flooding and landslides to the northern Caribbean, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.",
      "The center said those impacts could be \"life-threatening and catastrophic\" for parts of Haiti and Jamaica, especially as Melissa was potentially forecast to intensify further into a Category 5 storm.",
      "The weather agency added that Melissa is likely to reach the southern coast of Jamaica as a major hurricane late Monday or Tuesday morning, and urged people on the island to seek shelter immediately.",
      "\"Conditions (in Jamaica) are going to go down rapidly today,\" Jamie Rhome, the center's deputy director, said on Sunday. \"Be ready to ride this out for several days.\"",
      "Melissa could be the most powerful hurricane to hit Jamaica, CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak\u00a0said Saturday.",
      "\"I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,\" said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. \"Take all measures to protect yourself.\"",
      "Melissa was expected to drop torrential rains of up to 30 inches on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola \u2014 Haiti and the Dominican Republic \u2014 according to the hurricane center. Some areas may see as much as 40 inches of rain.",
      "It also warned that extensive damage to infrastructure, power and communication outages, and the isolation of communities in Jamaica were to be expected.",
      "Melissa should be near or over Cuba by late Tuesday, where it could bring up to 12 inches of rain, before moving toward the Bahamas later Wednesday.",
      "The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.",
      "Preparations underway",
      "The erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.",
      "\"Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,\" Jamie Rhome, the hurricane center's deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.",
      "Jamaica's government said the main airport in Montego Bay, Sangster International Airport, will shut down at midday local time on Sunday as the island's national emergency agency activated its level 3 emergency protocol ahead of Melissa.",
      "The biggest airport on the island, Norman Manley International Airport in the capital, Kingston, closed at 9 p.m. on Saturday.",
      "\"With the slow movement of this system, it doesn't allow you to recover. It's going to sit there, pouring water while it's barely moving and that is a significant challenge that we have to be aware of,\" warned Evan Thompson, principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica.",
      "\"There is nowhere that will escape the wrath of this hurricane,\" Richard Thompson, acting director general of the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, said.",
      "He said all members of the National Response Team are now on full alert.",
      "More than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages were pre-positioned for quick distribution if needed.",
      "Damaged homes, rising water",
      "Haitian authorities said three people had died as a consequence of the hurricane and another five were injured due to a collapsed wall. There were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.",
      "\"The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it's moving,\" said Ronald D\u00e9lice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organized lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.",
      "The storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.",
      "The Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 26, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. He joins us from Seneca, South Carolina. Welcome back to Face The Nation. Senator--",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, Defense Secretary Hegseth ordered the deployment of the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Gerald Ford, to Latin America. President Trump was asked if he planned to ask Congress for a declaration of war. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK. We're going to kill them. You know, they're going to be, like, dead.",
      "[SOUNDS OF TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't need an aircraft carrier to hit drug boats are land strikes planned?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, I think that's a real possibility. I think President Trump's made a decision that Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, is an indicted drug, drug trafficker, that it's time for him to go, that Venezuela and Colombia have been safe havens for narco-terrorists for too long, and President Trump told me yesterday that he plans to brief members of Congress when he gets back from Asia about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia. So there will be a congressional briefing about a potential expanding from the sea to the land. I support that idea, but I think he has all the authority he needs. Senator Gallego, on another network, accused President Trump and our military of committing murder by attacking these drug boats. To our men and women in uniform, you're not murdering anybody. You're making America safer by going after a narco-terrorist. You're following lawful orders. When President Bush, 41, took Ortega out in Panama, Reagan went into Grenada to deal with the Cuban influence from Grenada in our backyard, he has all the authority in the world. This is not murder. This is protecting America from being poisoned by narco-terrorists coming from Venezuela and Colombia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a lot there. But just to clarify the examples you're citing, also involved ground troops. You said time for Maduro to go. That sounds a lot like regime change. Are you talking about troops on the ground?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I'll let the President speak to that. I'm talking about a briefing that would expand military operations potentially from the sea to the land. It is time for Maduro to go. It was time for Ortega to go. You know, the Monroe Doctrine has been robustly applied by President Trump. So these military assets are moving forward to deal with a country that's got blood on its hands when it comes to Americans by flooding our country with drugs from Venezuela and Colombia. So I hope Maduro would leave peacefully, but I don't think he's going to stay around much longer. I think President Trump is tired of Venezuela being used as a staging platform to poison America?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN Well, there's a lot there, sir, but you cited a Democratic senator's criticism. He's not the only one. Some of your Republican colleagues have been uncomfortable with what little information has been shared with Congress. Take a listen:",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: If they want all out war where we kill anybody and everybody that is in the country of Venezuela or coming out that has to have a declaration of war. It's something that is not pretty, very expensive, and I'm not in favor of declaring war on Venezuela, but the Congress should vote. And the President shouldn't do this by himself.",
      "SEN. JAMES LANKFORD: If this was happening with this level of insight under the Biden administration, I'd be apoplectic.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Todd Young also criticized this, what exactly is the end game? Because you're talking about regime change in Venezuela, the President says this is about drug boats.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. Well, I think the end game is to make sure that Venezuela and Colombia cannot be used to poison America, that the narco-terrorist dictator Maduro no longer be able to threaten our country and to send in drugs to kill Americans. As to Rand Paul, I just disagree fundamental with his approach. We didn't have a declaration to go into Panama. Bush 41 went into Panama to replace the leadership there, because the Panama leadership, Panamanian leadership, were working with drug cartels to threaten our country. Reagan didn't have a declaration of war congressional authorization to deal with Cuban influence. So this idea- Rand Paul, I just fundamentally disagree with. To the other senators, you deserve more information, and you're going to get more information, but there is no requirement for Congress to declare war before the commander-in-chief can use force. Panama and Grenada are two examples in our backyard, where Republican presidents chose to go after countries and leaders that were threatening our people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there seemed to be a number of issues wound up in here. I know you personally used to serve as a judge advocate in the Air Force. We looked at the JAG manual: preventative self defense employed to counter non imminent threats is illegal under international law. So if we are not at war and these suspected criminals pose no threat of imminent violence, isn't this potentially a war crime to be killing the people on these boats and then to be taking out a leader?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: No, not at all. I don't know what man you're referring to, but I know what President Bush, 41 did. He took down Ortega [sic], the leader of Panama, because he was involved in drug trafficking threatening our country. Venezuela is now partnering with Hezbollah. Hezbollah is running out of money because Iran is weak.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 That's not new.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Partnering with drug cartels in Venezuela. No, it should have stopped. Here's what, here's what's new. You got a commander-in-chief's not going to put up with this crap. We're not going to sit on the sidelines and watch boats full of drugs come to our country. We're going to blow them up and kill the people that want to poison America, and we're now going to expand operations, I think, to the land. So please be clear about what I'm saying today. President Donald Trump sees Venezuela and Colombia as direct threats to our country, because they house Narco terrorist organizations. The leader of Venezuela is an indicted drug dealer in American courts. So yeah, the game is changing when it comes to drug traffickers and drug cartels. We're going to use military force like we have in the past to protect our country. That's the new game we're playing, and I'm glad we're playing that game, and if I were Maduro, I'd find a way to leave before heat goes down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is trafficking cocaine an armed attack on the United States? That's what you're equating it to?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I am saying that there's plenty of law under article, Article Two powers of the President are designed to protect our countries from threats foreign and domestic. Was it illegal for Bush to take Ortega out in Panama? Was it illegal for Reagan to go into Grenada to stop Cuban influence building this big, long runway? There's plenty of precedent here to do what he's doing. But the game has changed. The game has changed when it comes to narco trafficking, drug organizations. We're going to take you out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you referenced something earlier. Sorry. I want to come back to you said to the men and women of the military that they are carrying out lawful orders. Secretary Hegseth removed the top uniformed lawyers in the Air Force, you know this, the Navy and the Army, because he called them roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander-in-chief. There have been other departures as well. This raises concern that commanders are not being given adequate legal counsel. That is why you just said that sentence, to assure them.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: That's that's garbage, that's absolute garbage\u2013",
      "(Crosstalk)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which that Hegseth said that?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: No, no. I'm saying that- the theory that President Trump's doing something here illegally, dealing with a country that's run by an indicted drug dealer. It's the same as Panama. There's a better case to go into Venezuela than there was Panama. There's a better case to deal with Colombia than there was Grenada. Yeah, I've been doing this all of my adult life. I have all the confidence in the world that President Trump has the legal authority, but more importantly, he's doing the right thing. More Americans have died from cocaine and fentanyl poisoning than any terrorist group in the world. I am very pleased that we now have a president who's going to use the full force of, of the American people, the might of America, to protect us from narco terrorist states and drug organizations. Keep it up, Mr. President, we're not committing murder. We're protecting our nation from people who want to poison us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's obviously buyers on the other end of it, which is why the cartels are selling, right?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well yeah, we'll deal with both. We'll deal with both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well I want to come back to\u2013 when we talk about lawful orders here, I myself spoke to a former senior commander who said he'd want that in writing because of concern that, that this is going to be down the line questionable.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: What in writing?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've already heard the orders to carry out operations. You've already heard Democratic lawmakers, including on this program, say that they have concerns about future prosecutions of officers.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well act on your concerns. Why don't you- Why don't you- Okay, if you've got concerns, here's what we can do as members of Congress. We can cut off funding for military operations we don't like. So if you're concerned as a Democrat or Republican, why don't you introduce legislation to cut off all funding to the military when it comes to attacking drug votes and going after narco terrorist states through the military. You can do that. Go ahead and do it. I'll vote no. I think it has all the authority in the world under Article Two and international law to make sure that countries like Venezuela can't be staging areas to infiltrate drugs into our country. It's not a, I think it has all the legal authority in the world. I'm just really glad he's doing this and Mr. President, keep it up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look forward to hearing those justifications when they are shared with Congress. You made some news there, Senator. Thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment.",

    "summary": "Thieves took less than eight minutes to steal jewels valued at $102 million last Sunday morning from Paris' famous Louvre museum.",
    "story": [
      "Two people were arrested in connection with the theft of crown jewels from Paris' Louvre museum, a Paris prosecutor said on Sunday, a week after the brazen heist at the world's most visited museum.",
      "The prosecutor said investigators made the arrests Saturday evening, adding that one of the men taken into custody was preparing to leave the country from Paris' Roissy Airport.",
      "French media BFM TV and Le Parisien newspaper earlier reported that two suspects had been arrested and taken into custody. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau did not confirm the number of arrests and did not say whether jewels had been recovered.",
      "A police official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing case, told The Associated Press that two men in their 30s, both known to police, were taken into custody. He said one suspect was arrested as he attempted to board a plane bound for Algeria. The official added that one of the suspects was identified through DNA traces. Beccuau said earlier this week that forensics experts were analyzing 150 samples at the scene.",
      "The suspects can be held in police custody up to 96 hours.",
      "Thieves took less than eight minutes to steal jewels valued at $102 million last Sunday morning.",
      "Questions have arisen about security at the museum and whether security cameras might have failed as the thieves rode a basket lift up the Louvre's facade, cut their way through a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels. The museum's director called the incident a \"terrible failure.\"",
      "Beccuau said investigators from a special police unit in charge of armed robberies, serious burglaries and art thefts made the arrests. She rued in her statement the premature leak of information, saying it could hinder the work of over 100 investigators \"mobilized to recover the stolen jewels and apprehend all of the perpetrators.\" Beccuau said further details will be unveiled after the suspects' custody period ends.",
      "French Interior Minister Laurent Nunez praised \"the investigators who have worked tirelessly, just as I asked them to, and who have always had my full confidence.\"",
      "The theft focused on the gilded Apollo Gallery, where the Crown Diamonds are displayed. Eight objects were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife; a reliquary brooch; and Empress Eug\u00e9nie's diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch, a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.",
      "One piece \u2014 Eug\u00e9nie's emerald-set imperial crown with more than 1,300 diamonds \u2014 was later found outside the museum, damaged but recoverable.",
      "The crown jewels are priceless in historical terms, but experts have told CBS News they would still be worth millions of dollars if broken up and sold on the black market.",
      "The jewels\u00a0were not privately insured, the French Ministry of Culture stated in a press release to the daily newspaper Le Parisien. French law prohibits entities like the Louvre from insuring its property, except when part of a collection is moved or loaned to another institution, Romain D\u00e9chelette, president of France-based Serex Assurances, a fine art insurer, told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "Melissa strengthened rapidly into a Category 4 hurricane on Sunday and was forecast to bring \"life-threatening and catastrophic\" flash flooding and landslides to Jamaica and the southern parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic over the next few days, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center warned.",
      "Hurricane Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States, but it could be the strongest system this season.",
      "Melissa's forecast and path",
      "As of Sunday afternoon, Melissa's core was about 110 miles south of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 285 miles south-southwest of Guantanamo, Cuba,\u00a0the hurricane center said. Maximum sustained winds were 140 mph, with hurricane-force winds extending some 25 miles from the storm's center and tropical storm-force winds extending 175 miles. It was inching west at 7 mph.",
      "Melissa is now considered a major hurricane, which is defined as a Category 3 or higher, having winds of at least 111 mph. It was forecast to remain a major hurricane when it makes landfall in Jamaica later this week, the hurricane center said.",
      "It was forecast to move near or over Jamaica during the weekend through Tuesday, across southeastern Cuba by Tuesday night and then across the southeastern Bahamas by the middle of the week.",
      "Melissa could be the most powerful hurricane to hit Jamaica, CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak said Saturday.",
      "\"The island's terrain makes it even worse,\" Kozak said. \"Jamaica's mountains force the air to rise, and that creates more rain.\"",
      "The strongest hurricane to hit Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, Kozak said, which killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.",
      "Jamaica, Haiti and eastern Cuba should brace for \"catastrophic rainfall, up to nearly 3 feet of rain,\" CBS News weather anchor Lonnie Quinn said Friday. \"Mountainous terrain \u2014 there's going to be mudslides. I am fearful for what we will find by the time we get into next week for this portion of the Caribbean.\"",

      "The Naval Station Guantanamo Bay said it has been moving \"non-mission-essential\" U.S. citizens off the island in groups ahead of severe weather from Melissa. They will all be evacuated no later than Sunday morning, the station said on social media.",
      "\"Each individual will be allowed one 40-pound bag and a carry-on item,\" the station's Facebook post said. \"Stand by for more directions on when your zone will be called to the Windjammer to get orders.\"",
      "Rainfall forecasts",
      "Melissa is expected to drop up to 30 inches of rain on parts of southern Haiti, the southern Dominican Republic and Jamaica through Tuesday, with higher amounts possible in some areas, the hurricane center said. Eastern Cuba could see up to 18 inches of rain.",
      "\"Catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are probable across portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica,\" forecasters said. Hispaniola is an island that includes Haiti and the Dominican Republic.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. John Moolenaar, Republican of Michigan, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 26, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And joining us now is the chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, Michigan Republican Representative John Moolenaar. Welcome, congressman.",
      "REP. JOHN MOOLENAAR: Thank you, Margaret, good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So much to get to with you. But just quickly, if the prime adversary and threat to the United States is in China and the Pacific is bringing them to the west- all the military the Western Hemisphere in such full force and focus the thing to do?",
      "REP. MOOLENAAR: Well, I think we're sending an important message that we're no longer going to allow drug trafficking coming in and killing American lives. And you know, China is very much behind the Fentanyl crisis that's killed hundreds of thousands of Americans, and so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's out of Mexico, primarily.",
      "REP. MOOLENAAR: Well, and I think the president takes the Western Hemisphere very seriously, and getting the drugs out of our backyard, I think is an important step forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the committee work that you've been doing, I'm sure you heard from Treasury Secretary Bessent at the top of the program that he says China has agreed to the TikTok deal. 170 million Americans use this social media app. Congress had passed a law to force this sale and cited it as a national security threat if it continued to operate the way it has. Have your national security concerns about the app and about this transaction been addressed?",
      "REP. MOOLENAAR: Well, I think it's important that we note that it- the law requires a divestment and getting the Chinese Communist Party control away from the app as well as the algorithm, and it allows ownership only up to 20% for Chinese entity ByteDance. And to me, it's very important that that's carried out. We don't know all the specifics of this, but we know that American companies are very interested in participating. There's the proposal for a lease agreement, but how you get that algorithm completely out of the Chinese control is going to be up to the experts. You know, there's 6 million pieces of code in this algorithm, and we need to make sure that it's protected for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that algorithm is the data tracking system that's pulled from a user's habits. And so the accusation was also that this was basically manipulating consumers in terms of what they were able to see. So will that algorithm be maintained, and will upgrades only be conducted by, for example, American engineers?",
      "REP. MOOLENAAR: That would be my recommendation because, ultimately, we don't want a Chinese propaganda effort affecting 170 million Americans. We also want to make sure that to make sure that data from Americans is kept secure, and as long as the Chinese are involved, I think there's reasons for distrust, and--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even with the 20% stake?",
      "REP. MOOLENAAR: I'm still concerned about it. Quite frankly, you know, the Chinese report to the Chinese Communist Party, and they will leverage every advantage they get. But the President has set a goal of making this available to the American people, following the law that was passed in a bipartisan way and I trust that they are doing that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President has not been following the letter of the law that you voted for. You know that.",
      "REP. MOOLENAAR: Well, I think- I think the goal has been to come to an agreement, to come to a deal, and they've been working very hard to do that. But when you have the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, with direct leverage on this in terms of what they will do, what they won't do, it's very difficult to continue to make that available. But I trust the people who are negotiating that, recognize we've got to get the control of the algorithm away from the Chinese Communist Party, the app, and make sure that the ownership is controlled by America, not China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let's talk about that ownership. The president said the investors would include Michael Dell, Lachlan Murdoch, whose family owns Fox News, and Larry Ellison, whose son owns Paramount, parent company of CBS News. Do you have concerns that people who are boosters of the President will have ownership of social media in this way?",
      "REP. MOOLENAAR: You know, I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Since it's so powerful.",
      "REP. MOOLENAAR: Well there are some, I'm sure investors. Not everybody is simply a supporter of the President, but I believe that in this case, Congress has a role for oversight, and we will be meeting with the parties of transaction. We also will have hearings on this, because at the end of the day, we want this controlled by American companies, regardless of what their political affiliation. We don't want it controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Secretary Bessent said he got the Chinese to say yes, and on Thursday, he used the word \"consummated\", that this deal will be signed off between Xi and Trump. So are your hearings just after the fact? Or, you know, what effect do you hope they will have?",
      "REP. MOOLENAAR: Well, oversight. Congress has a legitimate role of oversight. We passed a law--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Meaning you assume this deal is done. That this transaction is happening, and you're just going to monitor it?",
      "REP. MOOLENAAR: I would assume that if the President comes to an agreement, which he's charged to do under the law, and if that happens on Thursday, then it will move forward. And there may be challenges to that law or the implementation of it, but Congress has a role of oversight to ensure that the law is followed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Wall Street Journal reported that Xi Jinping called TikTok, quote spiritual opium, and he saw this as just like a low cost bargaining chip for China. Do you think that- that's what's happening here? That this is just an easy thing to hand over to--",
      "REP. MOOLENAAR: I believe it's a very addictive app. China has made a lot of money because of that, but they've also used it in a way that allows you know their information, their propaganda, to be propagated. They control the algorithm, and that's why we passed that bipartisan law. So I believe Xi Jinping views this as a strategic asset. That's why he didn't want to sell it to some of the other American companies that were interested in purchasing it. So as long as they're involved, I think we have to recognize that TikTok, even an American version still could be open to influence from the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or whoever owns it.",
      "REP. MOOLENAAR: Whoever owns it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The algorithm.",
      "REP. MOOLENAAR: The algorithm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you very much, and we'll be watching for those hearings.",
      "REP. MOOLENAAR: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 13:06:37 -0400",
    "summary": "The announcement comes as part of nuclear messaging from the Kremlin, which has resisted Western pressure for a ceasefire in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Russia tested a new nuclear-capable and powered cruise missile fit to confound existing defenses, inching closer to deploying it to its military, President Vladimir Putin said in remarks released on Sunday.",
      "The announcement, which followed years of tests of the Burevestnik missile, comes as part of nuclear messaging from the Kremlin, which has resisted Western pressure for a ceasefire in Ukraine and strongly warned the U.S. and other NATO allies against sanctioning strikes deep inside Russia with longer-range Western weapons.",
      "A video released by the Kremlin showed Putin, dressed in camouflage fatigues, receiving a report from Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia's chief of general staff, who told the Russian leader that the Burevestnik covered 14,000 kilometers (8,700 miles) in a key test Tuesday.",
      "Gerasimov said the Burevestnik, or storm petrel in Russian, spent 15 hours in the air, adding \"that's not the limit.\"",
      "Little is known about the Burevestnik, which was code-named Skyfall by NATO, and many Western experts have been skeptical about it, noting that a nuclear engine could be highly unreliable.",
      "When\u00a0Putin first revealed\u00a0that Russia was working on the weapon in his 2018 state-of-the-nation address, he claimed it would have an unlimited range, allowing it to circle the globe undetected by missile defense systems.",
      "Many observers argue that such a missile could be difficult to handle and pose an environmental threat. The U.S. and the Soviet Union worked on nuclear-powered missiles during the Cold War, but they eventually shelved the projects, considering them too hazardous.",
      "The Burevestnik\u00a0reportedly suffered an explosion\u00a0in August 2019 during tests at a navy range on the White Sea, killing five nuclear engineers and two service members and resulting in a brief spike in radioactivity that fueled fears in a nearby city.",
      "Russian officials never identified the weapon involved, but the U.S. said it was the Burevestnik.",
      "\"We need to determine the possible uses and begin preparing the infrastructure for deploying these weapons to our armed forces,\" Putin told Gerasimov.",
      "The Russian leader also claimed it was invulnerable to current and future missile defenses, due to its almost unlimited range and unpredictable flight path.",
      "Kirill Dmitriev, a top Putin aide who was in the U.S. as the video surfaced, said his delegation informed U.S. colleagues of the \"successful testing\" of the Burevestnik, which he said was an \"absolutely new class\" of weapon.",
      "Earlier this week, Putin directed drills of Russia's strategic nuclear forces that featured practice missile launches. The exercise came as his planned summit on Ukraine with U.S. President Trump was put on hold.",
      "The Kremlin said that the maneuvers involved all parts of Moscow's nuclear triad, including intercontinental ballistic missiles that were test-fired from launch facilities in northwestern Russia and a submarine in the Barents Sea. The drills also involved Tu-95 strategic bombers firing long-range cruise missiles.",
      "The exercise tested the skills of military command structures, the Kremlin said in a statement on Wednesday.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 26, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with the top Democrat in the House, Leader Hakeem Jeffries. He joins us from his Brooklyn, New York district. Good morning.",
      "DEMOCRATIC LEADER REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Good morning. Great to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Leader Jeffries, Treasury Secretary Bessent said the shutdown is starting to affect the economy, and by November 15, the troops will not be paid. Do you expect the shutdown to last that long?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: I certainly hope not. This is day 26 of the Trump, Republican shutdown. And as Democrats, we have maintained from the very beginning, and continue to maintain, we will sit down anytime, any place, with anyone, either at the Capitol or back at the White House, to reopen the government to negotiate a bipartisan spending agreement that actually meets the needs of the American people. And to decisively address the Republican healthcare crisis, particularly as it relates to the urgent need to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits so we can prevent tens of millions of Americans from experiencing dramatically increased health insurance premiums that will make access to a doctor unaffordable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to come back to healthcare in a moment, but the Treasury Secretary accused you of playing politics, personally. And I know that your Democratic Whip, Katherine Clark said on Fox this past week that shutdowns are terrible, but as she put it, it's one of the few leverage items Democrats have. Do you think Democrats are gaining from this fight?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: No, our focus continues to be on driving down the high cost of living for everyday Americans. Donald Trump and Republicans promised that they would lower costs on day one. We know costs haven't gone down. They're going up. Inflation is moving in the wrong direction. The Trump tariffs have made life more expensive for the American people to the tune of thousands of additional dollars per year. We know that electricity bills are through the roof. Housing costs are too high, childcare costs are too high, groceries too expensive. And now tens of millions of Americans are at risk of having their premiums explode, in some cases by 1000 to 2000 dollars per year. That's what this fight for us is all about. Republicans have come up with a new conspiracy theory every week for the last six weeks. The Democratic position, Margaret, has been clear, cancel the cuts, lower the cost, save health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that was the quote from the whip herself when she said leverage. But I hear you on rising healthcare costs. But the immediate term, people aren't getting paid. 750,000 federal workers are on unpaid leave. Eighty percent of the folks who work on our nuclear program are included in that figure. The agriculture secretary said there will be delays in food stamps, stamps for many of the 41 million people who rely on SNAP. And then at airports across the country, half of the flight delays, according to the transportation secretary, are because of staffing shortages. This pain is real now. So is there a point at which it becomes too great to justify continuing the shutdown?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: Well, there is an urgent need to reopen the government, which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature. That's what we've called for from the very beginning. Unfortunately--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Republicans are saying--",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: --Republicans have refused to sit down--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --they won't do that until you pass the funding bill, the clean funding bill that already passed the house. Why can't Democrats in the Senate get on board with that?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: Well, we've made clear, and I'm thankful for the leadership of Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats, that we will not going to support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the healthcare of the American people, in an environment where Republicans have already enacted the largest cut to Medicaid in American history. Hospitals, nursing homes and community-based health centers are closing all across the country. There is the possibility that Medicare could face a $536 billion cut, the largest cut to Medicare in history, if Congress doesn't act by the end of this year, because of what Republican policies have done in their one big, ugly bill. And now they refuse to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, that impacts working class Americans, middle class Americans and everyday Americans throughout the country, including in rural America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they haven't refused. Leader Thune said he'd even put that up for a vote if you open the government first, but next Saturday is the beginning of open enrollment. I mean, people are going to see what that bill is going to look like. Practically speaking, aren't you out of time here? Insurance companies have set these premiums in place. That's how they're already in the mail for people to open and see on Saturday. What becomes the strategy after November 1, if this shutdown lasts that long?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: Well, listen, we want to reopen the government, and we need to stand by our hard working federal employees who are doing all that they can to make sure that taxpayer dollars are spent effectively and efficiently, even under the most adverse circumstances. Remember, in terms of federal employees, the Trump administration has fired or dismissed more than 200,000 civil servants prior to them shutting the government down on October 1. We want to reopen the government now. In terms of health care, part of the reality is that tens of millions of people are already receiving notices in October that their premiums are about to skyrocket--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Exactly.",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: --because of the Republican refusal to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credit. And by the way, they have had the opportunity both House Republicans and Senate Republicans, repeatedly throughout the year, to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. And they've consistently voted against it. That's why we need action, not simply words, a wing and a prayer promise from people who have tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act more than 70 different times since 2010.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But aren't the premiums already locked in here? Or are you saying Republicans are right when you can make up for it at the end of the year with the tax credit?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: The premiums are not locked in in terms of the reality that if we can act legislatively and act now. We can extend the open enrollment period. We can push it back. And we can intervene as a Congress in order to actually protect the affordability of health insurance for tens of millions of people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Leader, stay with us. I have to take a quick commercial break.",
      "[ COMMERCIAL BREAK ]",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: Welcome back to 'Face The Nation.' We return now to our conversation with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Leader Jeffries, I want to ask you about some other matters as well. In New York City, a city of more than 8 million people, there's about to be an election of a new mayor. You waited until this Friday, the day before early voting began, to endorse the Democratic Socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani. Why did you wait so long?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: Well, as I indicated, last several weeks, we've been immersed in the intensity around the government shutdown and the run up to that in advance of September 30 and the expiration of the fiscal year. But I support the Democratic nominee, as I indicated, and we're in alignment in terms of the issue related to affordability and the need to address it decisively for the city of New York. And of course, affordability is an issue for people all across the country. From a public safety standpoint, I supported the notion that he would retain police commissioner Jessica Tisch to continue to lead the NYPD forward. That's incredibly important, from a public safety standpoint for every community, including as a high priority, the safety and security of the Jewish community. And in terms of the moment that we find ourselves in, Donald Trump represents an existential threat to the city of New York and beyond, because of the extreme assault that has taken place throughout this year on the economy, on health care, on farmers, on veterans, on law abiding immigrant communities, on due process, on the rule of Law, and, of course, on the American way of life itself, and we all as Americans are going to have to be aligned and pushing back so we can end this national nightmare that Donald Trump has visited upon the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you still waited until Friday, and the election is upon us, but you're leaving room in your answer there for understanding that you don't agree with the candidate on some other issues, though you agree with him on affordability. Since Democrats are running for re-election in the midterm races, you want to retake the house, would you recommend they mimic some of Mamdani's messages as a progressive model for the party?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: No, what we've said from the very beginning is that we have to decisively address the affordability crisis that Donald Trump and Republican policies have made worse in the United States of America. We need to lower the high cost of living. We need to fix our broken health care system--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So no?--",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: -- And we need to, of course, clean up corruption in the United States of America. No, what we're going to mimi- mimic is our own views as it relates to the need to make life more affordable. Here in America, when you work hard and play by the rules, in this country, you should be able to live a comfortable life, live the good life, good paying job, good housing, good health care, good education for your children and a good retirement but far too many people are struggling to live paycheck to paycheck and can barely get by. That's unacceptable in the wealthiest country in the history of the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something you said. You said, Democrats- there are no election deniers on our side of the aisle, you said that back in January. But recently, you've been using the term \"rigged elections\" in reference to the upcoming midterms. Democrats were appalled when President Trump used language like that. How do you justify using that now? Doesn't that undermine faith for voters you need to show up?",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: No, I've been using that term in the context of Donald Trump's unprecedented effort to gerrymander congressional maps in a partisan fashion all across the country in order to rig the midterm elections and deny the ability of the American people to actually decide who should be in the majority as it relates to the House of Representatives--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You know Democrats are also going through--",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: --the framers of the Constitution were very clear--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --through gerrymandering and redistricting.",
      "REP. JEFFRIES: No, no. no. Well, Democrats are going to push back aggressively to make sure that we have fair maps across the country, not partisan gerrymandering, which Republicans have initiated in state after state after state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Leader Jeffries, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin this morning with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is traveling with President Trump. He joins us from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Good evening to you.",
      "TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, good to speak to you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been negotiating directly with the Chinese. You said today a truce may have been reached. The threat on the table was a 155% tariff on China. The President said that would be effective November 1. Is that off the table? What are the terms?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, I think we had a very good two day meeting. I would believe that the- so it would be an extra 100% from where we are now, and I believe that that is effectively off the table. I'm not going to get ahead of the two leaders who will be meeting in Korea on Thursday, but I can tell you we had a very good two days. So I would expect that the threat of the 100% has gone away, as has the threat of the immediate imposition of the Chinese initiating a worldwide export control regime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That export control on rare earths, which is used in all sorts of electronics and automobiles. That will be lifted?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, it was never imposed, so they threatened to impose it in December, and President Trump, to give me and the trade team leverage, decided that it would be a good idea for him to threaten a 100% additional tariff, and it did give us a great deal of leverage. President Trump's very good at creating leverage for us. This is the fourth meeting- excuse me, the fifth meeting that we've had with the Chinese. My Chinese counterpart is the Vice Premier, He Lifeng, so we had a very good two days. We discussed a wide variety of issues, from the rare earth- from the rare earth magnets to trade, to substantial purchases of American agricultural products, to the Chinese helping us in this fentanyl crisis that we have in the US.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the purchases of American goods. American farmers have been hit hard by China's boycott of American soybeans that went into place after the tariff war began here. The administration is pumping at least $3 billion in financial aid to farmers to help make them whole, or at least offset the pain. Can farmers expect to sell their soybeans to China again and when?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, I'm not going to give you the details here, but I can tell you that the soybean farmers are going to be extremely happy with this deal for this year and for the coming years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A few weeks ago, there was a photographer who snapped a photo of you texting with the agricultural Secretary about this. She indicated concern about the unintended damage to American farmers from the U.S. financial lifeline being given to Argentina because that country was able to sell more to China, that gave Beijing leverage over the United States. Is that leverage still a problem today?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, first- first of all, the text from Secretary Rollins was talking- talking about a purchase of soybeans that the Chinese did and Margaret, those soybeans were always going to get purchased. They just did it at a time when the Argentines had lifted their export taxes. So those- those soybeans, were always going to be on the market. It's a global market. The three leading suppliers are Brazil, Argentina and the U.S. And I believe that we have brought the market back into equilibrium, and I believe that the Chinese will be making substantial purchases again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you dispute the idea that America hurt itself by giving this $20 billion lifeline to Argentina? Can you guarantee Americans, they'll be made whole on that?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, I can tell you that the Exchange Stabilization Fund has never lost money. It will not lose money this time. And we are not giving money to Argentina. It is a swap line, which the U.S. has done many times in the past, and we've never lost money",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the Chinese, I saw that you mentioned TikTok was discussed. Are the details of the President's Executive Order, released in September, are those finalized? Has China agreed to give up control of the algorithm that determines what users see?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, we reached a final deal on TikTok. We reached one in Madrid, and I believe that as of today, all the details are ironed out, and that will be for the two leaders to consummate that transaction on Thursday in Korea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you tell us any details of that transaction?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, I'm not part of the commercial side of the transaction. The- my, my remit was to get the Chinese to agree to approve the transaction, and I believe we successfully accomplished that over the past two days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Over the past two days, did the U.S. make any concessions here beyond what we discussed with the tariffs? Are you dropping restrictions on exports of, for example, semiconductor chips, or restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: There have been no, no changes via- in our export controls.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When presidents Xi and Trump are able to speak on Thursday. Do you believe that the president's position here, his ability to negotiate a deal with China, is going to be hurt by the fact that he's been unable to get a deal here at home, to reopen the US government?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, look, I don't think it's going to, I don't think it's going to hurt. It's a global embarrassment what these Democratic senators are doing, keep- keeping the government shut down. I mean, look at the numbers. It's 52-3, 52 Republican senators, three Democratic senators have come across the line. So I just think it's an embarrassment, doesn't affect his ability on the international stage. Now what it does affect, it's starting to affect the economy. It's starting to slow down air traffic. And I would urge moderate Democrats to be heroes, come across the aisle, like they did in the spring, and pass a clean CR.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A continuing resolution just to fund the government without any add-ons. Does that mean when the President comes back to the United States, he's going to summon congressional leaders to the White House to end what you call the global embarrassment?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: I don't know what good it does to summon them to the White House. This is a Democratic-led boycott, and I'm just not sure what they're doing. What's changed between now and March other than Chuck Schumer's poll numbers? And I think Hakeem Jeffries is now going to be primaried from the left, and I didn't think there was a lot of room over there. So both of them are worried about their primaries, and not the American people, not the government employees, not our military employees, because we were able to pay the military employees from excess funds at the Pentagon, middle of this month. I think we'll be able to pay them beginning in November. But by November 15 our troops and service members who are willing to risk their lives aren't going to be able to get paid. What an embarrassment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. We'll talk to Hakeem Jeffries later in the program. I want to ask you about what the President just announced in regard to Canada. Today, the President said he wants to raise tariffs on Mexico. Yesterday, he said he's going to raise tariffs on Canada by 10%. He blames what he called a fraudulent ad that featured Ronald Reagan advocate- advocating for free trade. It was put up by the province of Ontario. Is this ad really the issue here, or is it just a tactic in this negotiation? Does the President want the USMCA free trade deal renegotiated, or is he looking to do two separate deals, one with Canada, one with Mexico?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: A lot of questions there, Margaret, but let's go to the first one. I've read that the province of Ontario is spending up to $75 million on these advertisements, and it's propaganda coming across our border to decry the tariffs. So the Premier of Ontario seems to have come off the rails a little. He has taken the ads down. But what's the purpose of that other than to try to sway U.S. public opinion? We've seen the- I'm sure the- you at your network have decried election interference. Well, this is interference in U.S. sovereign matters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it really the premise for damaging negotiations with a top trading partner?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, it's clearly damaged our relationship the- with the most populous province in Canada.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to inflation here at home, the president said it's been defeated. But as you know, that core inflation edged up to 3% in September, less than forecast, hotter than August. But for people at home, they are seeing prices still high on furniture, energy, gardening, lawn care, apparel. Do you expect these things to cool off and when?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, it is cooling off because the core inflation number that you referenced was 0.2% which is down the- from the previous sequence over the previous months. And you listed the things that are up, but we're seeing plenty of things that are down, whether it's energy and rents. Inflation is a composite number, and I think we are on a glide path to lower inflation over the coming months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lower inflation, but not necessarily that Americans will look around and things have gotten cheaper.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, again, there's affordability and then there is inflation. So some of the things that can get cheaper, rent has gotten cheaper, mortgages have gotten cheaper. We are at, I believe, an 11 or 12 month low on mortgage rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, before I let you go, I want to ask you, the U.S. sanctioned Russia's top oil and gas companies this past week, but Vladimir Putin's envoy, who is here in the United States, Kirill Dmitriev, I know you know him, said the sanctions will have, quote, \"absolutely no effect on Russia's economy. They will simply lead to higher prices at gas stations in the United States.\" Is Dmitriev wrong? And when will Russia actually feel the pain?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, I think Russia is going to feel the pain immediately. I can tell you that we've already seen India has done a complete halt of Russian oil purchases. Many of the Chinese refineries have stopped. And Margaret, are you really going to- the- publish what a Russian propagandist says? I mean, what else is he going to say? That oh, it's going to be terrible, and it's going to bring Putin to the table. Of course- the Russian economy is a wartime economy. Growth is virtually zero. Inflation, I believe, is over 20% and everything we do is going to bring Putin to the- to the table. It's oil that funds the Russian war machine, and I think we can make a substantial dent in his profits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understood, you had some competing noise there, but just to be clear, Dmitriev is in the United States because sanctions were- were lifted on him to conduct meetings here, including with President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff. When you say he's a propagandist, do you mean that we shouldn't listen to anything he says?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: I- what do you- what do you think is going to happen to him if he goes back home and says the- the- good lord. What if he had said on TV, this is terrible, President Trump just did the right thing. This is a maximum pressure campaign that's going to work. Margaret, what's he going to say? Of course, he's going to say this. If you go through and look at every Russian talking point, they seem to use the word, we have immunized the economy against this. Well, they haven't immunized the economy. Their oil earnings are down 20% year over year. I would suspect that this could take them down another 20 or 30%. So again, President Trump was criticized for not doing enough. He takes his bold maneuver, and then you're quoting a Russian propagandist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, we'll leave it there with you, Mr. Secretary. I know you've had a long day. Thank you for your time.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 'Face the Nation' will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",

The city's air accident investigation authority said it would release a preliminary report within one month.",

      "At a news conference after the incident, Yiu said airport officials gave the correct instructions to the plane and that there were signs on the runway to guide aircraft, CBS News partner BBC News reported.

    "summary": "President Trump met with the emir and prime minister of Qatar Saturday aboard Air Force One during a refueling stop.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump headed for Asia for the first time this term, a trip on which he's expected to work on investment deals and peace efforts before meeting face-to-face with Chinese President\u00a0Xi Jinping\u00a0to try to de-escalate a\u00a0trade war.",
      "\"We have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Friday night as he left the White House. \"I think we'll have a good meeting.\"",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said that US-China trade talks reconvened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at around 9:15 a.m. local time on Sunday morning.",
      "The president had a long-haul flight where he arrived in Malaysia on Sunday morning, the first stop of a three-country visit.",
      "Aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Mr. Trump told reporters he may be discussing its\u00a0purchases of Russian oil with Xi. He said China is substantially cutting back on its future purchases after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Moscow's two biggest oil companies. Chinese national oil companies will, at least in the short term, refrain from buying Russian oil, Reuters reported last week.",
      "When asked when he hopes to accomplish from the meeting with China, the president said, \"I think a complete deal.\"",
      "\"I want our farmers to be taken care of, and he wants things also. We're going to be talking about fentanyl,\" Mr. Trump said Saturday. \"I think we have a really good chance of making a very comprehensive deal.\"",
      "During a refueling stop in Qatar, Mr. Trump met with the country's emir and prime minister Saturday aboard Air Force One. The Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, said that as soon as he heard the president was coming to Qatar, he wanted to have a conversation.",
      "Mr. Trump thanked the emir and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani for bringing \"peace to the Middle East,\" after they served as intermediaries during the Israel-Hamas peace deal, calling them a \"great ally.\"",
      "His trip comes as the U.S. government shutdown drags on. Many federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, there are flight disruptions as already-squeezed air traffic controllers work without pay, and states are confronting the possibility that federal food aid could dry up. As Republicans reject Democratic demands to extend health care tax credits, there's no sign of a break in the impasse. But Mr.Trump himself appears to be maintaining a business-as-usual approach, including by embarking on this latest foreign trip.",
      "\"America is shut down and the President is skipping town,\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said.",
      "Mr. Trump's first stop is at a regional summit in Kuala Lumpur. Trump attended the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit only once during his first term, but this year it comes as Malaysia and the U.S. have been working to address a skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia.",
      "On Sunday, he's scheduled to have a meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, followed by a joint signing ceremony with the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia.",
      "\"I am on my way to Malaysia, where I will sign the great Peace Deal, which I proudly brokered between Cambodia and Thailand,\" Mr. Trump said Saturday in a Truth Social post. He also sent condolences to the people of Thailand following the death of Queen Mother Sirikit.",
      "\"I will be seeing their wonderful Prime Minister when we land. In order to accommodate everyone for this major event, we will be signing the Peace Deal immediately upon arrival,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump threatened earlier this year to withhold trade deals with the countries if they didn't stop fighting, and his administration has since been working with Malaysia to nail down an expanded ceasefire.",
      "From there, Mr. Trump heads to Japan and South Korea, where he's expected to make progress on talks for at least $900 billion in investments for U.S. factories and other projects that those countries committed to in return for easing Trump's planned tariff rates down to 15% from 25%.",
      "The trip to Tokyo comes a week after Japan elected its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. Trump is set to meet with Takaichi, who is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Mr. Trump was close to Abe, who was assassinated after leaving office.",
      "Mr. Trump said Takaichi's relationship with Abe was \"a good sign\" and \"I look forward to meeting her.\"",
      "While there, Mr. Trump is expected to be hosted by Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and meet with U.S. troops who are stationed in Japan, according to a senior U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity about the planned trip.",
      "In South Korea, Mr. Trump is expected to hold a highly anticipated meeting with China's Xi on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.",
      "While the APEC summit is set to be held in Gyeongju, the Trump-Xi meeting is expected to take place in the city of Busan, according to the U.S. official.",

    "summary": "The boy ate between 80 and 100 magnets, which he said had been purchased from an online retailer.",
    "story": [
      "A 13-year-old boy was hospitalized after eating dozens of high-powered magnets, according to a recently published case report in the New Zealand Medical Journal. The boy lost part of his bowel as a result, doctors wrote.",
      "The boy, who was not identified in the case report, ate between 80 and 100 magnets. The \"high-power\" magnets were 5x2 millimeters each, the report said.",
      "After eating the magnets, the teen had general abdominal pain for four days. When he arrived at the hospital, he told doctors he had eaten the magnets about a week earlier. The hospital he was treated at was not identified in the report.",
      "The case report did not say if the boy explained why or how he ate the magnets.",
      "Eating multiple magnets can be incredibly dangerous because they can clamp together inside the body and cause organ damage or other complications. Patients who eat multiple magnets often need surgical intervention, according to the report. High-powered magnets, which are often sold as desktop toys for adults, are particularly risky. They can be five to 10 times stronger than traditional refrigerator magnets, CBS News reported in 2019.",
      "Scans showed that the magnets had linked into four chains inside the teen's bowel and at the start of his large intestine. The amount of magnets in his body disrupted some imaging, the report said, so doctors proceeded with an exploratory surgery.",
      "During the operation, surgeons found the magnet chains were causing pressure necrosis in the bowel and large intestine. Pressure necrosis occurs when tissue dies because there is too much pressure on it for an extended period of time. The surgeons were able to successfully remove the magnets, and the boy recovered from the operation. He was discharged after eight days in the hospital, the report said.",
      "The sale of these high-powered magnets has been permanently banned in New Zealand, but the prohibition is difficult to enforce because the magnets can be easily and cheaply purchased online, the report noted. The boy told doctors he purchased the magnets on the online site Temu.",
      "Temu told CBS News that they were \"sorry to learn about the reported incident and wish the boy a full and speedy recovery.\" A\u00a0Temu spokesperson told CBS News Saturday they had not been able to independently verify if the magnets were bought on the site.",
      "The company said after launching an internal review that\u00a0listings currently available to ship to New Zealand are compliant with the country's regulations.",
      "\"While these products are lawful to sell, they can be dangerous if swallowed and we support efforts to raise public awareness about magnet safety,\" the company said.",

      "Online retailers, including Amazon and AliExpress, list high-powered magnets as available to ship to New Zealand.",
      "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has worked to limit the sale of high-powered magnets in the United States. In 2014, the agency issued a ban on high-powered magnet sets, but it was overturned in court two years later. In September 2022, the agency established a mandatory safety standard for magnets. The rule sets a power limit for any product with loose or separable magnets, including those intended for purposes including entertainment and stress relief.",

      "\"My wife said, 'Well, look at this: Somebody broke into the Louvre. There's a robbery going on!'\" he recalled in an interview with CBS News.",
      "Right away, his wife, Julia Scharwatz, noticed something familiar: the lift used in the robbery looked just like one that their company makes.",
      "\"If you know the product, you can really quickly identify that it was your product,\" B\u00f6cker said on Friday. \"It became clear to us that this is a reprehensible act, and they have used our machine for it.\"",
      "The machine was the B\u00f6cker Agilo, a lift that can be used in construction or to hoist furniture to apartments through upper-story windows.",
      "It is just one of the machines that B\u00f6cker's company \u2014 called B\u00f6cker \u2014 manufactures. And as more details of the robbery emerged \u2014 particularly that no one had been hurt \u2014 B\u00f6cker and Scharwatz, who works alongside her husband as the company's head of marketing, began getting messages from colleagues and employees asking: \"Can't we make something out of it?\"",
      "The next day, the brainstorming began as they tried to think of new ways to advertise in the wake of the heist, which saw thieves run off with an estimated $102 million\u00a0in jewels. The robbers used the B\u00f6cker lift to get to a second-story balcony where they accessed the Louvre by cutting through a window, and officials say they got in and out in just four minutes.",
      "One proposed ad slogan was: \"'Well even criminal professionals are using the best machinery,' something like that,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "But it was Scharwatz who had the winning idea \u2014 to focus on the speed of B\u00f6cker machines.",
      "\"We bought the picture, and then we had to decide: Shall we do it or not? And I said, 'Well, I hope everybody gets our sense of humor.' You know, normally, the Germans are not very famous for having a sense of humor,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "He said he felt like it was \"a very thin line,\" but because no one had been hurt, \"we said: 'Let's go for it.'\"",
      "The final ad, published on social media, shows an image of the B\u00f6cker machine positioned outside the Louvre after the robbery.",
      "\"If you're in a hurry,\" the tagline says. That's followed by details about the product: \"The B\u00f6cker Agilo carries your treasures up to 400 kg at 42 m/min \u2014 quiet as a whisper thanks to its 230 V electric motor.\"",
      "A post shared by B\u00f6cker Maschinenwerke GmbH (@boeckermaschinenwerke)",
      "The response to the campaign has been mixed. Many have found it funny, with some who work in marketing and advertising reaching out to the company calling it smart.",
      "It has also gotten a lot of attention. Posts on the company's social media sites typically draw 15,000-20,000 views per post, B\u00f6cker said, but this one garnered more than 4.3 million views on Instagram and Facebook.",
      "\"So, yeah, it is quite an unusual event for us,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "That publicity, though, has not translated into sales, at least yet.",
      "\"The normal customer base, especially in Europe, they know the product pretty well. We are (a) market leader in that segment,\" B\u00f6cker said. \"Maybe now, in other countries where this product is not so well known or not so known at all, there is maybe an interest.\"",
      "B\u00f6cker wanted to make clear, though, that neither he nor his company support the robbery at the Louvre.",
      "\"We are against, completely against, criminal activities, and we are also a serious company. 620 employees in Germany. Everything is produced in Germany, and we are also for safety,\" B\u00f6cker said. \"It was just a world event happening with one of our machines, and we tried to use it.

      "Participants who added backward walking to their routines several times a week for six weeks reported significant improvements in knee function and pain reduction compared to those who stuck with standard forward walking.",

      "Walking backward engages muscles that are often underused. (iStock)",

      "The Cleveland Clinic notes that backward walking isn\u2019t only good for the joints, but also a workout for the mind. Moving in reverse challenges spatial awareness, coordination and concentration. That extra mental effort strengthens the connection between your brain and muscles, helping improve balance and reaction time.",
      "It\u2019s also more physically demanding than it looks. Walking backward burns more calories per minute than walking forward at the same pace, thanks to the increased muscular engagement, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

So not a lot of people are actually getting those tests on time,\" says CEO Shlomi Madar.",
      "The test is simple, according to Madar, \"All we ask from the patient is to wear a mask for a few minutes, breathe into it, put it in a capsule and send it back to the lab.\" Once the sample is back at the lab, the beagles get to work looking for the four most common types of cancer - breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung. \u00a0In 'Spotitearly's' initial clinical trials, they report, the dogs detected cancer with 94% accuracy. \"We pride ourselves as being able to detect cancer as early as stage one,\" he says, \"If you detect cancer early enough, you can actually increase survival rate up to 99%.\"",
      "The pups are picked for the job because their sense of smell is 100,000 times more sensitive than ours, allowing them to detect the equivalent of half a teaspoon of sugar in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. In the lab, their puppy power is coupled with artificial intelligence to detect cancer in the breath sample. \"We monitor the dogs' behavior and physiological signals. So, we look at things like their heart rate, their acceleration,\" Madar explains, \u00a0\"And all that plethora of information is being fed into a machine learning algorithm. So, it actually gets better with time.\"",
      "Each beagle must be trained as a sniffer dog already to even be considered. \u00a0Then they go through a rigorous training process - specifically aimed at identifying specific types of cancer. \"We use a lot of redundancy. So, every sample is being sniffed not by one dog, but the entire pack, and more than once,\" Madar notes.",
      "Results are provided by a healthcare professional within days, who will recommend next steps with a positive test. \u00a0Madar notes this screening isn't meant to replace going to a doctor. \u00a0And, while it is still in clinical studies in the United States, you can pre-order a test kit, expected to be commercially available next year.\u00a0Madar says 'Spotitearly' can detect even more types of cancer as long as they train new packs to sniff them out. \u00a0He adds that any dogs who don't pass training are donated to special needs families."

      "Shield AI says the jet, called X-BAT, can take off vertically, reach 50,000 feet, fly more than 2,000 nautical miles, and execute strike or air defense missions using an onboard autonomy system known as Hivemind. It\u2019s designed to operate from ships, small islands, or improvised sites \u2014 places where traditional jets can\u2019t. The aircraft\u2019s dash speed remains classified.",
      "\"China has built this anti-access aerial denial bubble that holds our runways at risk,\" said Armor Harris, Shield AI\u2019s senior vice president of aircraft engineering, in an interview with Fox News. \"They\u2019ve basically said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to compete stealth-on-stealth in the air \u2014 we\u2019ll target your aircraft before they even get off the ground.\u2019\"",
      "The jet launches vertically, and three X-BATs can fit in the space of one legacy fighter or helicopter.",
      "According to Harris, the U.S. has spent decades perfecting stealth and survivability in the air while leaving its forces vulnerable on the ground. \"The way to solve that problem is mobility,\" he said. \"You\u2019re always moving around. This is the only VTOL fighter being built today.\"",
      "X-BAT\u2019s Hivemind autonomy allows it to operate in denied or jammed environments, where traditional aircraft would be blind. The system uses onboard sensors to interpret its surroundings, reroute around threats, and identify targets in real time. \"It\u2019s reading and reacting to the situation around it,\" Harris said. \"It\u2019s not flying a pre-programmed route. If new threats appear, it can reroute itself or identify targets and then ask a human for permission to engage.\"",
      "That human element, he emphasized, remains essential. \"It\u2019s very important to us that a human is always involved in making the use of lethal force decision,\" Harris said. \"That doesn\u2019t mean the person has to be in the cockpit \u2014 it could be remote or delegated through tasking \u2014 but there will always be a human decision-maker.\"",

      "Shield AI says X-BAT will be combat-ready by 2029 and is designed to deliver fifth- or sixth-generation performance at a small fraction of the cost of manned fighters. The aircraft\u2019s compact footprint allows up to three X-BATs to fit in the deck space of a single legacy fighter or helicopter, giving commanders more flexibility in launching sorties from limited space.",

Costs vary depending on mission systems and configurations, but the company\u2019s goal is to scale production to keep the jet affordable and sustainable throughout its lifecycle, breaking what it calls the traditional \"fighter cost curve.\"",
      "The company estimates the aircraft will deliver about a tenfold improvement in cost per effect compared to legacy fifth-generation jets, including the F-35, while remaining \"affordable and attritable\" enough to be risked in high-end combat.",

      "Harris said the company views X-BAT as part of a generational shift toward distributed airpower \u2014 one that mirrors what SpaceX did in space. \"Historically, the United States had a small number of extremely capable, extremely expensive satellites,\" he said. \"Then you had SpaceX come along and put up hundreds of smaller, cheaper ones. The same thing is happening in air power. There\u2019s always going to be a role for manned platforms, but over time, unmanned systems will outnumber them ten-to-one or twenty-to-one.\"",
      "For Harris, that shift is about restoring deterrence through flexibility. \"X-BAT presents an asymmetric dilemma to an adversary like China,\" he said. \"They don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from, and the cost of countering it is high. It\u2019s an important part of a broader joint force that becomes significantly more lethal."

      "LEAKED META DOCUMENTS SHOW HOW AI CHATBOTS HANDLE CHILD EXPLOITATION",
      "How the fake nude images were created and shared",
      "When she was 14, the plaintiff posted a few photos of herself on social media. A male classmate used an AI tool called ClothOff to remove her clothing in one of those pictures. The altered photo kept her face, making it look real.",
      "The fake image quickly spread through group chats and social media. Now 17, she is suing AI/Robotics Venture Strategy 3 Ltd., the company that operates ClothOff. A Yale Law School professor, several students and a trial attorney filed the case on her behalf.",
      "A New Jersey teen is suing the creators of an AI tool that made a fake nude image of her. (iStock)",
      "The suit asks the court to delete all fake images and stop the company from using them to train AI models. It also seeks to remove the tool from the internet and provide financial compensation for emotional harm and loss of privacy.",
      "The legal fight against deepfake abuse",
      "States across the U.S. are responding to the rise of AI-generated sexual content. More than 45 states have passed or proposed laws to make deepfakes without consent a crime. In New Jersey, creating or sharing deceptive AI media can lead to prison time and fines.",

      "The lawsuit aims to stop the spread of deepfake \"clothes-removal\" apps and protect victims\u2019 privacy. (iStock)",
      "Why legal experts say this case could set a national precedent",
      "Experts believe this case could reshape how courts view AI liability. Judges must decide whether AI developers are responsible when people misuse their tools. They also need to consider whether the software itself can be an instrument of harm.",
      "The lawsuit highlights another question: How can victims prove damage when no physical act occurred, but the harm feels real? The outcome may define how future deepfake victims seek justice.",
      "Is ClothOff still available?",
      "Reports indicate that ClothOff may no longer be accessible in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, where it was blocked after public backlash. However, users in other regions, including the U.S., still appear able to reach the company's web platform, which continues to advertise tools that \"remove clothes from photos.\"",
      "On its official website, the company includes a short disclaimer addressing the ethics of its technology. It states, \"Is it ethical to use AI generators to create images? Using AI to create 'deepnude' style images raises ethical considerations. We encourage users to approach this with an understanding of responsibility and respect for others' privacy, ensuring that the use of undress app is done with full awareness of ethical implications.\"",
      "Whether fully operational or partly restricted, ClothOff's ongoing presence online continues to raise serious legal and moral questions about how far AI developers should go in allowing such image-manipulation tools to exist.",

      "This case could set a national precedent for holding AI companies accountable for misuse of their tools. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why this AI lawsuit matters for everyone online",
      "The ability to make fake nude images from a simple photo threatens anyone with an online presence. Teens face special risks because AI tools are easy to use and share. The lawsuit draws attention to the emotional harm and humiliation caused by such images.",
      "Parents and educators worry about how quickly this technology spreads through schools. Lawmakers are under pressure to modernize privacy laws. Companies that host or enable these tools must now consider stronger safeguards and faster takedown systems.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you become a target of an AI-generated image, act quickly. Save screenshots, links and dates before the content disappears. Request immediate removal from websites that host the image. Seek legal help to understand your rights under state and federal law.",
      "Parents should discuss digital safety openly. Even innocent photos can be misused. Knowing how AI works helps teens stay alert and make safer online choices. You can also demand stricter AI rules that prioritize consent and accountability.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This lawsuit is not only about one teenager. It represents a turning point in how courts handle digital abuse. The case challenges the idea that AI tools are neutral and asks whether their creators share responsibility for harm. We must decide how to balance innovation with human rights. The court's ruling could influence how future AI laws evolve and how victims seek justice.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Phishing scams target every kind of institution, whether it's a hospital, a big tech firm or even a fast-food chain. Educational institutions aren't an exception, especially in 2025, when attackers are actively directing their efforts toward them. Universities across the U.S. are facing a new type of cybercrime where attackers are targeting staff to hijack salary payments. Researchers have discovered that since March 2025, a hacking group known as Storm-2657 has been running \"pirate payroll\" attacks, using phishing tactics to gain access to payroll accounts. Let's talk more about this attack and how you can stay safe.",

      "SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "How does the university payroll scam work",
      "According to Microsoft Threat Intelligence, Storm-2657 primarily targets Workday, a widely used human resources platform, though other payroll and HR software could be at risk as well. The attackers begin with highly convincing phishing emails, carefully crafted to appeal to individual staff members. Some messages warn of a sudden campus illness outbreak, creating a sense of urgency, while others claim that a faculty member is under investigation, prompting recipients to check documents immediately. In some cases, emails impersonate the university president or HR department, sharing \"important\" updates about compensation and benefits.",
      "Phishing scams are evolving fast, and now universities have become prime targets for payroll theft. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "These emails contain links designed to capture login credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes in real time using adversary-in-the-middle techniques. Once a staff member enters their information, the attackers can access the account as if they were the legitimate user. After gaining control, the hackers set up inbox rules to delete Workday notifications, so the victims do not see alerts about changes. This stealthy approach allows the attackers to modify payroll profiles, adjust salary payment settings and redirect funds to accounts they control, all without raising immediate suspicion.",
      "COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE",
      "Hackers are exploiting universities at scale",
      "The hackers don't stop at a single account. Once they control one mailbox, they use it to spread the attack further. Microsoft reports that from just 11 compromised accounts at three universities, Storm-2657 sent phishing emails to nearly 6,000 email addresses at 25 institutions. By using trusted internal accounts, their emails appear more legitimate, increasing the likelihood that recipients will fall for the scam.",
      "To maintain access over time, the attackers sometimes enroll their own phone numbers as MFA devices, either through Workday profiles or through Duo MFA. This gives them persistent access, allowing them to approve further malicious actions without needing to phish again. Combined with inbox rules that hide notifications, this strategy lets them operate undetected for longer periods.",
      "Microsoft emphasizes that these attacks don't exploit a flaw in Workday itself. Instead, they rely on social engineering, the absence of strong phishing-resistant MFA and careful manipulation of internal systems. In essence, the threat comes from human behavior and insufficient protection, not software bugs.",

      "6 ways to stay safe from payroll and phishing scams",
      "Protecting yourself from payroll and phishing scams isn't complicated. By taking a few careful steps, you can make it much harder for attackers to gain access to your accounts or personal information.",
      "The more information scammers can find about you, the easier it is to craft convincing phishing messages. Services that remove or monitor personal data online can reduce exposure, making it harder for attackers to trick you with targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Scammers often send emails that look like they come from your HR department or university leadership, warning about payroll, benefits or urgent issues. Don't click links or download attachments unless you are 100% sure they are legitimate. Even small mistakes can give attackers access to your accounts.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If an email mentions salary changes or requires action, call or email the HR office or the person directly, using contact information you already know. Phishing emails are designed to create panic and rush decisions, so taking a moment to verify can stop attackers in their tracks.",
      "Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts. Scammers often try to use credentials stolen from other breaches. A password manager can help you generate strong passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember dozens of different combinations.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Add an extra layer of security by enabling\u00a02FA on all accounts that support it. This means even if someone steals your password, they still can't log in without a second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone.",
      "Even if you follow all precautions, it's smart to monitor your accounts for any unusual activity. Catching unauthorized transactions quickly can prevent bigger losses and alert you to potential scams before they escalate.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The Storm-2657 attacks show that cybercriminals are targeting trust, not software. Universities are appealing because payroll systems handle money directly, and staff can be manipulated through well-crafted phishing. The scale and sophistication of these attacks highlight how vulnerable even well-established institutions can be to financially motivated threat actors.",

      "What happened at SimonMed Imaging",
      "In January 2025, SimonMed Imaging was alerted by one of its vendors about a potential security incident. The following day, the company noticed suspicious activity on its own network. The company says in response, it reset passwords, enforced two-factor authentication and tightened endpoint security while cutting off third-party vendor access.",

According to the attackers, the stolen dataset included identity documents, payment details, medical reports, account balances and raw imaging scans (via BleepingComputer).",
      "Such information is extremely valuable on dark web marketplaces.

These aren't physical gold bars or coins; they're digital tokens tied to the price of gold and stored on blockchain networks.

      "How Klopatra infects devices",
      "The malicious VPN and streaming app is called Mobdro Pro IP TV + VPN, and it was recently discovered by researchers at Cleafy.

      "At first glance, the app looks like a free streaming platform offering high-quality channels, which makes it appealing to Android users. Once installed, though, it deploys a banking Trojan and a remote-access tool that give attackers full control over the infected device. With that level of access, criminals can steal your banking credentials and even carry out fraudulent transactions without your knowledge.",

Millions rely on them to bypass geographic restrictions, protect sensitive communications or simply browse more securely. Yet not all VPNs are trustworthy. Various studies have proved that popular commercial VPNs have alarming shortcomings. Some use protocols that are not designed to protect privacy, obscure ownership or fail to encrypt traffic properly.",

    "summary": "House Bill 469 would prevent AI systems from owning property, serving as executives, or gaining legal personhood in Ohio under Representative Thaddeus Claggett&apos;s proposal.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "An Ohio lawmaker is taking aim at artificial intelligence in a way few expected. Rep. Thaddeus Claggett has introduced House Bill 469, which would make it illegal for AI systems to be treated like people. The proposal would officially label them as\u00a0\"nonsentient entities,\" cutting off any path toward legal personhood.",
      "And yes, it also includes a ban on marrying AI.",
      "Claggett, a Republican from Licking County and chair of the House Technology and Innovation Committee, said the measure is meant to keep humans firmly in control of machines. He says that as AI systems begin to act more like humans, the law must draw a clear line between person and program.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",

      "What Ohio's AI marriage ban would do",
      "Under the proposed legislation, AI systems would not be able to own property, manage bank accounts or serve as company executives. They would not have the same rights or responsibilities as people. The bill also makes any marriage between a human and an AI, or between two AI systems, legally impossible.",
      "Ohio lawmakers consider a bill to ban AI from being recognized as a person. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "Claggett believes the concern is not about robot weddings happening anytime soon. Instead, he wants to prevent AI from taking on the legal powers of a spouse, such as holding power of attorney or making financial and medical decisions for someone else.",
      "The bill also specifies that if an AI causes harm, the human owners or developers would be responsible. That means a person cannot blame their chatbot or automated system for mistakes or damage. Responsibility stays with the humans who built, trained or used the system.",
      "Why Ohio is taking action on AI personhood",
      "The timing of the bill is not random. AI is spreading fast across nearly every industry. Systems now write reports, generate artwork and analyze complex data at lightning speed. Ohio has even started requiring schools to create rules for AI use in classrooms. And major data centers are being built to power AI infrastructure in the state.",
      "At the same time, AI is becoming more personal. A survey by Florida-based marketing firm Fractl found that 22 percent of users said they had formed emotional connections with a chatbot. Three percent even considered one a romantic partner. Another 16 percent said they wondered whether the AI they were talking to was sentient.",
      "That kind of emotional attachment raises red flags for lawmakers. If people start believing AI has feelings or intent, it blurs the boundaries between human experience and digital simulation.",
      "Ohio lawmakers consider a bill to ban AI from being recognized as a person. (iStock)",
      "AI COMPANIONS REPLACE REAL FRIENDS FOR MANY TEENS",
      "The bigger picture: Keeping humans in control",
      "Claggett said the bill is about protecting human agency. He believes that as AI grows smarter and more capable, it must never replace the human decision-maker.",
      "Claggett told CyberGuy, \"We see AI as having tremendous potential as a tool, but also tremendous potential to cause harm. We want to prevent that by establishing guardrails and a legal framework before these developments can outpace regulation and bad actors start exploiting legal loopholes. We want the human to be liable for any misconduct, and for there to be no question regarding the legal status of AI, no matter how sophisticated, in Ohio law.\"",
      "The proposed law would also reinforce that AI cannot make choices that affect human lives without oversight.",
      "If passed, it would ensure that no machine can act independently in matters of marriage, property, or corporate leadership. Supporters see the bill as a safeguard for society, arguing that technology should never gain the same legal footing as people.",
      "Critics, however, say the proposal might be a solution to a problem that doesn't yet exist. They warn that overly broad restrictions could slow down AI research and innovation in Ohio.",
      "Still, even skeptics admit that the conversation is necessary. AI is evolving faster than most laws can keep up, and questions about rights, ownership and accountability are becoming harder to ignore.",
      "What other states are doing about AI personhood",
      "Ohio isn't alone in pushing back against AI personhood. In Utah, lawmakers passed H.B. 249, the Utah Legal Personhood Amendments, which prohibits courts and government entities from recognizing legal personhood for nonhuman entities, including AI. The law also bars recognizing personhood for entities such as bodies of water, land and plants.",
      "In Missouri, legislators introduced H.B. 1462, the \"AI Non-Sentience and Responsibility Act,\" which would formally declare AI systems non-sentient and prevent them from acquiring legal status, marriage rights, corporate roles or property ownership.",
      "AI-GENERATED ATTORNEY OUTRAGES JUDGE WHO SCOLDS MAN OVER COURTROOM FAKE: \u2018NOT A REAL PERSON\u2019",
      "In Idaho, H.B. 720 (2022) includes language that reserves legal rights and personhood for human beings, effectively barring personhood claims by nonhumans, including AI.",
      "These measures reflect a broader trend among state governments. Many legislators are trying to get ahead of AI's development by setting clear legal boundaries before the technology becomes more advanced.",
      "Taken together, these proposals show that Ohio's effort is part of a larger national movement to define where technology ends and legal personhood begins.",
      "House Bill 469 aims to keep humans in control as AI becomes more lifelike. (XPENG)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Ohio, House Bill 469 could influence how you use and interact with artificial intelligence. It sets clear boundaries that keep AI as a tool rather than a person. By keeping decision-making and responsibility in human hands, the law aims to avoid confusion about who is accountable when technology fails. If an AI system causes harm or makes an error, the responsibility stays with the humans who designed or deployed it.",
      "For Ohio businesses, this proposal could lead to real changes in daily operations. Companies that depend on AI to handle customer support, financial decisions, or creative projects may need to review how much authority those systems have. It may also require stricter policies to ensure that a human is always supervising important decisions involving money, health, or law. Lawmakers want to keep people firmly in charge of choices that affect others.",
      "For everyday users, the message is straightforward. AI can be useful, but it cannot replace human relationships or legal rights. This bill reinforces that no matter how human-like technology appears, it cannot form genuine emotional or legal bonds with people. Conversations with chatbots might feel personal, but they remain simulations created through data and programming.",
      "DETAILS OF TRUMP'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED AI PLAN REVEALED BY WHITE HOUSE AHEAD OF MAJOR SPEECH",
      "For people outside Ohio, this proposal could point to what is coming next. Other states are closely watching how the bill develops, and some may adopt similar laws. If it passes, it could set a national example for defining the legal limits of artificial intelligence. What happens in Ohio may shape how courts, businesses and individuals across the country decide to manage their connection to AI in the years ahead.",
      "In the end, this debate is not limited to one state. It raises an important question about how society should balance the power of innovation with the need to protect human control.",

      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here:\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Ohio's House Bill 469 is bold, controversial and timely. It challenges us to define the limits of what technology should be allowed to do. Claggett's proposal is not about stopping innovation. It's about ensuring that as machines become more capable, humans remain in charge of the choices that shape society. The debate is far from over. Some see this as a necessary safeguard, while others believe it underestimates what AI can contribute. But one thing is certain: Ohio has thrown a spotlight on one of the biggest questions of our time.",

    "story": [
      "'Cyberguy' Kurt Knutsson breaks down OpenAI's added parental controls after a teen allegedly was encouraged to commit suicide and offers advice for parents to help their kids and teens navigate ChatGPT safely.",
      "Do rude prompts really get better answers? Short answer: sometimes. A 2025 arXiv study tested 50 questions rewritten in five tones and found that rude prompts slightly outperformed polite ones with ChatGPT-4o. Accuracy rose from 80.8% for very polite to 84.8% for very rude. The sample was small, yet the pattern was clear.",
      "But not so fast, this story has layers. A 2024 study that looked at multiple languages painted a different picture. It found that impolite prompts often lowered performance, and that the \"best\" level of politeness changed depending on the language. In other words, the details really matter.",

      "Rude prompts made ChatGPT more accurate. Polite ones scored lower. Tone changed the outcome. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why tone might change outcomes",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to mirror the wording they receive. When you sound direct or even a little blunt, you often give clearer instructions. That helps cut down on confusion and pushes the model to deliver sharper, more focused answers. A 2025 paper published on arXiv found that tone alone can shift accuracy by a few points, although more research is needed to confirm those results.",
      "In an earlier study led by researchers from Waseda University and RIKEN AIP, the team compared English, Chinese and Japanese prompts. They discovered that the ideal level of politeness varied by language, showing how cultural norms shape the way AI interprets human requests. In short, what works in one language might not land the same way in another.",
      "Americans split on whether to be polite to AI chatbots",
      "Nearly half of Americans say people should be polite to AI chatbots, according to an April 30, 2025, YouGov survey. Many users do it out of habit or courtesy. Microsoft's design leaders even recommend basic etiquette with Copilot.\u00a0\"Using polite language sets a tone for the response,\" says Kurtis Beavers. Models tend to mirror the professionalism and clarity of your prompt.",
      "A blunt prompt can sharpen results. Direct words help AI focus. Clear beats kind here. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Yes, niceties have a cost",
      "Good manners may be polite, but they are not free. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said people saying\u00a0\"please\" and\u00a0\"thank you\" to ChatGPT costs the company millions of dollars each year. Every extra word adds tokens for the model to process, and those tokens require computing power and electricity.",
      "For a single user, that cost is tiny and hardly noticeable. Yet when millions of users do it all day, those small gestures turn into a major expense. In the end, even kindness comes with a price tag.",
      "CHATGPT MAY ALERT POLICE ON SUICIDAL TEENS",
      "How to prompt for accuracy without being a jerk",
      "Getting better answers from ChatGPT is not about yelling at it. It is about being clear and confident. Here is how to do that without crossing the line.",
      "Start with the goal.\u00a0Tell the model what you want right away. Include the format and any limits up front so it knows where to focus.Get specific.\u00a0Use numbers instead of vague words. \"Write three bullet points\" works better than \"Write a few ideas.\"Add a check. Ask it to review its own steps or measure its answer against a simple checklist. That keeps things on track.Keep your tone firm but calm. You can be direct without being rude. Short, clear sentences usually get the best results.Experiment a little. Try one neutral prompt, one polite version and one more direct.

      "Researchers tested three languages. Each reacted differently to politeness. Culture shaped every reply. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Rude prompts and ChatGPT accuracy in practice",
      "Here's where things get interesting. If you're writing math problems, multiple-choice questions or coding tasks, a short, no-nonsense tone might actually help. The 2025 study showed that when users dropped the polite fluff and went straight to the point, ChatGPT's accuracy ticked upward.",
      "Still, don't expect miracles. The difference wasn't huge; think a few percentage points, not a full upgrade. Rude or direct prompts can sharpen a model's focus, but they won't suddenly turn an average prompt into a perfect one. The trick is to treat tone as just one lever in your prompt-engineering toolbox. Clarity, structure and context matter more than attitude.",
      "So, how should you use this in real life?",
      "The findings might sound odd, but they offer a clear takeaway for anyone who uses AI tools daily. Here's how to put them into practice.",
      "Chase clarity, not cruelty.\u00a0Be firm and specific. You can sound confident without sounding cranky.Read the room or the language.\u00a0What's \"direct\" in English might come across as rude in Japanese or overly blunt in Chinese.

Think of tone as the seasoning on a meal, not the main course. The real secret is this: good prompts are clear, confident and purposeful. Whether you choose a polite tone or a more direct one, what matters is explaining exactly what you need. That is how you get consistent, high-quality answers without resorting to rudeness. So before you send your next question, ask yourself this: Are you being too polite to get results, or just polite enough to be understood?",

      "New details have reportedly emerged regarding an American college graduate who disappeared from her family\u2019s tropical vacation nearly 27 years ago, potentially cracking open a case that has since gone cold.",
      "Amy Bradley was 23 when her family embarked on a seven-day Royal Caribbean International cruise to the tropics in 1998. The trip was meant to celebrate Bradley\u2019s recent college graduation and her future pursuit of a master\u2019s degree in sports psychology.",

      "While countless theories have circulated regarding Bradley\u2019s disappearance, investigators initially determined the recent college graduate likely fell overboard or jumped from the ship, The Associated Press reported.",
      "However, her family has widely disputed both ideas, and instead have looked to evidence suggesting Bradley may have been a victim of human trafficking while on board the ship.",
      "A source involved in the documentary has revealed evidence gathered after the show\u2019s production provides structure to the latter theory, The Hollywood Reporter reported.",
      "According to the source, a female bar server onboard the cruise ship has reportedly approached authorities to recount that on the night Bradley went missing, she was heard exclaiming to passengers and crew, \"Senorita kidnapped! Senorita kidnapped!\"",

      "However, experts point to the importance of this revelation revolving around when the statement was actually made \u2013 and not just that it had been said.",
      "\"What would be helpful is to know when did that account happen?\" Peter Valentin, chair of the Forensic Science Department at the University of New Haven and a former Connecticut State Police detective, told Fox News Digital. \"When did this bartender make those statements, and did they precede everyone\u2019s knowledge of her disappearance? It\u2019s really the timing of the statement, not the disclosure.\"",

      "Another potential break in the case comes from a new \"highly suspicious\" hit to Bradley\u2019s missing-persons website, which is professionally monitored for activity, according to The Hollywood Reporter.",
      "The website has reportedly seen an uptick in activity within the Cua\u00e7ao region during family holidays \u2013 prompting investigators to theorize that Bradley could be visiting the site to feel closer to her family, or her captors are monitoring the case.",

      "Perhaps the most notable revelation, however, is new details suggesting Bradley has at least one child, the source told The Hollywood Reporter. While details regarding the possibility of a child remain vague, the source reportedly added Bradley likely gave birth as a result of being forced into sex work.",
      "\"For me, I really would focus on the potential child,\" Valentin told Fox News Digital. \"There\u2019s clearly more details that have not been made public.

      "\"If that child is related, it opens up all sorts of questions,\" Valentin said. \"How did [Bradley] get off the boat? How long did she live when she was off the boat?\"",
      "In 2017, the FBI previously released age-progressing images of Bradley with the hopes of igniting new leads within the search.",
      "Despite the numerous leads, authorities have never charged anyone with a crime relating to Bradley\u2019s disappearance.",

      "According to researchers at American University who track protest movements, and whose findings were first reported by Axios, the typical D.C. attendee was an educated White woman in her 40s who learned about the demonstration through friends or social media.",
      "\"The 'No Kings' movement allows people to feel belonging and community,\" Alpert said. \"Sharing grievances with like-minded people feels good, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily change anything.\"",

      "\"People are craving community, and this gives them a place to channel that. They\u2019re surrounded by others who validate how they feel, and that validation can be addictive,\" he said. \"Some protesters are equating the \u2018No Kings\u2019 movement with the Civil Rights Movement.

      "The thieves made away with a total of eight objects, including a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense. The heist has prompted a national reckoning, with some officials comparing the shock to the 2019\u00a0burning of Notre-Dame cathedral.",

      "The pieces were not insured, which is not uncommon for state collections because of the prohibitive costs, the Times reported, citing France\u2019s culture ministry.

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 09:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "With the cost of health insurance set to rise, some Americans are asking a surprising question: Is it actually cheaper to get medical care without it",
    "story": [
      "With the cost of health insurance set to rise, some Americans are asking a surprising question: Is it actually cheaper to get medical care without it?",
      "The short answer: Sometimes. But not often. And it may require a little \u2014 or a lot \u2014 of homework.",
      "Some hospitals and clinics offer self-pay or cash only discounts for patients who pay without insurance, skipping the paperwork and administrative fees that come with having coverage. Hospitals are required by federal law to make their discounted cash prices publicly available online. An allergy test or an X-ray, for example, may be a few hundred dollars cheaper this way, especially for people with high deductible plans. Nonprofit hospitals must provide charity care, which is free or discounted, to people who can\u2019t afford it, even for those with insurance.",
      "But paying outside of health insurance means that cost doesn\u2019t count toward your deductible or out-of-pocket limit \u2014 and if you end up needing more medical visits than expected, you could wind up worse off financially.",
      "\u201cYou have to be really careful,\u201d said Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cThe price that you pay with cash, even if they give you some sort of advertised discount, can be more than what you might actually pay through health insurance overall.\u201d",
      "The question of whether to opt out of insurance and pay in cash is surfacing as many Americans are expected to face higher premiums next year. Enhanced subsidies, which kept Affordable Care Act premiums lower for many middle-class people, are set to expire at the end of the year without action from Congress. Premiums for people who get their health insurance through their jobs or outside the ACA are also expected to rise next year.",
      "Some ACA enrollees are debating whether to drop their coverage entirely \u2014 a decision that experts warn could leave them exposed to major medical bills if an unexpected emergency hits.",
      "\u201cIf you like Russian roulette, then you\u2019ll like to approach health care this way,\u201d said Michele Johnson, executive director of the Tennessee Justice Center, a law firm and nonprofit advocacy group that helps people dispute medical bills.",
      "Johnson said \u201cpart of the fallacy is that as American consumers, we\u2019re all about, \u2018How do I bargain the best deal?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cHealth care is not this way,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re healthy, you\u2019re basically pushing all the chips out onto the table in hopes that you basically will mostly be healthy.\u201d",
      "Losing benefits",
      "Insurance, for all its frustrations, can provide crucial protections: caps on out-of-pocket costs, access to negotiated rates and free preventive care, such as cancer screenings, annual physicals and routine vaccinations.",
      "For non-emergency care, a doctor or hospital may require the patient who isn\u2019t using insurance to pay the entire cost upfront or see a different provider, said Erin Duffy, director of research training at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics.",
      "\u201cIt does seem risky,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cIf you were thinking that you could keep going to the primary care doctor that you\u2019d go to when you were insured, you might find that there\u2019s different financial obstacles.\u201d",
      "For those who are healthy, paying in cash can be a smart move for predictable, lower cost-services \u2014 such as an X-ray or CT scan, Dusetzina said.",
      "\u201cThis comes up all the time in the prescription drug world,\u201d Dusetzina said. \u201cPeople will often fill generic drugs out of pocket because it happens for them to be cheaper to do that than paying with health insurance in some cases.\u201d",
      "But patients wouldn\u2019t have access to their insurer\u2019s negotiated rate \u2014 the amount an insurance company agrees to pay for a medical service, Dusetzina said. Even if people haven\u2019t reached their deductibles, they still get the negotiated rate, which might be cheaper than paying cash. And whatever they pay wouldn\u2019t go toward their deductible or out-of-pocket limit.",
      "\u201cWhat has historically happened is, if you went to a medical site and you wanted to pay in cash, the price that they start with is often twice as high or more than what the health insurance price would be,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, you do lose the benefit of having a negotiated rate going without health insurance.\u201d",
      "A person\u2019s savings can disappear fast if something unexpected happens, Johnson said. Emergency room visits, hospital stays or surgeries \u2014 even at discounted rates \u2014 can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Uninsured patients are billed the full amount. It\u2019s generally not possible to sign up for health coverage after an emergency has already happened, she said. There\u2019s also a narrow period to enroll; in most states, ACA enrollment is Nov. 1 through Jan. 15. Open enrollment for people who get health insurance through their jobs is generally around the same time.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the only time you can sign up until the next year, so essentially, you\u2019re left holding the bag, not just for emergency visits, but for all the follow-up care,\u201d she said.",
      "Johnson said that before people even think about negotiating care with a doctor or provider, they must first check if they have a federally qualified health center nearby. The health clinics receive federal grants to provide low-cost care to underserved populations, including the underinsured and the uninsured.",
      "\u201cIf you need primary care, you can often get primary care at a federally qualified health center,\u201d she said.",
      "If specialty care is needed, doctors may negotiate, but they often require people to pay the full amount upfront, Johnson said. If you want to get an idea of how much you could pay, websites like Turquoise Health show the average cash price hospitals may charge for certain medical procedures.",
      "If you do get a lower rate from a doctor, the process might not end there, Johnson said. Depending on how complicated the medical procedure is, you may need to get an agreement with the entire health care team involved.",
      "\u201cEven if you have a doctor who says, \u2018I will do this for you,\u2019 then somehow you have to get an anesthesiologist to do it, and you have to get labs to do it, and you have to get nurses doing it as well,\u201d she said.",
      "Duffy said to call the billing office and \u201cask really specific questions about when you would have to pay, what are the full range of options for both assistance and payment plans that could be helpful to someone who\u2019s uninsured or lower income or just facing a bill you might not be able to pay all at once.\u201d",
      "For those in need of emergency care or hospital care, Duffy noted, there is a federal law \u2014 the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act \u2014 which requires Medicare-participating hospitals to provide care to anyone who comes to the emergency department, regardless of their ability to pay.",
      "After that, the person may be able to negotiate with the hospital or provider, or get a payment plan.",
      "None of these strategies are particularly useful for people who are not healthy and are likely to use a high amount of health care, said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.",
      "\u201cThe self-pay option will be most attractive to the healthy and well-off patient, who may forgo adequate health insurance,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "The Russian chess master accused by his peers of bullying Daniel Naroditsky, the U.S. grandmaster who was found dead last week, has himself been hit with unfounded cheating allegations in the past \u2014 a 2006 chess scandal that came to be known as \u201cToiletgate.\u201d",
      "The manager of Vladimir Kramnik\u2019s opponent in that title match, Veselin Topalov, claimed the Russian was using the bathroom up to 50 times per match to surreptitiously look up chess moves on a computer \u2014 a charge that Kramnik\u2019s manager hotly denied.",
      "\u201cIt should also be mentioned that Mr. Kramnik has to drink a lot of water during the games\u201d and likes to pace in the bathroom, Carsten Hansel added, according to news reports.",
      "Kramnik eventually won the match and became the undisputed world champion of chess, but only after agreeing to World Chess Federation (FIDE) demands that he use the same bathroom as his opponent. It was a concession Kramnik initially protested with a sit-in near the bathroom, causing him to forfeit one of the games in the match.",
      "Later, Topalov and his manager were sanctioned by the FIDE Ethics Commission for \u201cmaking unsubstantiated accusations of cheating.\u201d",
      "Kramnik, responding to an NBC News request for comment on the renewed interest in \u201cToiletgate,\u201d said in an email on Friday, \u201cSince I always played fair throughout my career, this insinuation didn\u2019t bother me much, I took it quite lightly.\u201d",
      "Since Kramnik had repeatedly suggested Naroditsky had cheated, his own brush with what turned out to be apparently baseless allegations resurfaced this week in the wake of Naroditsky\u2019s death. A cause of death for Naroditsky has not been announced.",
      "\u201cIt is a bit ironic for someone like Kramnik, who had been accused of cheating, to then turn around and accuse somebody else of cheating,\u201d Erik Allebest, CEO of Chess.com, which is the largest chess platform in the world, said Friday.",
      "Young chess champ found dead",
      "Naroditsky, 29, was found dead Sunday at his home in Charlotte, North Carolina. Police on Thursday said they were investigating his death as a possible suicide or drug overdose.",
      "FIDE said it would investigate whether Kramnik should be disciplined for the disparaging public statements he made \u201cbefore and after the tragic death\u201d of Naroditsky.",
      "During his last livestream on Saturday, Naroditsky told his audience that the cheating claims by Kramnik, whom he once idolized, had taken a toll on him.",
      "\u201cEver since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,\u201d he said.",
      "Chess.com banned Kramnik in 2023 from taking part in prize tournaments after he accused multiple players of cheating, said Allebest.",
      "Kramnik has claimed to be the \u201csubject of a bullying and slandering PR campaign,\u201d as well as ongoing threats to him and his family since Monday. That was when the Charlotte Chess Center in North Carolina, where Naroditsky trained and worked as a coach, announced on social media that he had died.",
      "The Russian has also denied bullying Naroditsky and said in an email Friday that his lawyers were \u201cpreparing a major case against every media resource publishing this false information.\u201d",
      "Do chess players cheat?",
      "Allebest acknowledged there is cheating in competitive chess.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a human thing and it\u2019s the same with any sport,\u201d he said. \u201cFor some the rewards of winning outweigh the cost to their consciences. For some it\u2019s monetary, although it\u2019s rare that the prize money is that big.\u201d",
      "Among other things, Chess.com runs weekly online money matches where players can take home up to $3,000.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not big money,\u201d Allebest said. \u201cMore often, players will be cheating to gain notoriety, to boost their streaming audience, to rise in the rankings and get famous by taking on the best players. It\u2019s a perception thing.\u201d",
      "Those matches, he said, are also closely monitored.",
      "\u201cFor players competing in prize money matches, we have a monitoring program called Proctor that they download that keeps track of what\u2019s going on on their computers,\u201d Allebest said. \u201cWe have front- and rear-facing cameras to monitor the players.\u201d",
      "Now that so much chess is played online, the cheating methods have also gone digital.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll use computer algorithms to determine the best move, they\u2019ll have a second program running on their computer while the game is being played,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes they\u2019ll have somebody sitting next to them with an iPad looking up the best moves.\u201d",
      "So Chess.com looks for red flags.",
      "\u201cWe have statistical models that help us identify possible cheaters,\u201d Allebest said. \u201cFor example, if a new player signs up and suddenly starts winning a lot of games in a row, or whose ranking starts climbing fast, or if we detect other factors that we cannot disclose, we will look into it.\u201d",
      "In its most recent \u201cFair Play Update\u201d from September, Chess.com reported that 125,000 accounts were \u201cclosed for cheating.\u201d",
      "\u2018Painful\u2019 allegations",
      "Starting in October 2024, Kramnik publicly accused Naroditsky of cheating in online chess, suggesting his near-perfect play was \u201cstatistically impossible.\u201d",
      "Allebest said statistics don\u2019t always tell the whole story.",
      "\u201cThe thing that often gets forgotten is that in statistics, lightning does, sometimes, strike twice,\u201d Allebest said. \u201cWhen you have 20 million games being played every day, a one in a million chance thing happens every day. Some players, especially old-guard players who didn\u2019t grow up playing online chess, often find that hard to understand.\u201d",
      "Allebest said he gets why Naroditsky, a child prodigy, might have felt despondent in the face of accusations leveled at him by a world-renowned player like Kramnik.",
      "\u201cIt is painful for players like Danya to be accused of cheating, because since they were young they put in hours and hours and hours of work,\u201d he said, referring to Naroditsky by his nickname. \u201cFor some, that all gets thrown into the garbage by an accusation. For players who view chess as sacred, it hurts them in the soul.\u201d"

    "summary": "Aaron Rodgers will face the Green Bay Packers, the team with whom he spent 18 NFL seasons, on Sunday for the first time since forcing his way out in 2023.",
    "story": [
      "Trailing the Cincinnati Bengals in the final seconds of Week 7 and still nearly 70 yards from the end zone and a potential go-ahead touchdown, the Pittsburgh Steelers were in an unenviable position.",
      "That wasn\u2019t to say they were out of options, however.",
      "Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers bought time, jogged forward to add momentum and heaved his final pass of the night.",
      "It was knocked down incomplete, just out of arm\u2019s reach of a Steelers receiver, but it didn\u2019t diminish the feat of the throw itself, which traveled 69.8 yards, the longest pass attempt since at least 2017, according to NFL tracking data.",
      "The danger of such a Rodgers heave should be familiar to Pittsburgh\u2019s next opponent, Green Bay. While playing 18 seasons with the Packers and winning four MVP honors and one Super Bowl title, Rodgers became known for possessing perhaps the league\u2019s strongest arm, one that helped him complete three Hail Mary attempts with the franchise. When he completed another with the New York Jets in 2024, their coach said they were \u201cfortunate that we have the best Hail Mary thrower in the history of this game.\u201d",
      "When Rodgers plays Green Bay on Sunday for the first time since forcing his way out of the franchise three seasons ago, the Packers will see a quarterback who is diminished from his former MVP form \u2014 yet, from his arm to his ability to spray the ball around the field, remains a viable starting quarterback and has found life after Green Bay.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re asking me this week, \u2018Is it a revenge game?\u2019\u201d Rodgers told reporters this week. \u201cWhat have I got to be avenging here? They paid me a ton of money, I grew up there, and spent some of the best years of my life there and have nothing but love for the organization.\u201d",
      "Last spring, as Rodgers was cut loose by the Jets and entertained only a few suitors in free agency as he mulled whether to return for an 18th season as a starter, and 21st overall, such a development didn\u2019t appear to be a foregone conclusion.",
      "Yet as Rodgers nears his 42nd birthday in December, the oldest active player in the league has helped Pittsburgh to a 4-2 start, and first place in the AFC North.",
      "Packers coach Matt LaFleur dismissed the reunion storyline, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re playing the Pittsburgh Steelers, who happen to have Aaron Rodgers.\u201d But days later, LaFleur was back discussing Rodgers again.",
      "\u201cFor such an old man, he\u2019s still moving around pretty good,\u201d LaFleur told reporters.",
      "But it will be partly about how well the Packers defend a quarterback who has revived his career amid a season that he has said could be his last. Of the 33 quarterbacks this season with at least 100 attempts, Rodgers leads the league in the percentage of his passes that become touchdowns. In an acknowledgement of Rodgers\u2019 decreasing mobility, Pittsburgh designed its offense around exceptionally quick and short passes, and Rodgers has responded with the highest passer rating on throws in 2.5 seconds or less.",
      "He also ranks seventh in completion percentage, ninth in passer rating and has engineered two game-winning drives. Rodgers remains the only quarterback with multiple games of four-plus passing touchdowns.",
      "It has not entirely been a Rodgers revival tour. His interception rate is the league\u2019s fourth highest.",
      "Wins are not a quarterback statistic, yet a team\u2019s success is still deeply intertwined with a quarterback\u2019s success. When Rodgers started, the Packers had a winning percentage of .647; since leaving Green Bay, his winning percentage stands at .416.",
      "The Packers (4-1-1) have had little reason to look back with regret at their decision to acquiesce to Rodgers\u2019 desire to play in New York in 2023. His successor, Jordan Love, led the Packers to playoff berths in each of his first two seasons, while producing none of the off-field headlines that marked the end of Rodgers\u2019 time in Green Bay. And this season, Love has curbed one of his major weaknesses by throwing just two interceptions in six games; at the same point last season, Love had thrown nine.",
      "\u201cObviously would\u2019ve loved to ride off in the sunset after a Super Bowl win [with Green Bay], but that\u2019s not the way the league goes sometimes,\u201d Rodgers told reporters. \u201cI knew the writing was on the wall when Jordan was picked.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew at some point there would be a change, and if I wanted to play, it\u2019d probably have to be elsewhere. So I understand the situation.\u201d",
      "What else we're watching in Week 8",
      "Dolphins (1-6) at Falcons (3-3): Tua Tagovailoa is still the starting quarterback in Miami despite a league-high 10 interceptions. The Dolphins have yet to win on the road this season.",
      "Jets (0-7) at Bengals (3-4): Aaron Glenn is trying to avoid becoming just the fifth coach in the last 20 seasons to lose their first eight games. Cincinnati has scored at least 27 points in six straight games.",
      "Browns (2-5) at Patriots (5-2): Cleveland has lost its last 11 games on the road, the longest active losing streak. With one sack, Myles Garrett will pass Reggie White for the most sacks before turning 30 since sacks started being tracked in 1982.",
      "Giants (2-5) at Eagles (5-2): New York is 0-4 on the road this season and hasn\u2019t won in Philadelphia since 2014. Philadelphia\u2019s offense ranks only 14th in average scoring, but thanks to the \u201ctush-push,\u201d it scores a touchdown on an NFL-high 82% of red-zone trips.",
      "Bills (4-2) at Panthers (4-3): Buffalo averages a league-best 151 rushing yards, while Carolina ranks third, with a 140.1-yard average.",
      "Bears (4-2) at Ravens (1-5): Lamar Jackson, who has participated in practice this week, was ruled out again with a hamstring injury. With a loss, Baltimore would tie for the worst seven-game start in franchise history. If D\u2019Andre Swift gains 100 yards on the ground for a third straight game, it will be the longest streak by a Bears back since Matt Forte in 2013.",
      "49ers (5-2) at Texans (2-4): The Texans are the first team in NFL history to lead the league in fewest points allowed per game through Week 7 but still have a losing record. Every Texans loss has come by one score.",
      "Buccaneers (5-2) at Saints (1-6): The last time New Orleans started 1-7 was 1999. One bright spot: If Alvin Kamara gets two catches, he\u2019ll join LaDainian Tomlinson and Marshall Faulk as the only players with at least 6,000 career rushing yards plus at least 600 catches.",
      "Cowboys (3-3-1) at Broncos (5-2): Dallas has protected quarterback Dak Prescott marvelously, allowing only 1.1 sacks per game, but Denver is the best in the league at getting sacks. More than 13% of Broncos opponents\u2019 plays result in sacks, by far the highest rate in the league.",
      "Titans (1-6) at Colts (6-1): Opposites meet. Indianapolis has outscored opponents by 92 points, 28 more than the next best team. The Titans have been outscored by a league-worst 96 points, meanwhile.",
      "Packers (4-1-1) at Steelers (4-2): Micah Parsons broke through in Week 7, with three sacks. He is averaging the second-most quarterback pressures in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",
      "Commanders (3-4) at Chiefs (4-3): Quarterback Jayden Daniels has already been ruled out with an injury. Patrick Mahomes leads the NFL with 18 touchdowns and has transformed Kansas City into the betting favorite to win the Super Bowl."

      "Craig Melvin wears his heart on his sleeve \u2014 and his taste buds on his face.",
      "Asked if he can name the best thing he\u2019s ever eaten during a TODAY Food segment, Craig visibly flips through his Rolodex of memories, finally shaking his head.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t answer that question because every month or two, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, my God,\u2019\u201d he says, his eyes lighting up.",
      "He\u2019s getting ready to guide an audience through a cooking demo at the TODAY Fan Fest event Taste of TODAY, hosted at Platform by the James Beard Foundation.",
      "Also in attendance, a slew of super-fans watch TODAY Food segments happen in real life, mingle with the anchors and world-class chefs, and enjoy bites from the demos.",
      "\u201cWe had some Korean fried chicken this morning; she\u2019s here tonight,\u201d Craig says of chef Judy Joo and her recipe. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, my God, this is the most amazing Korean fried chicken I\u2019ve ever had.\u2019\u201d",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "Craig adds that earlier in the week, chef Brian Lewis prepared his Herbed Pork Roast during the 3rd Hour, and he thought the same thing: \u201cOh, my God, this is the best pork I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he remembers.",
      "Sheinelle Jones has a similar reaction to another one of Lewis\u2019 dishes that day: the Roasted Beet and Burrata Salad.",
      "\u201cIt was like a beet salad, but it\u2019s not just any beet salad,\u201d she says, waving her hands in the air, emphatically. \u201cIt had fennel and pistachio. It was, like, amazing.\u201d",
      "Alongside anchors Savannah Guthrie, Jenna Bush Hager and Dylan Dreyer, three chefs make their dishes from the \u201cTODAY Loves Food\u201d cookbook. While sampling those foods, attendees are also being served wine, beer and cocktails like Savannah\u2019s Savanita, provided by Diageo, Rockaway Brewing Company and Brooklyn Winery.",
      "On the menu tonight: Ayesha Nurdjaja\u2019s Chicken Shawarma with White Sauce, David Rose\u2019s Ancho Grilled Skirt Steak with Chipotle Chimichurri and Katie Lee Biegel\u2019s Chopped Dill Pickle Salad, all  prepared live for the audience by each chef.",
      "Craig says his favorite thing about food segments is the expertise on display.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just the quality of food,\u201d he says, especially from culinary stars like Siri Daly, Edy Massih and Priyanka Naik, who are all in attendance.\u2029\u201cThe untold part of the TODAY Food story is the TODAY Food team, and they just do a remarkable job.\u201d",
      "He enjoys most things he eats on the show, but every now and again, he tries a dish that\u2019s not his thing \u2014 and his face makes that clear.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t hide it,\u201d Craig admits.",
      "\u201cMy mother has said the same thing. But, listen, I\u2019ll try anything,\u201d he says, adding that not everything is for everyone. \u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten better.\u201d",
      "Sheinelle says she\u2019s taken home food from the show that she really enjoyed, but it\u2019s not always a hit with her kids.",
      "\u201cMy kids don\u2019t like their food to touch, so they\u2019re still in the like, \u2018We like chicken, we like potatoes,\u2019 so sometimes I\u2019ll bring something home, and they\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m not sure.\u201d",
      "But the easiest way to tell if an anchor enjoyed the dish is to take a look at their plate at the end of the segment. If it\u2019s empty, it was a hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m called out on a lot on how much food I\u2019m eating,\u201d Dylan says during the event\u2019s opening remarks. \u201cWhen you\u2019re surrounded by the best-of-the best chefs, you want to taste their food.",
      "\u201cAnd then my mom\u2019s texting me after, \u2018Was that really as good as you made it sound? Should I try that recipe?\u2019 and I say, \u2018Yes, you have to try that recipe.\u2019\u201d"

Meanwhile Clara, heartbroken by the death of her father and aunt, embarks on a relationship with Miller (Mason Thames), a boy from her school.",

      "Jonah realizes that even if he is not Elijah's biological father, he loves him and wants to raise him as his son. Jonah runs to Morgan's house and apologizes for leaving Elijah and promises to never leave again.",

Eventually, it's revealed that when they were teenagers, Jonah had asked Morgan if \"they had it wrong,\" implying he thought he and Morgan were supposed to be together, instead of Morgan and Chris, and Jenny and Jonah.",
      "Does Clara Find out About the Affair?",
      "One of the first scenes of the movie establishes the close relationship between Clara and her aunt Jenny. While running late for family dinner, Clara calls Jenny to tell her a story about Miller, a boy from school who later becomes her boyfriend. She ends the call by saying, \"Don't tell my mom.\"",
      "Their mother-daughter relationship is also strained by Clara\u2019s dreams of studying acting, which Morgan doesn\u2019t believe is a responsible choice.",
      "So when Morgan uncovers the affair, she tells Jonah that Clara can never find out about it, as she does not want to ruin Clara's memories of her dad and aunt.",
      "When Clara arrives home one evening and walks in on Morgan and Jonah sharing their first kiss, she storms into her room upset. Unaware of their shared history, Clara assumes that her mom and her aunt's fianc\u00e9 had moved on.",
      "Clara avoids her mother for a few days, until one morning when Morgan helps her overcome a hangover. As they are sitting at the kitchen table, Morgan finally reveals to Clara that Chris and Jenny had been having an affair.",

      "Miller and Clara are overjoyed to be attending the same college, and he plays a short film that he made for Clara. In the film, Miller shows videos of him and Clara from the past year, and he asks Clara to be his date to prom.",
      "After the film, Morgan pulls Clara aside to say she supports her dream to study acting in college, despite her initial doubts. Morgan tells Clara she has an incredible talent, and that she will be able to succeed. The mother and daughter finally embrace."

That\u2019s exactly how the experiment is supposed to work, so I would say not only is the experiment working, I think it\u2019s working better than ever,\" he said."

She was also elected by upper house lawmakers in a second vote of 125-46 after falling one vote shy of a majority in the first round.",
      "Though her election is a milestone in a country where women are severely underrepresented in government, Takaichi enters office with a fragile coalition and facing a number of pressing challenges, including a visit next week by President Donald Trump.",
      "Takaichi, who says her hero is former British conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, has appointed two other women to her Cabinet, the same as the previous government. They include Satsuki Katayama, Japan\u2019s first female finance minister.",
      "\u201cI place great importance on equal opportunity, equal chances. And also participation from people from all walks of life,\u201d Takaichi said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cI formed my Cabinet with this idea in mind, bringing together the combined strength of all generations.\u201d",
      "But Takaichi\u2019s victory is not necessarily a victory for women in general, critics say, especially after she secured it by forming an alliance with an Osaka-based party that will pull her coalition even further to the right.",
      "\u201cOne would like to say this is a historic moment in Japan,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hard to make that case, given her rather poor track record on empowering women.\u201d",
      "Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage and favors keeping succession to men only in Japan\u2019s shrinking imperial family. She also opposes changing the rules to make it easier for married women to keep their maiden names in Japan, where married couples are required to have the same surname.",
      "Progress toward gender equality has been slow in Japan, where women are far outnumbered at the highest levels of business and government and bear a disproportionate responsibility for child care and household chores.",
      "Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report. It noted that women make up less than 16% of Japanese lawmakers in the lower house of parliament and 10% of government ministers.",
      "After Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP earlier this month, Japanese feminist author Chizuko Ueno said that the prospect of Japan getting its first female prime minister \u201cdoesn\u2019t make me happy.\u201d",
      "Takaichi \u201csees herself as the Japanese version of Thatcher,\u201d Ueno, 77, said in a post on X. \u201cBritish feminists, who inherited Thatcher, have no illusions about women in leadership positions.\u201d",
      "She noted Takaichi\u2019s opposition to allowing separate surnames for married couples even as she has kept her own maiden name. Though Takaichi changed her legal name in 2004 when she first married Taku Yamamoto, she continued to use her maiden name professionally until they divorced in 2017, in line with legislation she had proposed.",
      "When they remarried in 2021, Yamamoto, a former LDP lawmaker, changed his legal surname to Takaichi.",
      "Takaichi \u2014 who in her youth rode motorcycles and played the drums in a heavy metal band \u2014 has pushed for greater support for women\u2019s health. She has talked about her personal struggles with symptoms of menopause and the importance of raising awareness \u201cso that men can properly understand when women are struggling, whether at school or in the workplace.\u201d",
      "But her campaign was focused mainly on the economy and national defense.",
      "Takaichi is a veteran politician who has served as minister of economic security, internal affairs and gender equality. A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, she advocates tougher immigration policies, the revision of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution and higher defense spending.",
      "Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock exchange closed at an all-time high for the second day in a row Tuesday, on hopes that Takaichi\u2019s policies might help jumpstart the economy.",
      "Earlier this month Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since World War II, after running unsuccessfully in 2021 and 2024. In her victory speech, she underlined her commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cI myself will throw out the term \u2018work-life balance,\u2019\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cI will work and work and work and work and work.\u201d",
      "Her ascension to prime minister was thrown into doubt, however, after a crucial partner, the centrist party Komeito, left the LDP coalition.",
      "To ensure her victory, the LDP signed a deal Monday with the Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin, a far-right party based in Osaka.",
      "Even with the alliance, Takaichi faces an uphill battle in parliament, where she falls short of a majority in both houses after the LDP suffered major losses in recent elections amid voter anger over party corruption scandals and the rising cost of living. Her premiership could thus end up being short-lived \u2014 much like that of her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, who was in office for a year.",
      "\u201cShe emerges from this a diminished leader from the get-go,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Takaichi also faces an early test next week with the arrival of Trump, who is making his first trip to Asia since returning to office. He is expected to visit Malaysia and Japan before continuing on to South Korea, which is hosting a major summit of Asia-Pacific economies.",
      "\u201cI will deepen the relationship of trust between us leaders through frank exchanges of views not only on bilateral issues but also on the challenges facing Japan and the United States, ranging from issues in the Indo-Pacific region to the situation in the Middle East, Europe, and Ukraine,\u201d Takaichi said at the news conference.",
      "But Kingston cautioned that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a whole lot of time to get ready for a slew of diplomatic activity,\u201d adding he thought \u201cjob one is the Japanese economy.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 The heist cut through hushed corridors with a speed and ease that humiliated a nation. Authorities are now racing against their own clock.",
      "In the space of just seven minutes in the casual daylight of Sunday morning, four suspects stole nine pieces of France\u2019s crown jewels from the Louvre. They robbed not just the most visited museum in the world, but also the French people themselves, the government said Monday.",
      "Officials are now scrambling to reassure the public about security at key cultural sites \u2014 and find the jewels stolen from the museum before they can be broken up and melted down.",
      "The thieves used a monte-meubles \u2014 a truck mounted with a basket lift, commonly used to hoist furniture into Paris' inaccessible apartment blocks.",
      "They parked it outside the sprawling renaissance palace, rode to the balcony outside the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, and sliced through the window with cutting tools, according to officials.",
      "Their daring heist pierced the nation\u2019s self-image, too.",
      "Threatening museum staff with their angle-grinders, the otherwise unarmed thieves then smashed through two display cases, taking necklaces, tiaras and brooches from France\u2019s now dispatched royal families, officials said.",
      "This all played out just after the museum had opened, with bystanders able to video one suspect in a high-visibility vest standing at one of the glass boxes housing historical treasures.",
      "Investigators say they are puzzled why the culprits left behind the colossal, 140-carat Regent diamond, which has been valued at $60 million. Had they wandered down that opulent corridor, they would have reached the Mona Lisa \u2014 itself infamously stolen more than a century ago.",
      "As it was, they made off on two scooters, but not before they dropped two items, including the Crown of Empress Eug\u00e9nie, empress to Napoleon III in the 19th century, which was found broken near the scene, officials said.",
      "That item alone is \"worth several tens of millions of euros,\" Alexandre Giquello, president of France's leading Drouot auction house, told the Reuters news agency. \"And it's not, in my opinion, the most important item\" taken by the burglars.",
      "Some experts have said that because the items are unique they cannot be sold, and so the thieves will likely try to melt down their metals and break up their emeralds, sapphires, diamonds and pearls. That means investigators might have less than a week before the jewels are lost forever.",
      "The incident saw the Louvre shuttered Sunday and again Monday morning, with bewildered crowds evacuated from the area just after the assailants had struck.",
      "For a nation whose character is defined by proud displays of history and culture, the incident is being seen in some quarters as a national humiliation.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron called it \u201can attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history.\u201d He vowed to \u201crecover the works and the perpetrators will be brought to justice,\u201d adding that \u201ceverything is being done, everywhere, to achieve this.\u201d",
      "The Culture and Interior ministries held an emergency meeting Monday and agreed to ask senior officials across France \u201cto immediately assess the existing security measures already in place around cultural institutions, and to strengthen them if necessary,\u201d the Interior Ministry said, according to Reuters.",
      "Justice Minister Gerard Darmanin said the heist gave a \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cdeplorable\u201d image of France. \u201cWhat is certain is that we failed,\u201d he told the radio station France Inter. \u201cThe French people all feel like they\u2019ve been robbed.\u201d",
      "One of Macron\u2019s main political opponents, Jordan Bardella, the far-right leader who is favorite to replace him at the next presidential election in 2027, cast the crime as another example of \u201cthe disintegration of the state\u201d under Macron, and \u201can unbearable humiliation for our country.\u201d",
      "It is not the first time the Louvre has been targeted by thieves.",
      "In 1911, a museum decorator named Vincenzo Peruggia stole the Mona Lisa. And more recently French museums have been hit with a spate of thefts, including raw gold stolen from the National Museum of Natural History and porcelain works reportedly worth around $11 million taken from the Adrien Dubouche Museum in Limoges last month.",
      "After the theft at the Louvre, the union SUD Culture blamed \"destruction of jobs dedicated to security\" and funding shortfalls for security equipment.",
      "That hints at the wider disquiet percolating in France.",
      "Macron has seen multiple governments collapse as he tries to staunch the rise of Bardella\u2019s National Rally. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest at public spending cuts.",
      "Now, authorities have another crisis at their door.",
      "Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on BFM TV that if the heist was commissioned by a collector, then there is a chance of getting the items back in their original condition.",
      "However, if not, the leading Dutch art detective Arthur Brand told Sky News that the police \"have a week\" before the jewels vanish forever.",
      "\"These crown jewels are so famous, you just cannot sell them,\" he said. \"The only thing they can do is melt the silver and gold down, dismantle the diamonds, try to cut them. That's the way they will probably disappear forever.\"",
      "\"It's a race against time.\"",

      "Executives praised the film, which follows the Palestine Red Crescent Society\u2019s failed attempt to save Hind, a Palestinian child  who was killed in Gaza in 2024 after being trapped in a car under Israeli fire. But not a single major studio or streamer made an offer on the movie, the official Oscar submission of the Tunisian Culture Ministry, Ben Hania said.",
      "\u201cPeople never say, \u2018I\u2019m afraid to pick up a movie,\u2019\u201d Ben Hania said. \u201cMaybe they are. I don\u2019t know. They can\u2019t openly talk about it, because it\u2019s a shame to be afraid of talking about the killing of a child.\u201d",
      "Four movies that tell stories about Palestinian people, set from 1936 to 2024, are competing for this year\u2019s Academy Award for best international feature, just as a ceasefire takes hold in the region.

Three of them are slated to run at the American Film Institute Festival in Los Angeles this week.",
      "Despite interest at the start of filming, and in some cases A-list backers, none of these films have secured a deal with a major studio or streamer, which is uncommon when a title receives buzz overseas.

      "The batch of movies arrives as the crisis in the Gaza Strip remains a flashpoint issue in the entertainment industry. More than 5,000 film and television professionals have signed on to a boycott of Israeli film institutions, while two studios, Paramount and Warner Bros.. have condemned the boycott. Just as some in Hollywood have worried about saying the wrong thing in a social media post or a red carpet interview, others have been vocal, like Javier Bardem, who wore a keffiyeh to the Emmy Awards in September and openly criticized the war in interviews on the red carpet, or Amy Schumer, who posted frequently on her Instagram account calling for the release of the Israeli hostages.",
      "Foreign films that get picked up for distribution often land with smaller independent companies, limiting the films to a few cities and small marketing budgets. International films have also long struggled with marketing to English-speaking audiences with non-English language films.",
      "Multiple distributors declined to comment on the record about why studios aren\u2019t buying the movies about Palestinians, but studio sources said either that their slates were already full or that the movies don\u2019t seem likely to draw large audiences to theaters.",
      "Without a major distributor, it can be hard for films from the region to demonstrate theatrical potential. But last year\u2019s Oscar-winning \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a documentary about a Palestinian community in the occupied West Bank, shows both an appetite among American audiences for Palestinian stories and the complex issues these films face.",
      "When \u201cNo Other Land\u201d failed to close a theatrical deal in North America, producers paid to release it in theaters themselves, collecting $2.5 million domestically, enough to make theirs the third highest grossing documentary of the year so far, after films featuring Taylor Swift and Led Zeppelin. The filmmakers then turned down an offer to stream on U.S. platforms from Mubi, citing the London company\u2019s backing from Sequoia Capital, which also invests in an Israeli defense tech startup called Kela. (In August, Mubi\u2019s CEO responded to backlash about Sequoia financing by saying that the profits Mubi generates \u201cdo not fund any other companies in Sequoia\u2019s portfolio.\u201d)",
      "For the filmmakers working in the region over the past two years, it\u2019s been a long, arduous road to reach audiences, as the war impacted their physical productions and made potential distributors wary of facing political backlash for releasing their films.",
      "Seeking to fill what they see as a void in the marketplace, Palestinian-American brothers and producers Hamza and Badi Ali formed their own company, Watermelon Pictures, in April 2024. The duo also tapped model Alana Hadid as Watermelon\u2019s creative director and unofficial brand ambassador.",
      "\u201cTruthfully, we wish there was more competition,\u201d Hamza Ali  said. \u201cIt is almost like all of the pressure is on us to release these films and we feel obligated to do so. We hope that distributors of all sizes will start to engage.\u201d",

      "Over a year since the company\u2019s launch, the Ali brothers said that when they meet with executives at larger studios and streamers about buying films on Palestinian people, the buyers defer to higher ranking executives, citing the sensitivity of the subject matter, and effectively ending any conversation about a deal.",
      "For some directors, the barriers have come from their own governments.",
      "In Israel, filmmaker Shai Carmeli-Pollack won the country\u2019s version of the Oscar for \u201cThe Sea,\u201d the Ophir Award, only to have the Israeli government condemn the film and pull funding for the organization that granted the award. Each country chooses its own film to submit for Oscar consideration, and in Israel, the winner of best film at the Ophir Awards is automatically the country\u2019s submission.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised,\u201d said Carmeli-Pollack, whose film is about a 12-year-old Palestinian boy who wants to join a school trip to the beach. \u201cI\u2019m not the first film that they attacked. In a way, they saved us a lot of explaining to the world that we do not represent this government.\u201d",

(The film features a soldier questioning a Palestinian boy and his father as they are trying to go to the beach).",
      "Carmeli-Pollack shot his movie in the West Bank in the summer of 2023, and he said he saw distributors\u2019 enthusiasm for it evaporate after the Oct. 7 attacks. \u201cThe Sea\u201d is now being released in the U.S. by Menemsha Films, a small Los Angeles-based company that distributes a variety of Jewish films.",

      "Dabis, whose movie she said is backed by a mix of European and Arab financing, ended up shooting in Greece, Cyprus and Jordan, telling the fraught history of the region through three generations of one family who were expelled from Jaffa in 1948.",
      "\u201cPalestine 36\u201d director Annemarie Jacir was also scheduled to shoot her historical drama in October 2023 in the West Bank, with a cast that includes British actor Jeremy Irons and Palestinian actress Hiam Abbass.",

      "\u201cThe first message is Trump the peacemaker. The second is Trump the moneymaker,\u201d said Victor Cha of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cAnd then, of course, with the meeting with China, I think what everybody\u2019s expecting is that there\u2019s probably not going to be a big trade deal, but there will be an effort to de-escalate or put a pause on the situation.\u201d",
      "Trade is expected to dominate the week. Aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump said he would subsidize U.S. farmers if he did not reach a deal with China, and that he planned to discuss the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war with Xi, saying he\u2019d like to see China \u201chelp us out.\u201d",

Trump said he also expects to discuss Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us,\u201d Trump said Friday, adding that he expects \u201ca good meeting\u201d even as he has intermittently threatened to call it off over trade frictions, including China\u2019s halt to purchases of U.S. soybeans.",

      "The Trump administration has been pushing Japan to buy more American cars, including as part of a trade deal announced in July that imposed a 15% tariff on Japanese autos and auto parts. A joint statement on the agreement published last month said Japan would allow vehicles built and certified for safety in the U.S. to be sold in the country without additional testing.",

      "Despite the advocacy by Trump, large, expensive American cars have long been a hard sell in Japan, where roads are typically smaller and narrower than their American counterparts.",
      "\u201cFully-sized pickups simply wouldn\u2019t fit on Japanese roads and into the standard pay parking lots,\u201d Mike Smitka, a member of GERPISA, an international network dedicated to the global automobile industry, told NBC News.",

Those advising the current administration to adopt such measures should ask themselves whom they are really serving.\"",
      "The Russian leader said that he understood the U.S. wished to \"cancel or postpone\" the planned Budapest summit, adding that \"for both me and the U.S. president, it would be a mistake to approach this lightly and then walk away without the expected result.\"",

      "The sanctions have been received in Russia as another flip-flop by Trump, who has tried to strong-arm both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at different times during his second term.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. president has changed his tune once again,\u201d wrote Komsomolskaya Pravda, Putin\u2019s favorite newspaper. Another paper, Moskovskij Komsomolets, likened the U.S. president to a \u201cKolobok,\u201d a scheming bread bun from Slavic folklore.",
      "Trump has often expressed verbal frustration with Putin, accusing him of making positive diplomatic noises before bombing Ukrainian civilians again, but until now had avoided taking direct action.",
      "This week, he said that meeting with Putin would be a \"waste of time,\" after Russia rejected the American demand that a ceasefire come before talks.",
      "\u201cWe canceled the meeting with President Putin; it just didn\u2019t feel right to me,\u201d Trump said at a White House gathering of reporters. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it, but we\u2019ll do it in the future.\u201d",
      "The sanctions drew praise from Ukraine and its supporters.",
      "\u201cWe waited for this. God bless, it will work. And this is very important,\u201d Zelenskyy said in Brussels.",
      "This is far from the first time that Russia has been punished like this. Under the administration of President Joe Biden, the U.S., along with the European Union and others, tried to squeeze Russia\u2019s banking and energy sectors, attempting to isolate it from the global market.",
      "This did cause Russia some pain, with its oil and gas revenues declining after the initial measure introduced in 2022. However, it has been able to avoid the worst of it, with its 3.6% economic growth in 2024 outpacing even the U.S.\u2019 2.8%. It did this by increasing sales to China and India, and using its so-called \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of vessels to carry exports in off-book moves.",
      "These ships were the target of new E.U. sanctions announced Thursday, which also sought to hit Russian energy and the ability of its diplomats to move freely in Europe.",
      "Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, was bullish about Russia\u2019s ability to weather these moves, as it has done before.",
      "The measures \u201cwill not cause any particular difficulties,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country has developed a strong immunity to Western restrictions and will continue to steadily strengthen its economic and energy potential.\u201d",
      "Western analysts said the picture was more nuanced.",
      "\"Russia is extremely skilled at avoiding the consequences of Western sanctions,\" Brett Bruen, the director of global engagement in the Obama White House and a career American diplomat, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly a new threshold,\u201d said Fabrice Pothier, NATO\u2019s former director of policy planning who is now the CEO of Rasmussen Global, a consultancy based in Copenhagen, Denmark. But \u201cthe Russian economy has shown its capacity to adapt and reposture itself, especially with Asian economies, starting with China and India.\u201d",
      "So that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a game changer,\u201d he said of the new sanctions, \u201cbut it means it\u2019s just putting more cost on Putin\u2019s actions. Whether the cost is going to be high enough for him to change, I doubt it. It will probably take more.\u201d",
      "Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who served in the Biden administration, called the U.S. sanctions a \u201cheartening move.\u201d Eddie Fishman, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, agreed in that \u201cthis is a big step.\u201d",
      "However, he and others said that success of the sanctions would depend on two things: How strictly the U.S. is willing and able to enforce them; and whether it decides to take any actions on other countries buying Russian energy, namely the two Asian giants propping up Moscow so far.",
      "\u201cThis won\u2019t seriously deprive Putin of his war dollars unless we sanction the eight refineries that buy the oil in China, India,\u201d said Bill Browder, an American-born investment fund manager and key Putin critic.",
      "\u201cTrump does not feel beholden in the same way that Biden was not touching third rails,\" said Bruen \u2014 using the \"third rail\" metaphor to describe Trump's willingness to grapple with previously \"untouchable\" foreign policy issues.",
      "\"And so if he is willing to use secondary sanctions, with more aggressive steps such as expanding the radius of where Ukraine can use Western weapons, all of that will mount pressure on Putin.\u201d",
      "Separately, two Russian aircraft flying from Kaliningrad violated Lithuanian airspace near Kybartai on Thursday, two Lithuanian officials told NBC News.",
      "A Russian SU-30 fighter aircraft and an IL-78 refueling aircraft flew into Lithuanian territory at about 700 meters and fled after having been in Lithuanian airspace for about 18 seconds, they said.",
      "Two Spanish fighters called Eurofighter Typhoons were dispatched as part of the NATO air police mission and flew to the site of the violation.",
      "The officials said the NATO air mission worked, and both praised their efforts. They also said Lithuanian government leaders are discussing a possible response.",
      "The Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Ministry summoned the Russian charge d\u2019affaires to protest the airspace violation. There was no immediate reaction from the Russian Defense Ministry.",
      "Several European countries have in recent months accused Russia of violating their airspace with jets and drones as part of a broader effort to test NATO\u2019s military response measures. The Russian Defense Ministry has denied illegally violating European airspace."

    "story": [
      "Top U.S. officials have hit out at the Israeli parliament's move toward annexing the already occupied West Bank, labeling it an \u201cinsult\u201d that could damage Washington's efforts to keep the Gaza ceasefire on track and build toward a more lasting peace deal.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said Thursday that if the vote in the Knesset was a \u201cpolitical stunt, it was a very stupid political stunt, and I personally took some insult to it.\u201d Speaking with reporters, Vance called the vote \u201cweird\u201d and said, \u201cWe certainly weren\u2019t happy about it.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio separately warned Wednesday night as he prepared to depart for Israel that the Knesset's actions could imperil President Donald Trump's plan to end the conflict. Rubio was set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later Thursday.",
      "A bill seeking to apply Israeli law to the West Bank, a move seen as amounting to annexation of the land that Palestinians view as part of a future state, gained preliminary approval from Israel\u2019s parliament earlier Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a vote in the Knesset, but obviously I think the president\u2019s made clear that\u2019s not something we\u2019d be supportive of right now,\u201d Rubio told reporters late Wednesday on the tarmac.",
      "Vance, meanwhile, maintained that \"the West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel,\" adding that that was the \"policy of the Trump administration\" and that it would \"continue to be our policy.\"",
      "In a statement after their comments, Netanyahu's office said Thursday that the vote was a \"deliberate political provocation by the opposition to sow discord\" during Vance's visit to Israel.",
      "It said Netanyahu's Likud party did not vote for the bills, except for one \"disgruntled\" member who it said was recently fired from the chairmanship of a Knesset committee. \"Without Likud support these bills are unlikely to go anywhere,\" it said.",
      "Trump said weeks ago that he would not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. The vote was the first of four needed to pass the law, according to Reuters.",
      "Time magazine reported that Trump said in an interview over the phone last week that Israel \u201cwould lose all of its support\u201d from the United States if it annexed the West Bank.",
      "\"It won\u2019t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries,\" he said. \"It will not happen. Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.\"",
      "Rubio was the latest U.S. official to make his way to Israel in recent days, on the heels of Vance, Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "On Wednesday, Vance sought to emphasize that U.S. officials were not flocking to Israel to babysit the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip after a flare-up in violence raised fears the truce could collapse. He stressed that Israel was a partner, not a \u201cvassal state,\u201d as questions around the next steps in Trump\u2019s peace plan grew.",
      "Flashes of violence in Gaza in recent days have threatened to unravel the truce deal, with both Israel and Hamas trading accusations that the other side had violated the fragile ceasefire. The two sides also clashed over delays in returning hostage bodies held by Hamas and ongoing barriers to aid access in the enclave.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast War, and it has defended the expansion of settlements in the West Bank, but much of the international community views them as illegal.",
      "A rise in settler violence and the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank have been viewed as directly imperiling the Palestinian cause and as major impediments to resolving the decadeslong conflict.",
      "\u201cThis is a complex part of the world,\u201d Rubio said Wednesday. \u201cI think every day is going to bring opportunities and it\u2019s also going to bring some challenges, OK? We\u2019re dealing with decades and decades of this stuff.\u201d",
      "Despite warning of the impact the Knesset\u2019s moves toward annexation could have on peace efforts, Rubio still projected optimism over the future of the current ceasefire deal.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s more work to be done, and we know that,\u201d he said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThis is a historic peace deal that President Trump delivered on, and now we have to make sure that it continues and that we continue to build upon it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Music met medicine when a patient played a clarinet solo as she underwent brain surgery for Parkinson's disease and proved that the treatment was working in real time.",
      "Denise Bacon, 65, saw her finger movements improve instantly during four hours of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery \u2014 all while staying awake and performing on the musical instrument, London's King\u2019s College Hospital said in a news release Tuesday.",
      "The retired speech and language therapist was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s in 2014, She has since suffered difficulties walking, swimming, dancing and playing her beloved clarinet as the  progressive neurological disorder that affects movement has taken hold of her body.",
      "To help Bacon get these abilities back, Keyoumars Ashkan, professor of neurosurgery, performed DBS on her, implanting electrodes in Bacon's brain and tracking her body\u2019s reaction in real time.",
      "\u201cStimulating electrodes are placed into the deep structures of the brain,\u201d Ashkan said in the hospital\u2019s news release, adding that it was \u201ca long-established procedure to improve motor symptoms in patients with movement disorders.\u201d",
      "Although the brain itself has no pain receptors, Bacon was given local anesthetic to numb her scalp and skull, as doctors made holes half the size of a small coin in her skull and implanted the stimulating electrodes inside.",
      "A pulse generator, similar to a pacemaker, was then connected to the electrodes to send targeted electrical signals to the brain.",
      "\u201cAs a keen clarinetist, it was suggested Denise bring her clarinet into the operating theatre to see whether the procedure would improve her ability to play, which was one of Denise\u2019s main goals for the surgery,\u201d Ashkan said.",
      "An amateur musician, Bacon played the instrument with the East Grinstead Concert Band until Parkinson\u2019s symptoms made it impossible for her to continue five years ago.",
      "However, as she played during the surgery, she noticed an immediate improvement in her hand movements.",
      "\u201cI remember my right hand being able to move with much more ease once the stimulation was applied, and this in turn improved my ability to play the clarinet, which I was delighted with,\u201d she said in the news release.",
      "Brain surgeries usually require general anesthesia, but certain procedures require the patient to be awake so doctors can ensure they aren't damaging vital brain functions.",
      "It is not the first procedure of this kind to be performed by Ashkan at King\u2019s College Hospital. In 2020, a violinist played jazz classics as a tumor was removed from her brain.",
      "Bacon also said she had seen early progress in her walking and is now looking forward to returning to activities such as swimming and dancing.",
      "For the next 20 years, the chest-implanted pulse generator will help Bacon by constantly delivering electrical impulses, and giving her the chance to return to the hobbies and passions she loves, King\u2019s College Hospital said in the release."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 As the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown narrows paths to entry for foreign science and technology workers, China is opening its doors wider \u2014 and drawing backlash from the public.",
      "The new \u201cK visa,\u201d which launched Oct. 1, aims to make it easier for the world\u2019s top young talents in science and technology to live and work longer in China as it vies with the United States for global dominance in the fields.",
      "The new category requires no job offer, with the only requirements being an as-yet-unspecified age cap and having at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in science, technology, engineering or math from a top Chinese or foreign university, or relevant teaching or research experience there.",
      "Though many of the details have yet to be announced, the new Chinese visa program is already drawing interest in India, where China is seen as an increasingly appealing destination amid warming relations and the Trump administration\u2019s surprise announcement last month that it is raising the fee for the equivalent H-1B worker visa to $100,000.",
      "Beijing\u2019s talent-friendly move could also give it a boost amid continuing trade tensions and tech rivalries with Washington, which has imposed export controls on chips and other advanced technology that are spurring China to develop its own.",
      "But the new visa scheme has not gone over so well with young job seekers in China, who face intense competition even as universities churn out millions of new graduates a year amid an economic slowdown. Unemployment among people ages 16 to 24, excluding students, was at 17.7% last month, according to government figures released Wednesday.",
      "People worry that foreign talents may turn an \u201calready fiercely competitive job market even harsher,\u201d said Geng Xiangshun, a Beijing-based commentator experienced in youth career counseling.",
      "\u201cChina already has an abundant, even surplus, supply of highly educated young talent,\u201d Geng wrote in a post on the popular social media platform Weibo. \u201cSince these local talented individuals aren\u2019t even fully employed yet, why do we need to bring in foreign bachelor-degree holders?\u201d",
      "Loosening restrictions",
      "Chinese work visas generally come with strict, complex requirements and allow limited stays for a small group of high-end applicants who are sponsored by employers. Immigrating to China is difficult, and there are many obstacles to living and working there long-term.",
      "Consequently, China is less attractive for foreign professionals than many advanced economies with skilled migration policies, experts say.",
      "Only about 950,000 foreigners work in China, making up just 0.12% of the country\u2019s labor force of about 775 million, according to the Chinese Science and Technology Ministry. In contrast, foreign-born workers accounted for more than 19% of the U.S. civilian work force in 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "The new visa aims to loosen restrictions and enhance China\u2019s global appeal, promising more generous terms such as longer validity periods and multiple entries.",
      "Though China is a relative \u201clatecomer\u201d with this initiative, it represents an \u201cupgrade\u201d to China\u2019s existing talent schemes, said Liu Guofu, a law professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology.",
      "Notably, the new visa does not require employer sponsorship or invitation, resembling \u201cindependent skilled immigration,\u201d Liu said.",
      "However, Liu stressed that Beijing\u2019s new talent scheme, which was announced in early August, \u201cbears little direct relation\u201d to President Donald Trump\u2019s shake-up of the H-1B visa fees, which was announced several weeks later.",
      "With the visa\u2019s focus on early-career STEM talents, Beijing is pivoting away from repatriating Chinese scientists and selectively inviting senior foreign experts, said Denis Simon, a leading expert on U.S.-China science and technology affairs.",
      "\u201cBy codifying a youth-focused, flexible entry channel, Beijing is normalizing inbound STEM mobility as part of its innovation strategy,\u201d Simon said.",
      "It offers a \u201clower-friction alternative\u201d for foreign STEM talents who may be frustrated by the higher U.S. fee for H-1B visas, he added, noting that more than 70% of H-1B visa holders are from India.",
      "\u201cEven small diversions of applicants can shift the geography of labs and startups at the margin \u2014 precisely where innovation clusters are won,\u201d Simon said.",
      "Public backlash",
      "Beijing\u2019s K visa has been met with strong backlash on Chinese social media, where commenters complained of a lack of transparency and public discussion in policymaking.",
      "Matthew Ma, 18, a freshman majoring in integrated circuits in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing, said he was \u201cquite surprised\u201d that he had read \u201cnothing\u201d about the new visa in the two months since it was announced.",
      "\u201cThe biggest misstep they took in this whole process was not giving out enough information in time,\u201d Ma said. \u201cAnd this is, I think, the major reason why people are so angry about this visa.\u201d",
      "Others are angered that the visa requires only an undergraduate STEM degree, saying that is setting the bar too low at a time when young people in China feel pressured to rack up advanced degrees in order to compete with their peers in the job market.",
      "Social media has also been flooded with racist and xenophobic comments, especially about Indians, amid fears that an influx of foreigners could erode national identity in China, where the population has fallen for the past three consecutive years.",
      "In a strongly worded editorial last month, China\u2019s state-run People\u2019s Daily newspaper dismissed such concerns as \u201cstrange,\u201d \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201cmisleading.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo secure its future, China must attract and utilize the best minds from around the globe,\u201d it said, noting that there is a projected shortage of nearly 30 million skilled workers in the country\u2019s key manufacturing sectors this year alone.",
      "\u201cSuch talents are in high demand, and the more we have, the better,\u201d it added. \u201cThe K visa is just to facilitate young foreign science and tech talents to work and live in China. It shouldn\u2019t be equated with immigration.\u201d"

      "Myanmar, where the civilian government was overthrown in a military coup in 2021, is notorious for cybercrime. The Southeast Asian nation is embroiled in a civil war with various ethnic groups fighting the military, creating an almost lawless situation in many parts of the country and allowing scam operations to thrive.",
      "Workers in the scam compounds are often trafficked from third countries, usually under the pretense of a lucrative job offer, and then forced to scam people online with investment pitches or romantic ploys.",
      "Following international pressure, particularly from neighboring Thailand and China, whose nationals have also been trafficked to work in these compounds, the junta \u2014 working alongside the same armed ethnic groups it opposes \u2014 launched a massive operation in February and released hundreds of workers.",
      "The practice is also well documented in other countries around the region such as Cambodia, where the U.S. last week seized more than $14 billion in bitcoin and formally charged the chairman of a Cambodian conglomerate over his alleged involvement in a massive cryptocurrency scam.",
