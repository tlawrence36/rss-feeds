      "Hollywood megastar Tom Hardy has reunited with director Guy Ritchie 17 years after \u201cRocknRolla\u201d for a new TV series, \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tom Hardy has collected troves of knowledge and skill throughout his journey as an actor, forming a megastar career. But any education he received from director Guy Ritchie during their time on the 2008 \u201cRocknRolla\u201d film was gained from afar.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have very much to do with him ... the first time I worked with him. Gerard (Butler) was leading that film and in many elements, we were support staff,\u201d said Hardy. \"So, I got to experience being on the Guy Ritchie set, and it was a bit from a position of not being a lead, and that\u2019s a different responsibility.\u201d",
      "But time can bring people and experiences back around, especially in Hollywood. Since that film 17 years ago, Ritchie has transitioned into esteemed directorial status. And Hardy has morphed into a box office superstar with films like \u201cThe Dark Night\u201d as the imposing villain Bane, and the titular role for Marvel\u2019s \u201cVenom\u201d franchise. Now, the two have reunited for Ritchie\u2019s gritty, yet sophisticated series \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really keen to go back and work with him because he\u2019s a fellow Brit and he\u2019s done quite incredible work,\u201d explained Hardy. \u201cI wanted to go and play with him, actually, and see what that was like now I\u2019m older, and it was good fun.\u201d",
      "The Paramount+ original series follows Harry Da Souza (Hardy), an intimidating, yet calm fixer for a London-based crime family hoping to find the missing son of a rival faction to prevent a catastrophic gang war.",
      "How did Hardy prepare to play such a menacing, yet even-keeled character?",
      "\u201cNo acting required\u201d he said with a big laugh. \u201cJust turn up and, \u2018Oh, yeah, that makes sense\u2019 and say the lines. Don\u2019t bump into the furniture.\u201d",
      "The second episode of the 10-part \u201cMobLand\u201d series airs Sunday on Paramount+.",
      "The series was created by Ronan Bennett, known for popular crime shows like \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\u201d and \u201cTop Boy,\u201d and written with playwright Jez Butterworth. Ritchie serves as executive producer and directed the first two episodes. The \u201cMobLand\u201d idea began as a spinoff from Showtime\u2019s popular \u201cRay Donovan\u201d series, before becoming a stand-alone show.",
      "Two-time Oscar-winner Helen Mirren stars as the devious Maeve, matriarch and manipulator of the crime family, while Pierce Brosnan plays her husband and mob leader, marking a reunion for the pair who worked on the 1980 film \u201cThe Long Good Friday.\u201d",
      "It may be hard to think of a role that Dame Mirren hasn\u2019t played, but she found one with \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are always characters out there that are going to take you by surprise and \u2026 I think, \u2019Oh my god, I\u2019ve never done anything like that before,\u201d said the \u201c1923\u201d star who believes the line between shooting film and TV is now nearly nonexistent. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the sort of beauties of my job, actually, is to constantly be entering into such very, very different worlds.\u201d",
      "Mirren said the opportunity to work with Hardy was intriguing.",
      "\u201cTom\u2019s involvement in it was one of the reasons I signed up because I\u2019ve admired his work over many years,\u201d Mirren said. \u201cDifferent actors, you can see, \u2019Oh, they\u2019re a great actor' \u2026 they can perform. But certain actors like Tom, it\u2019s an interior power that just communicates with the camera. And Tom\u2019s got that. You know what? It\u2019s called star power.\u201d",
      "The \u201cMobLand\u201d cast features Paddy Considine of \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d fame, Joanne Froggatt, Lara Pulver, Anson Boon and Mandeep Dhillon. While this show technically reunites Mirren and Brosnan, they also shot the upcoming \u201cThe Thursday Murder Club\u201d film prior to this project.",
      "While much was unknown when Brosnan signed on, \u201cMobLand\u201d had all the right ingredients for the former James Bond to dive in, starting with Ritchie, who released his Netflix series \u201cThe Gentlemen\u201d last year.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s naughty. He\u2019s cheeky. He\u2019s bold,\u201d said Brosnan. \u201cI love his work. His movies. The way he\u2019s acquitted himself on the landscape of cinema. He\u2019s a unique talent all his own \u2026 so I said yes. I wanted to go back to London. I wanted to work.\"",
      "Next for Hardy is the crime drama film \u201cHavoc\u201d premiering later this month, and there's chatter of a potential sequel to his 2015 \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d A second season of \u201cTaboo\u201d is on the way \u2014 nearly a decade after its debut. What about a \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cVenom\u201d crossover? Hardy addressed the rumors that an alleged project fell apart, clarifying it was never in the works.",
      "\u201cPeople embellish a story. I just said I would have loved to work with \u2018Spider-Man,\u2019 but it never happened, which is a fact. It hasn\u2019t happened. And I\u2019m no longer working with \u2018Venom\u2019 \u2026 it is a shame because my kids would love to watch Venom and Spider-Man together,\u201d said Hardy. \u201cI would have liked that.\u201d",

      "A young actor\u2019s suicide in South Korea",
      "SEOUL -- A young actor\u2019s suicide in South Korea. Allegations of an underage relationship. They are part of a growing drama in the Asian entertainment world that raises questions about society\u2019s treatment of celebrities in crisis, with harsh media and online commentary amplifying their lowest moments.",
      "This week, South Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun publicly denied allegations that he dated the late actor Kim Sae-ron when she was under the age of sexual consent. His emotional press conference followed Kim Sae-ron\u2019s suicide in February, which reignited allegations that they were romantically involved.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the case.",
      "Kim Sae-ron was once one of South Korea's most promising film stars. She began acting at age 9 in the 2009 film \u201cA Brand New Life,\u201d which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. She gained further recognition with \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d (2010) and \u201cA Girl at My Door\u201d (2014), also invited to Cannes.",
      "Her career halted in May 2022 after she crashed her car in Seoul while driving under the influence. Despite offering a public apology and reportedly paying compensation to shops that lost power because of the crash, she faced relentless negative attention.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Media and online commentators scrutinized her personal life. YouTube gossip channels accused her of exaggerating financial difficulties and questioned her sincerity. Critics, and her family, say it contributed to her declining mental health.",
      "She killed herself on Feb. 16, Kim Soo-hyun's birthday.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun, 37, also has been one of South Korea\u2019s most recognized actors, known for dramas such as \u201cMy Love from the Star\u201d (2013) and \u201cQueen of Tears\u201d (2024) as well as films like \u201cThe Thieves\u201d (2012) and \u201cSecretly, Greatly\u201d (2013).",
      "Speculation about a relationship with Kim Sae-ron began last year when she posted a photo of them together, quickly deleted. Gold Medalist, the agency co-founded by Kim Soo-hyun, denied the relationship, according to South Korean media.",
      "Days after Kim Sae-ron\u2019s death, a YouTube channel known for its politically charged content, HoverLab, alleged that she and Kim Soo-hyun had been in a six-year romantic relationship beginning in 2015, when she was 15 and he was in his late 20s. The channel released what it called evidence including photos, videos and letters. Kim Soo-hyun has called them fabricated.",
      "Kim Sae-ron\u2019s family had approached HoverLab to release the materials, calling it an attempt to restore Kim Sae-ron\u2019s image.",
      "On March 27, a lawyer representing Kim Sae-ron\u2019s family presented to journalists what the family claimed was a photo of an undelivered letter written in 2024 in which Kim Sae-ron described Kim Soo-hyun as her \u201cfirst and last love\u201d and referenced a five-to-six-year relationship.",
      "The letter was written after she failed to reach Kim Soo-hyun to discuss a debt she owed his agency, according to the lawyer. After Kim Sae-ron's contract ended and wasn't renewed, the agency asked her to pay back 700 million won (about $520,000) in damages related to her drunk-driving case. Her family says the demand placed severe pressure on her.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun has acknowledged that he dated Kim Sae-ron but insisted their relationship began after she became an adult. He called claims of an underage relationship false and damaging.",
      "\u201cIt is also not true that the deceased made a tragic choice because of my avoidance (of her), or because my agency pressured her about debt,\" an emotional Kim told Monday\u2019s press conference.",
      "He refused to answer a question from the AP about when he first met Kim Sae-ron.",
      "Whether any laws were broken depends largely on timing. South Korea raised its age of sexual consent from 13 to 16 in 2020. Kim Sae-ron was born in 2000, and the family alleges the relationship began in 2015, when she was 15 and Kim Soo-hyun was 27.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun maintains that their relationship lasted from summer 2019 to fall 2020, when Kim Sae-ron was a legal adult.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun's agency has taken legal action against the family of Kim Sae-ron and HoverLab, which first aired the underage relationship claims, for distributing private photos and videos of the actor, including images of Kim Soo-hyun kissing the late actor. Kim\u2019s agency said Kim Sae-ron had visited his apartment and his family was present. The agency said they were not dating at the time.",
      "On Monday, Kim Soo-hyun's lawyer announced a civil lawsuit seeking 12 billion won (approximately $8.15 million) in damages against the YouTube channel and Kim Sae-ron's family, along with criminal complaints alleging defamation and violation of privacy laws. Kim Soo-hyun and his agency also sued the YouTube channel operator for stalking.",
      "The family\u2019s legal representative and HoverLab both told the AP on Wednesday that they plan to sue Kim Soo-hyun and his agency for making false claims about his relationship with the late actor.",
      "Kim\u2019s death reignited criticism of South Korea\u2019s relentless tabloid and digital media culture. Her family has singled out videos with speculative, unverified content portraying her as emotionally unstable and morally questionable.",
      "Suing for defamation is often a lengthy, costly battle for South Korean celebrities, as many platforms, like YouTube, are based overseas. Punishments are typically light, with fines or suspended sentences.",
      "Other high-profile cases following negative online attention have included the deaths of K-pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019 and \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Fashion brand Prada has ended its collaboration with Kim Soo-hyun. South Korean cosmetics company Dinto terminated its one-year contract with him, citing the seriousness of the controversy. 7-Eleven Taiwan canceled a Kim Soo-hyun fan event last month, citing schedule changes.",
      "An online petition this week calling for the age of consent to be raised from 16 to 19 has gathered nearly 40,000 signatures on the National Assembly\u2019s website.",
      "Suggested reforms in South Korea meant to discourage harsh online comments have not been passed.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- The U.S. State Department revoked the visas of members of a Mexican band after they projected the face of a drug cartel boss onto a large screen during a performance in the western state of Jalisco over the weekend.",
      "U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who was U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the first Trump administration, said late Tuesday on X that the work and tourism visas of members of Los Alegres del Barranco were revoked.",
      "The visa revocations follow widespread outrage in Mexico over the concert as prosecutors in two states have launched investigations into the projected images, and a larger national reckoning over how to address the rise of a popular musical genre criticized for romanticizing drug cartels.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in freedom of expression, but that doesn\u2019t mean that expression should be free of consequences,\u201d Landau wrote on X. \u201cThe last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists.\u201d",
      "The controversy broke out over the weekend when the face of Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \"El Mencho\" Oseguera layered over flames was projected behind the band, originally hailing from Sinaloa, during the concert. Finger pointing ensued among the band, concert producers and the venue.",
      "Oseguera is the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has been connected to a ranch authorities say was used to train cartel recruits and possibly dispose of bodies in Jalisco, where searchers found human bone fragments, heaps of clothing and shoes.",
      "The Jalisco cartel is among other criminal groups in Mexico that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "While the image was met by applause during the concert, Jalisco prosecutors quickly announced they were summoning the band to testify in an investigation into whether they were promoting violence, a crime which could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison. The state of Michoacan also announced an investigation into the Los Alegres del Barranco for projecting the same images during a concert in the city of Uruapan.",
      "Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus said that the state would ban musical performances that glorify violence, adding that violators would \u201cface monetary and criminal sanctions.\u201d",

      "Since, a number of the band's future shows have been cancelled, one town's government saying that the show \u201cdidn't have the municipal permissions needed\u201d to carry out the performance.",
      "Pavel Moreno, the band's accordion player and back-up singer, didn't respond to questions by fans asking if his visa had been revoked, simply thanking them for support and saying that \"everything is fine.\u201d",
      "The band was scheduled to play in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 4. While the event hasn't been publicly cancelled, ticket sales websites read: \u201cNo tickets available for now on our site\" for that date.",
      "The dispute coincides with a larger cultural debate in Mexico as artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano usher in a global renaissance of Mexican regional music, by mixing classic ballads with trap music. In 2023, Peso Pluma beat Taylor Swift out as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "Many of the artists now topping the charts have come under fierce criticism because their lyrics often paint cartel leaders as Robin Hood-esque figures. Others say that the genre, known as \u201cnarco corridos\u201d, expresses the harsh realities of many youths across Mexico.",
      "A number of Mexican states have banned public performances of the music in recent years, the most recent being the state of Nayarit in February. Some of the bans have come as famed artists have received death threats from cartels, forcing a number of them to cancel their performances.",
      "Others, including Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, have sought a less aggressive approach to addressing the genre. Sheinbaum, who has come out against censoring the music, has suggested instead that the Mexican government push forward initiatives that promote Mexican regional music with more socially acceptable lyrics.",
      "The Mexican leader did harden her language on the topic following the Los Alegres del Barranco concert. In her morning news briefing this week, Sheinbaum demanded an investigation into the concert, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t justify violence or criminal groups.\u201d",

      "Star lived in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house on a busy street at the edge of downtown. But starting in early January, someone began tampering with the friendly reindeer and his pen.",
      "A person got inside the pen in January, and Star began losing weight. In February, someone cut the locks off the pen's gates and Star wandered downtown streets. The following night, someone sprayed some type of substance into Star's pen.",
      "Earlier, Whitehead shied away from thinking that person might have poisoned Star, but now he doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Star had a persistent cough after the February incidents and then developed pneumonia. It was believed that contents from his stomach were coming up through his nose, and Star breathing that matter back into his lungs caused the pneumonia.",
      "It\u2019s possible Star ate a plastic bag when he was wandering downtown Anchorage, which could cause indigestion problems and chronic weight loss.",
      "He was cured of pneumonia but developed a second bout.",
      "\u201cHe started to recover and then all of a sudden reversed himself, and we decided it was not possible to save him,\u201d Whitehead said. Star was euthanized Tuesday, the same day the necropsy was conducted.",
      "Results won\u2019t be known for a few weeks as to the possible cause of death or contributing factors, Whitehead said.",
      "There has been a pet reindeer housed in downtown Anchorage since the 1950s. This particular Star was the seventh in the line to live with either Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart or Whitehead after he took over for the Stewarts in 2002.",
      "Star, which had his own Facebook page, constantly got visitors to his pen, attracting tourists and locals alike. He got daily walks in downtown Anchorage, was featured in parades, was visited by schoolchildren and even appeared on reality TV shows.",

      "The jokesters' custom has been around for hundreds of years, although its exact birth is difficult to pinpoint. These days, depending on your location, it could be marked with a fish secretly pinned to someone's back or a whoopee cushion or even news reports of flying penguins (yes, that actually happened ).",

      "There are plenty of theories about where this day of pranks and hoaxes came from. It's not clear exactly which one might be true. But what is clear is that April Fools\u2019 Day has roots stretching back hundreds of years.",
      "One idea is that it dates back to France in 1564, when King Charles IX moved the New Year celebration from its weeklong observance beginning March 25 to a celebration on Jan. 1, according to the Library of Congress. Those who forgot or were never told about the change were mocked. Although the library notes that the true history of the New Year is more complicated, as different parts of the country observed it on different days.",
      "A similar theory ties April Fools\u2019 Day to the 1582 change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, according to the library. But it explains that this type of origin story has been used to explain several holidays and may be more of a \u201cmigratory legend.\u201d",
      "And then there's the theory that it could be connected to the March 21 vernal equinox, which is known as a day when people are tricked by unexpected weather changes, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.",
      "Whatever its origin, the first time there was clear documented reference to the day was in 1561 when the Flemish writer Eduard De Dene wrote in his poem about a nobleman sending his servant on pointless tasks, according to the Library of Congress. The servant soon realizes that he has been \u201csent on \u2018fool\u2019s errands\u2019 because it\u2019s April 1,\u201d the library states.",
      "In 2021, then-first lady Jill Biden pretended to be a flight attendant on an airplane traveling from California to Washington. She wore a \u201cJasmine\u201d nametag and passed out Dove ice cream bars while wearing a black mask, black pantsuit and wig. A few minutes later, \u201cJasmine\u201d reemerged without the wig \u2014 revealing herself to be Jill Biden, laughing and proclaiming, \u201cApril Fools!\u201d",
      "Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin became known for announcing outlandish ideas every April Fools\u2019 Day soon after starting their company more than a quarter century ago. One year, Google posted a job opening for a Copernicus research center on the moon. Another year, the company said it planned to roll out a \u201cscratch and sniff\u201d feature on its search engine.",
      "In 1992, NPR 's \u201cTalk of the Nation\u201d program announced that former-President Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974, would be running for president, according to the Museum of Hoaxes. A comedian had impersonated Nixon to say, \u201cI never did anything wrong, and I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d",
      "Outside of the U.S., one of the most notable pranks involved the BBC World Service in 1980 declaring that Big Ben would become a digital clock and renamed Digital Dave, according to the UK Parliament.",
      "From Scotland to Iceland to the U.S., the day is honored in a wide array of ways.",
      "In France, the day is known as poisson d\u2019avril, or \u201cApril Fish,\u201d and has long had a fish-themed pranking tradition. In modern times, it\u2019s become more of a day for children to relish in attaching paper fish to their friends\u2019 backs, Atlas Obscura says.",
      "In Scotland, April Fools' has a history of being a two-day event. April 1 is known as \u201cGowkie Day\u201d or \u201cHunt the Gowk,\u201d explained Encyclopedia Britannica. Gowk is a term used to describe a fool. On April 2, the celebration may become more physical, with children attaching \u201ckick me\u201d signs to people\u2019s backs.",
      "The day is also celebrated in Iceland, with the aim being to get people to \u201chlaupa apr\u00edl,\u201d or \u201cmake an April run.\u201d In other words, to trick someone in a way that makes them travel to a different location. News agencies have also been known to participate in pranking people.

      "For once, things are working out for Wile E",
      "NEW YORK -- For once, things are working out for Wile E. Coyote.",
      "After being shelved by Warner Bros. in 2023, the Looney Tunes film \u201cCoyote vs. Acme\u201d has found a new home. Ketchup Entertainment announced Monday that it acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film for an undisclosed sum.",
      "The deal gives new life to one of the three fully completed films that Warner Bros. elected to take a tax write-off on rather than release. The tactic, which followed a change in leadership at Warner Bros. coming out of the pandemic, was widely disparaged by creatives and fans, alike. The other two shelved movies \u2014 the $90 million DC Studios production \u201cBatgirl\u201d and the animated \u201cScoob! Holiday Haunt\u201d \u2014 remain unreleased.",
      "But \u201cCoyote vs. Acme\u201d will be salvaged from the dustbin. Ketchup Entertainment plans a theatrical release at an unspecified future date.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have made a deal with Warner Bros. Pictures to bring this film to audiences worldwide,\u201d Gareth West, chief executive of Ketchup Entertainment, said in a statement. \u201c\u2018Coyote vs Acme\u2019 is a perfect blend of nostalgia and modern storytelling, capturing the essence of the beloved Looney Tunes characters while introducing them to a new generation.\u201d",
      "Directed by Dave Green and based on a New Yorker article by Ian Frazier, \u201cCoyote vs. Acme\u201d follows Wile E. Coyote in a lawsuit against Acme Corporation for the many faulty products that failed to catch him the Road Runner. The live-action animated hybrid stars John Cena and Will Forte.",
      "Deadline earlier reported that Ketchup paid about $50 million for the film, which cost $70 million to produce. Ketchup, a distribution company launched in 2012, also recently released another Looney Tunes film jettisoned by Warner Bros.: \u201cThe Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.\u201d In three weeks of release, it's grossed $8.2 million in domestic ticket sales.",

      "The makers of hit Netflix show \u201cAdolescence\u201d have sparked a conversation on how to protect children from violent misogyny and other harmful content on social media",
      "LONDON -- The makers of hit Netflix show \u201cAdolescence \u201d have sparked a conversation on how to protect children from violent misogyny and other harmful content on social media.",
      "Now they have the ear of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who welcomed the filmmakers to Downing Street on Monday for talks on child protection. Starmer's office said he backed an initiative by Netflix to stream the drama series for free to secondary schools across the country, so that as many children as possible can watch it.",
      "The show, filmed in England, explores the difficult questions that arise when a 13-year-old boy is accused of stabbing a girl in his school to death. It has been watched by more than 66 million people worldwide since it launched earlier in March.",
      "Starmer said it was difficult watching the series with his 14-year-old daughter and 16-year-old son. But showing it widely in schools will \u201chelp students better understand the impact of misogyny, dangers of online radicalization and the importance of healthy relationships,\u201d his office said.",
      "Starmer added in a statement: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a challenge politicians can simply legislate for. Believe me, if I could pull a lever to solve it, I would.\"",
      "Jack Thorne, a co-writer of the show, said the team behind \u201cAdolescence\u201d made it to provoke a conversation.",
      "\u201cSo to have the opportunity to take this into schools is beyond our expectations,\u201d he said. \"We hope it\u2019ll lead to teachers talking to the students, but what we really hope is it\u2019ll lead to students talking amongst themselves.\u201d",
      "Stephen Graham, a co-creator of the drama who stars as the boy's father, has told The Associated Press he wanted the narrative to focus on the seemingly ordinary life of the accused.",
      "He said that when a knife crime among young people takes place, the first reaction may be to question the background of the murder suspect and how they were raised.",
      "\u201cBut what if it's not the family?\u201d he asked, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re all maybe accountable. School. Society. Parents. Community.\u201d",
      "The success of \u201cAdolescence\u201d has come during growing concern over children's use of smartphones and the easy availability of pornography and extreme misogynistic content on social media pushed by influencers like Andrew Tate. Tate and his brother, Tristan, who are dual U.S. and British citizens, face charges of human trafficking and forming an organized criminal group to sexually exploit women.",
      "Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, warned last week that \u201cthe harmful effect of Tate is plain to see.\u201d",
      "Police in the U.K. are now dealing with more than a million crimes related to violence against women and girls each year, or a fifth of all recorded crime.",

      "A New Mexico court has cleared the way for the release of investigative records from the deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, as long as depictions of the deceased couple are blocked from view",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- A court on Monday cleared the way for the release of investigative records from the deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, as long as depictions of the deceased couple are blocked from view.",
      "The ruling from a New Mexico judge allows the possible release of redacted police body camera video and other investigative materials, including images of the couple's dead dog. All photos, video and documents from the investigation had been restricted from release by an earlier, temporary court order.",
      "\u201cThere shall be no depiction of either body in any video production\u201d or photographic image of the bodies, Santa Fe-based Judge Matthew Wilson said in response to questions from attorneys on his ruling.",
      "A representative for the Hackman family estate had urged a New Mexico judge to keep the records sealed to protect the family\u2019s constitutional right to privacy.",
      "The partially mummified remains of Hackman and Arakawa were found in their Santa Fe home on Feb. 26, when maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police.",
      "Authorities have said Hackman, 95, died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease about a week after his wife died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is a rare, rodent-borne disease. Hackman may have been unaware Arakawa, 65, was dead.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs, a kelpie mix named Zinna, also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs were found alive. A state veterinary lab tied the dog's death to dehydration and starvation.",
      "Authorities unraveled the mysterious circumstances of the couple\u2019s deaths and described their conclusions at a March 7 news conference without releasing most related written and photographic records.",
      "New Mexico\u2019s open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of dead bodies. Experts also say some medical information is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.",
      "In seeking to block the release of records, estate representative Julia Peters had emphasized the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media. The Hackman family estate also sought to block the eventual release of autopsy reports by the Office of the Medical Investigator and death investigation reports by the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "An attorney for the estate, Kurt Sommer, argued during Monday's hearing that the couple took great pains to stay out of the public light during their lifetimes and that the right to control the use of their names and likenesses should extend to their estate in death.",
      "The bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability.",
      "The Associated Press, CBS News and CBS Studios intervened in the matter. Gregory P. Williams, an attorney for the news outlets, told the judge that they had previously said in court filings that they would not disseminate images of the couple's bodies and would blur images to obscure them from other records.",
      "\u201cThere is certainly a public interest in knowing how their deaths were investigated and knowing how that was handled,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Susan Madore, a publicist who had worked with the Hackmans for years, testified that the couple relished living in Santa Fe because it afforded them anonymity. Hackman retired in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa had no children, while Hackman is survived by three children from a previous marriage.",
      "At Monday's hearing, an attorney for Hackman's son and daughters highlighted the possible traumatic effects of releasing conversations about the deaths within police body camera videos.",
      "Scot Sauder, an attorney for the state medical investigator, told the judge that autopsy reports for Hackman and his wife do not yet exist and won\u2019t include past health care information once completed. It can take months for autopsy reports to be completed.",
      "Privacy likely also will play a role as the couple\u2019s estate is settled. According to probate court documents, Hackman signed an updated will in 2005 leaving his estate to his wife while the will she signed that year directed her estate to him. With both dying, management of the estate is in Peters' hands.",
      "Without trust documents being made public, it\u2019s unclear who the beneficiaries are and how the assets will be divided.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Richard Chamberlain, the handsome hero of the 1960s television series \"Dr. Kildare\" who found a second career as an award-winning \"king of the miniseries,\" has died. He was 90.",
      "Chamberlain died Saturday night in Waimanalo, Hawaii, of complications following a stroke, according to his publicist, Harlan Boll.",
      "\u201cOur beloved Richard is with the angels now. He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us,\" Martin Rabbett, his lifelong partner, said in a statement. \"How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul. Love never dies. And our love is under his wings lifting him to his next great adventure.\u201d",
      "Tall, with classic good looks and romantic style, Chamberlain became an instant favorite with teenage girls as the compassionate physician on the TV series that aired from 1961 to 1966. Photoplay magazine named him most popular male star for three years in a row, from 1963-65.",
      "Not until 2003 did he acknowledge publicly what Hollywood insiders had long known, that he was gay. He made the revelation in his autobiography, \"Shattered Love.\"",
      "The actor became known as \"king of the TV miniseries\" in 1978 when he landed the starring role in \"Centennial,\" an epic production 24 hours long and based on James Michener's sprawling novel. He followed that in 1980 with \"Shogun,\" another costly, epic miniseries based on James Clavell's period piece about an American visitor to Japan.",
      "He scored his greatest miniseries success in 1983 with another long-form drama, \"The Thorn Birds,\" based on Colleen McCullough's best-seller. He played Father Ralph de Bricassart, a Roman Catholic priest in Australia who falls in love with beautiful Meggie Cleary (Rachel Ward). The ABC production, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck, reportedly attracted 100 million viewers.",
      "Chamberlain won Golden Globes for his work in \u201cShogun\" and \u201cThe Thorn Birds.\u201d Years earlier, he received one for \u201cDr. Kildare.\u201d",
      "When the public began to lose interest in miniseries, Chamberlain turned to the theater, where he displayed a fine singing voice. He appeared as Henry Higgins in a 1994 Broadway revival of \"My Fair Lady\" and as Captain von Trapp in a 1999 revival of \"The Sound of Music.\"",
      "He reprised his role of de Bricassart in the 1996 TV movie \"The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years.\"",
      "He also appeared in numerous films, including \"The Music Lovers\" (as Tchaikovsky), \"The Madwoman of Chaillot,\" \"The Towering Inferno\" and \"The Three Musketeers\" and its sequels.",
      "The \"Kildare\" series was based on a string of successful 1930s and '40s films that had starred Lew Ayres in the title role.",
      "Chamberlain's hunky, all-American appearance made him an overnight star. Another medical show that debuted the same season, \"Ben Casey,\" also was a smash and made its leading man, the darkly handsome Vince Edwards, a star, too.",
      "The \"Ben Casey shirt\" became a fashion item, both shows' theme songs made the pop Top 40 (the Kildare song performed by Chamberlain himself) and there was even a pop song called \"Dr. Kildare! Dr. Casey! You Are Wanted for Consultation.\"",
      "But in his book, Chamberlain recounted how he was forced to hide his sexuality. He would escort glamorous actresses to movie premieres and other public events at the request of studio executives and dodge reporters' questions about why he had never married with a stock reply: \"Getting married would be great, but I'm awfully busy now.\"",
      "\"When I grew up, being gay, being a sissy or anything like that was verboten,\" he said in an NBC interview. \"I disliked myself intensely and feared this part of myself intensely and had to hide it.\"",
      "The book also described a troubled childhood and an alcoholic father, and Chamberlain said that writing it finally lifted a heavy emotional burden. He also expressed relief that he was no longer hiding his sexuality.",
      "\"I played a cat-and-mouse game with the press. Game over,\" said Chamberlain.",
      "Born George Richard Chamberlain in Beverly Hills on March 31, 1934, the actor originally studied at Pomona College to be a painter. But after returning from the Army, where he had served as an infantry clerk in the Korean War, Chamberlain decided to try acting.",
      "He studied voice and drama, and after appearing in guest roles in a handful of TV shows and in the 1960 film \"The Secret of the Purple Reef,\" he won the Dr. Kildare role.",
      "When \u201cDr. Kildare\u201d was canceled he initially found it difficult to shake the image of the handsome young physician.",
      "He moved to England for a time to find work and hone his acting skills. While there, he appeared in three of director Richard Lester\u2019s films, \u201cPetulia\u201d (1968), \u201cThe Three Musketeers\u201d (1973) and \u201cThe Four Musketeers\u201d (1974). He reunited with Lester in 1989 for \u201cThe Return of the Musketeers,\u201d once more playing Aramis.",
      "In 1969, Chamberlain played the title role in \u201cHamlet\u201d at England\u2019s Birmingham Repertory Company and repeated it in a TV adaptation that appeared on NBC in the United States. He also appeared as Octavius in a film version of \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d which co-starred Charlton Heston and Jason Robards.",
      "He continued to act well into the 21st century, appearing on such television shows as \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d \u201cThe Drew Carey Show\u201d and \u201cTouched by an Angel.\u201d",

      "The roughly two dozen workers who ran the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program were among 10,000 people fired as part of a dramatic restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services, according to Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.",

      "\u201cThe way they did it, there was no like warning,\u201d he said.",
      "On Thursday, 13 U.S. senators, including two Republicans, sent a letter to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging the administration to reverse its decision to cut the LIHEAP staff.

      "It's not clear whether there is an alternative plan to analyze the data, which local and state governments use to develop prevention measures and treatment services. The federal government distributes grant money to fight the opioid addiction crisis based on it. Researchers use it to study trends in depression, alcoholism and tobacco use.",
      "An HHS spokesman did not immediately respond to a question about the survey's future.",
      "The nationally representative survey is conducted in person by an independent research group with about 70,000 people each year.

      "\u201cWe use its findings on a near daily basis in our research, educational programming and resources, and communication materials,\u201d Vuolo said of the survey.",
      "Before the layoffs, the government team was preparing to analyze 2024 data, the first year where trends would be reliable again since the pandemic disrupted data collection, said Jennifer Hoenig, the laid-off director of the Office of Population Surveys.",
      "The data could now sit on the shelf without experienced analysts to untangle it, she said.",
      "\u201cEvery person working on it was let go,\u201d Hoenig said, noting that the data collection is mandated by Congress. The office is part of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which would be absorbed into a new Administration for a Healthy America under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s plan.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Susan Crawford\u2019s Wisconsin Supreme Court election victory over a conservative candidate backed by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk cemented a liberal majority on the state\u2019s top court for at least three more years and dealt a devastating blow to Republicans who fear it paves the way for a wide array of rulings that will overturn or block the GOP's agenda in the swing state.",
      "Trump, Musk and other Republican leaders fear that Crawford's win means the court controlled 4-3 by liberals will redraw Wisconsin's congressional lines in a way that could result in the Democrats picking up at least two seats and helping the party regain the majority.",
      "Crawford backers, including Democratic U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, told supporters that electing Crawford was important so that she and other liberal justices can order Wisconsin's congressional boundary lines to be redrawn.",
      "Last year, the court declined to take up a Democratic-backed challenge to the state's congressional lines, drawing criticism from one of Wisconsin's two House Democrats, Rep. Mark Pocan, who had urged the court to take the case then. Pocan said Wednesday that he hopes a new lawsuit will be filed soon.",

      "The court also overturned a decision by the former conservative court that banned absentee ballot drop boxes.",
      "Schimel's loss had Republicans worried about what that means for 2026, when Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' is up for reelection to a third term.",

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments in a South Carolina case over whether states can cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood",
      "WASHINGTON -- There are just two Planned Parenthood clinics in South Carolina, but every year they take hundreds of low-income patients who need things like contraception, cancer screenings and pregnancy testing.",
      "The organization has long been at the center of the debate over abortion, but its clinics across the U.S. also provide a range of other services. In South Carolina, Medicaid patients often seek out Planned Parenthood because they often have difficulty finding a doctor who accepts the publicly funded insurance.",
      "A case coming before the Supreme Court from South Carolina on Wednesday could upend that option. That's because the state's Republican governor, Henry McMaster, is pushing to block any public health care dollars from going to Planned Parenthood.",
      "Federal law already prohibits Medicaid money from going to pay for abortions, with very limited exceptions, and South Carolina now bans almost all abortions around six weeks after conception.",
      "\u201cThis case is not about abortion. This case is about general health care,\u201d said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.",
      "Still, Republican leaders in conservative-led states have long said that no public health care dollars should go to an organization that provides abortions, and states should instead be able to direct that money as they choose. A few states already have cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood and more could follow if South Carolina prevails.",
      "\u201cThe people in this state do not want their tax money to go to that organization,\u201d McMaster said.",
      "The Trump administration is joining South Carolina for the arguments on Wednesday, which are playing out against the backdrop of a wider push by abortion opponents to defund Planned Parenthood.",
      "Health care advocates, meanwhile, say the effects of the case transcend abortion. The legal question at its center is whether Medicaid patients can sue over their legal right to choose their own qualified provider.",
      "The American Cancer Society and other public-health groups say in court papers that lawsuits are the only real way that patients can assert those rights. Losing the ability to go to court would hurt their access to care, especially in rural areas.",
      "\u201cIf no one is able to enforce the statute or no one\u2019s willing to enforce the statute at the federal level, then it\u2019s a right on paper only,\u201d said Julian Polaris, a lawyer who regularly advises state Medicaid programs and health care providers. States could also move to restrict access to treatments like gender-affirming care if the court sides with South Carolina, he said.",
      "One in five American women of reproductive age is now enrolled in the Medicaid program, said Heidi Allen, an associate professor at Columbia University. This means that finding providers who can offer quality family planning services \u2014 a requirement for Medicaid \u2014 is crucial for meeting the needs of those patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that states would eliminate a site of care for politically motivated reasons, \u201cAllen said.",
      "The case stretches back to 2018, before the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to abortion, when McMaster first moved to cut Planned Parenthood funding in a fulfillment of a campaign promise. He signed an executive order removing Planned Parenthood from a list of providers for things like birth control, and sexually transmitted disease testing.",
      "\u201cThere are plenty of good organizations that provide maternal health advice, counseling and care and we need more of those,\u201d McMaster said last week.",
      "His order was blocked in court, but since then judges have ruled in favor of similar moves in Texas and Missouri, said John Bursch, an attorney for the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level, this case is about whether states have the flexibility to direct Medicaid moneys to best benefit low-income women and families,\u201d he said.",
      "He acknowledged that a win for South Carolina could curtail other Medicaid lawsuits, but suggested that could be good for the program overall because it would mean less money going to legal fees. There is also an administrative appeals process available, he said.",
      "\u201cNo one is losing their access to health care clinics,\u201d Busch said. If the state is allowed to cut off Planned Parenthood, Medicaid patients could go to one of 200 other publicly funded health care clinics in the state, he said.",
      "In South Carolina, $90,000 in Medicaid funding goes to Planned Parenthood every year \u2014 a tiny fraction of a percentage point of the state\u2019s total Medicaid spending.",
      "Most counties in the state have already been federally designated as having too few primary care providers, said Amalia Luxardo, CEO of the South Carolina-based Women\u2019s Rights and Empowerment Network. Fourteen of the state\u2019s counties have no practicing OB-GYN physicians and five other counties have just one, she said, meaning many women already have to travel longer distances to find the right provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood has flexible hours and can get appointments scheduled quickly, factors that bring in patients from around the state, she said.",
      "\u201cWe are already in a health care crisis,\u201d said Luxardo, whose group has filed court briefs supporting Planned Parenthood. \u201cAnd when decisions like these negatively impact our constituents, the crisis is going to only increase.\u201d",

      "The health guidelines, first published last fall, take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavored peanuts.",
      "Announcing that the ban had become law, Mexico's Education Ministry posted on X: \u201cFarewell, junk food!\u201d It encouraged parents to support the government's crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.",
      "\u201cOne of the core principles of the new Mexican school system is healthy living,\" said Mario Delgado, the public health secretary. \u201cThere's a high level of acceptance of this policy among parents.\u201d",

      "Under Mexico's new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labeling system in 2020.",
      "Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.",

      "It includes supporters of popular Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, and young people who see all politicians as ineffective. Protesters range from the socialist left to the ultra-nationalist right, and from university students to retirees.",
      "They are united by a sense that the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has grown increasingly authoritarian, diminishing the secular and democratic values and laws that the country was built upon. They are fueled by outrage at Imamoglu's arrest and the government's attempts to quell the ensuing protests.",
      "The protests began after the government arrested Imamoglu, the man seen as posing the most serious electoral challenge to Erdogan in years, on March 19. Prosecutors accuse him of corruption and aiding an outlawed Kurdish organization.",
      "Critics say the charges are an excuse to get a key rival out of the way, but the government denies interfering with the legal process.",
      "The largest protests have happened alongside rallies of Imamoglu's center-left pro-secularist Republican People\u2019s Party, known as the CHP, but many young protesters said they don't support the party.",

      "In images on social media, some protesters made the ultranationalist \u201cgrey wolf\u201d hand sign, standing next to others showing the leftists' raised fist. Some showed the peace sign favored by both leftists and pro-Kurdish groups, while others chanted slogans attacking the banned militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party.",
      "Berk Esen, an associate professor of political science at Sabanci University, said most protesters he has seen are educated, urban young people aged 18 to 25, but they have little else in common: \u201cThis is a much more amorphous, eclectic group politically,\u201d he said.",
      "One afternoon last week, dozens of students from Bogazici University gathered at a metro station in Istanbul, many wearing masks to avoid reprisals or arrest.",
      "More than 2,000 people, including journalists, have been detained since the protests began. Around 300 were formally arrested on charges including \u201cjoining an illegal protest\u201d and \u201cresisting the police,\u201d with some accused of \u201cterrorism links.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the arrested students say that the charge of \u201cjoining an illegal protest\u201d does not justify extended detention, and that the number of arrests is \u201cunusually high\u201d compared to offenses such as terrorism or drugs.",
      "At the metro station, 22-year-old management student Burak Turan and his girlfriend slipped into a mall, watching officers detain dozens of protesters.",
      "\u201cWe are here because so many students are getting arrested for no reason,\u201d Turan said. \u201cThey act like it\u2019s a war; they are exercising wartime laws.\u201d Turan refused to wear a mask, saying he had nothing to be ashamed of.",
      "Other protesters include public employees, artists and retirees, many of whom support the CHP.",
      "A man in his 60s watching a standoff at city hall said he was there to defend the rights of the younger generation. \u201cWe don\u2019t matter, they do. They are our future.\u201d he said.",
      "Others were there to speak out against as what they perceived as a slide away from Turkey\u2019s secular and democratic values under Erdogan.",
      "Mehtap Bozkurt, a 70-year-old pensioner and a CHP supporter, joined a protest outside Istanbul city hall.",
      "\u201cThis country is secular and will remain secular,\" she said. \"We will resist until the end. I am ready to give my life and blood for this issue.\u201d",
      "That doesn't mean that people protesting aren't practicing Muslims, said Esen, the Sabanci academic. \u201cThere are Muslims, religious people and those who at least perform some religious duties amongst the protesters,\" he said. \u201cBut they also probably define themselves as secular.\u201d",
      "Outside the courts in Istanbul, parents and relatives, some holding flowers, maintained an anxious vigil. Some hoped for a loved one's immediate release, while others were overcome with frustration. One family member, who asked to remain anonymous fearing reprisals from officials, told local media that the detained students had \u201cstudied day and night to get into the best universities.\u201d",
      "\u201cLook at the treatment they are receiving now. There are no rights. There is no law. There is no justice,\u201d she said.",
      "Another woman showed journalists a picture of her son with a black eye. \u201cHe told me, \u2018Mom, they beat me up,\u2019\u201d she said tearfully. Another woman said she was a cancer patient left waiting since dawn. \u201cWhat did these kids do? Did they murder someone? What did they even do?\u201d",
      "Around 300 protesters spent the Eid holiday in prison, separated from their families.",
      "Lawyers for several protesters told The Associated Press that students are held in overcrowded cells and face physical and verbal mistreatment, as well as limited access to meals since prison commissaries are closed for Eid. Lawyers also fear that students could miss exams or be expelled as a \u201cpunishment\u201d for taking part in the protests.",
      "On Thursday the police issued a statement describing as \u201cvile slander\u201d claims that women had been sexually assaulted in custody.",
      "The Interior Ministry said that at least 150 police officers were injured in clashes with demonstrators. Images from the protests showed riot police using tear gas and plastic pellets, while students threw plastic water bottles and flares.",
      "Esen says the protests may mark a pivotal moment for Turkey.",
      "\u201cWill the police violence used by the government against them make them throw in the towel after a certain point or will it bring about a bigger showdown and make this a long-term affair? If the latter happens, I will be very optimistic about Turkey becoming democratic again. If the former happens, all of this is heading toward a very bad place,\" he said.",
      "A young female protester wearing a mask watched the standoff with police unfolding near city hall last week.",

      "Suspected U.S. airstrikes have killed at least two people overnight in a stronghold of Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Suspected U.S. airstrikes killed at least two people overnight in a stronghold of Yemen's Houthi rebels, the group said Sunday, as a bombing video posted by U.S. President Donald Trump suggested casualties in the campaign may be higher than the rebels acknowledge.",
      "The strikes in Saada killed two people and wounded four others, with footage aired by the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel showing a strike collapsing what appeared to be a two-story building. The Iranian-backed Houthis aired no footage from inside the building, which they described as a solar power shop.",
      "The intense campaign of airstrikes in Yemen under Trump targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters stemming from the Israel-Hamas war has killed at least 69 people, according to casualty figures released by the Houthis.",
      "However, the Houthis have not acknowledged any casualties from their security and military leadership \u2014 something challenged after an online video posted by Trump.",
      "Early Saturday, Trump posted what appeared to be black-and-white video from a drone of a group of several dozen people gathered in a circle. An explosion detonates during the 25-second video, with a massive crater left in its wake.",
      "\u201cThese Houthis gathered for instructions on an attack,\u201d Trump claimed, without offering a location for the attack or any other details about the strike. \u201cOops, there will be no attack by these Houthis! They will never sink our ships again!\u201d",
      "The U.S. military's Central Command, which oversees America's Mideast military operations, has not published the video, nor offered any specific details about the strikes it has conducted since March 15. The White House has said there have been over 200 strikes so far targeting the Houthis.",
      "The rebel-controlled SABA news agency in Yemen, citing an anonymous source, described the bombing as targeting \u201ca social Eid visit in Hodeida governorate.\u201d Muslims across the world just celebrated Eid al-Fitr, the festival at the end of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. SABA had published images of other commanders meeting fighters during the holiday, though not any high-level Houthi officials.",
      "\u201cThose present at that gathering had no connection to the operations carried out by the (Houthis), which are implementing the decision to ban navigation on ships linked to the American and Israeli enemy,\u201d the SABA report said, adding that the attack killed and wounded \u201cdozens.\u201d",
      "However, the Houthis previously have not acknowledged any strike on Hodeida during that time with such a high casualty count. The SABA report also did not describe those killed as civilians, suggesting those killed had ties to the rebels' security or military forces.",
      "Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert of the Basha Report risk advisory firm, cited social media condolence notices suggesting a colonel overseeing police stations for the Houthis in Hodeida had been killed in the strike Trump highlighted alongside his two brothers.",
      "\u201cThe strikes have expanded significantly, hitting multiple goveronates simultaneously, alongside telecommunications infrastructure, command nodes, properties tied to senior Houthi leadership and previously untouched tunnel networks in mountainous areas,\u201d al-Basha told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve also seen direct targeting of Houthi force gatherings, indicating a more aggressive and evolving shift in the targeting strategy,\u201d al-Basha said.",
      "An AP review has found the new American operation against the Houthis under Trump appears more extensive than those under former U.S. President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.",
      "The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.",
      "The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.",
      "The attacks greatly raised the profile of the Houthis, who faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers in Yemen amid a decadelong stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation.",
      "The campaign shows no signs of stopping as the Trump administration repeatedly has linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.",

      "In its 3-year-old war, Russia has detained what human rights activists say are thousands of Ukrainian civilians and has charged them with various crimes",
      "When she heard her front door open almost two years ago, Kostiantyn Zinovkin\u2019s mother thought her son had returned home because he forgot something. Instead, men in balaclavas burst into the apartment in Melitopol, a southern Ukrainian city occupied by Russian forces.",
      "They said Zinovkin was detained for a minor infraction and would be released soon. They used his key to enter, said his wife, Liusiena, and searched the flat so thoroughly that they tore it apart \u201cinto molecules.\u201d",
      "But Zinovkin wasn't released. Weeks after his May 2023 arrest, the Russians told his mother he was plotting a terrorist attack. He's now standing trial on charges his family calls absurd.",
      "Zinovkin is one of thousands of civilians in Russian captivity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy insists their release, along with prisoners of war, will be an important step toward ending the 3-year-old war.",
      "So far, it hasn't appeared high on the agenda in U.S. talks with Moscow and Kyiv.",
      "\u201cWhile politicians discuss natural resources, possible territorial concessions, geopolitical interests and even Zelenskyy\u2019s suit in the Oval Office, they\u2019re not talking about people,\u201d said Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of the Center for Civil Liberties, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022.",
      "In January, the center and other Ukrainian and Russian rights groups launched \u201cPeople First,\u201d a campaign that says any peace settlement must prioritize the release of everyone they say are captives, including Russians jailed for protesting the war, as well as Ukrainian children who were illegally deported.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t achieve sustainable peace without taking into account the human dimension,\u201d Matviichuk told The Associated Press.",
      "It's unknown how many Ukrainian civilians are in custody, both in occupied regions and in Russia. Ukraine\u2019s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets has estimated over 20,000.",
      "Matviichuk says her group received over 4,000 requests to help civilian detainees. She notes it's against international law to detain noncombatants in war.",
      "Oleg Orlov, co-founder of the Russian rights group Memorial, says advocates know at least 1,672 Ukrainian civilians are in Moscow\u2019s custody.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a larger number of them that we don\u2019t know about,\u201d added Orlov, whose organization won the Nobel alongside Matviichuk's group and is involved in People First.",
      "Many are detained for months without charges and don't know why they're being held, Orlov said.",
      "Russian soldiers detained Mykyta Shkriabin, then 19, in Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region in March 2022. He left the basement where his family was sheltering from fighting to get supplies and never returned.",
      "Shkriabin was detained even though he wasn\u2019t charged with a crime, said his lawyer, Leonid Solovyov. In 2023, the authorities began referring to him as a POW, a status Solovyov seeks to contest since the student wasn\u2019t a combatant.",
      "Shkriabin's mother, Tetiana, told AP last month she still doesn\u2019t know where her son is held. In three years, she's received two letters from him saying he's doing well and that she shouldn't worry.",
      "She's hoping for \u201ca prisoner exchange, a repatriation, or something,\u201d Shkriabina said. Without hope, \"how does one hang in there?\u201d",
      "Others face charges that their relatives say are fabricated.",
      "After being seized in Melitopol, Zinovkin was jailed for over two years and charged with seven offenses, including plotting a terrorist attack, assembling weapons and high treason, his wife Liusiena Zinovkina told AP, describing the charges as \u201cabsurd.\u201d",
      "While vocally pro-Ukrainian and against Russia's occupation, her husband couldn\u2019t plot to bomb anyone and had no weapons skills, she said.",
      "Especially nonsensical is the treason charge, she said, because Russian law stipulates that only its citizens can be charged with that crime, and Zinovkin has never held Russian citizenship, unless it was forced upon him in jail. A conviction could bring life in prison.",
      "Ukrainian civilian Serhii Tsyhipa, 63, was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 13 years in a maximum-security prison after he disappeared in March 2022 while walking his dog in Nova Kakhovka, in the partially occupied Kherson region, said his wife, Olena. The dog also vanished.",
      "Tsyhipa, a journalist, was wearing a jacket with a large red cross sewn on it. Both he and his wife, Olena, had those jackets, she told AP, because they volunteered to distribute food and other essentials when Russian troops invaded.",
      "Serhii Tsyhipa protested the occupation, and Olena believes that led to his arrest.",
      "He was held for months in Crimea and finally charged with espionage in December 2022. Almost a year later, in October 2023, Tsyhipa was convicted and sentenced in a trial that lasted only three hearings.",
      "He appealed, but his sentence was upheld. \u201cBut the Russian authorities must understand that we are fighting \u2014 that we are doing everything possible to bring him home,\u201d she said.",
      "Mykhailo Savva of the Expert Council of the Center for Civil Liberties said rights advocates know of 307 Ukrainian civilians convicted in Russia on criminal charges \u2014 usually espionage or treason, if the person held a Russian passport, but also terrorism and extremism.",
      "He said that in Ukraine's occupied territories, Russians see activists, community leaders and journalists as \"the greatest threat.\u201d",
      "Winning release for those already serving sentences would be an uphill battle, advocates say.",
      "Relatives must piece together scraps of information about prison conditions.",
      "Zinovkina said she has received letters from her husband who told her of problems with his sight, teeth and back. Former prisoners also told her of cramped, cold basement cells in a jail in Rostov, where he's being held.",
      "She believes her husband was pressured to sign a confession. A man who met him in jail told her Kostiantyn \u201cconfessed to everything they wanted him to, so the worst is over\u201d for him.",
      "Orlov said Ukrainian POWs and civilians are known to be held in harsh conditions, where allegations of abuse and torture are common.",
      "The Kremlin tested those methods during the two wars it waged in Chechnya in the 1990s and 2000s, well before invading Ukraine, said Orlov, who recently went to Ukraine to document Russia's human rights violations and saw the pattern repeated from the North Caucasus conflicts.",
      "\u201cEssentially, a misanthropic system has been created, and everyone who falls into it ends up in hell,\u201d added Matviichuk, the Ukrainian human rights worker.",
      "A recent report by the U.N. Human Rights Council said Russia \u201ccommitted enforced disappearances and torture as crimes against humanity,\u201d part of a \"systematic attack against the civilian population and pursuant to a coordinated state policy.\u201d",
      "It said Russia \u201cdetained large numbers of civilians,\u201d jailed them in occupied Ukraine or deported them to Russia, and \u201csystematically used torture against certain categories of detainees to extract information, coerce, and intimidate.\u201d",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry, the Federal Penitentiary Service and the Federal Security Service did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "As the U.S. talks about a ceasefire, relatives continue to press for the captives' release.",
      "Liusiena Zinovkina says she hasn't abandoned hope as her husband, now 33, stands trial but is tempering her expectations.",
      "\u201cI see that it\u2019s not as simple as the American president thought. It\u2019s not that easy to come to an agreement with Russia,\u201d she said, reminding herself \u201cto be patient. It will happen, but not tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Olena Tsyhipa said every minute counts for her husband, whose health has deteriorated.",

      "Thousands marched in the capital, Madrid, and over 30 other cities in a demonstration organized by housing activists and backed by Spain\u2019s main labor unions.",
      "The housing crisis has hit particularly hard in Spain, where there is a strong tradition of home ownership and scant public housing for rent. Rents have been driven up by increased demand. Buying a home has become unaffordable for many, with market pressures and speculation driving up prices, especially in big cities and coastal areas.",
      "A generation of young people say they have to stay with their parents or spend big just to share an apartment, with little chance of saving enough to one day purchase a home. High housing costs mean even those with traditionally well-paying jobs are struggling to make ends meet.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m living with four people and still, I allocate 30 or 40% of my salary to rent,\u201d said Mari S\u00e1nchez, a 26-year-old lawyer in Madrid. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t allow me to save.

      "The average rent in Spain has almost doubled in the last 10 years. The price per square meter rose from 7.2 euros ($7.9) in 2014 to 13 euros last year, according to real estate website Idealista. The increase is bigger in Madrid and Barcelona.",
      "Incomes have failed to keep up, especially for younger people in a country with chronically high unemployment.",

      "Spain is near the bottom end of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries with public housing for rent making up under 2% of all available housing. The OECD average is 7%. In France it is is 14%, Britain 16% and the Netherlands 34%.",
      "Angry renters point to instances of international hedge funds buying up properties, often with the aim of renting them to foreign tourists. The question has become so politically charged that Barcelona\u2019s city government pledged last year to phase out all its 10,000 permits for short-term rentals, many of them advertised on platforms like Airbnb, by 2028.",

      "Iran\u2019s rial currency traded at a record low against the U.S. dollar as the country returned to work after a long holiday",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- TEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 Iran \u2019s rial currency traded Saturday at a record low against the U.S. dollar as the country returned to work after a long holiday, costing over 1 million rials for a single greenback as tensions between Tehran and Washington likely will push it even lower.",
      "The exchange rate had plunged to over 1 million rials during the Persian New Year, Nowruz, as currency shops closed and only informal trading took place on the streets, creating additional pressure on the market. But as traders resumed work Saturday, the rate fell even further to 1,043,000 to the dollar, signaling the new low appeared here to stay.",
      "On Ferdowsi Street in Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, the heart of the country\u2019s money exchanges, some traders even switched off their electronic signs showing the going rate as uncertainty loomed over how much further the rial could drop.",
      "\u201cWe turn it off since we are not sure about the successive changes of the rate,\u201d said Reza Sharifi, who works at one exchange.",
      "Iran\u2019s economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. At the time of the 2015 deal, which saw Iran drastically limit its enrichment and stockpiling of uranium in exchange for lifting of international sanctions, the rial traded at 32,000 to the dollar.",
      "After Trump returned to the White House for his second term in January, he restarted his so-called \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign targeting Tehran with sanctions. He again went after firms trading Iranian crude oil, including those selling at a discount in China.",
      "Trump meanwhile has written to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, trying to jumpstart direct talks between Tehran and Washington. So far, Iran has maintained it is willing for indirect talks, but such discussions under the Biden administration failed to make headway.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump is continuing an intense airstrike campaign targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, the last force in Tehran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d able to attack Israel after other militant groups were mauled by Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Mehdi Darabi, a market analyst, said he believed that foreign pressures in recent months caused \u201cexpectations for the possibility of a decrease in oil sales and more inflation, and it caused a higher rate for hard currencies,\u201d according to Tehran\u2019s Donay-e-Eqtesad economic newspaper.",
      "Economic upheavals have evaporated the public\u2019s savings, pushing average Iranians into holding onto hard currencies, gold, cars and other tangible wealth. Others pursue cryptocurrencies or fall into get-rich-quick schemes.",
      "Meanwhile, internal political pressure remains inflamed still over the mandatory hijab, or headscarf, with women still ignoring the law on the streets of Tehran. Rumors also persist over the government potentially increasing the cost of subsidized gasoline in the country, which has sparked nationwide protests in the past.",
      "The falling rial has put more pressure as well on Iranian reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian. In March, when the rate was 930,000 rials to the dollar, Iran\u2019s parliament impeached his finance minister, Abdolnasser Hemmati over the crashing rial and accusations of mismanagement.",
      "Anger over government spending also saw Pezeshkian fire his vice president in charge of parliamentary affairs, Shahram Dabiri, for taking a luxury cruise to Antarctica, state media reported. Though Dabiri reportedly used his own money for the trip with his wife, the Instagram photos posted of his trip angered an Iranian public scrapping by to survive.",
      "\u201cIn a situation where the economic pressures on people are huge and the number of deprived people is massive, expensive recreational trip by officials even by their own personal fund is not defendable and reasonable,\u201d Pezeshkian said in firing Dabiri, who so far hasn\u2019t offered any public explanation for his trip.",

The couple formed their band Mali\u2019s Blind Couple in 1980, making their mark locally and internationally.",

      "Construction of a new pier to accommodate much larger ships, a dry dock for repairs and other features was completed in recent weeks at the Ream Naval Base in southern Cambodia, on the Gulf of Thailand.",
      "The project has drawn great attention mainly because Washington \u2014 noting that China is Cambodia\u2019s closest ally and main source of investment and aid \u2014 believes that Beijing has been secretly granted special and exclusive privileges to use the base, a claim repeatedly denied by Cambodian officials.",
      "Hun Manet at the inauguration noted that the ceremony was taking place two weeks ahead of a visit to Cambodia by Chinese President Xi Jinping. He praised Xi\u2019s government for help in building the expansion and other projects, describing bilateral relations as good and strong.",
      "At the same time, he declared that the Ream base expansion was not hidden from other countries, and said warships from all friendly countries can visit the base and hold joint military exercises, except for very big warships that cannot be physically accommodated.",

      "China\u2019s Defense Ministry, in a statement issued in Beijing, said the China-Cambodia Ream Naval Base Joint Support and Training Center \u2014 part of the facility that was officially opened Saturday \u2014 will support a wide range of joint operations.",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 Europe vowed retaliation. China plotted tariffs of its own. Mexico scrambled to blunt the blow. But while the world's leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports, Argentina's right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "As part of his enthusiastic outreach to Trump, Argentine President Javier Milei flew from one of the planet's southernmost nations all the way to Palm Beach for 24 hours to receive an award honoring his libertarian agenda and, he'd hoped, to chat with Trump, who was also scheduled to attend the right-wing \u201cAmerican Patriot\u201d gala.",
      "\u201cMake Argentina Great Again!\u201d Milei bellowed from the ballroom stage at at Mar-a-Lago late Thursday.",

      "Whether Milei's staunch alliance with Trump can actually help crisis-stricken Argentina remains to be seen, analysts say.",
      "\u201cHe has a special relationship with Trump that has been good for him politically, but he needs to translate that into being good for the country economically,\u201d said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, director for the Americas at New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \u201cHe hasn't managed to do that yet.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Milei pulled Argentina out of the World Health Organization after the U.S. announced its own exit.",
      "He threatened to quit the Paris climate accord after Trump did. He outlawed gender change treatments for minors after Trump banned transgender athletes from participating in women\u2019s sports.

      "While U.S. partners and rivals alike were criticizing Trump\u2019s tariffs, a tux-clad Milei was holding forth beside a painting of Trump\u2019s pumped fist, reveling in the opportunity to prove himself a dogged champion of the American president.",
      "\u201cAs you can see, we conduct policy with actions, not mere words, and on that we agree with President Donald Trump,\u201d Milei told the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, drawing cheers at the mention of the American president\u2019s name as he spoke in Spanish.",
      "In Buenos Aires, Milei's government sought to reconcile Trump's major round of tariffs with its own radical libertarian ideology and fervent support for free trade.",
      "\u201cWe do not believe this is an attack on free trade, quite the opposite,\u201d Milei\u2019s spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said of Trump's announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t see why there should be so much concern about this.\"",
      "For all the leaders' mutual flattery, Argentina was slapped with a 10% minimum tariff. But officials framed it as uniquely preferential treatment. The front page of Argentina\u2019s largest-circulation daily, Clar\u00edn, declared: \u201cTrump raises the tax on our products less than on other countries.\u201d",
      "In Washington, Argentine Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein on Thursday held what he described as \u201chighly productive\u201d meetings with top U.S. trade negotiator Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, releasing rosy statements promising that Argentina was on its way to negotiating a free-trade agreement with the U.S.",
      "Milei praised progress toward the free deal in his Mar-a-Lago speech. But far more important to the Argentine leader is a hoped-for $20 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The badly needed cash would help Milei keep his ambitious economic reforms on track as pressure mounts on the country's sparse foreign currency reserves.",
      "Milei has already used executive powers to remove the need for Congress to approve a new IMF program. But the loan hasn't cleared the finish line, with negotiators still haggling over how much cash Argentina, a serial defaulter that owes some $44 billion to the fund, will be allowed to access up-front.",
      "It was against this backdrop on Wednesday that Milei, accompanied by his economy minister, hopped on the plane to the U.S., the fund\u2019s biggest stakeholder. He told journalists he expected \u201can informal meeting\u201d with Trump, who was instrumental during his first term in helping Argentina secure a major $56 billion loan from the fund in 2018.",
      "But on Friday, Milei's much-anticipated photo-op with Trump was nowhere to be found in his publicist's slick montage of the Argentine president snapping selfies with fans on Mar-a-Lago's red carpet.",
      "The president's office said nothing about his meeting \u2014 or, nonmeeting \u2014 with Trump, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach very late Thursday evening after attending an event with professional golfers at one of his golf courses near Miami. The White House didn\u2019t say whether he and Milei met.",
      "Major Argentine newspapers cited anonymous officials saying the leaders never met, drawing instant scorn from his political enemies.",

      "FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- At a vast landfill in Sierra Leone 's capital of Freetown, smoke billows over decades of decomposing waste. Zainab sits there, squinting through the soot. It is her usual spot for buying kush, a cheap synthetic drug ravaging young people in the country.",
      "\u201cThis kush is so addictive,\" she said. \"If I don\u2019t smoke, I feel sick.\u201d",
      "Her current home, a shack of corrugated iron, contains only a tattered mattress where she brings her clients as a sex worker. She uses her income to sustain her drug addiction.",
      "She is one of many women in Sierra Leone who, as a result of social factors that include living conditions and stigma, have not benefited from intervention efforts after the government a year ago declared a public health emergency over rampant kush abuse. The declaration was meant to enforce criminal, public health and prevention measures to reverse the trend in Sierra Leone, as kush spreads to other parts of West Africa. The drug has been seized in Gambia, Senegal and Guinea.",
      "While officials say kush has become scarcer on the streets in Sierra Leone, critics say programs are still underfunded and inadequate.",
      "Despite new criminal, public health and prevention measures, only about 300 people have gone through the country\u2019s official rehab program, according to available data. Most have been men.",
      "Women have been less visible in the crisis. Rights groups say they are historically left out.",
      "Only one in 18 women with drug use disorders receive treatment compared to one in seven men, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The agency said women are usually more vulnerable to gender-based violence, economic discrimination and human rights violations.",
      "The situation is not so different in Sierra Leone where various advocacy groups spoke about how women are not as visible as men in coming forward to receive support and often do not get adequate help. Far more men, though, use drugs compared to women, experts say.",
      "Zainab said five years of smoking Kush has brought shame and isolation. She said no one has helped her, and spoke about days she gets so high that \u201cI did not know what was happening around me.\u201d",
      "But she wants to stop for her children. One night while at work, flames engulfed their home with the two infants inside. They survived, but she entrusted them to an orphanage, haunted by the fire.",
      "\u201cI would love to hear my children call me mummy again,\u201d she said, her scarred face breaking into a smile.",
      "Kush is a depressant. Its short, intense effect often leaves users senseless. Symptoms of addiction range from sores to psychosis. Liver, kidney and respiratory problems are common.",
      "The drug's evolving composition, low cost and widespread availability make it difficult to combat in Sierra Leone, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries. A recent report from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime earlier this year found that nearly half of kush samples tested contained opioids up to 25 times stronger than fentanyl. The drug's content were largely unknown before now, hindering response efforts, experts noted.",
      "Kadiatu Koroma with the local Women for Women Foundation nonprofit said her organization has seen a rise in drug use among women and girls in recent years.",
      "\u201cWhen they are very drowsy \u2026 men will just come and take advantage,\u201d she said. Left vulnerable after using the drug, the women \u201care impregnated and they don\u2019t even know the men who did it.\u201d",
      "At Sierra Leone's Kissy Psychiatric Hospital, health workers described encountering 25 different strains of the drug in the wider Freetown area.",
      "In one of two female wards, nurse Kadiatu Dumbuya said 90% of kush addicts she has attended to during her six years in the hospital have \"sold their body\u201d to feed the habit.",
      "And yet, among the 50 people \u2014 majority of whom are kush users \u2014 who filed into one of Sierra Leone\u2019s two government-run rehab centers on a recent day, only three were women.",
      "Only 300 people have accessed the seven-week program at the Hasting Military Center since it opened in February 2024, guarded by the military and surrounded by barbed wire. Just 40 of the beneficiaries are women.",
      "Officials say the program is gender-sensitive, with men and women separated by a fence. However, staff said stigma and family pressure mean women often deny their addictions and refrain from seeking support.",
      "\u201cIn most cases, we have 10% of girls that come to our attention. That doesn\u2019t mean the girls aren\u2019t addicts \u2026 they feel shy in their communities,\u201d said Ansu Konneh, who works with the Sierra Leone's Ministry of Social Welfare.",
      "\u201cIt is a drop in the ocean,\u201d he says.",
      "Due to funding challenges, an \u2018ambassador\u2019 program for recovered addicts from the center has stalled, and admissions were halted for five months. When it resumed, some of the parents on the 2,000 person-long waiting list said their children had died.",
      "Among those desperate for help was Melda Lansana, who said she visited the ministry several times to secure a rehab spot for her 18-year-old daughter, Khadija.",
      "\u201cWhen I was taking it, I couldn\u2019t wash, I couldn\u2019t take care of myself,\u201d Khadija said, recalling the relief of the days spent in the center last August.",
      "Without money for school, she struggles to get her life on track. Due to family tensions, she has chosen to live \u201con the streets\u201d with her boyfriend.",
      "She vows she\u2019s clean. Her mother suspects she\u2019s still using.",
      "Progress against kush is slow, much like other parts of the world where the fight against synthetic drugs is often difficult.",
      "Officials acknowledge the government has struggled to provide livelihood or business support to ease reintegration, particularly for beneficiaries without formal education - a step advocates say would help women.",
      "Last year's emergency declaration, lauded by civil society, has helped shift the approach from punishment to care but the response is only \"65% of what it should be,\u201d said Habib Kamara, director of the Social Linkages For Youth Development And Child Link, a local nonprofit involved in the fight against drug use.",
      "The organization is one of the few that have offered targeted support to female users, especially to vulnerable populations like sex workers, through community peer support, free family planning and beauty sessions to help build confidence.",
      "\u201cWe have to meet the women where they are,\u201d Kamara said.",
      "Marie Kamara, 19, rejected kush for another drug - Tramadol, which experts have warned is also dangerous. She saw kush as too risky and was put off by her friends' stench and oozing sores.",

      "With the upcoming canonization of its first millennial saint, the Catholic Church has turned to police in Italy to investigate the online sale of some purported relics of Carlo Acutis",
      "ASSISI, Italy -- With the upcoming canonization of its first millennial saint, the Catholic Church has turned to police in Italy to investigate the online sale of some purported relics of Carlo Acutis, who already has been drawing hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to his shrine.",
      "Since the early days of the faith, many Catholics have prayed for intercession to saints\u2019 relics \u2014 usually small parts of their body or clothing that are authenticated by ecclesiastical authorities and preserved in churches. But their sale is strictly forbidden.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just despicable, but it\u2019s also a sin,\u201d said the Rev. Enzo Fortunato, who leads the Vatican\u2019s World Children\u2019s Day committee and has a tiny fragment of Acutis\u2019 hair in a chapel by his office for veneration by visiting youth. \u201cEvery kind of commerce over faith is a sin.\u201d",
      "An anonymous seller had put up for online auction some supposedly authenticated locks of Acutis' hair that were fetching upward of 2,000 euros ($2,200 US), according to the Diocese of Assisi, before being taken down. Last month, Bishop Domenico Sorrentino asked authorities to confiscate the items and added that if fraudulent, the sale would constitute a \u201cgreat offense to religious belief.\u201d",
      "Acutis died of leukemia in 2006, when he was only 15 but had already developed a precocious faith life centered on devotion to the Eucharist \u2014 which for Catholics holds the real presence of Christ. Savvy with technology, he had created an online exhibit about eucharistic miracles through the centuries.",
      "He will formally be declared a saint at a Mass in front of the Vatican\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Basilica on April 27. Over the past year, about 1 million pilgrims have flocked to the central Italian town of Assisi, where his body \u2014 wearing sneakers, jeans, and a sweatshirt \u2014 lies in a shrine in a church dedicated to a key moment in the life of medieval hometown saint, St. Francis.",
      "Acutis\u2019 body was exhumed during the more-than-decade-long canonization process and treated so it could be preserved for public showing, including by removing certain organs. His face, which looks as if he were asleep, was reconstructed with a silicone mask, Sorrentino said.",
      "Acutis\u2019 heart has been preserved at a dedicated altar in another Assisi church; it will be taken to Rome for the canonization Mass.",
      "\u201cThe relics are little, little fragments of the body, to say that that body is blessed, and it explains to us the closeness of God,\u201d Sorrentino said.",
      "There are different \u201cclasses\u201d of relics \u2014 the most important are major body parts, such as the heart. Sorrentino gave Acutis' pericardium \u2014 the membrane enclosing the heart \u2014 to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2022 for the duration of its multi-year Eucharistic Revival.",
      "The bishop in charge of the saint\u2019s body works with requests from other bishops around the world to give or lend relics \u2014 always for free \u2014 to be exhibited for veneration at parishes and other churches.",
      "\u201cWe give this to communities, to parishes, to priests using the relics for the cult in their parish,\u201d Sorrentino said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something magic. It\u2019s not something that works automatically, it works through faith.\u201d",
      "The practice of gathering relics dates to the earliest days of the church, when many faithful Christians died as martyrs in religious persecutions. Witnesses to the killings would collect blood or fragments of clothing to memorialize their sacrifice and to pray for the saints\u2019 intercession, Fortunato said.",
      "In Acutis\u2019 case, the first miracle in his canonization process was the healing of a boy in Brazil after a prayer service invoking his intercession with the presence of a relic, he added.",
      "For clergy and pilgrims who have been visiting Acutis\u2019 shrine in Assisi this week, the relics take second place to the example of faith and the power of assisting with prayer that saints provide.",
      "\u201cI would never buy one,\u201d said Amelia Simone, an 18-year-old from Chicago who has been studying in Rome and credits Acutis for help smoothing out tricky visa paperwork. \u201cI think the intercession aspect is very cool, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever want to own a first-class relic. It just would feel a bit weird to me.\u201d",
      "Two clergy leading a Holy Year pilgrimage to Italy from the Diocese of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, said it was \u201ca great tragedy\u201d that online relic sales were happening.",
      "\u201cWe continue to pray for people\u2019s conversion,\u201d said the Rev. Christopher Pujol.",
      "Bishop Larry Kulick added that relics \u201care very reverent and very solemn for us as Catholics. And they are not only inspirational for us, but they are really ... opportunities to help us to pray.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so it\u2019s unfortunate that such a thing would happen, because that\u2019s really a misuse of the relics and actually a disrespect to him and to his memory,\u201d he added.",
      "Already, the uncommon devotion and attention that Acutis' canonization process has generated has been met with some skepticism. In hundreds of social media comments to a recent Associated Press article about the phenomenon, some called his sainthood a marketing ploy by the church to lure more young people back into the pews.",
      "Many others \u2014 and those making pilgrimage to Assisi \u2014 praised Acutis for his devotion and were glad he\u2019s become a role model for members of his generation.",
      "\u201cIt's a joy for me to have encountered Carlo Acutis' body, and especially to ask for his intercession for the transformation and the conversion of many youth,\u201d said Juana de Dios Euceda, a missionary nun from Honduras.",

      "Some of the more than a dozen states that cover the high cost of GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy, Ozempic and Zepbound through Medicaid or state employee insurance programs are scrambling to lessen the budgetary squeeze from fast-rising costs",
      "States increasingly struggling to cover the rising cost of popular GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy, Ozempic and Zepbound are searching for ways to get out from under the budgetary squeeze that took them by surprise.",
      "One solution some policymakers may try is restricting the number of people on Medicaid who can use the pricey diabetes drugs for weight-loss purposes.",
      "Pennsylvania's Medicaid coverage of the drugs is expected to cost $1.3 billion in 2025 \u2014 up from a fraction of that several years ago \u2014 and is contributing to projections of a multibillion-dollar budget deficit. The state is thinking about requiring Medicaid patients who want to use GLP-1s for weight loss to meet a certain number on the body-mass index or try diet and exercise programs or less expensive medications first.",
      "\u201cIt is a medication that\u2019s gotten a lot of hype and a lot of press, and has become very popular in its use and it is wildly expensive,\u201d Dr. Val Arkoosh, Pennsylvania\u2019s human services secretary, told a state House hearing in March.",
      "At least 14 states already cover the cost of GLP-1 medications for obesity treatment for patients on Medicaid, the federal health care program for people with low incomes. Democrats and Republicans in at least a half-dozen other states floated bills this year to require the same coverage, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "Some bills have stalled while others remain alive, including a proposal in Arkansas requiring GLP-1s to be covered under Medicaid when prescribed specifically for weight loss. Iowa lawmakers are thinking about ordering a cost-benefit analysis before making the commitment. Already, West Virginia and North Carolina ended programs in 2024 that provided coverage for state employees, citing cost concerns.",
      "\u201cIt is very expensive,\u201d said Jeffrey Beckham, the state budget director in Connecticut, where Medicaid coverage of the drugs for weight loss may be scrapped entirely. \u201cOther states are coming to that conclusion, as well as some private carriers.\u201d",
      "Overall Medicaid spending on GLP-1 drugs \u2014 before partial rebates from drug manufacturers \u2014 jumped from $577.3 million in 2019 to $3.9 billion in 2023, according to a November report from KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. The number of prescriptions for the drugs increased by more than 400% during that same time period. The average annual cost per patient for a GLP-1 drug is $12,000, according to a Peterson-KFF tracker.",
      "About half of Americans \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favor having Medicare and Medicaid cover weight-loss drugs for people who have obesity, a recent AP-NORC poll showed, with about 2 in 10 opposed the idea and about one-quarter with a neutral view.",
      "But Medicare does not cover GLP-1s, and the Trump administration said Friday that wouldn't put into place a proposed rule by presidential predecessor Joe Biden to cover the medications under Medicare\u2019s Part D prescription drug coverage. Biden\u2019s proposal was expensive: It would have included coverage for all state- and federally funded Medicaid programs, costing taxpayers as much as $35 billion over next decade.",
      "States that do provide coverage have tried to manage costs by putting prescribing limits on the GLP-1s. There's also some evidence that if Medicaid patients lose weight with the drugs, they'll be healthier and less expensive to cover, said Tracy Zvenyach of Obesity Action, an advocacy group that urges states to provide coverage.",
      "Zvenyach also stressed how it's unclear whether patients will need to regularly take these drugs for the rest of their lives \u2014 a key cost concern raised by public officials. \u201cSomeone may have to be on treatment for over the course of their lifetime,\" she said. \"But we don\u2019t know exactly what that regimen would look like.\u201d",
      "About 40% of adults in the U.S. have obesity, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Obesity can cause hypertension, Type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol, which lead to greater risks of things like stroke and heart attacks.",
      "Dr. Adam Raphael Rom, a physician at Greater Philadelphia Health Action, a network of health centers in the city, said most of his patients who take GLP-1s are covered by Medicaid and some are non-diabetics who use it for weight loss.",
      "\u201cI had one patient tell me that it\u2019s like, changed her relationship to food,\" Rom said. \u201cI\u2019ve had patients lose like 20, 40, 60 pounds.\"",
      "But obesity experts have told The Associated Press that as many as 1 in 5 people may not lose the amount of weight that others have seen come off. And in a recent survey of state Medicaid directors conducted by KFF, a health policy research organization, they said cost and potential side effects are among their concerns.",
      "The debate over coverage coincides with rising Medicaid budgets and the prospect of losing federal funding \u2014 with congressional Republicans considering siphoning as much as $880 billion from Medicaid over the next decade.",
      "Connecticut is facing a $290 million Medicaid account deficit, and Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont proposed doing away with a 2023 requirement that Medicaid cover GLP-1s for severe obesity, though the state has never fully abided by the law due to the cost.",
      "Starting June 14, though, state Medicaid patients will be required to have a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis to get the drugs covered. Lamont also is pushing for the state to cover two less expensive oral medications approved by the FDA for weight loss, as well as nutrition counseling.",
      "Sarah Makowicki, 42, tried the other medications and said she suffered serious side effects. The graduate student and statehouse intern is working on a bill that would restore the full GLP-1 coverage for her and others.",
      "Sara Lamontagne, a transgender woman with a disability who is on Medicaid, said she regained weight when her coverage for GLP-1 medication was cut off in the past. She said she went from 260 pounds to over 300, heavier than she had ever been.",
      "\u201cSo, it\u2019s a horrible game to be played, to be going back and and forth,\u201d said Lamontagne, whose attempts to appeal the state's recent denial of her Ozempic prescription refill have been unsuccessful.",
      "Makowicki said GLP-1 drugs combined with weight-loss surgery helped her change her life: She's had knee-replacement surgery and lost over 200 pounds.",

      "The biggest-ticket implications of President Donald Trump's tariff blitz understandably gain the most attention",
      "NEW YORK -- Economy Candy\u2019s shelves brim with sweets from around the world \u2013 gummies from Germany, lollipops from Spain, chocolates from Japan and a panoply of candies from across the U.S.",
      "Standing amid it all, columns of bright jellybeans to his left and exotic Kit Kats to his right, owner Mitchell Cohen is quick with his assessment of how many of this shop\u2019s 2,000-plus items are affected by the historic round of tariffs announced by President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cI think all of them,\u201d Cohen says at his store on New York's Lower East Side.",
      "Few corners of the American economy are untouched, directly or indirectly, by the sweeping tariffs being imposed by Trump. Even a little store like Economy Candy.",
      "Cohen had just begun to feel a barrage of inflation-driven price increases from suppliers ease when the tariff threats arrived. For a business with a name like Economy Candy, he wants to remain affordable but fears how high some prices may have to climb in the coming months.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s gonna be another round of this hyperinflation on some items,\u201d says 39-year-old Cohen. \u201cIf we\u2019re putting tariffs everywhere, it is going to go up.\u201d",
      "Stepping into Economy Candy feels like a time warp. Its name is emblazoned on a sign in a vintage, blaring red script, and crossing below its green-and-white striped awning, past the bins of Smarties, butterscotches and Lemonheads in the front window, an indecipherable sweetness fills the air, oldies music sounds overhead and customers mill around stacks of candy bars they forgot still existed.",
      "It represents just a blip in the country\u2019s $54 billion candy industry. But it was already feeling the weight of surges in prices of cocoa and other ingredients before tariffs were layered on.",
      "Candy and gum prices are up about 34% from five years ago and 89% from 2005, according to Consumer Price Index data. Price, according to the National Confectioners Association, has become the top factor in consumers\u2019 candy purchase decisions, outweighing a buyer's mood.",
      "About a third of Economy Candy\u2019s products are imported, crowded on shelves and tables near the store\u2019s rear. There aren\u2019t just \u201cmore German Haribo varieties than the Haribo store in Germany,\u201d as Cohen claims, but gummies the brand makes in France, Austria and Britain.",
      "They have every Milka bar they can find in Switzerland, every type of Leone hard candies that Italy churns out and as many exotic Kit Kats from Japan as they can fit.",
      "On products like these, the tariffs\u2019 toll is obvious.",
      "Pistachio Snickers bars are from India, now subject to 26% tariffs, while passion fruit mousse Snickers are from Portugal, now under the 20% European Union levies.",
      "But even an American-made Snickers isn\u2019t immune.",
      "While the bars may roll off conveyors in Texas, they rely on ingredients from around the globe. Sourcemap, which tracks supply chains, says Snickers bars are made with chocolate from Guyana, peanuts from Argentina and sugar from Brazil, wrapped up in packaging from Canada. All are now subjected to varying levels of tariffs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ingredients in there that have to come from other countries,\u201d says Andreas Waldkirch, an economics professor at Colby College who teaches a class on international trade. \u201cUnless you\u2019re talking about something very simple from your local farmers market, almost every product relies on ingredients from elsewhere. Those indirect costs are really what\u2019s going to drive up prices.\u201d",
      "The story repeats with American candies across the store \u2013 the boxes of Nerds and bags of Sugar Babies and rolls of Smarties are all inextricably tied to the global supply chain.",
      "A table teeming with those domestic delicacies takes center stage near Economy Candy\u2019s entrance. Cohen took over the store from his parents, who took it over from their parents before. He got his first haircut in the store. He was behind the register as a child. He took his wife by on their first date.",
      "As a kid, everything on the store\u2019s centerpiece table of American treats cost 59 cents. By 2020, the price was $1.29, but customers who bought a whole box paid a discounted rate of $1 per piece.",
      "Now, Cohen can\u2019t even get them wholesale at that price.",
      "Today, he sells the items on the table for $1.59. Cohen calls the selection a \u201closs leader\u201d but thinks it's important to showcase his store's affordability. Once the tariffs are fully implemented, he\u2019s not sure he\u2019ll be able to put off price increases.",
      "\u201cWhen your margins are coming down and your dollar doesn\u2019t go as far at the end of the day, you really start to feel it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want anyone to come into Economy Candy and not think that it\u2019s economical.\u201d",
      "The biggest-ticket implications of the tariff blitz understandably gain the most attention \u2013 the thousands of dollars a car\u2019s price tag may grow, the tens of thousands that disappear from a retirement account in a single day. But here among the root beer barrels and licorice strands, you're reminded that small-dollar items are affected too, and so are the families selling them.",
      "At its birth, the business Cohen\u2019s grandfather started focused on shoe and hat repairs. But in the wake of the Great Depression, when few in a neighborhood of crowded tenements had money for such fixes, the business pivoted.",
      "Candy, once relegated to a cart out front, took over the store.",
      "In the 88 years since, business hasn't always been Chuckles and Zagnuts. The Sept. 11 attacks kept tourists away and had sales sagging and the pandemic closed the store and forced it to pivot to online sales.",
      "If tariffs upend things, Cohen isn\u2019t sure how he might adapt again. He sells products that aren\u2019t made in America and he sells American products made with ingredients from across the globe. He had just been making headway on beginning international sales, but the web of tariff rules may make it impossible.",
      "The average U.S. tariff could rise to nearly 25% if the import taxes Trump put on goods from dozens of countries are fully implemented Wednesday. That would be the highest rate in more than a century, including tariffs widely blamed for worsening the Great Depression.",
      "Trump said imposing the tariffs amounted to a \u201cliberation day\u201d for a country that has been \u201clooted, pillaged, raped and plundered\u201d by friend and foe alike, insisting it was \u201cvery, very good news\u201d for the U.S.",
      "Cohen isn't sure how that can be true for a business like his.",
      "\u201cI can understand bringing manufacturing and bringing things back to America, but you know, we rely on raw materials that just aren\u2019t native to our country,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like I can get a green tea Japanese Kit Kat from an American company.\u201d",
      "As Cohen stood before mounds of strawberry candies in shiny wrappers and little cubes of caramel in cellophane, the first word of the tariff\u2019s concrete impact on him arrived. A French supplier emailed saying it was immediately imposing a 5% surcharge due to the tariffs, expressing regret for the move and hope that \u201cthe situation will be resolved swiftly.\u201d",
      "Cohen wore a smile anyway. He wants this to be a happy place for visitors.",
      "\u201cYou travel back to a time when nothing mattered,\u201d Cohen says, \"when you didn\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us,\u201d Giorgetti said. \u201cOur message is that we need to avoid pushing the panic button. \u2026 We are following a pragmatic and rational approach.\u201d",

      "While the world\u2019s leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports, Argentina\u2019s right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 Europe vowed retaliation. China plotted tariffs of its own. Mexico scrambled to blunt the blow. But while the world's leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports, Argentina's right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "As part of his enthusiastic outreach to Trump, Argentine President Javier Milei flew from one of the planet's southernmost nations all the way to Palm Beach for 24 hours to receive an award honoring his libertarian agenda and, he'd hoped, to chat with Trump, who was also scheduled to attend the right-wing \u201cAmerican Patriot\u201d gala.",
      "\u201cMake Argentina Great Again!\u201d Milei bellowed from the ballroom stage at at Mar-a-Lago late Thursday.",
      "It would have been the fourth face-to-face meeting between the leaders since Trump's election victory last November as President Milei, who has imposed a sweeping austerity program to fix Argentina's long troubled economy, offers himself as one of Trump's strongest allies in the global culture war against the \u201cwoke\u201d left.",
      "Whether Milei's staunch alliance with Trump can actually help crisis-stricken Argentina remains to be seen, analysts say.",
      "\u201cHe has a special relationship with Trump that has been good for him politically, but he needs to translate that into being good for the country economically,\u201d said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, director for the Americas at New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \u201cHe hasn't managed to do that yet.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Milei pulled Argentina out of the World Health Organization after the U.S. announced its own exit.",
      "He threatened to quit the Paris climate accord after Trump did. He outlawed gender change treatments for minors after Trump banned transgender athletes from participating in women\u2019s sports. He even promoted a cryptocurrency token echoing the $Trump memecoin \u2014 at great political cost.",
      "Railing against socialism and feminism at speaking events all over the world \u2014 most recently, the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he gifted Elon Musk a giant chain saw modeled after the power tool he wielded during his 2023 campaign \u2014 Milei has fashioned himself into something of a MAGA celebrity.",
      "While U.S. partners and rivals alike were criticizing Trump\u2019s tariffs, a tux-clad Milei was holding forth beside a painting of Trump\u2019s pumped fist, reveling in the opportunity to prove himself a dogged champion of the American president.",
      "\u201cAs you can see, we conduct policy with actions, not mere words, and on that we agree with President Donald Trump,\u201d Milei told the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, drawing cheers at the mention of the American president\u2019s name as he spoke in Spanish.",
      "In Buenos Aires, Milei's government sought to reconcile Trump's major round of tariffs with its own radical libertarian ideology and fervent support for free trade.",
      "\u201cWe do not believe this is an attack on free trade, quite the opposite,\u201d Milei\u2019s spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said of Trump's announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t see why there should be so much concern about this.\"",
      "For all the leaders' mutual flattery, Argentina was slapped with a 10% minimum tariff. But officials framed it as uniquely preferential treatment. The front page of Argentina\u2019s largest-circulation daily, Clar\u00edn, declared: \u201cTrump raises the tax on our products less than on other countries.\u201d",
      "In Washington, Argentine Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein on Thursday held what he described as \u201chighly productive\u201d meetings with top U.S. trade negotiator Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, releasing rosy statements promising that Argentina was on its way to negotiating a free-trade agreement with the U.S.",
      "Milei praised progress toward the free deal in his Mar-a-Lago speech. But far more important to the Argentine leader is a hoped-for $20 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The badly needed cash would help Milei keep his ambitious economic reforms on track as pressure mounts on the country's sparse foreign currency reserves.",
      "Milei has already used executive powers to remove the need for Congress to approve a new IMF program. But the loan hasn't cleared the finish line, with negotiators still haggling over how much cash Argentina, a serial defaulter that owes some $44 billion to the fund, will be allowed to access up-front.",
      "It was against this backdrop on Wednesday that Milei, accompanied by his economy minister, hopped on the plane to the U.S., the fund\u2019s biggest stakeholder. He told journalists he expected \u201can informal meeting\u201d with Trump, who was instrumental during his first term in helping Argentina secure a major $56 billion loan from the fund in 2018.",
      "But on Friday, Milei's much-anticipated photo-op with Trump was nowhere to be found in his publicist's slick montage of the Argentine president snapping selfies with fans on Mar-a-Lago's red carpet.",
      "The president's office said nothing about his meeting \u2014 or, nonmeeting \u2014 with Trump, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach very late Thursday evening after attending an event with professional golfers at one of his golf courses near Miami. The White House didn\u2019t say whether he and Milei met.",
      "Major Argentine newspapers cited anonymous officials saying the leaders never met, drawing instant scorn from his political enemies.",
      "\u201cWhen I woke up, I thought I'd find on TV the photo-op with your \u2018friend\u2019 Trump that you went looking for,\" left-wing former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner wrote on social media. \u201cWhat a way to mess around and spend money on nothing.\u201d",

      "The protest began as Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman was presenting product updates and a long-term vision for the company's AI assistant product, Copilot, to an audience that included Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and former CEO Steve Ballmer.",
      "\u201cMustafa, shame on you,\u201d shouted Microsoft employee Ibtihal Aboussad as she walked toward the stage and Suleyman paused his speech. \u201cYou claim that you care about using AI for good but Microsoft sells AI weapons to the Israeli military. Fifty-thousand people have died and Microsoft powers this genocide in our region.\u201d",
      "\u201cThank you for your protest, I hear you,\u201d Suleyman said. Aboussad continued, shouting that Suleyman and \u201call of Microsoft\u201d had blood on their hands. She also threw onto the stage a keffiyeh scarf, which has become a symbol of support for Palestinian people, before being escorted out of the event.",
      "A second protester, Microsoft employee Vaniya Agrawal, interrupted another part of the celebration during which Gates, Ballmer and current CEO Satya Nadella were on stage \u2014 the first public gathering since 2014 of the three men who have been Microsoft's CEO.",
      "An investigation by The Associated Press revealed earlier this year that AI models from Microsoft and OpenAI had been used as part of an Israeli military program to select bombing targets during the recent wars in Gaza and Lebanon. The story also contained details of an errant Israeli airstrike in 2023 that struck a vehicle carrying members of a Lebanese family, killing three young girls and their grandmother.",
      "In February, five Microsoft employees were ejected from a meeting with Nadella for protesting the contracts. While the February event was an internal meeting, Friday's protest was far more public \u2014 a livestreamed showcase of the company's past and future. Some employees also rallied outside the event Friday.",
      "\u201cWe provide many avenues for all voices to be heard,\" said a statement from the company Friday. \u201cImportantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption. If that happens, we ask participants to relocate. We are committed to ensuring our business practices uphold the highest standards.\u201d",
      "Microsoft declined to say whether it was taking further action. Aboussad told the AP she hasn't yet heard anything from the company but she and Agrawal both lost access to their work accounts after the protest and have not been able to log back in, a possible indication that they were being fired.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Government staffing cuts have gutted a small U.S. health agency that aims to protect workers \u2014 drawing rebukes from firefighters, coal miners, medical equipment manufacturers and a range of others.",
      "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a Cincinnati-based agency that is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is losing about 850 of its approximately 1,000 employees, according to estimates from a union and affected employees. Among those ousted were its director, Dr. John Howard, who had been in the job through three previous presidential administrations.",
      "The layoffs are stalling \u2014 and perhaps ending \u2014 many programs, including a firefighter cancer registry and a lab that is key to certifying respirators for many industries.",
      "The cuts are \u201ca very pointed attack on workers in this country,\u201d said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, vice president of the union local representing NIOSH employees in Cincinnati.",
      "Unions that represent miners, nurses, flight attendants and other professions have criticized the cuts, saying it will slow the identification and prevention of workplace dangers. Rallies in Cincinnati and other cities drew not only fired CDC employees but also members of unions representing teachers, postal workers and bricklayers, Niemeier-Walsh said.",
      "NIOSH doctors review and certify that 9/11 first responders who developed chronic illnesses could qualify for care under the federal government\u2019s World Trade Center Health Program, noted Andrew Ansbro, president of a union that represents New York City firefighters.",
      "\u201cDismantling NIOSH dishonors the memory of our fallen brothers and sisters and abandons those still battling 9/11-related illnesses,\u201d Ansbro said in a statement.",
      "NIOSH was created under a 1970 law signed by President Richard Nixon. It started operations the following year and grew to have offices and labs in eight cities, including Cincinnati; Pittsburgh; Spokane, Washington; and Morgantown, West Virginia.",
      "In the more than 50 years since, it has done pioneering research on indoor air quality in office buildings, workplace violence and occupational exposures to bloodborne infections.",
      "NIOSH investigators identified a new lung disease in workers at factories that made microwave popcorn, and helped assess what went wrong during the Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster. It was recently involved in the CDC's response to measles, advising on measures to stop spread within hospitals.",
      "Some of its best-known work is related to mining. It trains and certifies doctors in how to test for black lung disease, and the agency conducts its own mobile screenings of miners. For years, NIOSH owned an experimental mine in Pennsylvania and two years ago announced it was developing a replacement research facility near Mace, West Virginia, that would feature tunnels and other mine structures.",
      "Its research and recommendations have served as the foundation for Department of Labor rules for worker protection, including one issued last year for coal miners that cuts by half the permissible exposures to poisonous silica dust.",
      "Studies have concluded NIOSH research helps the nation save millions of dollars each year in avoided workers\u2019 compensation and other costs.",
      "\u201cAny stoppage to this type of research and recommendations can impact all segments of the workforce,\u201d said Tessa Bonney, who teaches about occupational health at the University of Illinois at Chicago.",
      "NIOSH was swept up in the massive upheaval at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that includes about 10,000 layoffs, an anticipated reorganization and proposed budget cuts.",
      "Nonunionized NIOSH workers \u2014 mainly supervisors \u2014 were told to clean out their desks immediately. Bargaining unit employees got layoff notices, and were told their terminations would happen later this year.",
      "\u201cRight now we are trying to figure out chain of command,\u201d Niemeier-Walsh said.",
      "An HHS spokesman, Andrew Nixon, said what\u2019s left of NIOSH will be moved into a newly created agency to be called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said that 20% of the people laid off from federal health agencies might be reinstated as the agency tries to correct mistakes, but the department has not detailed which parts of NIOSH were reduced or eliminated, and which will remain open.",
      "What\u2019s known about the cuts made so far was pieced together by employees affected by the layoffs and the union that represents them. They say almost every NIOSH program faced steep cuts or outright elimination.",
      "A firefighter cancer registry website went down Tuesday \u201cbecause there were no IT people left to staff the system,\u201d Niemeier-Walsh said.",
      "And at least some of the hundreds of mice and rats at a NIOSH lab in Morgantown likely will have to be destroyed because the layoffs put an abrupt, mid-experiment end to inhalation research there, said Cathy Tinney-Zara, a public health analyst who is president of the union local representing employees there.",
      "\u201cMillion of dollars of research, decades of research, is going down the drain,\u201d Tinney-Zara said.",
      "Some of the outcry from unions and industry has centered on the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, a NIOSH office that tests and certifies fitted masks that protect workers from inhaling airborne dangers. (The N95 masks that became popular during the COVID-19 outbreak are named for a NIOSH standard.)",
      "Closing the lab gives a competitive advantage to companies in China and other countries that send products to the U.S. without meeting the stringent quality standards that come with certification, said Eric Axel, executive director of the American Medical Manufacturers Association.",
      "\u201cThis decision effectively rewards foreign manufacturers who have not made the same investments in quality and safety while punishing American companies that have built their reputations on producing reliable, high-quality protective equipment,\u201d Axel said in a statement.",
      "The cuts are \u201creally devastating,\u201d said Rebecca Shelton, director of policy for the Appalachian Citizens\u2019 Law Center, a Kentucky-based organization that provides legal help to ill coal miners.",
      "\u201cHere in central Appalachia, everybody knows somebody with black lung disease,\u201d she said.",
      "It appears NIOSH programs for coal miners are being eliminated, raising questions about who will monitor for new cases and spot trends, Shelton said.",
      "NIOSH staff routinely visited mines and rural communities to offer free screenings and speak at public meetings about black lung disease and other workplace health issues.",
      "\u201cThese are not out-of-touch federal workers. They are very well connected\u201d with their communities, she said.",
      "Many NIOSH workers come from families that have worked in occupational health for generations. Niemeier-Walsh\u2019s grandfather was an agency toxicologist for 30 years.",
      "\u201cIt was normal dinnertime conversation in our family to talk about how you can use the power of science to protect workers,\u201d she said.",

      "Industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers are seeking blanket exemptions from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene",
      "WASHINGTON -- Industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers are seeking blanket exemptions from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene.",
      "The request by the American Chemistry Council and the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers comes as the Trump administration offers industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from rules imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA has set up an electronic mailbox to allow regulated companies to request a two-year presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules.",
      "The chemistry council and the petrochemical group said in a letter Monday to the EPA that regulation of the chemical industry is supposed to be based on sound science and \u201creflect a reasonable assessment of the risks and benefits involved.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d the groups wrote, an EPA rule on air pollution from stationary sources \u201cundermines those important objectives and advances improper and significantly costly requirements on an unworkable timeline.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press obtained a copy of the letter on Friday.",
      "Costs for the rule\u2019s risk-related requirements alone could exceed $50 billion, the groups said, \u201csignificantly more than the $1.8 billion for the full rule that EPA estimated at final publication\u201d last year.",
      "Environmental groups have denounced the administration\u2019s offer to grant industry exemptions, calling the new email address a \u201cpolluters\u2019 portal\u201d that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Exemptions would be allowed for nine EPA rules issued under former President Joe Biden, including limits on mercury, ethylene oxide and other hazardous air pollutants. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother\u2019s womb.",
      "The Environmental Defense Fund accused the chemical and petrochemical companies \u2014 which include giants such as ExxonMobil, Marathon Petroleum, Chevron, Dow and DuPont \u2014 of \u201chiding behind their associations to get a presidential exemption from pollution safeguards that keep our kids healthy and safe.\u201d",
      "New EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin \u201chas opened a back door for hundreds of companies to avoid complying with reasonable limits on the most toxic forms of air pollution, and they\u2019re rushing through it with no regard for the communities around them,'' said Vickie Patton, the group's general counsel.",
      "Granting the exemption would be \u201ca huge blow to American families who now must worry about their loved ones breathing dirtier air, their kids missing more school days because of asthma attacks and more cancer in their families,\u201d Patton said. \"There is no basis in U.S. clean air laws \u2014 and in decency \u2014 for this absolute free pass to pollute.\u201d",
      "EDF has filed a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act for all records related to the EPA portal \u2014 including the names of those seeking exemptions \u2014 and pledged to go to court to obtain the records if necessary and make them public.",
      "The EPA's offer to grant exemptions marks at least the third time Zeldin has moved to weaken enforcement of environmental laws since he took office less than two months ago. He previously announced a series of actions to roll back landmark environmental regulations, including rules on pollution from coal-fired power plants, climate change and electric vehicles.",
      "Zeldin also said he would push for a 65% spending cut at the agency, and has moved to drastically reduce EPA staffing. The agency is considering a plan to eliminate its scientific research office and has sought to claw back $20 billion in \u201cgreen bank\u201d grants approved by the Biden administration to promote clean energy.",
      "Use of presidential exemptions to EPA rule is rare, although Biden offered some last year after tightening emission standards for ethylene oxide from commercial facilities that sterilize medical equipment.",
      "The EPA directed questions about the possible exemptions to the White House, noting that authority for any exemption rests with the president. White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said no decisions have been made, but said, \u201cwe can confirm President Trump\u2019s commitment to unleashing American energy, protecting our national security interests and ensuring environmental stewardship.\u201d",
      "The chemistry council said in a statement Friday that its members \u201cgreatly appreciate the current administration\u2019s willingness to offer a pathway for relief from the unrealistic timelines\u201d set by the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to working expeditiously with EPA throughout this process to develop appropriate, science-based requirements that help protect public health and safety without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on domestic manufacturers that would undermine our national security and American competitiveness,\u201d the statement said.",

      "The Senate is diving into a contentious late-night \u2014 or all-night \u2014 debate on a budget plan critical to Republican efforts to pass trillions of dollars in tax cuts and boost border security and defense spending",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senators dived into a contentious late night \u2014 or all-night \u2014 debate Friday over a Republican budget plan that's central to President Donald Trump's agenda for trillions of dollars in tax breaks and boosts to border security and defense spending, all while slashing other government spending.",
      "It could not have come at a more difficult political moment. The U.S. economy is churning over Trump's vast tariff scheme sent stocks plummeting, and experts are warning of soaring costs for consumers at home and threats of a potential recession. Even some Republicans have expressed concerns.",
      "But GOP leaders with a nod from Trump are determined to march ahead, pushing past a hardened line of opposition from Democrats, who are unified as they decry tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of federal programs Americans rely on. Approval, expected by Saturday morning, would give Republicans the chance in coming months to muscle a tax cut bill through both chambers of Congress, just as they did in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "\u201cLet the voting begin,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",
      "The evening kicked off what's called vote-a-rama as Democrats are intent on making the effort as politically painful as possible, with all-night votes on dozens of amendments to the package that GOP senators will have to defend before next year\u2019s midterm elections. Among them are proposals to ban tax breaks for the super-wealthy and to halt Trump\u2019s tariff policies and efforts to shrink the federal government.",
      "Democrats accused Republicans of laying the groundwork for increasing deficits and cutting key safety net programs such as Medicaid and nutritional assistance to help pay for tax cuts they say disproportionately benefit the rich.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said, \u201cTrump's policies are a disaster,\" as is Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. \u201cRepublicans could snuff it out tonight, if they wanted.\u201d",
      "None of the many proposals from Democrats are expected to pass as Republicans use their majority to swat them back. The Republicans are framing their work as preventing a tax increase for most American families, arguing that unless Congress acts, the individual and estate tax cuts that Republicans passed in 2017 will expire at the end of this year.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, the No.-2 ranking GOP senator, said voters gave Republicans a mission and a mandate in November, and the Senate budget plan delivers.",
      "\u201cIt fulfills our promises to secure the border, to rebuild our economy and to restore peace through strength,\u201d Barrasso said.",
      "Throughout the day, the debate was generally one-sided, as Democrats were taking full advantage of 25 hours of their available debate time, while Republicans yielded much of theirs in order to get to the all-night voting frenzy.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif, warned that Trump and Musk \u201cdo not care about you. They care about their billionaire buddies.\u201d",
      "One Republican, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, expressed his own misgivings about tax breaks adding to the federal deficits and said he has assurances that Trump officials would seek the cuts elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThis vote isn\u2019t taking place in a vacuum,\u201d he said, a nod to the turmoil over Trump's tariffs.",
      "And Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the lone vote of opposition to the plan so far, questioned the math being used by his colleagues that he said would pile on the debt load. \u201cSomething's fishy,\u201d he said.",
      "If the Senate is able to to approve the measure, as expected, it next goes to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson has already approved his chamber's version and will need to hold his slim majority together to merge the two plans.",
      "The House budget plan provided for $4.5 trillion in tax breaks over 10 years, though the amount for tax breaks would shrink if the spending cut totals don\u2019t get to $2 trillion in savings.",
      "The Senate\u2019s budget plan allows for extending the tax cuts under a scoring method that treats them as not adding to future deficits, even though a new estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation projects they will add $5.5 trillion over the next decade when including interest, and $4.6 trillion not including interest.",
      "On top of that, the budget plan allows an additional $1.5 trillion to include some of Trump\u2019s campaign promises, such as no taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and overtime. Republicans are also looking to increase the $10,000 deduction for state and local taxes, something that lawmakers from states such as New York, California and New Jersey say is necessary to get their support.",
      "Committees are also given authority to pursue as much as $521 billion to boost border security, defense and the Coast Guard, though Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has said the final spending total will be closer to $345 billion.",
      "The budget plan also allows the Senate to increase the debt ceiling by up to $5 trillion. Final approval of such an increase would allow the federal government to continue to finance its debts and push any further votes on the matter until after next year\u2019s midterm elections. Trump is wary of giving Democrats the chance to extract concessions on a debt ceiling vote.",
      "The plan also instructs four Senate committees to find at least $1 billion each in budget reductions. That's just a small fraction of the potential tax relief. But the leadership is emphasizing that the instructions purposefully set a low floor for spending cuts to provide maximum flexibility and that committees will be on the hunt for far more.",
      "Already, the GOP leaders are confronting concerns from fiscal hawks in deep red states and congressional districts who want trillions of dollars in spending cuts to help pay for the tax breaks. At the same time, dozens of lawmakers in swing districts and states are worried about what those cuts will mean for their constituents, and for their reelection chances.",
      "The GOP leadership has encouraged members to just get a budget plan over the finish line, saying they have time to work out the tough questions of which tax breaks and spending cuts to include.",
      "Throughout the debate, Democrats focused on framing the tax cuts as helping out the wealthiest at the expense of average Americans. Sen. Jeff Merkley, the lead Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, spoke with a sign behind him that read \u201cRepublican Plan: Families Lose, Billionaires Win.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat's a terrible plan,\u201d Merkley said.",
      "Extending the the 2017 breaks would cut taxes for about three-quarters of households but raise them for about 10%. In 2027, about 45% of the benefit of all the tax cuts would go to those making roughly $450,000 or more, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, which analyzes tax issues.",

    "story": [
      "One big loser in President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating trade war is likely to be the U.S. electric vehicle industry",
      "DETROIT -- President Donald Trump's tariff blitz has sent shock waves throughout every aspect of the global economy, including the auto sector, where multi-billion-dollar plans to electrify in the United States are especially at risk.",
      "Here's what consumers should know about the impact of tariffs on electric vehicles.",
      "EVs accounted for about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. in 2024, according to Motorintelligence.com.",
      "Some of those sales can be attributed to expanded tax credits for EV purchases, a Biden-era policy that spurred car buyer interest.",
      "Tesla held a majority of U.S. EV market share in 2024, at 48%. But that share has declined in recent years, as brands including Ford (7.5%), Chevrolet (5.2%) and Hyundai (4.7%) began to offer a wider variety of electric models at better price points, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Electric vehicles remain more expensive than their gasoline-powered equivalents. New gas vehicles sold for $48,039 on average last month, Kelly Blue Book data says, while EVs sold for $55,273 on average.",
      "Tariffs add on to the costs of an EV transition that was already volatile and uncertain, said Vanessa Miller, a litigation partner focused on automotive manufacturing at law firm Foley & Lardner.",
      "Biden\u2019s tax credits essentially required automakers to get more and more of their EV content from the U.S. or trade allies over the coming years in order for their vehicles to qualify. Automakers have worked to build an EV supply chain across the country and significant investment has gone toward these efforts.",
      "EVs assembled here include Tesla models, the Ford F-150 Lightning and more. Tesla actually might be least vulnerable given how much of its vehicles come from the U.S.",
      "Though the industry is growing, tariffs mean costs for automakers and their buyers will stay high and might go higher, as well as hike up the prices of the many parts of EVs still coming from China and elsewhere. From the critical minerals used in battery production to the vehicles themselves, China laps the U.S. industry.",
      "Automakers were already pulling back on ambitious electrification plans amid shrinking federal support and are strapped for cash on what is the less lucrative side of their businesses.",
      "Higher prices might push car buyers to the used car market, but they aren't likely to find much respite there.",
      "If consumers don't buy as many vehicles, automakers will have to prioritize their investments and manufacturing. That means the cars that buyers want and that are most profitable. Automakers still lose thousands of dollars on each EV they make and sell, but they make money from big, popular gas-guzzling pickup trucks and SUVs.",
      "These manufacturers \u201chave put a certain amount of investment into EVs, and it would probably be even more wasteful to completely walk away from them than it is to find the new level at which it makes sense to maintain production of them,\" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at auto research site iSeeCars.com. That level \u201cwill assuredly be lower than what it was,\u201d he added.",
      "Making fewer EVs won\u2019t help bring their cost down further anytime soon.",
      "Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said in a statement the EV and battery sector is working to ensure that the American auto industry grows and that his group will work with the administration on productive trade policy.",
      "\u201cTariffs on our longstanding trade partners, many of whom have committed billions in direct investment into U.S. factories, introduces uncertainty and risk into an industry that is creating jobs and bringing new economic opportunities to communities across the country,\u201d Gore said.",
      "Trump has already taken a hatchet to federal EV policy. He campaigned on a vow to end what he called former President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cEV mandate.\u201d",
      "Biden\u2019s EV policies did not require automakers to sell EVs or consumers to buy them, but they did incentivize manufacturers to increase their electric offerings in the coming years. Trump put an end to Biden\u2019s target for 50% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2035 in his first days in office.",
      "Also under Biden, Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rules on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy were to get increasingly tougher, but could be met by automakers selling a growing number of EVs alongside more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles. Trump's administrators are already reevaluating emissions standards.",
      "He's also likely to seek to repeal the tax credits.",

      "\u201cBut it could be worse,\u201d Dampt added. \u201cI was really stressed with the possibility of having this 200% tariff.\u201d",
      "Trump had threatened last month a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the EU went forward with a planned tariff on American whiskey.",
      "Dampt suggested he preferred a negotiated outcome between the EU and the U.S., saying a full on trade war is bad for business.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not at school,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you answer too quickly with the same violence, it\u2019s not constructive.\u201d",

      "Chablis white wine was also the target of tariffs under the first Trump administration at the height of the spat between aviation giants Boeing and Airbus.",
      "There's only one way for Dampt to fight back and maintain a presence in the U.S.: bring down his prices and cut his profit. But he said \"it's not an easy thing to do\" especially now when he had already lost about 50% of his crop last year, mostly due to hail storms and killer frost.",

      "\u201cWhile this new measure will affect exports, potentially costing Bourgogne wines up to 100 million euros, it will not bring trade to a sudden halt, as would have been the case with higher tariffs,\" the trade association noted.",
      "The U.S. remained last year the largest export market for wines produced in the EU, with 4.88 billion euros ($5.36 billion), the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en des Entreprises Vins (European Committee of Wine Businesses), or CEEV, said in a statement. Exports to the U.S. accounted for 28% of the EU\u2019s total wine export value, it said.",
      "The new tariff would create \"economic uncertainty and result in layoffs, deferred investments and price increases,\u201d said Marzia Varvaglione, CEEV president. \u201cThere is no alternative wine market that could compensate the loss of the U.S. market.\"",
      "Macron denounced the tariffs as \"brutal and unfounded.\u201d In addition to the wine industry, the meeting at the Elysee palace gathered representatives from aeronautics, chemical and metal sectors, electronics, health, luxury, cosmetics and food industry.",
      "Macron said France is likely to be slightly less impacted than some of its neighbours, because exports to the U.S. represent 1.5% of France's GDP, while they represent over 3% for Italy and 4% for Germany. Yet, \u201cit\u2019s not a small thing,\u201d Macron said.",
      "He emphasized that the U.S. economy will first experience the negative impact of the tariffs.",

      "Lebanon\u2019s economy has been witnessing its worst crisis in its modern history since 2019 and the state must implement reforms demanded by the international community. Such reforms are needed to unlock international aid, and on top of that, Israel\u2019s 14-month war with Hezbollah that caused what the World Bank estimates was $11 billion in damages and economic losses.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s crisis is rooted in decades of corruption by the country\u2019s political and financial leaders that drained state resources and eventually led to a run on the banks in 2019 afterwhich people have lost access to their deposits. The situation has since been made worse with Covid-19, the massive Beirut port blast in August 2020 and the Israel-Hezbollah war.",
      "Since the historic meltdown began Lebanon has been running on a cash economy and in October, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, an international anti-money laundering watchdog, placed Lebanon on its \u201cgrey list.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will work on implementing international laws on top of them combating money laundering and supporting terrorism,\u201d Souaid said. The former asset manager added that banks in Lebanon should recapitalize by pumping new money and those that cannot and don\u2019t want to can merge with other lenders. He said that the priority will be to return deposits starting with people who have small accounts. He said the return of deposits should be the responsibility of the banks, central bank and the state.",

      "What is more uncertain for Sri Lanka now is its obligation to rid the island nation of mines by 2028 under the Ottawa Treaty, which it ratified in 2017.",
      "Pushparani has experienced the civil war in its full fury. In her family, her husband, father and two brothers died fighting for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, as the rebel group was formally known. Two other siblings are missing.",
      "She was born in eastern Sri Lanka and while still in school, her family had to move to the northern parts of the nation after a countrywide ethnic pogrom against minority Tamils by majority Sinhala mobs in 1983.",
      "The incident stirred up emotions among many Tamil youth who joined militant organizations to fight for an independent state for the Tamils. Pushparani too joined the Tamil Tigers while still a teenager in school.",
      "\u201cBecause the whole of my family was with the organization they arranged my marriage. My eldest daughter was born in 1990 and the younger one was born in 1992. My husband died in battle in 1996 and my children were raised in the \"Sencholai\" home, run by the organization,\" said Pushparani.",
      "She was reunited with her children when the fighting ended in 2009 and started working with demining groups for a living.",
      "Demining operations in Sri Lanka started in 2002 during a ceasefire period and the U.S. has been the major donor among 11 countries supporting the effort, contributing about 34% of the $250 million grants received for the projects so far.",
      "The U.S. contribution was 45% of the grants received last year, according to M.M Nayeemudeen, director of the state-run National Mine Action Center.",
      "Thanks to the international generosity, the demining operations continue to date despite being interrupted for a few years because of the break down of the ceasefire. They have so far managed to clear more than 2.5 million anti-personnel, anti-tank, small arms ammunition and unexploded ordnance.",
      "Out of 254 square kilometers of land that originally needed to be cleared, only about 23 square kilometers are left to deal with. Whether that can be achieved by the 2028 deadline will depend on continued funding.",
      "Nayeemudeen said once the aid suspension was announced, Sri Lanka's foreign ministry appealed and the U.S allowed the usage of its allocated funds pending a review, a decision on which is expected on May 1.",
      "\u201cWe hope that on completion of the 90-day review period that commenced from Jan. 24, 2025, the U.S government funding assistance will continue,\" said Ananda Chandrasiri head of Delvon Assistance for Social Harmony, one of the four demining groups operating in the country.",
      "\"Otherwise it will create a grave problem for Sri Lanka to achieve mine-free status by the end of 2027 as targeted ... A huge reduction of staffing levels of the four operators would be inevitable.\u201d",
      "There are around 3,000 workers, most of them recruited from among the civil war-affected communities. With the uncertainty, some groups have already started terminating their staff, Nayeemudeen said.",
      "Sri Lanka's civil war ended in 2009 when government troops crushed the Tamil Tiger rebels, ending their quarter-century separatist campaign. According to conservative U.N. estimates, about 100,000 people were killed in the conflict.",
      "Civilian properties were demined, but large areas were still contaminated when hundreds of thousands of civilians who were displaced by the conflict came back to resettle. Mine awareness campaigns were held, but there were many accidents.",
      "Kumarakulasingham Dinojan has lost his left hand below his wrist and has damaged fingers in his right hand from a mine blast. As a 9-year-old boy, he tried to open a metal container that he found in the woods. His brother, who was playing with him, also suffered wounds.",
      "\u201cMy grandmother went into the woods to get firewood and we also followed her. We did not know that she had reached home through another way. We found a container which looked like a perfumed powder, and when we tried to open it, it exploded,\u201d said Dinojan.",
      "There were people who were injured or killed trying to open mines and use the explosives for fishing.",
      "Vidya Abhayagunawardena, coordinator of the Sri Lanka Campaign to Ban Land Mines, said it's critical for Sri Lanka to ratify Protocol V on Explosive Remnants of War. He also called for the enactment of domestic legislation to enforce the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, ratified in 2016, to bolster the legal rights of the country\u2019s disabled population.",
      "Dinojan's older brother, Vilvaraj Vinothan, said his brothers becoming land mine victims made him take action and become involved in mine clearance. He has worked with the Mine Advisory Group for six years.",
      "\u201cOnly when the land was being cleared that I understood how we should deal with the mines,\" he said. \"That's when I decided to help, knowing it would benefit the entire community.\"",
      "Pushparani is grateful that her demining income has allowed her to fulfill her family\u2019s needs. She financed one daughter\u2019s university education and her marriage. However, she also cares for a daughter injured in crossfire and an elderly mother.",
      "\u201cThe reason for my choosing demining for livelihood is not only because of poverty. I also have a desire to see this land to be free of mines,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI don't want to see our future generations being injured or affected by war. I can say that I am carrying the burden of both my family and of the country on my shoulders.\u201d",

    "summary": "Lawmakers in Oregon and Washington are considering whether striking workers should receive unemployment benefits",
    "story": [
      "Lawmakers in Oregon and Washington are considering whether striking workers should receive unemployment benefits",
      "SEATTLE -- Lawmakers in Oregon and Washington are considering whether striking workers should receive unemployment benefits, following recent walkouts by Boeing factory workers, hospital nurses and teachers in the Pacific Northwest that highlighted a new era of American labor activism.",
      "Oregon's measure would make it the first state to provide pay for picketing public employees \u2014 who aren't allowed to strike in most states, let alone receive benefits for it. Washington's would pay striking private sector workers for up to 12 weeks, starting after at least two weeks on the line.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is this helps level the playing field,\u201d said Democratic state Sen. Marcus Riccelli, who sponsored Washington's bill. \u201cWithout a social safety net during a strike, workers are faced with tremendous pressure to end the strike quickly or never go on strike in the first place.\u201d",
      "But the bills are raising questions about how they would affect employers, especially amid economic uncertainties tied to federal funding cuts and tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate to unbalance the bargaining table in a way that forces employers to pay for the costs of a striking worker,\u201d Lindsey Hueer, government affairs director with the Association of Washington Business, told senators during a committee hearing in February. \u201cUnemployment insurance should be a safety net for workers who have no job to return to.\"",
      "So far only two states, New York and New Jersey, give striking workers unemployment benefits. Senate Democrats in Connecticut have revived legislation that would provide financial help for striking workers after the governor vetoed a similar measure last year.",
      "The measures in Washington and Oregon have been passed by the state Senate of each and are now in the House. The Washington bill faces its final committee hearings on Friday and Monday.",
      "The Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit, pro-labor think tank in Washington, D.C., has studied the effects of giving unemployment benefits to striking workers and found it to be good for workers and employers alike, said Daniel Perez, state economic analyst for the organization.",
      "First, he said, lengthy strikes are extremely rare. More than half of U.S. labor strikes end within two days \u2014 workers wouldn't receive pay in those cases \u2014 and just 14% last more than two weeks. Second, the policy costs very little \u2014 less than 1% of unemployment insurance expenditures in every state that has considered legislation.",
      "Bryan Corliss, spokesperson for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace union, told The Associated Press that the big winners would be low-wage workers.",
      "\u201cIf low-wage workers had the financial stability to actually go on strike for more than a day or two without risking eviction, we believe that would incentivize companies to actually come to the table and make a deal,\" he said.",
      "During a hearing in the Washington House labor committee last week, several Republican lawmakers tried to amend the bill to require striking workers to look for other jobs or to shorten the time covered from 12 weeks to four. The Democratic majority shot those ideas down.",
      "Republican Rep. Suzanne Schmidt said the bill might be good for workers, but it would hurt employers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen instances of this with the Boeing strike last year for the machinists,\" she said. \"We had 32,000 people on strike at the same time and if this had been in play it would have cost millions of dollars to cover those workers. Boeing did actually lose billions having the workers on strike for several months.\u201d",
      "The Oregon bill, which also would make striking workers eligible for unemployment benefits after two weeks, sparked a similar debate, both among Democratic and Republican lawmakers as well as constituents, with hundreds of people submitting written testimony.",
      "The state has seen two large strikes in recent years: Thousands of nurses and dozens of doctors at Providence's eight Oregon hospitals were on strike for six weeks earlier this year, while a 2023 walkout of Portland Public Schools teachers shuttered schools for over three weeks in the state's largest district.",
      "The Oregon Senate passed the measure largely along party lines, with two Democrats voting against it.",
      "On the Senate floor, Democratic Sen. Janeen Sollman said she worried about the effect on public employers such as school districts, which \u201cdo not have access to extra pots of money.\u201d Private employers pay into the state's unemployment trust fund through a payroll tax, but few public employers do, meaning that they would have to reimburse the fund for any payments made to their workers.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Gorsek, who supported the bill, argued it wouldn't cost public employers more than what they've already budgeted for salaries, as workers aren't paid when they're on strike. Also, those receiving unemployment benefits get at most 65% of their weekly pay, and benefit amounts are capped, according to a document presented to lawmakers by employment department officials.",
      "\u201cUnemployment insurance is partial wage replacement, so unemployment insurance in and of itself is not an additional cost to the employer,\" Gorsek said. \u201cIn fact, the only way Senate Bill 916 would yield additional cost for what was already budgeted by the employer is if the employer decided to hire replacement workers.\u201d",

      "Everything from crude oil to Big Tech stocks to the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies has fallen. Even gold, a traditional safe haven that recently hit record highs, pulled lower after Trump announced his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d set of tariffs,\u2019 which economists say carries the risk of a potentially toxic mix of weakening economic growth and higher inflation.",

      "In other trading early Friday, the U.S. dollar fell to 145.39 Japanese yen from 146.06. The yen is often used as a refuge in uncertain times, while Trump's policies are meant in part to weaken the dollar to make goods made in the U.S. more price competitive overseas. The euro gained to $1.1095 from $1.1055.",
      "Trump announced a minimum tariff of 10% on global imports, with the tax rate running much higher on products from certain countries like China and those from the European Union. Smaller, poorer countries in Asia were slapped with tariffs as high as 49%.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cplausible\u201d the tariffs altogether, which would rival levels unseen in more than a century, could knock down U.S. economic growth by 2 percentage points this year and raise inflation close to 5%, according to UBS.",

      "Four of every five that make up the S&P 500 declined.",
      "Best Buy fell 17.8% because the electronics that it sells are made all over the world. United Airlines lost 15.6% because customers worried about the global economy may not fly as much for business or feel comfortable enough to take vacations. Target tumbled 10.9% amid worries that its customers, already squeezed by still-high inflation, may be under even more stress.",
      "Investors knew Trump was going to announce sweeping new tariffs, and fears surrounding it had already pulled Wall Street\u2019s main measure of health, the S&P 500 index, 10% below its all-time high.",
      "Some analysts and investors believed Trump might use tariffs simply as a tool for negotiations, rather than as a long-term policy. But he indicated Wednesday that he sees them as a way to bring factory jobs back to the United States, which could take years.",

      "WASHINGTON -- After a long wait, the Senate is launching action on President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\u201d of tax breaks and spending cuts at a risky moment for the U.S. and global economy.",
      "More than a month after House Republicans surprised Washington by advancing their framework for Trump's $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $2 trillion in spending cuts, Senate Republicans voted Thursday to start working on their version. The largely party-line vote, 52-48, sets the stage for a potential Senate all-nighter Friday spilling into the weekend.",
      "But work on the multitrillion-dollar package is coming as markets at home and abroad are on edge in the aftermath Trump's vast tariffs scheme, complicating an already difficult political and procedural undertaking on what Republicans hope will become their signature domestic policy package.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., opened the chamber Thursday saying they expected to be ready to begin.",
      "Trump says he's on board with the plan and Republicans, in control of Congress, are eager to show the party is making progress toward delivering on their campaign promises. By nightfall, as voting began, one Republican, the libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against, as did all Democrats.",
      "Democrats, as the minority party, don't have the votes to stop the GOP plan. But they intend to use the procedural tools available to prolong the process. Democrats argue that Republicans are focusing on tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of the programs and services millions of Americans rely on for help with health care, child care, school lunches and other everyday needs.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re mean, they\u2019re nasty, they\u2019re uncaring,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said about the Republicans. \u201cWe, tonight and tomorrow, are going to show just who they are.\"",
      "Senate Democrats started consuming up to 25 hours of their available debate time, holding the floor into the night and railing against potential GOP cuts to Medicaid, veterans programs, DOGE cuts and the impact of Trump's tariffs.",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Budget committee, repeated a slogan he has been sharing: \u201cFamilies lose and billionaires win.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat,\" he said, \u201cis the Republican plan.\u201d",
      "Fundamental to the Senate package is making sure Trump\u2019s first-term tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of the year, are continued and made a permanent fixture of the tax code. The senators also will consider adding Trump's proposed tax cuts on tipped wages, Social Security income and others.",
      "The Senate package also would bolster border security funds by some $175 billion to carry out Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign, which is running short of cash, and it would add national security funds for the Pentagon \u2014 all priorities the Senate GOP tucked into an earlier version that was panned by House Republicans.",
      "Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the party whip, said that without action tax cuts would expire, becoming a $4 trillion tax hike on Americans. \u201cRepublicans are focused on getting America back on track,\u201d he said.",
      "What's unclear is how it will all be paid for, since Republican deficit hawks typically require spending offsets to help defray the lost tax revenue and avoid piling onto the nation's $36 trillion debt load.",
      "While House Republicans approved their package with $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and up to $2 trillion in spending cuts, the Senate Republicans are taking a different tack.",
      "Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham is making the case that since the existing Trump tax breaks are the current policy, they are not considered new, and do not need to be offset with reductions in spending \u2014 an approach Democrats compare to \u201cgoing nuclear\u201d with the normal rules, particularly if the strategy is put to the test with an unfavorable ruling before the Senate parliamentarian.",
      "Instead, Senate Republicans are considering offsets mostly for any new Trump tax breaks. Raising alarms from the most conservative budget hawks, the senators have set a floor of about $4 billion in budget reductions to health and other programs \u2014 a fraction of the package's expected $4 trillion-plus price tag for tax breaks.",
      "GOP leaders are assuring the deficit hawks within their own ranks that the legislation says the cuts can rise to as much as $2 trillion.",
      "After an expected Friday night vote-a-rama, with dozens of amendments being offered to the package, the senators are planning to stay into Saturday if needed to take a final vote to approve it, sending it to the House for action.",
      "The House and Senate will ultimately need to merge their frameworks into a final product, expected in May, but House Speaker Mike Johnson's intention to have it all wrapped up by Memorial Day could prove optimistic.",
      "The political environment is uncertain, and the public's appetite for steep budget cuts is being tested in real time, with Trump's Department of Government Efficiency headed by billionaire Elon Musk blazing through federal offices, firing thousands of workers and shuttering long-running government mainstays \u2014 from scientific research projects on diseases to educational services for schoolchildren to offices that help with Social Security, tax filing and the weather.",
      "At the same time, the staunchest fiscal conservatives in both the House and Senate, many aligned with the Freedom Caucus, are pushing for even more cuts.",

The threshold increased to $200 in 1994 and $800 in 2016. But the rapid rise of cross-border e-commerce, driven by China, has challenged the intent of the decades-old customs exception rule.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service. And the U.S. market has been a major destination.",
      "The Chinese government, which sees cross-border e-commerce as a critical part of its foreign trade, has introduced favorable policies, including financial support and infrastructure building, to foster its growth.",
      "Former President Joe Biden proposed a rule last year that said foreign companies can\u2019t avoid tariffs simply by shipping goods that they claim to be worth $800 or less. Trump tried in February to end the exception but his initial order was called off within days when it appeared the U.S. was not prepared to process and collect tariffs on the millions of parcels.",
      "U.S. Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, said she was pleased Trump acted a second time to eliminate the rule.",
      "\u201cFor too long, this customs loophole has let foreign exporters flood our market with cheap goods and helped drug traffickers move fentanyl past our borders \u2014 resulting in factory closures, job losses, and deaths,\u201d DeLauro said.",
      "In 2023, for the first time, more than 1 billion such packages came through U.S. customs, up from 134 million in 2015. By the end of last year, Customs and Border Protection said it was processing about 4 million small shipments a day.",
      "The cheap prices and increasing popularity of Shein and Temu squeezed fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M. Forever 21 blamed the tax exemption in part for its decision to file for bankruptcy last month  and close its U.S. stores,",
      "\u201cWe have been unable to find a sustainable path forward, given competition from foreign fast-fashion companies, which have been able to take advantage of the de minimis exemption to undercut our brand on pricing and margin,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brad Sell said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon launched late last year a low- cost online storefront featuring electronics, apparel and other products priced under $20, in an apparent effort to compete with Temu and Shein. Amazon shipped the products to U.S. customers from a warehouse it operates in China, according to documentation the company provided to sellers.",

      "Mexico is celebrating having dodged the latest round of tariffs from the White House taking aim at dozens of U.S. trading partners around the world",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico celebrated Thursday having dodged the latest round of tariffs from the White House taking aim at dozens of U.S. trading partners around the world, but was also quickly reminded that in a global economy the effects of uncertainty can\u2019t be entirely avoided.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum said the free-trade agreement signed by Mexico, Canada and the U.S. during Trump\u2019s first administration had shielded Mexico.",
      "Now her government will focus on the existing 25% U.S. tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum, while accelerating domestic production to safeguard jobs and reduce imports.",
      "\u201cDuring my last call with President Trump, I said that, in the case of reciprocal tariffs, my understanding was that there wouldn\u2019t be tariffs (on Mexico), because Mexico doesn\u2019t place tariffs on the United States,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard noted that despite having free-trade agreements with the U.S., many countries were targeted by the tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump announced Wednesday on what he dubbed \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d Trump framed the tariffs as a way to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.",
      "Noting that Mexico escaped the latest round of tariffs, Ebrard said swaths of Mexican exports including agricultural products like avocados, clothing and electronics will continue to enter the U.S. without import duties.",
      "Ebrard said it wasn't a given that the free-trade agreement would be preserved, \u201cbecause in a new commercial order based on tariffs it's very hard for a free-trade agreement to survive.\u201d The fact that it did, puts Mexico at a competitive advantage, because \u201cit's going to be cheaper to produce in Mexico than in any other part of the world.\u201d",
      "Oscar Ocampo, a specialist in foreign trade at the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, a think tank, said \u201cthe United States is closing off to the rest of the world and in relative terms closing off less with Mexico and that is an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum is seeking to use that opportunity to encourage companies producing in Mexico who had not been exporting under the free-trade agreement for various reasons to take the necessary steps to qualify. She cited major German auto producers as an example.",
      "Qualifying for the free-trade agreement could involve anything from doing paperwork to making adjustments to the sourcing of a product.",
      "Despite Trump's latest tariffs not being imposed on Mexico, the uncertainty they created and the interconnectedness of the North American auto supply chains meant it didn\u2019t take long for the effects to touch Mexico.",
      "Stellantis, maker of auto brands including Dodge and Jeep, announced that it would pause production at its assembly plant in Toluca west of Mexico City for the month of April while it assesses the tariffs' impact on its operations. The company has more than 15,000 employees in Mexico. A similar temporary production halt was scheduled for an assembly plant in Canada and some 900 workers were to be temporarily laid off across several plants in the United States.",
      "That uncertainty is part of the reasons why Sheinbaum is pushing Plan Mexico, an initiative to promote and cultivate more domestic production.",
      "As an example, she cited a collaboration between her government, local universities and Mexican companies Megaflux and Dina to produce electric buses for public transportation.",
      "Ebrard said recently that the buses represent not only a technological advance in Mexico, but also a \u201cstrategic decision\u201d in favor of Mexico\u2019s industrial sovereignty.",
      "At a factory in Mexico City, the electric buses called Taruk \u2014 trail-runner in the Indigenous Yaqui language \u2013 are already in production. Megaflux Director General Roberto Gottfried said the company hopes to deliver some 200 by year's end.",
      "He noted that some 70% of the Taruk's components are produced in Mexico, including its motor, but the lithium batteries that power them come from China.",
      "In a country where one out of every three people use public transportation every day, developing this sector domestically is critical, Gottfried said.",
      "Despite the global economic challenges presented by the uncertainty caused by tariffs, he said, Mexico\u2019s large internal market gives the initiative a competitive advantage to develop and weather the storm.",

      "KINSHASA, Congo -- A Trump administration official said Thursday the United States is in talks with conflict-plagued Congo on developing its mineral resources under a deal the Congolese president has said could help make his country safer.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump's senior adviser for Africa, Massad Boulos, did not provide details of the potential deal following talks with Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi in Kinshasa, but he said it could involve \u201cmultibillion-dollar investments.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have heard about a minerals agreement. We have reviewed\" the Congo's proposal, Boulos said. \u201cI am pleased to announce that the president and I have agreed on a path forward for its development.\u201d",
      "American companies would be \u201coperating transparently\u201d and would \u201cstimulate local economies,\" Boulos said.",
      "Congo is the world\u2019s largest producer of cobalt, a mineral used to make lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and smartphones. It also has substantial gold, diamond and copper reserves.",
      "Tshisekedi said last month that he was open to a deal on developing critical minerals with the United States if the American involvement could help quell insurgencies and boost security in the African country.",
      "\u201cI think that the U.S. is able to use either pressure or sanctions to make sure that armed groups ... can be kept at bay,\u201d he said on U.S. TV broadcaster Fox.",
      "The Trump administration also is negotiating with Ukraine over a minerals deal in that country, which originally was proposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last fall in hopes of strengthening his country's hand in its conflict with Russia by tying U.S. interests to Ukraine\u2019s future.",
      "Eastern Congo has been in conflict for decades with more than 100 armed groups, most of which are vying for territory in the mineral-rich region near the border with Rwanda. The conflict has created one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises with more than 7 million people displaced, including 100,000 who fled homes this year.",
      "The M23 is the most potent armed group and is backed by Congo\u2019s neighbor Rwanda. In a major escalation since January, the M23 rebels have captured the cities of Goma and Bukavu and several towns in eastern Congo, prompting fears of regional war.",
      "On Thursday, M23 withdrew from Walikale, a key mining town in eastern Congo it captured last month, after weeks of fighting with Congolese forces and its allied Wazalendo militia.",

      "Willy Mishiki, a national deputy representing Walikale, said the rebels left under pressure from the Wazalendo. Walikale resident Faustin Kamala said it's not clear where the rebels went.",
      "The Walikale area is home to the largest tin deposits in Congo and to several significant gold mines. The Bisie tin mine, around 60 kilometers (35 miles) northwest of the town, accounts for the majority of tin exports from North Kivu province.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s expansive new tariff regime reverses a decades-long global trend of lower trade barriers that will likely raise prices for U.S. consumers and threatens to sharply slow the economy this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's expansive new tariffs reverse a decades-long global trend of lower trade barriers and are likely, economists say, to raise prices for Americans by thousands of dollars each year while sharply slowing the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House is gambling that other countries will also suffer enough pain that they will open up their economies to more American exports, leading to negotiations that would reduce the tariffs imposed Wednesday.",
      "Or, the White House hopes, companies will reverse their moves toward global supply chains and bring more production to the United States to avoid higher import taxes.",
      "But a key question for the Trump administration will be how Americans react to the tariffs. If prices rise noticeably and jobs are lost, voters could turn against the duties and make it harder to keep them in place for the time needed to encourage companies to return to the U.S.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab estimates the Trump administration's tariffs would cost the average household $3,800 in higher prices this year. That includes the 10% universal tariff plus much higher tariffs on about 60 countries announced Wednesday, as well as previous import taxes on steel, aluminum and cars. Inflation could top 4% this year, from 2.8% currently, while the economy may barely grow, according to estimates by Nationwide Financial.",
      "Investors turned thumbs-down on the new duties Thursday, with the S&P 500 index dropping 4.8% at the close of trading, its worst day since the pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 1,600 points.",
      "Still, Trump was upbeat Thursday when asked about the stock market drop.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going very well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an operation, like when a patient gets operated on and it\u2019s a big thing. I said this would exactly be the way it is.\"",
      "The average U.S. tariff could rise to nearly 25% when the tariffs are fully implemented April 9, economists estimate, higher than in more than a century, and higher than the 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariffs that are widely blamed for worsening the Great Depression.",
      "\u201cThe president just announced the de facto separation of the U.S. economy from the global economy,\u201d said Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Relations. \u201cThe stage is set for higher prices and slower growth over the long term.\"",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick argued the policies will help open markets overseas for U.S. exports.",
      "\u201cI expect most countries to start to really examine their trade policy towards the United States of America, and stop picking on us,\u201d he said on CNBC Thursday. \u201dThis is the reordering of fair trade.\u201d",
      "Bob Lehmann, 73, who stopped by a Best Buy in Portland, Oregon, Wednesday opposed the tariffs. \u201cThey\u2019re going to raise prices and cause people to pay more for daily living,\u201d he said.",
      "Mathew Hall, a 64-year-old paint contractor, called the tariffs a \u201cgreat idea\u201d and said potential price increases in the short term were worth it.",
      "\u201cI believe in the long term, it\u2019s going to be good,\u201d he said, adding that he felt the U.S. had been taken advantage of.",
      "But a former trade official from Trump\u2019s first term, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the impact, suggested that Americans, including those who voted for Trump, may have difficulty accepting the stiff duties.",
      "Americans \u201chave never faced tariffs like this,\u201d the former official said Thursday. \u201cThe downstream impact on clothing and shoe stores, it\u2019s going to be pretty significant. So we\u2019ll have to see how the Trump voters view this ... and how long their support for these policies goes.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, automaker Stellantis, which owns the Jeep, Citroen and Ram brands, said it would temporarily halt production at plants in Canada and Mexico in response to Trump's 25% tax on imported cars. The reduced output means the company is temporarily laying off 900 workers at plants in Michigan and Indiana.",
      "Some exporters overseas may cut their prices to offset some of the tariffs, and U.S. retailers could eat some of the cost as well. But most economists expect much of the tariffs to bring higher prices.",
      "The tariffs will hit many Asian countries hard, with duties on Vietnamese imports rising to 46% and on Indonesia to 32%. Tariffs on some Chinese imports will be as high as 79%. Those three countries are the top sources of U.S. shoe imports, with Nike making about half its shoes last year and one-third of its clothes in Vietnam.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab estimates all Trump\u2019s tariffs this year will push clothing prices 17% higher.",
      "On Thursday, the Home Furnishings Association, which represents more than 13,000 U.S. furniture stores, predicted the tariffs will increase prices between 10% and 46%. Vietnam and China are the top furniture exporters to the U.S.",
      "It said manufacturers in Asia are offsetting some of the costs by discounting their products and lowering ocean freight rates, but that won't be enough to avoid price hikes. Even domestically made furniture often relies on imported components.",
      "\u201cWhile many in the industry support the long-term goal of reshoring manufacturing, the reality is that it will take at least a decade to scale domestic production,\u201d Home Furnishings Association CEO Shannon Williams said in a statement. \u201cPermitting, training a skilled workforce and managing the higher costs of U.S. manufacturing are significant hurdles.\u201d",
      "At Gethsemane Garden Center in Chicago, there are Canadian-grown tulip, daffodil and hyacinth bulbs, though only about 5% of center plants are imported. Thousands of lemon cypress trees from Canada are sold year-round and Canadian mums are sold in the fall.",
      "Regas Chefas, whose family has owned Gethsemane for decades, says all the tariffs won't be passed onto customers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to absorb some of the increase. The growers will absorb some of the increases and then the customers will pay a little bit higher price,\u201d he said.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, which represents Coca-Cola, General Mills, Nestle, Tyson and Del Monte as well as Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, said its companies already make the majority of their goods in the U.S.",
      "But there are critical ingredients and inputs \u2014 like wood pulp for toilet paper \u2014 that are imported because of scarce domestic availability. Cinnamon is harvested from trees that can\u2019t survive in the U.S.. Domestic production of coffee and cocoa is also limited.",
      "\u201cWe encourage President Trump and his trade advisers to fine-tune their approach and exempt key ingredients and inputs in order to protect manufacturing jobs and prevent unnecessary inflation at the grocery store,\u201d said Tom Madrecki, the association\u2019s vice president of supply chain resiliency.",
      "Outside a Tractor Supply south of Denver, two family members on opposite sides of the political spectrum debated the tariffs.",
      "Chris Theisen, a 62-year-old Republican, said: \u201cI feel a good change coming on, I feel it\u2019s going to be hard, but you don\u2019t go to the gym and walk away and say, \u2019God, I feel great.\u201d",
      "Nayen Shakya, a Democrat and Theisen\u2019s great nephew, said higher prices are already a hardship. At the restaurant where he works, menu prices have been raised to account for higher ingredient costs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really easy sometimes to say some things in a vague way that everyone can agree with that is definitely more complex under the surface,\u201d said Shakya. \"The burden of the increased prices is already going to the consumer.\u201d",

      "The yield slid to 4.06% Thursday as a sharp sell-off on Wall Street following the White House\u2019s latest and most severe volley of tariffs fueled expectations among bond investors that the Fed may have to cut its main interest rate if the economy sours.",
      "\u201cThe 10-year Treasury has dipped even further this morning as investors are exiting the stock market, so it\u2019s likely that mortgage rates will continue to come down in the coming months as a result,\u201d said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com. \u201cThis shock to the system will be felt in the housing market for the rest of the year.\u201d",
      "Recent forecasts by housing economists generally called for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain around 6.5% this year.",
      "Lower mortgage rates can help spur home sales by make homeownership more affordable. At the same time, many Americans may put off buying a home if they're worried about losing their job or taking a hit on their stock portfolio during an economic downturn.",
      "\u201cIt remains to be seen whether relief from mortgage rates will spur buyers to make a move in 2025, or if the broader economic conditions will slow things down,\u201d Berner said.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "Easing mortgage rates and more homes on the market nationally helped drive sales higher in February from the previous month, though they were down year-over-year.",
      "Even with mortgage rates easing this year, rising home prices are helping to drive up the cost of homeownership. The typical monthly payment made by U.S. homebuyers climbed to a record-high $2,802 in the four weeks that ended March 20, according to Redfin.",

      "Before The Beatles, Studio One had already cemented its place in music history, when it was opened by British composer Sir Edward Elgar, who recorded his \u201cLand of Hope and Glory\u201d with the London Symphony Orchestra. It\u2019s also hosted other music greats like Maria Callas, Igor Stravinsky, Daniel Barenboim, Fats Waller and Glenn Miller.",
      "Due to its huge size, more than double Studio Two, it can fit a 100-piece orchestra and 100-member choir at the same time \u2014 which is perfect for recording film soundtracks, and explains why six to seven out of every 10 Hollywood films are scored at Abbey Road, according to the studio.",
      "Standing on the balcony, overlooking the 40-foot-high (12-meter-high) room, Davies points out the original screen that was used to show \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d (1981) while musicians played along to record the soundtrack.",
      "Since then, everything from \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d trilogy to Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d to \u201cBarbie\u201d were scored in Studio One. For the last, all the musicians came in with something pink, whether a pink instrument or piece of clothing.",
      "Oscar-nominated composer Daniel Pemberton has been recording in Studio One since 2009 and calls his \u201ccreative home\u201d a \u201cspectacular space.\u201d",
      "\u201cOutside, it just looks like a normal house. And then you come in and you find this space in it that\u2019s like almost the size of a football pitch. In fact, I have played football in there once,\u201d he laughs.",
      "Pemberton is known for scoring \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider Verse,\u201d \u201cFerrari,\u201d \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7\u201d and creating the \u201cSlow Horses\u201d theme song and \u201cStrange Game,\u201d with Mick Jagger.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s so exciting about a room like Studio One is what happens on the day is what happens for the rest of time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like history is being made, whether it\u2019s good history or bad history or whatever, you\u2019re making a moment then.\u201d",
      "Pemberton notes the stories, whether personal or musical, that have unfolded within the walls of Studio One.",
      "\u201cThe ghosts are insane in there,\u201d he said.",
      "Davies agrees that the history adds to the enchantment.",
      "\u201cYou walk into this room and you can feel it. \u2026 There is a magic in the sound. It sounds phenomenal. There is a spirituality in who has been here, who has performed here,\u201d she says. \u201cSo when we see artists come through, you know that immediate reaction of, \u2018Oh my gosh. I\u2019m in Studio One.\u2019\u201d",
      "To celebrate the reopening this week, Abbey Road Studios showcased an unusual art form for the space: dance, which incorporated Pemberton\u2019s scores, remixed by resident artist Jordan Rakei and choreographed by Joseph Toonga.",
      "\u201cIt kind of like threw me back a bit like, wow, it really is big,\u201d said Toonga of the first time he saw the studio. He then incorporated that feeling into a dance which spanned hip-hop, krumping and ballet.",
      "Up next, the first client to record in Studio One since the refurbishment is a hush-hush Hollywood franchise.",
      "But there are lots of secrets at Abbey Road. One of them is Pemberton\u2019s plan to record the unique rattling sound of the new railings for a movie soundtrack.",
      "There was concern that the hollow, Art Deco-style bars would upset the acoustics of the room, and a backup plan was made to fill them with sand if they messed with the reverb.",
      "Luckily, the empty bars were allowed to stay because Pemberton is delighted by the noise they make when you run past them with keys \u2014 it\u2019s another dramatic sound that can only be created in Studio One and will make its way into theaters around the world, via a film score.",
      "___",
      "This story has been corrected to show that Studio One can fit a 100-piece orchestra and 100-member choir at the same time, not 110 each, and that the managing director is named Sally Davies, not Sally Davis.",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was once called the most popular politician on Earth by then-U.S. President Barack Obama. Those times are long gone.",
      "Halfway through his latest four-year term, Lula's approval rating has plunged down to levels never before seen in any of this three administrations. Brazil's economy is growing and its unemployment is decreasing, but people are complaining about higher food prices and crime.",
      "Lula\u2019s approval rating has dropped to 24%, according to the country\u2019s most prominent pollster Datafolha in its latest February poll, which interviewed 2,007 people across Brazil with a margin of error of 2 percentage points. That is an all-time low across his time in office from 2003 to 2010, and since he took office again in 2023. The previous record was 28% in 2005. Surveys by other firms also show a rise in discontent.",
      "And in an apparent attempt to claw back support, the government on Thursday is hosting an event in the capital, Brasilia.",
      "\u201cThe objective is to present the achievements of the Federal Government in the first two years,\u201d the presidential palace said in a statement this week.",
      "Lula\u2019s difficulties come against a Brazilian political landscape in upheaval, with his predecessor and bitter rival former President Jair Bolsonaro due to stand trial on charges that the right-wing politician attempted a coup.",
      "The plunge in support also comes as Lula, 79, weighs whether to run for re-election next year.",
      "For many observers, the increase in the cost of food is a top reason for Lula\u2019s fall in popularity. Food and drinks were nearly 8% more expensive in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to Brazil's national statistics agency.",
      "\u201cFood inflation has a direct impact on people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Carla Beni, a professor of economics at Getulio Vargas Foundation, pointing especially to the rise of the cost of meat, a staple of Brazilians' diet.",
      "Beni said prices have soared due to the impact of climate change on crops and the strengthening of the dollar against the real.",
      "An uptick in food prices particularly affects the poor \u2013 Lula\u2019s historical support base. A poll by private firm Genial/Quaest released Wednesday showed a surge in disapproval among women, Black people and in Brazil\u2019s poorer northeast. In six months, the percentage of respondents who disapprove of Lula's administration in the northeast jumped from 26% to 46%. And more women have a poor opinion of the government than they do a positive one.",
      "\u201cNot only are things expensive, but we\u2019re also living in a dangerous country,\u201d said Anderson Vianna, 45, a sales representative who lives Rio de Janeiro's low-income northern zone. \u201cIf you have your phone in hand, you can\u2019t relax,\u201d added the man who voted for Lula in 2002, 2006 and 2022.",
      "To reign in food inflation, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin announced on March 6 that the government would reduce import taxes to zero on a series of products, including meat and coffee.",
      "But the measure does not appear to have turned the public\u2019s perception of the government. Jo\u00e3o Feres, a political scientist at Rio de Janeiro State University, said Lula\u2019s government has a myriad of public policies but \u201cthe problem is communicating the results of these policies.\u201d",
      "A blow to Lula came in January, when his government said it would increase oversight of financial transactions, including Brazil\u2019s popular instant payment system PIX.",
      "That sparked a flurry of fake news pushed by far-right politicians close to Bolsonaro, who said the government planned to impose a new tax on PIX payments. The administration denied the accusation, but ended up backtracking on the step.",
      "\u201cThat was the first point that really damaged Lula\u2019s image,\u201d said Paulo Feldmann, an economist at the University of Sao Paulo.",
      "Crime and violence are other top concerns.",
      "\u201cSince the end of restriction of movement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it's in first place\u201d in the ranking of Brazilians' worries, said Marcos Calliari, the country's director of pollster IPSOS.",
      "Over the weekend, the video of an influencer inadvertently filming the moment her phone was stolen at the Lollapalooza festival in Sao Paulo went viral. Almost one in 10 Brazilians had their phone stolen between July 2023 and June 2024, according to Datafolha.",
      "Lula has sharpened his tone against thieves in recent weeks. \u201cWe will not allow criminals to take over our country,\u201d he said on March 19.",
      "The justice ministry is planning to send a bill to Congress that would increase the maximum sentence for receiving and benefiting from stolen cellphones from eight to up to 12 years, it said in a statement on Friday.",
      "Lula\u2019s government is also preparing a wider bill on security.",
      "To woo back voters, the government is also counting on a proposal to cut taxation for the poor. Mid-March, the administration sent a bill to Congress that seeks to exempt individuals earning up to 5000 reais (around $880) per month from income tax, up from around 2,300 reais currently.",
      "If Congress approves the bill, observers say it could be a big win for Lula, though it's uncertain whether it will restore his popularity.",
      "With Lula struggling in the polls and Bolsonaro barred from running until 2030, the next election is much more unpredictable than the previous one, Beni said.",
      "Vianna, the sales representative, said he is disappointed and is not sure he would vote for Lula again. \u201cWe need a renewal.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Employer-sanctioned groups designed to enhance diversity and inclusion began in corporate America in the 1970s to help address tensions around race, gender and sexual orientation",
      "NEW YORK -- After moving to the United States from South Korea at age 6, Jenny Jang found it challenging to navigate through school and her first jobs.",
      "\u201cIn all of the environments I was in, I was always a minority,\u201d Jang said. \u201cComing to the States, I didn\u2019t have a road map for me. And I couldn\u2019t ask these questions to my parents, so I had to seek mentorship from elsewhere.\u201d",
      "Now based in Atlanta and working at an international elevator company, Jang launched the organization's business resource groups in North America. The gatherings offered ways for employees to find support and connect around an identity or theme.",
      "The first group, for women employees, drew 500 members in three years. Jang brought in a facilitator to lead conversations on topics such as balancing family responsibilities and a career in a male-dominated industry. A group for veterans and supporting military families came next.",
      "The gatherings \u201cbecame a safe space where employees could share their experiences,\u201d she said.",
      "Employee resource groups, which are voluntary, employer-sanctioned groups designed to enhance diversity and inclusion, began in corporate America in the 1970s to help address tensions around race, gender and sexual orientation. Over the years, the focus has expanded to recognize other affiliations and experiences, such as caring for a family member, mental health challenges, neurodiversity and generational divides.",
      "Critics of ERGs have become more outspoken in arguing that such groups give participants unfair advantages and damage staff morale by splintering colleagues based on personal characteristics or beliefs. In some cases, companies have responded to complaints by revising the purpose and scope of their employee groups.",
      "An executive order President Donald Trump signed with the goal of ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government and beyond has created additional uncertainty around the future of ERGs. Here is some information about starting, participating in or evaluating the groups at your company:",
      "The Equal Employment Opportunities Commission released guidance in March which said that limiting membership in ERGs to workers covered by anti-discrimination laws, such as only women or people of a particular race, can be considered unlawful segregation.",
      "To comply with the EEOC's interpretation, employers should ensure workplace groups are open to all employees.",
      "\u201cThey want to make sure these programs are not offering some tangible benefit to one group of employees at the expense of another,\u201d said Infinito Associates CEO Kevin England, whose consulting group helps organizations start ERGs.",
      "If an ERG offers mentorship or opportunities only to people who identify as a member of a legally protected class, \"you absolutely do need to open that up,\u201d said David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law.",
      "Some employee resource groups organized around an identity create separate email lists for members who share the identity and members who describe themselves as allies. Glasgow advises against doing that. \u201cIt raises the question of what you're excluding people from,\u201d he said.",
      "The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, a conservative public interest law firm and policy organization, has received dozens of complaints from employees who felt excluded from their workplace ERGs, according to Deputy Counsel Dan Lennington. Opening employee groups to everyone will not necessarily satisfy those concerns, he said.",
      "\u201cThe question is, are you treating employees differently based on race?\u201d Lennington said. \u201cAre you making employees feel uncomfortable about their race or gender or sexual identity?\u201d",
      "Proponents of ERGs list numerous benefits for employees and management. For participants, the groups are places to find community, develop leadership skills and create a channel for sharing their views with higher-ups. Companies often sponsor affinity groups as a tool for recruiting and retaining diverse employees.",
      "\u201cEmployee engagement is great because it creates, typically, higher effort and retention,\u201d said Helena Pagano, chief people and culture officer at insurance and financial services firm Sun Life. \u201cOne way that you drive engagement is making people feel like they had a voice. They had a place to express opinions and drive policies and outcomes that matter in the company.\u201d",
      "England, the consultant, was working at a bank call center when he joined and then took on a leadership role in an ERG for people who identify as LGBTQIA+.",
      "\u201cI was terrified to speak publicly, and because of that role, I had to do a lot of that,\u201d England said. \u201cI was able to develop skills that were completely unrelated to my day job.\"",
      "Anna Ettin co-founded Bank of America\u2019s intergenerational employee network about a decade ago, and worked on bridging gaps between millennials and baby boomers. Now, as co-founder of Tapestry Partner Solutions, a consulting group that specializes in intergenerational dynamics and skills development, she's doing the same work with Generation Z.",
      "\u201cThere are some real differences in the way they\u2019re coming into the workplace and what their needs are, their expectations,\" Ettin said. \u201cWe\u2019re really helping companies think through, how do you retain the incredibly talented staff you have and also be appetizing to Gen Z?\u201d",
      "When Ettin worked in a call center about 20 years ago, she noticed few women in management roles. \u201cThere was a clear gap in the leadership pipeline for women,\u201d she said. She gathered 20 highly engaged women and they started by planning events on interviewing skills, resume writing and talks with senior female leaders about their career paths and obstacles they'd overcome.",
      "Experts recommend finding a senior leader to act as a sponsor. In Ettin's case, that meant convincing the call center manager to approve and participate in the group.",
      "Groups typically begin when 10 or 20 people find each other organically and get together for happy hours or lunches, England said. \u201cYou get some momentum going, and sometimes that group of 20 people becomes 50 or 100 people,\u201d he added.",
      "Then you can tell leaders, \u201cwe already have an informal collection of employees with this shared experience, and we would love to do something more with this,\" England said. \"We think that this group of friends and colleagues could help the organization.\u201d",
      "Some ERGs are given company funds for meals, events or travel to conferences. A new group should be prepared to make a business case for a budget request. Experts also advise collecting data to show the group\u2019s impact in areas such as employee retention.",
      "It's easier to start a new ERG when an organization already has one in place because there's a road map of what worked and who supported the initial group. But if none exist at your workplace, you can start with one and build from there, Jang said. \u201cThere is no perfect recipe,\u201d she said. \u201cStart small.\u201d",
      "As organizations absorb various federal directives, they're deciding which direction to take. Some have adjusted to make it clear that all are welcome. Others have shuttered their ERGs altogether, wiping out years of work, Ettin said.",
      "\u201cThe underrepresented, underserved communities still need the programs, support, connectivity and advocacy that they\u2019ve needed for the last decades,\" Ettin added. \"That hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d",

      "The three-time Tour de France champion had launched his last and decisive attack on the penultimate climb \u2013 about 18 kilometers (11 miles) from the finish \u2014 and not even defending champion Mathieu van der Poel could stay on his wheel.",
      "Pogacar finished 1 minute, 1 second ahead of Mads Pedersen, who edged out Van der Poel in a four-man sprint for second, just ahead of Wout van Aert and Jasper Stuyven.",
      "Also known as De Ronde (The Tour), the Tour of Flanders is one of cycling\u2019s most challenging one-day races and was first held in 1913. This year\u2019s 268.9-kilometer (167-mile) route featured 16 short but punishing climbs and several cobblestone sections.",
      "It was a second victory for Pogacar after he won in 2023. The Slovenian didn\u2019t defend his title last year, when Van der Poel claimed a record-equaling third win.",
      "It was expected to be another episode of the great rivalry between Pogacar and Van der Poel, who had won the recent Milan-San Remo, and so it proved.",
      "The duo played cat and mouse with each other in the final 50 kilometers (31 miles) with each matching the other\u2019s attacks before Pogacar left the Dutch cyclist and the other hopefuls in the distance.",
      "The Tour of Flanders is one of the \u201cmonuments\u201d of cycling \u2014 the five most prestigious one-day events in the sport \u2014 along with Milan-San Remo, Paris-Roubaix, Liege-Bastogne-Liege and the Giro di Lombardia.",

      "SAN ANTONIO -- Up by double figures in the second half at the Final Four, closing in on the chance to play for yet another national championship, Duke was right where it had worked all season to be.",
      "What happened next was unforgettable, history of the most painful kind.",
      "Up 14 with 8 1/2 minutes left, the Blue Devils improbably faded down the stretch, done in by Houston's relentless fight to stay in a game that had frequently seemed on the verge of getting away. They missed shots. They turned the ball over. They couldn't get stops. And their biggest star \u2014 Associated Press national player of the year Cooper Flagg \u2014 missed a shot for the lead in the final seconds.",
      "By the final horn, the Cougars had scored the game's last nine points in the final 1:14 to erase the remnants of the Blue Devils' big lead and finish off a 70-67 victory Saturday night in the second semifinal.",
      "Duke went from in firm control to having a desperate final possession after LJ Cryer's last two free throws with 3.7 seconds left, leaving the Blue Devils only Sion James' full-court heave for a try at a tying 3 with no timeouts left. But after a scramble for the catch, it ended up in Tyrese Proctor's hands to flail it toward the basket and miss everything as the horn sounded.",
      "That sent James crumpling to midcourt in anguish, only to look around and realize he had to quickly spring up because the Cougars' bench was sprinting his way to celebrate a stunning victory. That included J'Wan Roberts \u2014 who hit the go-ahead free throws after drawing an over-the-back foul on Flagg \u2014 running over to Cougars fans nearby to scream in victory while popping the front of his jersey.",
      "Roberts had also defended Flagg's shot for the lead moments before Cryer's last free throws, forcing the 6-foot-9 freshman to take a tough fading shot in the lane that missed off the front of the rim.",
      "As Houston's players celebrated, Flagg walked with his head down toward the edge of the court for the stairs to down to the tunnel and to the locker room. His teammates followed with stunned expressions, along with freshman big man Khaman Maluach having tears streaming down his face.",

      "Jesse Winker hit two triples including the tying two-run hit in the eighth inning of the New York Mets\u2019 3-2 win over the Toronto Blue Jays",
      "NEW YORK -- Jesse Winker was holding his daughter during a postgame interview after helping lift the New York Mets to a comeback win Saturday night when he asked her if he was fast.",
      "Without hesitation, 4-year-old Wren nodded. She quickly nodded again when Winker asked if she's faster than him.",
      "\u201cWren\u2019s Dad didn\u2019t know he was fast,\u201d Winker said with a big smile. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think he is fast.\u201d",
      "But Winker hit two triples, including the tying two-run hit in the eighth inning, and also had a double in the Mets\u2019 3-2 win over the Toronto Blue Jays.",
      "So, is Winker the new basepaths-blazing version of Lance Johnson or Jose Reyes for the Mets?",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Winker said flatly.",
      "The 31-year-old Winker entered Saturday with just three regular-season triples in 760 career games, and he hadn't had one in a regular-season game since 2021 while with Cincinnati.",
      "But the triples against the Blue Jays were his third and fourth in his last 16 games dating to the start of the playoffs last October. The long-haired outfielder had RBI triples against Milwaukee in a wild-card series and Los Angeles in the NL Championship Series.",
      "\u201cJust put your head down and run as fast as you can,\u201d Winker said.",
      "Winker\u2019s second triple could have been an inside-the-park home run. Blue Jays right fielder George Springer suffered lower back spasms after crashing into the wall in pursuit of the ball, but he got back to his feet, chased down the ball and threw it towards the infield to limit Winker to three bases.",
      "\u201cInitially, I thought it had a chance to get out \u2014 I probably should have been running harder out of the box,\u201d Winker said. \u201cBut once it ricocheted, I just wanted to run as fast as I could.\u201d",
      "Winker also tripled with two outs in the fourth off Chris Bassitt, but was stranded when Mark Vientos struck out. The two-triple game was the first by a Mets player since Francisco Lindor did so on July 26, 2023.",
      "Still, Winker joined a select club by becoming the 17th player in team history with two triples in a game. Reyes holds the team record with 113 triples and eight two-triple games. Johnson, whose 21 triples in 1996 are the single-season team record, and Doug Flynn are the only other Mets players with a pair of two-triple games.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy \u2014 crazy, no comment,\u201d Winker said with a grin. \u201cTired.\u201d",

      "Duke made a grand total of one field goal over the last 10 1/2 minutes of this game. The second-to-last attempt during its game-ending 1-for-9 stretch was a step-back jumper in the lane by Flagg that J\u2019Wan Roberts disrupted. The last was a desperation heave by Tyrese Proctor that caught nothing at the buzzer.",
      "It was Roberts\u2019 two free throws with 19.6 seconds left that gave the Cougars their first lead since 6-5. LJ Cryer, who led Houston with 26 points, made two more to push the lead to three. It was Houston\u2019s biggest lead of the night.",

      "Florida\u2019s 79-73 win over Auburn in the early game was a free-flowing hoopsfest. This one would\u2019ve looked perfect on a cracked blacktop and a court with chain-link nets.",
      "That\u2019s just how Houston likes it. It closed the game on a 9-0 run over the final 74 seconds, and though Flagg finished with 27 points, he did it on 8-for-19 shooting and never got a good look after his 3 at the 3:02 mark put the Blue Devils (35-4) up by nine.",
      "It looked over at that point. Houston was just getting started.",
      "\u201cWe had a feeling that we could still win this game,\u201d Roberts said.",
      "A team that prides itself on getting three stops in a row \u2014 calling the third one the \u201ckill stop\u201d \u2014 allowed a measly three free throws down the stretch. One came when Joseph Tugler got a technical for batting the ball from a Duke player's hand as he was trying to throw an inbounds pass.",
      "That didn't make it any better for Duke.",
      "On the possession following the technical, Tugler rejected Kon Knueppel (16 points), then Emanuel Sharp (16 points) made a 3 to cut the deficit to three.",
      "Mylik Wilson stole the next inbounds pass and missed a game-tying 3, but Tugler tipped it in to cut the deficit to one.",
      "Proctor missed the front end of a 1-and-1 with 20 seconds left to set the stage for the Roberts free throws.",
      "Duke\u2019s slow walk off the court came through a phalanx of Houston fans who waved goodbye to Flagg, who will likely be off to the NBA as the first pick in the draft.",
      "Houston finished with six steals and six blocked shots, including four from Tugler, who might be the best shot blocker this program has seen since Hakeem Olajuwon, who was on hand at the Alamodome to see the program's first trip to the final since 1984.",
      "The huge comeback also netted a $1 million win for artificial intelligence. An AI disruptor bet a professional gambler that his program could do a better March Madness bracket, and it all came down to the Duke-Houston game.",
      "Even if the Houston loses in the final, the AI bracket will get more points in the contest and the disruptor, Alan Levy, will pocket the million.",

      "Even as he grows older, Microsoft founder Bill Gates still fondly remembers the catalytic computer code he wrote 50 years ago that opened up a new frontier in technology.",
      "Although the code that Gates printed out on a teletype machine may look crude compared to what's powering today's artificial intelligence platforms, it played a critical role in creating Microsoft in April 1975 \u2014 a golden anniversary that the Redmond, Washington, company will celebrate on Friday.",
      "Gates, 69, set the stage for that jubilee with a blog post reminiscing on how he and his old high school friend \u2014 the late Paul Allen \u2014 scrambled to create the world's first \u201csoftware factory\u201d after reading an article in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine about the Altair 8800, a minicomputer that would be powered by a tiny chip made by the then-obscure technology company, Intel.",
      "The article inspired Gates, who was just a freshman at Harvard University, and Allen to call Altair's maker, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, and promise the company's CEO Ed Roberts they had developed software that would enable consumers to control the hardware. There was just one hitch: Gates and Allen hadn't yet come up with the code they promised Roberts.",
      "Gates and Allen tackled the challenge by latching onto the BASIC computer language that had been developed in 1964 at Dartmouth College, but they still had to figure out a way to make the technology compatible with the forthcoming Altair computer, even though they didn't even have a prototype of the machine.",
      "After spending two months working on the program with little sleep, Gates finished the code that became the basis for the Altair's first operating system. \u201cThat code remains the coolest I\u2019ve ever written,\u201d Gates wrote in his blog post, which includes an option to download the original program.",
      "The code would go on to provide the foundation for a business that would make personal computers a household staple, with a suite of software that include the Word, Excel and PowerPoint programs, as well as the Windows operating system that still powers most PCs today.",
      "\u201cThat was the revolution,\u201d Gates said of the code in a video accompanying his post. \u201cThat was the thing that ushered in personal computing.\u201d",
      "Gates' recollection of the code is part of a nostalgic kick that he has been on this year as he prepares to turn 70 in October.",
      "The trip down memory lane included the February release of a memoir exploring his early years as an often-misunderstood child with few friends, and a hailing of the 25th anniversary of the philanthropic foundation he created after stepping down as Microsoft's CEO in 2000. The tech giant initially stumbled after Gates' departure but has been thriving under CEO Satya Nadella, and has amassed a market value of about $2.8 trillion.",
      "In his memoir, Gates also reflected on his tempestuous relationship with fellow PC pioneer, the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, whose company will be celebrating its golden anniversary next year.",
      "\u201cFifty years is a long time,\u201d said Gates, whose personal fortune is estimated at $108 billion. \u201cIt's crazy that the dream came true.\u201d",

      "Construction crews in Vienna last year made an unprecedented discovery",
      "VIENNA -- As construction crews churned up dirt to renovate a Vienna soccer field last October, they happened upon an unprecedented find: A heap of intertwined skeletal remains in a mass grave dating to the 1st-century Roman Empire, likely the bodies of warriors in a battle involving Germanic tribes.",
      "On Wednesday, after archaeological analysis, experts at the Vienna Museum gave a first public presentation of the grave \u2014 linked to \u201ca catastrophic event in a military context\" and evidence of the first known fighting ever in that region.",
      "The bodies of 129 people have been confirmed at the site in the Vienna neighborhood of Simmering. The excavation teams also found many dislocated bones and believe the total number of victims tops 150 \u2014 a discovery never seen before in Central Europe.",
      "\u201cWithin the context of Roman acts of war, there are no comparable finds of fighters,\" said Michaela Binder, who led the archaeological dig. \"There are huge battlefields in Germany where weapons were found. But finding the dead, that is unique for the entire Roman history.\u201d",
      "Soldiers in the Roman Empire were typically cremated until the 3rd century.",
      "The pit where the bodies were deposited suggests a hasty or disorganized dumping of corpses. Every skeleton examined showed signs of injury \u2014 to the head, torso and pelvis in particular.",
      "\u201cThey have various different battle wounds, which rules out execution. It is truly a battlefield,\" said Kristina Adler-W\u00f6lfl, head of Vienna city archaeological department. \u201cThere are wounds from swords, lances; wounds from blunt trauma.\u201d",
      "The victims were all male. Most were aged 20 to 30 years old and generally showed signs of good dental health.",
      "Carbon-14 analysis helped date the bones to between 80 and 130 A.D. That was cross-checked against known history of relics found in the grave \u2013 armor, helmet cheek protectors, the nails used in distinctive Roman military shoes known as caligae.",
      "The most indicative clue came from a rusty dagger of a type in use specifically between the middle of the 1st century and the start of the second.",
      "The research continues: Only one victim has been confirmed as a Roman warrior. Archaeologists hope DNA and strontium isotope analysis will help further identify the fighters, and whose side they were on.",
      "\u201cThe most likely theory at the moment is that this is connected to the Danube campaigns of Emperor Domitian \u2014 that\u2019s 86 to 96 A.D.,\" Adler-W\u00f6lfl said.",
      "City archaeologists said the discovery also reveals the early signs of the founding of a settlement that would become the Austrian capital of today.",

      "What was once Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest coal-fired power plant is being turned into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus designed to capitalize on Big Tech's fast-growing energy demands",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The owners of what was once Pennsylvania's biggest coal-fired power plant said Wednesday that they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus designed to capitalize on the fast-growing energy demands of Big Tech companies to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing applications.",
      "The former Homer City Generating Station, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Pittsburgh, will host seven gas-fired turbines to power data centers on site with up to 4.5 gigawatts of electricity, according to the owners, an investor group named Homer City Development.",
      "That amount of electricity is enough to power about 3 million homes.",
      "Construction is expected to begin this year and power could start flowing by 2027, the group said in a statement. The cost to prepare the site and build the data centers could exceed the initial $10 billion investment by billions more, the group said.",
      "Much of the critical infrastructure for the project is already in place from the shuttered Homer City power plant, including transmission lines connected to the mid-Atlantic and New York power grids, substations and water access, the group said.",
      "The developers were awarded a $5 million state grant to extend a gas line to the property, which sits atop the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir.",
      "Last month, the group demolished the three cooling towers and four smokestacks still standing from the former coal plant. It shut down in 2023 after 54 years in operation.",
      "The owners, Homer City Development, blamed competition with cheaper natural gas, unseasonably warm winters that demanded less power, the rising cost of coal and increasingly expensive environmental regulations.",
      "The late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT \u2014 built with help from Microsoft's data centers \u2014 ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.",
      "That has sent Big Tech companies in search of new power sources, spurred interest in a new wave of nuclear reactors, revived interest in building new gas-fired plants and stoked concerns among states and federal regulators about electricity shortages.",
      "It's also prompted utilities to delay the retirements of aging power plants and to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, including last year's announcement that the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant will reopen under a 20-year agreement to feed Microsoft's data centers.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders have spurred more than 130 lawsuits, but one related to TikTok barely generates a peep",
      "WASHINGTON -- After TikTok was banned in the United States earlier this year, President Donald Trump gave the platform a reprieve, barreling past a law that was passed in Congress and upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court that said the ban was necessary for national security.",
      "The Republican president's executive orders have spurred more than 130 lawsuits in the little more than two months he has been in office, but this one barely generated a peep. None of those suits challenges his temporary block of the 2024 law that banned the popular social video app after the deadline passed for it to be sold by ByteDance, its China-based parent company.",
      "Few of the 431 members of the House of Representatives and the Senate who voted for the law have complained.",
      "Despite a bipartisan consensus about the risk to national security posed by TikTok\u2019s ties to China, \"it\u2019s as if nothing ever happened,\u201d said Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "TikTok continues to function, much to the delight of its 170 million users in the U.S., and the tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle have been persuaded to continue to offer and support the app, on the promise that Trump\u2019s Justice Department would not use the law to seek potentially steep fines against them.",
      "Trump declared he was suspending the law for 75 days, though no provision of the rule would appear to allow for that, to give ByteDance a fresh chance to find a U.S. buyer. The president has suggested he could extend the pause, but he has since said he expects a deal by Saturday, when the reprieve expires. He is meeting Wednesday with aides about possible suitors for TikTok. Oracle and the investment firm Blackstone are among the potential investors.",
      "Trump's action followed a fast-tracked free-speech challenge by TikTok and its users that ended with a unanimous Supreme Court ruling days before Trump's inauguration, in which the justices held that national security concerns overcame their usual receptivity to First Amendment claims.",
      "The court's opinions dealt at length with the potential for China to harvest vast quantities of TikTok users' data that could allow it to track the locations of federal employees and contractors.",
      "\u201cThe record before us establishes that TikTok mines data both from TikTok users and about millions of others who do not consent to share their information,\u201d Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a brief separate opinion. \u201cAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, TikTok can access \u2018any data\u2019 stored in a consenting user\u2019s \u2018contact list\u2019 \u2014 including names, photos, and other personal information about unconsenting third parties.\u201d",
      "TikTok, which has headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles, has said it prioritizes user safety, and China's Foreign Ministry has said China\u2019s government has never and will not ask companies to \u201ccollect or provide data, information or intelligence\u201d held in foreign countries.",
      "The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users, but it came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "The president's position has evolved over time. During his first term, he used an executive order to try to ban TikTok on national security grounds. But federal courts blocked it. His administration then tried to negotiate a sale of the platform, but it failed.",
      "Trump changed his tune during his 2024 campaign and said he would \u201csave TikTok,\u201d then credited the platform with helping him win more young voters. He issued the 75-day pause on the first day of his second term.",
      "The law allows for one 90-day reprieve, but only if there's a deal on the table and a formal notification to Congress.",
      "Trump's actions so far violate the law, said Alan Rozenshtein, an associate law professor at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe law does not permit the sort of \u2018extension\u2019 that Donald Trump has announced,\" Rozenshtein said.",
      "But both he and Kreps acknowledged a court challenge or other pushback is unlikely.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s the constituency? You have 170 million Americans using the app, and they\u2019re pretty happy to see this continue to be available to them,\u201d Kreps said.",
      "It also might be hard for someone to establish the legal right, or standing, to sue, Rozenshtein said. A plaintiff would have to be able to show harm from the delay in enforcing the law, he said.",
      "More importantly, he said, the TikTok executive order was an early \"example of the Trump administration not caring about the rule of law.\u201d",
      "While Trump has directed the Justice Department not to seek fines from the tech companies, they still are taking a legal gamble, according to Democratic lawmakers who oppose the TikTok ban but also criticize Trump for his actions. A future administration might have its own reasons to pursue legal claims against Apple, Google and Oracle, they wrote Trump in a letter last week.",
      "Companies could face hundreds of billions of dollars in legal liability for facilitating TikTok's operations since the law's effective date of Jan. 19, Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Ed Markey of Massachusetts wrote.",
      "The companies themselves acknowledged their legally uncertain situation in their initial response to Trump's order. Oracle continued to provide cloud services to TikTok, the senators said, but \u201cApple and Google, however, initially came to a different decision and refused to reinstate TikTok in their app stores.\"",
      "The companies changed course only after receiving written assurance from the Justice Department.",
      "The Democrats have called for amending the law to extend the deadline for a sale to October. Other opponents of the TikTok ban support a full repeal.",
      "Among the few supporters of the ban to speak out is Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "But rather than take on Trump, Moolenaar has focused his criticism on ByteDance and its ties the Chinese Communist Party. \u201cIf ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal \u2014 plain and simple,\u201d Moolenaar said in remarks to a TikTok event on Capitol Hill last week.",
      "Several potential bidders have stepped forward.",
      "Perplexity AI presented ByteDance in January with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "Another possibility is a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic adviser. Investors in the consortium previously said they offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. They had planned to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they said would provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, had also organized a consortium, which included the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and offered ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",

      "The Tennessee Valley Authority has promoted one of its top executives to CEO as President Donald Trump has begun turning his attention back to the nation's largest public utility",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The nation's largest public utility on Monday promoted one of its top executives to CEO, putting Don Moul in charge of the Tennessee Valley Authority as President Donald Trump has cast renewed attention on the federal entity.",
      "The utility announced that its board picked Moul as president and chief executive to replace Jeff Lyash, who said in January that he would retire no later than September. The move comes less than a week after Trump removed one of the utility's board members without indicating why. With the firing of Michelle Moore, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, the board currently has five members and four vacancies.",
      "The board firing and CEO hiring come after Tennessee's two Republican U.S. senators urged officials to opt for \u201can interim CEO trusted by the president\u201d before hiring someone long-term.",
      "Moul has served as TVA's executive vice president and chief operating officer since June 2021. In a news release announcing his selection, TVA focused in part on Moul's leadership in the advancement of nuclear energy technologies and his experience as a licensed senior reactor operator. He starts in the new role on April 9.",
      "\u201cTVA needs a steady hand right now,\" Moul said in the news release. \"I will build on the momentum that Jeff and our team have created -\u2013 making sure we continue to invest in new generation, strengthen our grid and enhance system reliability.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty wrote a guest column arguing that the TVA board was bogging down a project that seeks to build a small modular reactor with studies and hurdles.",
      "Blackburn and Hagerty also said that hiring a CEO from within would forgo the chance to recruit a \u201ctop-quality leader\u201d from outside the utility, which provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states.",
      "In part, advocates for nuclear energy have called for its expansion to help meet the demand from companies to power their artificial intelligence technologies, and do so without carbon emissions that speed up climate change.",
      "Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, called the op-ed by Blackburn and Hagerty \u201creckless interference.\u201d He said they don't understand the \u201crisk of rushing nuclear technology before it\u2019s ready for prime time both economically and safety-wise.\u201d",
      "Clean energy advocates have also criticized TVA's decision to replace several of its aging coal plants with another fossil fuel, natural gas.",
      "Trump put TVA and the outgoing CEO Lyash on the hot seat in his first term.",
      "In 2020, Trump fired the former TVA board chairman and another board member and drove TVA to reverse course on the hiring of foreign labor for information technology jobs.",
      "He also called for Lyash\u2019s replacement and the position\u2019s pay to be capped at $500,000.",
      "In response, TVA has noted that the CEO pay ranks in the bottom quartile of the power industry. Lyash\u2019s total compensation topped $10.5 million in the 2024 budget year, including various pension and performance incentives worth millions of dollars. Additionally, the utility has stressed that it doesn\u2019t receive federal taxpayer money and instead is funded by electricity customers.",
      "A TVA spokesperson has said Lyash's retirement was not related to the administration or current politics and that Lyash had begun talking to TVA board members last fall about considering retirement.",

      "NEW YORK -- For those trapped in rubble after an earthquake, survival depends on many factors, including weather and access to water and air.",
      "If their injuries aren't too severe, victims can survive for a week or more, assuming the weather isn't too hot or cold, experts say.",
      "Rescue teams in Myanmar and Thailand are searching for survivors after Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake that toppled buildings and damaged roads. The disaster has killed more than 2,000 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in Thailand, mainly at a Bangkok office tower construction site.",
      "Most rescues happen in the 24 hours after a disaster. The chances of survival drop with each day after that, experts say. Most victims are badly injured or buried by falling stones or other debris.",
      "Trapped victims are more likely to survive if they are in a debris-free pocket that prevents major injury while they await rescue, like under a sturdy desk, said geophysicist Victor Tsai from Brown University in an email. Experts call this a survivable void space.",
      "If fire, smoke or hazardous chemicals were released as a result of the building collapse, they may decrease a person's survival odds, said emergency response expert Dr. Joseph Barbera, an associate professor at George Washington University.",
      "Beyond that, having air to breathe and water to drink are crucial as the days go on.",
      "\u201cYou could survive a while without food,\u201d Barbera said. \u201cYou could survive less without water.\u201d",
      "Temperatures where someone is trapped may affect survival, and temperatures outside the rubble can affect rescue missions.",
      "Power outages and spotty communications have slowed relief operations in Myanmar, where many are searching for survivors by hand in daily temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). A lack of heavy machinery has slowed search-and-rescue efforts.",
      "It can be important for survivors to receive vital medical care before they are removed from the rubble, Barbera said. If not, the buildup of toxins from crushed muscles could make them go into shock after they are rescued.",
      "After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, a teenager and his 80-year-old grandmother were found alive after nine days trapped in their flattened home. And the year before, a 16-year-old Haitian girl was rescued from earthquake rubble in Port-Au-Prince after 15 days.",
      "The best practices for survival during an earthquake depend on where you are in the world. Building codes in regions with active fault lines are often designed to withstand earthquakes, but that doesn't hold true everywhere.",
      "In many countries, including the United States, the best practices are to drop, seek cover and hang on unless you are close to a building exit. Seek shelter under a heavy table or near sturdy furniture that may yield a survivable pocket if the roof collapses. Cover your face with cloth or a mask to protect from dust and debris.",
      "If you are trapped in the rubble after and earthquake, save your energy and don't overexert. Ration food and water, listen for rescue calls and search for something near you to make noise. If you have a phone with you, conserve its battery and try for help in short spurts each day.",

      "The clouds eventually moved and it took a few more hours for another satellite from San Francisco-based Planet Labs to capture the aerial pictures and send them to Microsoft's philanthropic AI for Good Lab. By then it was already about 11 p.m. Friday at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. A group of Microsoft workers was ready and waiting for the data.",
      "The AI for Good lab has done this kind of AI-assisted damage assessment before, tracking the flooding that devastated Libya in 2023 or this year's wildfires in Los Angeles. But rather than rely on a standard AI computer vision model that could run any visual data, they had to build a customized version specific to Mandalay.",
      "\u201cThe Earth is too different, the natural disasters are too different and the imagery we get from satellites is just too different to work in every situation,\u201d Lavista Ferres said. For instance, he said, while fires spread in fairly predictable ways, \u201can earthquake touches the whole city\u201d and it can be harder to know in the immediate aftermath where help is needed.",
      "Once the AI analysis was complete, it showed 515 buildings in Mandalay with 80% to 100% damage and another 1,524 with between 20% and 80% damage. That showed the widespread gravity of the disaster, but, just as important, it helps pinpoint specific locations of damage.",
      "\u201cThis is critical information for teams on the ground,\u201d Lavista Ferres said.",
      "Microsoft cautioned that it \"should serve as a preliminary guide and will require on-the-ground verification for a complete understanding.\" But in the meantime, the tech company has shared the analysis with aid groups such as the Red Cross.",

      "Dubbed the wooly devil, the flower with furry leaves, purplish-striped petals and pops of yellow is a new genus and species in the same family as sunflowers and daisies: Asteraceae. It was discovered last year in Big Bend National Park, known for its rugged terrain of desert, canyons and mountains, on the border with Mexico.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn with this species so they\u2019re really just getting started,\u201d said Carolyn Whiting, a Big Bend botanist.",
      "Scientists are hopeful the flowers will bloom again after rain fell on the drought-stricken park last week, giving them the opportunity to learn more including when the plants germinate, Whiting said.",
      "The flower was discovered in March 2024. Park volunteer Deb Manley and a park ranger were hiking in a remote area when they saw a patch of flowers that were smaller than a quarter and close to the ground.",
      "\u201cWe stopped and took some photos and neither one of us had any idea,\u201d Manley said. \u201cI could get it to family but I couldn\u2019t figure out any more than that. So we took photos and moved on, not realizing we had found a new genus.\u201d",
      "When Manley got back from the hike, she started researching what the flower could be. She soon found that not only was she stumped, but others were too. Her post about the flower on iNaturalist, an online platform for nature enthusiasts \u201ccaused a stir,\u201d said Isaac Lichter Marck, a researcher at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.",
      "A. Michael Powell, curator and director of the herbarium at Sul Russ State University in Alpine, said when Manley contacted him about the flower, he immediately thought it was something new.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything I\u2019d seen before,\u201d said Powell, who has extensively studied the region.",

      "\u201cWe really got out there just in the nick of time before the specimens would have been completely dried up,\u201d Whiting said.",
      "The discovery of the flower was announced last month.",
      "Lichter Marck said they were able to extract DNA from the flower but that there's still a lot to learn. He said they don\u2019t know yet how it reproduces, or what potential uses it might have. They also need to determine if it\u2019s endangered.",
      "The wooly devil's official name \u2014 Ovicula biradiata \u2014 takes inspiration from its appearance: Ovicula, which means tiny sheep, is a nod to the hairs that cover its leaves; while biradiata, or bi-radial, refers to its two striped petals.",
      "Kelsey Wogan, environmental lab manager at Sul Ross State University, said she\u2019s excited to see if the wooly devil can be found in other places as well and what its range is.",
      "Whiting said the park is so well-studied that finding a new species was a surprise.",
      "\u201cThe fact that there\u2019s still species out there that had slipped under the radar is pretty remarkable,\u201d she said.",
      "Wogan said part of the excitement about the flower's discovery is that it shows \u201cthere\u2019s still new and undescribed things out there.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the great reminder to keep your eyes open,\" she said, \"and if you don\u2019t know what something is, it might be completely new.\u201d",

The announcement was met with an immediate and ongoing plunge in global markets as well as various countries levying retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. Democratic lawmakers and critics of Trump's economic policy raised alarms about a potential recession and adverse effects on the U.S.'s relationship with allies.",
      "The universal 10% tariffs went into effect on Saturday, while tariffs on individual countries are set to go into effect on Wednesday.",
      "Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers disagreed with Hassett\u2019s contention that tariffs will cause a drop in prices for American consumers.",
      "\u201cThis is the biggest self-inflicted wound we've put on our economy in history. We are increasing inflation because the prices are higher because of the tariffs. That gives people less spending power. That means fewer jobs,\" Summers said after Hassett's interview. \"Markets are looking at all of that. And they think companies are going to be worth $5 trillion less than they thought before these tariffs started. And that's just the loss to companies. If you add in the loss to consumers, a reasonable estimate would probably be something like $30 trillion.\u201d",
      "Here are other highlights from Hassett and Summers\u2019 interviews:",
      "Hassett on Trump using the market crash to influence the Fed",
      "Stephanopoulos: Right, but you also -- he also said prices were going to come down and he just conceded the prices are going to go up. Also on Truth Social, the president retweeted a post that said the market drop was part of a deliberate strategy to force the Fed to lower interest rates. Is that the president's strategy? If not, why did he post it?",
      "Hassett: Yeah, that, you know, the bottom line is the president has been talking about tariffs for 40 years and this is like been absolutely the policy that he's focused on in the campaign and throughout his political career. And you know, the cyclical cycle of the Fed, it comes and goes. That's a different matter. But this is President Trump's desired policy. He's been arguing for it ever since. I think he was on \u201cThe View\u201d 30, 40 years ago, and it's exactly -- the baseline tariff is exactly what he -- he put into the convention.",
      "Stephanopoulos: But is it his strategy --",
      "Hassett: So, this is not a surprise for anyone.",
      "Stephanopoulos: Is it his strategy to force the Fed to lower interest rates, and that the market crash was part of that strategy?",
      "Hassett: We understand the Fed is an independent agency. We respect the independence of the Fed. But the president's allowed to have an opinion. The -- absolutely, the president's allowed to have an opinion but there's not going to be any political coercion over the Fed, for sure.",
      "Stephanopoulos: So -- so that is his strategy? Tank the market so the Fed will lower interest rates?",
      "Hassett: No, no, no.",
      "Stephanopoulos: Well, you just said the president's allowed to have an opinion. Is that his opinion or not?",
      "Hassett: He's not trying to tank the market. He's trying to deliver for American workers.",
      "Hassett on the lack of tariffs against Russia",
      "Stephanopoulos: Why did the president not include Russia on the list of countries who are facing tariffs?",
      "Hassett: There's obviously an ongoing negotiation with Russia and Ukraine, and I think the president made the decision not to conflate the two issues. It doesn't mean that Russia, the fullest of time, is going to be treated wildly different than every other country, but Russia is one of the only countries, one of the few countries, that is not subject to these new tariffs, aren't they? They're in the middle of a negotiation, George, aren't they?",
      "Stephanopoulos: Well, I'm asking a different question: Why? And I just want to know why---",
      "Hassett: Would you literally advise that you go in and put a whole bunch of new things on the table in the middle of a negotiation that affects so many American and Ukrainian and Russian lives.",
      "Stephanopoulos: Negotiators do that. Negotiators do that all the time.",
      "Hassett: No, no, that's not appropriate to throw a new thing into these negotiations right in the middle of it. It's just not.",
      "Stephanopoulos: So you are conceding that Russia is not paying any new tariffs, unlike many of our allies, including Europe, Canada, Mexico.",
      "Hassett: Russia is in the midst of negotiations over peace that affects, really, thousands and thousands of lives of people, and that's what President Trump is focused on right now.",
      "Summers on the stock market",
      "Stephanopoulos: If you're advising American consumers, also American corporate leaders on where this is headed, how would you counsel them to prepare for all of this?",
      "Summers: Look, I think there's a very good chance there's going to be more turbulence in markets. The two-day move we saw on Thursday and Friday was the fourth largest two-day move since the Second World War. The other three were the 1987 crash, the 2008 financial crisis, and the pandemic. So a drop of this magnitude signals that there's likely to be trouble ahead. And people ought to just be very cautious.",
      "But the risk is, of course, when all of us decide to be cautious, that can become a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Unless and until the president recognizes that this is a very serious error that is likely to have very adverse consequences, I think it's likely to make things very difficult. I think people are right to hold off on making big new purchases, businesses are right to be cautious. People are right to want to hold cash. What we need is a reversal of these policies, and until we have a reversal, I think we're going to have a real problem. This is a moment of testing for the president's advisers. The intellectually honest ones know that this reflects presidential 40-year fixation, not any kind of proven economic theory.",

      "The biggest mistake Democrats have made is \u201cnot centering people enough\u201d Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said Sunday.",
      "\u201cA lot of people voted for Donald Trump because they trusted him and didn't trust that Democrats could deliver for them,\u201d Booker told ABC \u201cThis Week\u201d anchor George Stephanopoulos. \u201cWe are in a state where, again, the Democratic Party should own up. We partly laid this pathway for this demagogue to come into office, and so the way we deal with that, the way we correct from those mistakes, is to do more of the centering of American voices, American people in our conversation and in our focus, not focus on politics, focus on people.\u201d",
      "Booker\u2019s marathon 25 hour and 4 minute speech that concluded Tuesday evening broke the record for the longest speech on the Senate floor. Booker protested the national \"crisis\" he said President Donald Trump and adviser Elon Musk created. It surpassed the record set by Sen. Strom Thurmond, who filibustered the Civil Rights Act for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957.",
      "During the speech, Booker said that Democrats must do better.",
      "\u201cI confess that I have been imperfect. I confess that I've been inadequate to the moment,\u201d Booker said on Tuesday. \u201cI confess that the Democratic Party has made terrible mistakes that gave a lane to this demagogue. I confess we all must look in the mirror and say 'we will do better.'\"",
      "Booker told Stephanopoulos the action he tried to inspire with his speech should not be confused with partisan politics.",
      "\u201cThis is not about the Democratic Party, I'm sorry,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThe Democratic Party is at its weakest when it's concerned about the party. It's at its strongest when it's concerned about the people, when it's bigger and broader than any narrow, political analysis. This is the time for Americans to step up.\u201d",
      "Tens of thousands of \u201cHands Off\u201d protesters rallied in more than 1,200 cities across the country on Saturday to speak out against the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to the federal workforce and other policies, according to organizers.",
      "\u201cI'm just grateful, especially yesterday, to stand in solidarity with millions of Americans who are just really determined, even though they themselves are tired, to keep fighting,\u201d Booker said.",
      "Here are more highlights from Booker\u2019s interview:",
      "Booker on the tariffs Trump announced this week",
      "Stephanopoulos: Let's talk about some of the issues that Americans were responding to, including, of course, the tariffs. You heard Kevin Hassett earlier in the program. He said there may be some increase in prices, but it's going to be worth it. Your response?",
      "Booker: God bless Kevin, but I've never seen an administration in my lifetime do something so monumentally wrong and that so staggeringly hurts American people. I've been hearing all day yesterday, from frightened Americans who've saved for their entire lives, for retirement in the coming months, but now know they can't because in one fell swoop, Donald Trump has devastated their retirement accounts, their 401(k)s\u2026 This president is pushing, yet again, a plan to gut basic services to give bigger and bigger tax cuts to the wealthy. So the chaos he has unleashed on America, the financial insecurity that he has brought to people's lives, this is not what he promised people, and I think he will already go down for a president having the worst first 100 days in the last century of any president that's ever taken that office.",
      "Booker on law firms and universities targeted by the administration",
      "Stephanopoulos: \u201cYou also saw Jon Karl's piece about the president\u2019s retribution campaign, he promised to be the retribution during the campaign. We're seeing these moves against universities. We\u2019re seeing these moves against law firms. You took the Senate floor to protest. What should these law firms and universities do?",
      "Booker: \u201cWell, first and foremost, you're calling retribution, but it's something far worse than that. If you look around the world, from Viktor Orban to Vladimir Putin, this is not what democratic leaders do. This is really a violation of our constitutional principles, that he's using that power of that office, not to advance noble causes that could help the American people, whether I disagree with them or not, that's what a president is called to do, do what they think is in the best interests of the public at large. What this president is instead doing is violating our constitutional principles, violating the fundamental rights of people in order to punish them, to carry out his own retribution plan. You know, John F. Kennedy famously said, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\u201d Donald Trump is now saying, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for Donald Trump to make amends. He is trying to hurt people, to make them cower to him and offer him tribute in order to not violate the Constitution and hurt them economically. This is something that should not just be about a bunch of law firms. This is something that should ultimately be about Americans.",

      "Critics say college students will especially be affected if the president follows through with transferring the responsibilities of the Office of Federal Student Aid \u2014 with its $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio -- to another agency and terminating the federal workers who administer funds for higher education.",

      "At an impromptu appearance at a news conference held by Democrats outside the department's headquarters earlier this week, McMahon defended the administration's moves, saying she believes the best education is \"closest to the child where teachers and parents, local superintendents, working together and local school boards to develop the curriculum for those students is the best way that it can happen.\"",
      "McMahon has also vowed\u00a0to continue funding statutorily mandated functions and responsibilities of the department.",

    "summary": "Prosecutors seek more than seven years for George Santos in \"brazen web of deceit.\"",
    "story": [
      "The former congressman's sentencing is on April 30.",
      "Federal prosecutors are urging a judge to sentence disgraced former U.S. Rep. George Santos to seven years and three months in prison, calling his conduct a \"brazen web of deceit\" that defrauded donors, misled voters, and fueled his political rise through lies, theft, and identity fraud.",
      "The government outlined the extent of Santos's fraudulent activity across the 2020 and 2022 election cycles in a detailed sentencing memo filed on Friday.",
      "Prosecutors allege Santos, 35, with the help of former Campaign Treasurer Nancy Marks, falsified Federal Election Commission filings, fabricating donor contributions and inflating fundraising totals to meet the $250,000 threshold required to join the National Republican Congressional Committee's (NRCC) coveted \"Young Guns\" program. Marks pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing in June.",
      "When informed he hadn't reached the NRCC benchmark, Santos texted an associate, \"We are going to do this a little differently. I got it.\"",
      "That \"different\" approach included submitting fake donations attributed to family members, fictitious individuals and even identities stolen from elderly supporters, according to the filing.",
      "In tandem, Santos was running a fraudulent political consulting firm, Redstone Strategies LLC, falsely presenting it as a registered Super PAC or 501(c)(4) nonprofit. It was neither, according to prosecutors.",
      "Prosecutors say Santos used Redstone to launder donor money, keep commissions and fund personal expenses. In one scheme, he used an elderly woman's credit card -- originally provided for a one-time donation -- to charge $12,000 through Redstone's merchant account, netting himself $11,580 after fees. He wired the money directly into his personal bank account.",
      "When questioned by his business partner, Santos lied, claiming the woman -- who suffers from a brain injury -- was a consulting client, according to the filing. Between February and August 2022, prosecutors say Santos used her credit card repeatedly, attributing donations to her, her daughter, or fictitious names.",
      "Another victim, referred to as \"Individual 2\" in the filing, had their credit card charged at least five times in March 2022, totaling more than $30,000 in fake campaign contributions, including some attributed to Santos's uncle and to people who didn't exist. These donations were strategically routed to other campaigns that were clients of Redstone, ensuring Santos earned a financial kickback while boosting his political visibility.",
      "In July 2020, he used another victim's credit card to contribute $28,400 to his own campaign, some under the name of a personal friend who neither donated nor gave consent, according to the filing.",
      "In April 2022, prosecutors say Santos falsely reported a $500,000 personal loan to his campaign, enabling him to boast an $800,000 Q1 fundraising haul. He approved a press release promoting the lie and pitched the narrative in conversations with Republican leaders, including a sitting congresswoman. According to the prosecution, the loan never existed.",
      "That lie, combined with his doctored FEC filings and a fabricated resume claiming degrees from NYU and jobs at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, helped Santos secure Young Guns status from the NRCC in June 2022. The designation brought significant support: $103,000 in advertising, $33,000 in polling, and direct contributions from joint fundraising efforts.",
      "However, by fall 2022, campaign staffers discovered the truth. When confronted about the nonexistent loan, Santos admitted it wasn't real and scrambled to fill the gap by soliciting a $450,000 loan from a donor referred to as \"Individual 1\" in the filing. Santos wired $400,000 of it to his campaign, never reported it to the FEC, and never repaid the donor. He covered the remaining $100,000 by misappropriating more funds from the same donor via Redstone.",
      "Santos was expelled from Congress in December 2023 and has pleaded guilty wire fraud and aggravated identity fraud.",
      "Defense attorneys said in their own memo Santos deserves no more than two years in prison, arguing he \"accepted full responsibility for his actions.\"",
      "\"This plea is not just an admission of guilt,\" Santos told reporters in August. \"It's an acknowledgment that I need to be held accountable like any other American that breaks the law.\"",
      "The former congressman's sentencing is on April 30.",

      "Trump unveiled the tariffs in an announcement on Wednesday.",
      "Wendy Brugh, owner of Dry Ridge Farm in Marshall, North Carolina, said President Donald Trump's tariffs announcement is like \"pouring salt in a wound that is just now beginning to heal.\"",
      "During a gathering of small business owners on Wednesday, she said tariffs will increase the costs of \"everything from fertilizer and feed to construction materials and tractors,\" hitting the farming community while it still recovers from crop losses after Hurricane Helene.",
      "\"We're personally faced with the uncertainty of how retaliatory tariffs will affect our largest expense, our animal feed,\" Brugh told ABC News' Asheville affiliate WLOS.",
      "Brugh and other small business owners are weighing in on the tariffs Trump unveiled against virtually all U.S. trading partners on Wednesday afternoon. He described the tariffs as \"kind reciprocal\" and will focus on nations he claimed were the worst offenders in trade relations with the U.S.",
      "The new measures -- which Trump described as \"historic\" -- include a minimum baseline tariff of 10% on all trading partners and further, more targeted punitive levies on certain countries, including China, the European Union and Taiwan.",
      "\"We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us,\" he said, adding, \"because we are being very kind.\"",
      "Hendrick Svendsen, the owner of a furniture store in Merriam, Kansas, told ABC News on Wednesday he has decided to close his store due to Trump's tariffs announcement.",
      "\"We just made the decision we are going to close down, we will be out in August,\" Svendsen said.",
      "He said there is no way to continue the store's operation by using American-made products, with 90% of their items made overseas.",
      "\"I don't think that furniture manufacturing is ever going to come back to the U.S. North Carolina, where it used to be made, it's like a ghost town,\" Svendsen said on ABC News Live. \"When it comes to skill and workers, I don't think we have that in the U.S.\"",
      "Furniture manufacturing jobs in the United States have declined over the past few months, with 336,900 reported in February, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Simon Bryant, a restaurant owner in San Francisco, told ABC station KGO that food costs have already been difficult to manage due to bird flu, and the tariffs could make things even more challenging.",
      "\"The reality is everyone's paying higher prices,\" Bryant said. \"We have to figure out what to do as a community.\"",
      "But, there are individuals who are optimistic about the tariffs, including Duane Paddock, the owner of a Chevrolet dealership in Buffalo, New York. He told ABC News Live that he has seen the best sales in 13 years.",
      "While he is uncertain of the exact impact of the tariffs, he said he is hopeful that Trump's announcement is the \"best thing for our country\" and that his dealership will continue to \"keep prices as low as possible and do our fair share to help the customers.\"",
      "\"Whether President Trump was a Democrat or Republican, I have to have faith in my president and that's what I choose to do,\" Paddock said.",
      "He also stressed the importance of these tariffs allowing for products to be made in the United States.",
      "\"It's a great opportunity for people to get back with manufacturing and have an opportunity to have a great middle-class life and increase their compensation over the course of time,\" Paddock said.",
      "James Evans, a manufacturer who produces car parts in the U.S., told Baltimore ABC affiliate WMAR the tariffs will be \"great for us in six months to a year probably.\"",
      "\"I think in three, four years, it should set us up and other people that are manufacturing here in America for success,\" Evans said. \"I'm fine with dealing with some headaches for the next six months to a year and hopefully things go the way I think they're gonna go and then we'll be good, but maybe not. Only time will tell.\"",
      "In South Carolina, shrimp catchers are also pleased with Trump's tariff announcement. Rocky Magwood told Charleston ABC affiliate WCIV that he will now be able to \"sell everything\" he catches. According to the Southern Shrimp Alliance, 94% of shrimp consumed in the United States is imported, with India and Ecuador supplying nearly 70%.",
      "\"This is the greatest stuff we see,\" Magwood said. \"Maybe people will want to buy our shrimp more. I can't say on the politics one way or another because I'm not into politics. That's not what feeds my family.\"",
      "But Leah Ashburn, the president and CEO of Highland Brewing in North Carolina, said moving to American production is not feasible in all industries, especially her company, which relies on aluminum to make beer cans. While there are existing aluminum manufacturers in the United States, Canada is still the fourth-largest primary aluminum provider, behind China, India and Russia, according to the Canadian government.",
      "In 2021, the United States accounted for less than 2% of global aluminum production, according to a Congressional Research Service Report.",
      "\"The U.S. simply can't pivot to making aluminum cans,\" Ashburn told WLOS. \"Mining is not done here. Aluminum is 95% brought in from other countries, and we are dependent on Canada. The effort to make aluminum here would be complex, costly and take a lot of time. It won't come soon enough.\"",
      "She also said her business cannot raise their prices because consumers have \"hit their limit on what they're going to pay for a six-pack.\"",
      "The 10% baseline tariff rate goes into effect on April 5, according to senior White House officials. The \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs go into effect April 9 at 12:01 a.m., officials said, and will affect roughly 60 countries.",

      "Sixteen state attorneys general filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Friday over its cancellation of research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).",
      "The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, argues the cancellation of the grants is \"unlawful\" and the attorneys general \"seek relief for the unreasonable and intentional delays currently plaguing the grant-application process.\"",
      "The defendants named in the suit include the NIH, almost all of the NIH's 27 institutes and centers, NIH director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the Department of Health and Human Services and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The NIH told ABC News it does not comment on pending litigation. The HHS did not immediately reply to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "\"Once again, the Trump administration is putting politics before public health and risking lives and livelihoods in the process,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James, one of plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in a statement. \"Millions of Americans depend on our nation's research institutions for treatments and cures to the diseases that devastate families every day.\"",
      "\"The decision to cut these funds is an attack on science, public health, and medical innovation -- and I won't stand for it. We are suing to restore these critical funds because the people of New York, and the entire nation, deserve better,\" the statement continued.",

      "As of late March, more than 900 grants worth millions of dollars have been terminated, an NIH official with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named, told ABC News.",
      "In previous termination letters, viewed by ABC News, they state that, \"Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans. Many such studies ignore, rather than seriously examine, biological realities. It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize these research programs.\"",

      "\u201cThe new draft agreement from the U.S. shows that the intention to create a fund or jointly invest remains,\u201d Svyrydenko said Saturday, during a trip to northern Ukraine.",
      "The delegation from Kyiv will include representatives from the Ministries of Economy, Foreign Affairs, Justice and Finance.",
      "The long-running negotiations over a mineral deal have already strained relations between Kyiv and Washington. The two sides had been preparing in February to sign a framework agreement but the plan was derailed following a contentious meeting in the Oval Office between U.S. President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "After some Ukrainian lawmakers leaked the new draft, critics slammed it as little more than an attempt to strip Kyiv of control over its own natural resources and infrastructure. According to the leaked document, the new draft includes not only rare-earth minerals but gas and oil.",

      "\u201cWhat we have now is a document that reflects the position of the U.S. Treasury legal team,\u201d said Svyrydenko. \u201cThis is not a final version, it\u2019s not a joint position.\u201d",
      "She said that Ukraine\u2019s task now is to assemble a technical team for negotiations, define its red lines and core principles, and send a delegation to Washington for technical talks as early as next week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the full parameters of this agreement can\u2019t be discussed online,\u201d Svyrydenko said. \u201cWe need to sit down with the teams and continue the conversation in person.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis marks a new stage in relations with the United States \u2014 one that requires expertise across multiple areas,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately, everything will be decided through the course of negotiations.\u201d",
      "Svyrydenko declined to elaborate publicly on Ukraine\u2019s official evaluation of the new draft, but noted that there is now a more detailed document outlining the fund\u2019s creation. And while the initial draft focused primarily on the intention to establish the fund, Svyrydenko said the latest version lays out how American advisers envision its structure and operation.",
      "It remains unclear what role Ukraine would play in managing the fund under the newly proposed U.S. draft. However, analysts who reviewed the leaked document said Kyiv\u2019s involvement would likely be minimal \u2014 a point Ukraine hopes to challenge in upcoming negotiations, using the previously agreed framework as its reference.",
      "A previous version of the framework agreement, obtained by The Associated Press, outlined plans for a jointly owned and managed investment fund between the United States and Ukraine, intended to support the reconstruction of Ukraine\u2019s war-torn economy.",
      "Under the terms, Ukraine would allocate 50% of future revenues generated from key national assets \u2014 including minerals, hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas, and other extractable resources \u2014 to the fund.",
      "The framework agreement, which was never signed, stated that revenues from its natural resources would go into the fund and be used for the reconstruction of the country, not that ownership or control of those resources would be transferred to the United States.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very focused on ensuring that the final draft of the agreement, after negotiations, fully aligns with our strategic interests,\u201d Svyrydenko said. \u201cI believe the work on the previous memorandum showed that both teams are capable of reaching these goals and agreeing on terms acceptable to both sides.\u201d",

The number of tornado warnings eclipsed those issued during last month\u2019s deadly outbreak in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri and other states.",
      "Not all tornado warnings involve an actual tornado, and it was too early to know how many were actually produced by the current outbreak.",

      "Hundreds of flights have been canceled and more than 6,400 flights delayed, according to FlightAware.com, which reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of U.S. flights early Sunday. The flooding also led to road closures in Kentucky and southern Illinois, among other places.",

      "A recent immigration enforcement action that resulted in the arrests of employees and owners at a Texas bakery has shocked residents of the town of Los Fresnos",
      "LOS FRESNOS, Texas -- Leonardo Baez and Nora Avila-Guel's bakery in the Texas community of Los Fresnos is a daily stop for many residents to share gossip over coffee and pick up cakes and pastries for birthdays, office parties or themselves.",
      "When Homeland Security Investigations agents showed up at Abby\u2019s Bakery in February and arrested the owners and eight employees, residents of Los Fresnos were shocked. Abby's Bakery doesn't employ violent criminals and Baez and Avila-Guel are not the people who border czar Tom Homan calls the \u201cworst of the worst\u201d and says are the priority for mass deportations.",
      "\u201cI was surprised because I know that they\u2019re not taking advantage of the people,\u201d Esteban Rodriguez, 43, said after pulling into the bakery\u2019s parking lot to discover it was closed. \u201cIt was more like helping out people. They didn\u2019t have nowhere to go, instead of them being on the streets.\u201d",
      "The reaction in the town of 8,500 residents may show the limits of support for President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown in a majority Hispanic region dotted with fields of cotton, sugarcane and red grapefruit where Republicans made gains in last year's elections. Cameron County voted for a GOP president for the first time since 2004. For neighboring Starr County, it was the first time since 1896.",
      "Now, Baez and Avila-Guel, a Mexican couple who are legal U.S. permanent residents, could lose everything after being accused of concealing and harboring immigrants who were in the U.S. illegally. It's a rare case in which business owners face criminal charges rather than just a fine.",
      "Los Fresnos, which is 90% Latino and counts the school district as its largest employer, is about a half-hour drive from the U.S.-Mexico border. Hundreds of school bus drivers, painters, retirees and parishioners from the nearby Catholic church come into Abby\u2019s Bakery each day. Customers with silver trays and tongs select pastries from glass-door cabinets.",
      "Six of Abby's eight employees were in the U.S. on visitor visas but none had work permits when Homeland Security Investigations agents came to the business Feb. 12. The owners acknowledged they knew that, according to a federal complaint.",
      "Employees lived in a room with six beds and shared two bathrooms in the same building as the bakery, according to an agent's affidavit.",
      "Baez, 55, and Avila-Guel, 46, have pleaded not guilty. They referred questions to their attorneys, who noted the workers were not held against their will and there was no attempt to hide their presence, as a smuggler would.",
      "As green card holders, the couple could be deported if they are convicted. They have five children who are U.S. citizens.",
      "The bakery closed for several days after their arrest, drawing about 20 people to protest on an uncharacteristically chilly evening.",
      "Monsignor Pedro Brisen\u0303o of St. Cecilia Church often visited before early morning Mass for the campechana, a flaky, crunchy pastry dough layered with caramelized sugar. His routine was interrupted when plainclothes immigration agents arrived in unmarked vehicles.",
      "\u201cA woman came here crying. She said, \u2018Father, Father, they\u2019re taking my brother,\u2019\u201d Brisen\u0303o said. The priest walked over and saw agents use zip ties to bind employees' hands.",
      "There is overwhelming bipartisan support to deport people who are in the U.S. illegally and have been convicted of a violent crime, with 82% in favor, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll in January. Support softens considerably for deportations of all people in the country illegally, with 43% in favor and 37% opposed.",
      "Trump and top aides repeatedly emphasize they are deporting criminals. But, as Homan often says, others in the country illegally who are there when officers arrest criminals also will be deported, a departure from the Biden administration's practices.",
      "So far, Trump has avoided the large-scale factory and office raids that characterized his first term and that of Republican President George W. Bush. Scattered reports of smaller operations included the recent arrests of 37 people at a roofing business in northern Washington state.",
      "ICE says it made 32,809 arrests in Trump's first 50 days in office, or a daily average of 656, which compared with a daily average of 311 during a 12-month period ending Sept. 30. ICE said nearly half (14,111) were convicted criminals and nearly one-third (9,980) had pending criminal charges but did not specify the charges.",
      "People with deep ties in their communities and no criminal records tend to generate more sympathy.",
      "Abby's reopened after the owners were released on bond.",
      "Chela and Alicia Vega, two sisters in their 60s who retired from the school district and have known the bakery owners for years, were among the customers filling trays with pastries. Chela Vega said the couple once took a week off from work to drive them to San Luis Potosi in Mexico after their sister died. When a hurricane struck, Leonardo Baez cut down their damaged trees without charge.",
      "For Terri Sponsler, 61, shopping at Abby\u2019s is now a political statement. \u201cWith everything going on right now in our country, we need to find ways to protest,\u201d she said.",
      "Mark W. Milum, the Los Fresnos city manager, said Abby\u2019s is an important business that contributes property and sales tax revenue to the $13 million annual municipal budget.",
      "Some customers just love the products.",
      "\u201cOther bakeries, they pop up, right?\" said Ruth Zamora, 65. \"But when you go there, it\u2019s not the same.\"",

      "Sending children back to school in new sneakers, jeans and T-shirts is likely to cost U.S. families significantly more this fall",
      "NEW YORK -- Sending children back to school in new sneakers, jeans and T-shirts is likely to cost U.S. families significantly more this fall if the bespoke tariffs President Donald Trump put on leading exporters take effect as planned, American industry groups warn.",
      "About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the U.S. are imported, predominantly from Asia, the American Apparel & Footwear Association said, citing its most recent data. Walmart, Gap Inc., Lululemon and Nike are a few of the companies that have a majority of their clothing made in Asian countries.",
      "Those same garment-making hubs took a big hit under the president's plan to punish individual countries for trade imbalances. For all Chinese goods, that meant tariffs of at least 54%. He set the import tax rates for Vietnam and neighboring Cambodia at 46% and 49%, and products from Bangladesh and Indonesia at 37% and 32%.",
      "Working with foreign factories has kept labor costs down for U.S. companies in the fashion trade, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb new costs that high. India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka also got slapped with high tariffs so aren't immediate sourcing alternatives.",
      "\u201cIf these tariffs are allowed to persist, ultimately it\u2019s going to make its way to the consumer,\u201d said Steve Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association.",
      "Another trade group, Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, provided estimates of the price increases that could be in store for shoes, noting 99% of the pairs sold in the U.S. are imports. Work boots made in China that now retail for $77 would go up to $115, while customers would pay $220 for running shoes made in Vietnam currently priced at $155, the group said.",
      "FDRA President Matt Priest predicted lower-income families and the places they shop would feel the impact most. He said a pair of Chinese-made children\u2019s shoes that cost $26 today will likely carry a $41 price tag by the back-to-school shopping season, according to his group\u2019s calculations.",
      "The tariffs on the top producers of not only finished fashion but many of the materials used to make footwear and apparel shocked U.S. retailers and brands. Before Trump's first term, U.S. companies had started to diversify away from China in response to trade tensions as well as human rights and environmental concerns.",
      "They accelerated the pace when he ordered tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018, shifting more production to other countries in Asia. Lululemon said in its latest annual filing that 40% of its sportswear last year was manufactured in Vietnam, 17% in Cambodia, 11% in Sri Lanka, 11% in Indonesia and 7% in Bangladesh.",
      "Nike, Levi-Strauss, Ralph Lauren, Gap. Inc., Abercrombie & Fitch and VF Corporation, which owns Vans, The North Face and Timberland, also reported a greatly reduced reliance on garment-makers and suppliers in China.",
      "Shoe brand Steve Madden said in November it would reduce imports from China by as much as 45% this year due to Trump's campaign pledge to impose a 60% tariff on all Chinese products. The brand said it already had spent several years developing a factory network in Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico and Brazil.",
      "Industry experts say reviving the American garment industry would be hugely expensive and take years if it were feasible. The number of people working in apparel manufacturing in January 2015 stood at 139,000 and had dwindled to 85,000 by January of this year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sri Lanka employs four times as many despite having a population less than one-seventh the size of the U.S.",
      "Along with lacking a skilled and willing workforce, the U.S. does not have domestic sources for the more than 70 materials that go into making a typical shoe, the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America said in written comments to Trump's trade representative.",
      "Shoe companies would need to find or set up factories to make cotton laces, eyelets, textile uppers and other components to make finished footwear in the U.S. on a large scale, the group wrote.",
      "\u201cThese materials simply do not exist here, and many of these materials have never existed in the U.S,\u201d the organization said.",
      "The expected barrage of apparel price increases would follow three decades of stability. Clothes cost U.S. consumers essentially the same in 2024 as they did in 1994, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.",
      "Economists and industry analysts have attributed the trend to free trade agreements, offshoring to foreign countries where workers are paid much less and heated competition for shoppers among discount retailers and fast-fashion brands like H&M, Zara and Forever 21.",
      "But customers unaccustomed to inflation in the apparel sector and coming off several years of steep rise in the costs of groceries and housing may be extra sensitive to any big jumps in clothing prices. Priest, of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, said he has observed shoppers pulling back on buying shoes since Trump's return to the White House.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re nervous,\u201d he said. \"They\u2019ve obviously been playing the long game as it relates to inflation for a number of years now. And they just don\u2019t have the endurance to absorb higher prices, particularly as they\u2019re inflicted by the U.S. government.\u201d",
      "According to a report by British bank Barclays published Friday, the winners in the tariff wars are retailers that have at least one of these attributes: big negotiating power with their suppliers, a strong brand name and limited sourcing in Asia.",
      "In clothing and footwear, that includes off-price retailers Burlington, Ross Stores Inc. and TJX Companies, which operates T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, as well as Ralph Lauren and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, according to the report.",
      "The companies in for a tougher time are those with limited negotiating power, limited pricing power and high product exposure in Asia, a list including Gap Inc., Urban Outfitters and American Eagle Outfitters, according to the report.",
      "Secondhand clothing resale site ThredUp cheered a related action Trump took with his latest round of tariffs: eliminating a widely used tax exemption that has allowed millions of low-cost goods \u2014 most of them originating in China \u2014 to enter the U.S. every day duty-free.",
      "\u201cThis policy change will increase the cost of cheaply produced, disposable clothing imported from China, directly impacting the business model that fuels overproduction and environmental degradation,\u201d ThredUp said.",
      "Several industry analysts and economists said they think tariffs will end up being a consumer sales tax that widens the yawning gap between America's wealthiest residents and those in the middle and lower end of the income spectrum.",
      "\u201cSo where will the U.S. be buying its apparel now that the tariff rates on Bangladesh, Vietnam and China are astronomical?\u201d Mary E. Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said of the schedule set to take effect Wednesday. \u201cWill the new \u2018Golden Age\u2019 involve knitting our own knickers as well as snapping together our cellphones?\u201d",

      "About 45 years have passed since a state last eliminated its income tax on wages and salaries",
      "About 45 years have passed since a U.S. state last eliminated its income tax on wages and salaries. But with recent actions in Mississippi and Kentucky, two states now are on a path to do so, if their economies keep growing.",
      "The push to zero out the income tax is perhaps the most aggressive example of a tax-cutting trend that swept across states as they rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic with surging revenues and historic surpluses.",
      "But it comes during a time of greater uncertainty for states, as they wait to see whether President Donald Trump's cost cutting and tariffs lead to a reduction in federal funding for states and a downturn in the overall economy.",
      "Some fiscal analysts also warn the repeal of income taxes could leave states reliant on other levies, such as sales taxes, that disproportionately affect the poor.",
      "The 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to levy income taxes. It was ratified by states in 1913. Since then, most states have adopted their own income taxes.",
      "Eight states currently charge no personal income tax: Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming. A ninth state, Washington, charges no personal income tax on wages and salaries but does tax certain capital gains income over $270,000.",
      "When Alaska repealed its personal income tax in 1980, it did so because state coffers were overflowing with billions of dollars in oil money.",
      "Though income tax eliminations have been proposed elsewhere, they have not been successful.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to go without an individual income tax if you\u2019ve never levied one,\" said Katherine Loughead, a senior analyst and research manager at the nonprofit Tax Foundation. \"But once you become dependent on that revenue, it is a lot more difficult to phase out or eliminate that tax.\u201d",
      "Republican Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves recently signed a law gradually reducing the state's income tax rate from 4% to 3% by 2030 and setting state revenue growth benchmarks that could trigger additional incremental cuts until the tax is eliminated. The law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and raises the gasoline tax.",
      "If cash reserves are fully funded and revenue triggers are met each year, Mississippi's income tax could be gone by 2040.",
      "Supporters of an income tax repeal hope it will attract both businesses and residents, elevating the state\u2019s economy to the likes of Florida, Tennessee and Texas. Their theory is that when people pay less in income taxes, they will have more money to spend, thus boosting sales tax collections.",
      "The tax repeal \u201cputs us in a rare class of elite, competitive states,\u201d Reeves said in a statement. He added, \u201cMississippi has the potential to be a magnet for opportunity, for investment, for talent \u2013- and for families looking to build a better life.\u201d",
      "Mississippi is among the most impoverished states and relies heavily on federal funding. Democratic lawmakers warned the state could face a financial crises if cuts in federal funding come at the same time as state income tax reductions.",
      "The income tax provides \u201ca huge percentage of what the state brings in to fund things like schools and health care and services that everybody relies on,\u201d said Neva Butkus, senior analyst at the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.",
      "A 2022 Kentucky law reduced the state's income tax rate and set a series of revenue-based triggers that could gradually lower the tax to zero. But unlike in Mississippi, the triggers aren't automatic. Rather, the Kentucky General Assembly must approve each additional decrease in the tax rate.",
      "That has led to a series of tax-cutting measures, including two new laws this year. One implements the next tax rate reduction from 4% to 3.5% starting in 2026. The second makes it easier to continue cutting the tax rate in the future by allowing smaller incremental reductions if revenue growth isn't sufficient to trigger a 0.5 percentage point reduction.",
      "Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed the legislation for next year's tax cut but let the other measure passed by the Republican-led legislature become law without his signature. Beshear called it a \u201cbait-and-switch\u201d bill, contending lawmakers had assured the guardrails for income tax reductions would remain in place while pushing for the 2026 tax cut, then later in the session altered the triggers for future years.",
      "New Hampshire and Tennessee already did not tax income from wages and salaries, but both states had taxed certain types of income.",
      "In 2021, Tennessee ended an income tax on interest from bonds and stock dividends that had been levied since 1929.",
      "New Hampshire halted its tax on interest and dividends at the start of this year.",
      "Some other states also are pushing to repeal income taxes The Oklahoma House passed legislation in March that would gradually cut the personal income tax rate to zero if revenue growth benchmarks are met. That bill now is in the Senate.",
      "New Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, also wants to phase out the income tax. The House and Senate have advanced legislation that would take an incremental step by exempting capital gains income from taxes.",

      "\u201cThis year, we\u2019re going to have less trail work done on the trails, so just know that going into your hike, safety is the most important thing,\u201d Kipperman told a group of backpackers from Europe and the United States at the trailhead near Campo, California, an hour\u2019s drive east of San Diego.",
      "He cautioned there is \u201cno trail\u201d at all in parts of the 2,650-mile (4,265 kilometers) path through California, Oregon and Washington state.",
      "The cutbacks are not just on the West Coast. Ahead of the busy summer hiking season, funding freezes and mass layoffs also are disrupting repairs on the East Coast's Appalachian Trail after nearly 500 miles (800 kilometers) were damaged by Hurricane Helene, underscoring how President Donald Trump\u2019s dramatic downsizing of the U.S. government is touching even the nation\u2019s remote backcountry where vacationers, wanderers and escapists alike retreat to leave modern life behind.",
      "Wildfires and more intense storms due in part to climate change have been taking a toll on the legendary trails. The federal cuts threaten their very existence, according to the Pacific Crest Trail Association and the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, which oversee their preservation in partnership with the government and receive millions in federal dollars.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service called the situation \u201cdynamic and evolving\u201d in an email to The Associated Press, but said they are committed to ensuring public safety and access to recreation areas that are vital to local economies.",
      "The Trump administration has let go some 3,400 workers at the U.S. Forest Service, and nearly 1,500 at the National Park Service, including trail repair specialists. The associations said the cuts also led to the rescinding of job offers for seasonal crews with technical skills to rebuild boardwalks, bridges and campsites and train thousands of volunteers.",
      "Courts have ordered federal agencies to rehire thousands of workers, but some say they are not coming back.",
      "\u201cFor hikers, they\u2019re going to be crawling, navigating, working their way through downed trees across the trail that won\u2019t get cut out,\u201d said Justin Kooyman, director of the Pacific Crest Trail operations. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make for a little more rough and tumble.\u201d",
      "While the trails are not in total disarray and many hikers may not see any damaged areas, maintenance is critical to their existence, the associations say. More than 20 miles (32 kilometers) of the Appalachian Trail remain closed following Helene and downed trees could fuel wildfires.",
      "Last month, the Appalachian Trail turned 100 years old. The footpath stretches 2,193 miles (3,530 kilometers) between Georgia\u2019s Springer Mountain and Maine\u2019s Mount Katahdin.",
      "Its founder, the late forest scientist Benton MacKaye, saw a need for a place to escape stress following the end of World War I and the 1918 flu epidemic.",
      "The Appalachian Trail and Pacific Crest Trail officially became the country\u2019s first National Scenic Trails under the 1968 National Trails System Act. Completing them has come to symbolize the strength of the human spirit, inspiring books and movies. Only a fraction are thru-hikers, a term for those who walk the trails from end to end. Many don\u2019t succeed and several people have died trying. Most users hike for a day or two to enjoy the breathtaking beauty.",
      "\u201cI am so concerned with what seems to be a general lack of appreciation for what these protected outdoor spaces can bring to not just our physical well-being but to our souls,\u201d said Sandi Marra, head of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. \u201cIf we lose these things, we are really going to be lost as a species, and definitely as a country.\u201d",
      "The Pacific Crest Trail Association said it is operating with a third less federal grant money than anticipated. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy said at least $1.5 million is at risk from federal downsizing.",
      "The National Park Service said its funding has continued for the Appalachian Trail as it works to \u201caddress challenges collaboratively and seek solutions\u201d to support the footpath's \u201cenduring legacy.\"",
      "Both trails already had a backlog of projects. Wildfires have scorched nearly 250 miles (400 kilometers) of the Pacific Crest Trail in recent years.",
      "The disruption exacerbates the deteriorating conditions and the spread of invasive plant species, which will ultimately increase costs, said Megan Wargo, head of the Pacific Crest Trail Association.",
      "The Pacific Crest Trail crosses searing desert and traverses forests of giant sequoias, the world\u2019s largest trees, before climbing by snow-covered peaks in the rugged Sierra Nevada. After snaking over 50 mountain passes, it ends in Washington\u2019s remote Pasayten Wilderness at the Canadian border.",
      "As the trail's popularity grew through social media and the bestselling memoir \u201cWild\u201d that inspired a Hollywood film, drawing less experienced backpackers, the association hired what they call \u201ccrest runners.\"",
      "Kipperman is one of two at the southern end. Their duties include greeting hikers at the Mexican border, checking their permits and providing safety tips before they set off. The crest runners normally work from March until August, covering the hottest, riskiest months for that section.",
      "Last year, a crest runner also worked the northern end at the Canadian border. But this year they only will be at the southern end until mid-May unless more federal funds are unfrozen.",
      "Kipperman, whose trail name is \u201cPure Stoke,\" is infectiously cheery as he rattles off the dangers from rattlesnakes to dehydration and distributes bags for discarded toilet paper. He steers clear of discussing politics and instead talks about protecting water quality, burying human waste, packing out trash and building safe campfires.",
      "\u201cRemove the ego. Address the situation. See if going forward is really the right thing for you,\u201d Kipperman said, warning hikers to beware that Mile 225 or so is washed out.",
      "After hearing Kipperman\u2019s spiel, backpacker Joshua Suran said he planned to try helping restore the trail where possible.",
      "Marias Michel of Germany trudged over, concerned about the weight of his backpack draped with gear, water bottles and a pair of Crocs. After quitting his job, he said he needed to do the trail, calling it \u201ca resetting, a big detox.\u201d",
      "He was aware of the federal cuts but said he couldn\u2019t worry about that.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just going to be learning by doing because I don\u2019t want to be too much up here,\u201d Michel said, pointing to his head. \u201cI want to test myself. No expectations. It\u2019s an attempt until you make it.\"",

      "Booker took questions at suburban New Jersey's Bergen Community College the same day as more than 1,200 \u201cHands Off!\u201d demonstrations were planned around the country. The town hall event was punctuated both by celebratory shouts of \u201cCory, Cory\u201d as well as at least a half-dozen interruptions by protesters.",
      "It was Booker's first in-person event in his home state since his speech this week, where he held the Senate floor for 25 hours and 5 minutes in opposition to Trump's policies. In doing so, he broke the record for the longest floor speech, which was set by segregationist Sen. Strom Thurmond in opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1957.",
      "Questioner after questioner asked what they could be doing to show their disagreement and worry over the president's policies. Booker told them it only takes a little bit more \u2014 could they afford a trip to Washington to lobby against budget cuts? One of the loudest moments of applause came after he addressed a woman who said she worried about what potential Medicaid cuts could mean for her son with autism.",

      "The questions and Booker's response mirror what voters and other Democrats have been hearing during town halls. He said he didn't want to focus on the Democratic Party, which has struggled to find a message since losing the 2024 election. Instead, he said, he would focus on \u201cthe people of our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the Democratic Party lost a lot of elections because people didn\u2019t believe that they cared about them. So let\u2019s stop worrying about the politics and get more focused on the people,\u201d Booker said.",

I\u2019m trying to figure out where do I stand right now in terms of what I actually can do and what will make the most impact,\u201d she said. \u201cSo part of me does understand that answer because I assume that probably politicians are in the same boat.\u201d",
      "After the event, Booker said he was reluctant to tell people the exact tactics to use, citing civil rights activists like the late John Lewis. He said creativity has a role to play.",
      "\u201cI know one thing it\u2019s not is sitting down and doing nothing and just watching on TV and getting stuck in a state of sedentary agitation,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody has to be taking measures to put the pressure on to change.\u201d",

      "Booker, 55, is in his second full term in the Senate. He chairs the Strategic Communications Committee, his party's messaging arm. His team is focused on boosting Senate Democrats\u2019 presence across social platforms through more frequent and casual content.",
      "Booker himself has amassed one of the largest followings on social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok and X, where his commentary appears to connect with the party's base. But staffers are now focused on how to transfer that success to Booker\u2019s fellow senators, who are often less digitally fluent and face different political landscapes in their home states.",

      "Booker hopes to double the engagement senators receive with their content directly online and increase the caucus\u2019 appearances with online digital media personalities.",
      "The start of Saturday's event included six disruptions, including by several people who decried the treatment of Palestinians. Police in the gymnasium escorted them from the arena.",

      "Maryland lawmakers have passed a measure to try to limit future liabilities from claims of sexual abuse at state and private institutions",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland lawmakers passed a measure Saturday to try to limit future liabilities from claims of sexual abuse at state and private institutions after thousands of people unexpectedly came forward with allegations of abuse, many of them in youth detention centers, putting potentially billions of dollars at stake for the state.",
      "The wave of cases targeting the state's juvenile justice system resulted after Maryland eliminated the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse claims two years ago with the Catholic Church abuse scandal in mind.",
      "The measure, which now goes to Gov. Wes Moore, reduces caps on settlements from $890,000 to $400,000 for cases filed after May 31 for state institutions and from $1.5 million to $700,000 for private institutions. It also changes the 2023 law to only allow each claimant to receive one payment, instead of being able to collect for each incident of abuse.",
      "In California on Friday, Los Angeles County officials announced they had reached a $4 billion agreement to settle nearly 7,000 claims of sexual abuse in juvenile facilities since 1959.",
      "Other private and public entities have been rocked by allegations of wide-ranging abuse and subsequent settlements.",
      "The agreement in California, which still needs a county board's approval, far surpasses a $2.6 billion settlement reached in 2022 with Boy Scouts of America, which recently renamed itself Scouting America. That settlement involved more than 80,000 men who said they were molested as children by scouting leaders and others.",
      "Maryland state Sen. Will Smith, who chairs the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, said it has been estimated that Maryland is facing a potential liability between $3 billion and $4 billion.",
      "Smith, a Democrat, noted that lawmakers approved the 2023 Child Victims Act in response \u201cto a long fight to have justice for victims of child sex abuse, where our prior framework barred some of those claims if you were above the age of 38.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut what we could never have anticipated was just the sheer volume of cases that ensued,\u201d Smith said.",
      "During debate Saturday, lawmakers said about 1,500 cases already have been filed. In addition, another 4,500 cases are known about, lawmakers said, and attorneys for plaintiffs have been in settlement discussions with Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown's office.",
      "Sen. Justin Ready, a Republican who is the Senate minority whip, said the state liability could potentially be even higher than the estimate cited by Smith.",
      "\u201cWe just spent all session wrestling with a $3 billion deficit, which is a huge deficit, and we\u2019ve been fighting about that and debating it discussing it \u2026 Just one settlement from this very well could end up being that entire amount, and that is not the end of this,\" Ready said.",
      "Sen. Chris West said he doubted the provision in the bill that would limit someone to only sue for one individual case, rather than for each incident of abuse, would survive a court challenge, based on prior rulings by the Maryland Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cIf the Supreme Court follows the guidance of prior Supreme Court decisions, they will hold that our attempt to deny people the right to file cases to recover for multiple occurrences is unconstitutional, because those rights for the past two years have been vested,\" West, a Republican, said. \"The people have had the right to file those cases.\u201d",
      "Smith told reporters on Friday that he believed a settlement \u201cis the optimal solution here.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that the attorney general and the plaintiffs can get together and work out a settlement,\" Smith said.",
      "Maryland lawmakers passed the Child Victims Act in the immediate aftermath of a scathing investigative report by the attorney general's office that revealed widespread abuse within the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Before its passage, victims couldn\u2019t sue after they turned 38. The law change prompted the archdiocese to file for bankruptcy to protect its assets.",
      "The Maryland Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law in a 4-3 ruling in February.",
      "The measure approved Saturday also would cap attorneys\u2019 fees at 20% for cases that settle out of court and 25% for cases resolved in court.",
      "The Senate voted 36-7 for the bill on Saturday, and the House voted 92-40 for the bill a short time later, sending the bill to the governor.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The political battle lines are drawn for a debate in Washington and beyond over a Republican budget plan that's a cornerstone of President Donald Trump's domestic agenda.",
      "With the plan's approval by the GOP-controlled Senate in a vote that ended early Saturday, Republicans hope to leverage their position of power in Washington to enact as much as $7 trillion in tax breaks, boost border security for mass deportations and cut government funding \u2014 and do so \u201cwithout one single Democratic vote,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the Senate Budget Committee chairman.",
      "Democrats, as the minority party, were unable to halt the budget plan. But during the late-night session, they offered a preview of the political attacks likely coming not just during the lead-up to the final vote this summer, but through the 2026 campaign.",
      "\u201cWe may not have the votes to stop them all by ourselves,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told The Associated Press, \u201cbut we can use what the Republicans are trying to do with this tax bill to ignite a fire all across this country.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at what happened and what comes next:",
      "Trump's tariffs hung over the budget debate, interjecting economic uncertainty in ways unimaginable just days before senators prepared to vote.",
      "Seizing on the moment, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York put forward an amendment to showcase that unease: He called for an end to those recently announced import taxes, which could result in higher prices for household goods, while keeping tariffs on China, Russia, Iran and other U.S. adversaries.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s tariff tax is one of the dumbest things he\u2019s ever done as president, and that\u2019s saying something,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "He repeatedly pointed out that remote islands, including one inhabited by penguins, were hit with tariffs, but not President Vladimir Putin's Russia.",
      "\u201cPenguins not Putin,\" Schumer said.",
      "The amendment failed. The slogan lives on.",
      "Democrats say Republicans pose grave threats to the nation's safety net programs as they hunt for cost-savings to help offset the lost revenues from the tax breaks, and as Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency slashes through the federal government.",
      "Among the more than two dozen amendments offered during the debate were several to protect Medicaid, Social Security, food stamps, Head Start child care, Meals on Wheels for older adults, and others. Several Republicans joined Democrats in voting to preserve those programs, including Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, opposed the entire package in a warning against steep Medicaid cuts.",
      "Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., who offered an amendment to save Social Security's phone service, said Musk and DOGE are \u201crevving up their chainsaw\u201d to come after it.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018Get online, Grandma,\u2019\u201d Markey said, scoffing at the notion of older people not being able to pick up the telephone.",
      "Central to the Republican budget \u2014 and Trump's domestic policy agenda \u2014 is the effort to preserve the tax breaks approved in 2017 during his first term.",
      "While many of the income tax breaks are popular, including the child tax credit or bolstered standard deduction, Democrats argue that much of the benefit flows to the well-off.",
      "Democrats piled on a series of amendments trying to prohibit tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy, only to be denied by Republicans.",
      "It\u2019s a standoff that\u2019s expected to carry on through the debate, and the campaign season ahead.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-La., shifted the conversation to what Republicans see for them as a more politically favorable direction, focused on federal spending.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot about, you know, massive tax cuts for billionaires,\u201d he said as the evening dragged on. \u201cBut the one thing you don\u2019t hear a lot about is the run up in federal spending.\"",
      "The nation's debt load, now $36 trillion, continues to climb.",
      "At least one Republican deficit hawk, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, said no more.",
      "\u201cWhat is it: Are we cutting spending or are we adding to the debt?\u201d Paul said during debate, before ultimately voting against the bill.",
      "He argued the budget plan would add $5 trillion to the debt over 10 years, echoing an assessment from the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "\u201cYou scratch your head and say, what\u2019s up here?\u201d",
      "But for Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., the impact of the tariffs was a factor in his decision to vote for the budget resolution, despite his concerns that the tax breaks would add to the federal deficit.",
      "Cassidy said he did not want to cast a vote that could \u201cincrease uncertainty in the economy.\u201d",

      "Georgia's state Senate leadership caught their House counterparts by surprise when the Senate adjourned earlier than expected on Friday",
      "ATLANTA -- Here\u2019s how a Georgia legislative session is supposed to end:",
      "After a last-minute rush of negotiations, lawmakers jam through final agreements on a few more bills as the clock ticks past midnight.",
      "Legislative staffers crowd into chambers as leaders thank employees against a soundtrack of paper being ripped into pieces.",
      "Finally, the presiding officer recognizes the climactic motion to adjourn \u201csine die,\u201d a Latin phrase that means to leave without a day to return.",
      "Then everyone tosses shredded paper into the air and cheers.",
      "Friday, though, Georgia\u2019s state Senate just left.",
      "The motion to adjourn by Republican Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch of Dahlonega came shortly after 9 p.m. with none of the usual buildup. There was no thanks to the staff. Senators hadn\u2019t even torn up much paper.",
      "Georgia lawmakers can pick up bills in 2026 where they left off Friday, the second year of a two-year session, but they left plenty on the table.",
      "Among items that didn\u2019t pass were proposals to force Georgia to leave a multistate election group, a push by Jones to establish more legislative control over rules enacted by state agencies, an effort to ban diversity programs in public schools and colleges and a bill to let people sue local governments for not cooperating with federal immigration officials.",
      "The sudden departure came after it became increasingly clear some Senate measures were languishing in the House and that Senate leaders had lost their appetite to bargain. It was possible to leave early because lawmakers had already agreed on a budget and other highest-priority legislation including tax cuts, a school safety bill, new limits on lawsuits and banning transgender girls and women from participating in women\u2019s sports.",
      "The collision was reminiscent of the 2023 legislative session, the first year Burns and Jones led their chambers. Many big issues didn\u2019t pass after the chambers got into a standoff over the budget and licensing rules for hospitals. Then, it appeared Jones was trying to force his will on the House, a reversal of the traditional dynamic in Georgia, where the House has often had its way.",
      "Ultimately, many issues derailed in 2023 ended up passing in 2024, including loosening hospital permitting requirements, imposing basic protections for renters and creating a voucher program to pay for private school and home-schooling.",
      "As senators cheered their departure Friday, veteran state Rep. Alan Powell was at the microphone in the House proposing changes to a hotly debated bill to regulate automated speed detection cameras in school zones.",
      "Suddenly, there was no reason for the Hartwell Republican to continue, as there were no senators left to agree to amendments.",
      "Republican House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington and his staff exchanged bewildered glances as House lawmakers murmured.",
      "\u201cIt appears that the Senate has checked all their priorities, all their political priorities, and decided to end their night early instead of finishing their work on behalf of the people we represent,\u201d Burns told the House. \u201cOf course, they\u2019re free to do as they please, but this chamber puts policy over politics.\"",
      "Many longtime lawmakers were baffled. House Rules Committee Chairman Butch Parrish, a Swainsboro Republican who has served since the 1980s, said senators \u201cbroke new ground.\u201d",
      "Representatives approved a few more bills that didn't need further Senate action, and then also went home early.",
      "Jones downplayed any conflict.",
      "\u201cWhat do you mean what happened?\u201d Jones said afterward. \u201cWe ended session.\u201d",
      "Jones said senators had achieved their goals and he had been bucking for an early adjournment all day.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of things done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so there was no need to stay here until midnight.\u201d",
      "Some minority Democrats were ecstatic because bills they opposed didn't become law. \u201cVictory!\u201d shouted Atlanta Democrat Shea Roberts as she left the Capitol.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that a lot of this session was spent on political messaging bills and on politics instead of focusing on Georgian families,\u201d said state Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat considering a run for governor in 2026.",
      "Both Jones and Burns said there are no hard feelings over how things ended Friday, although Burns said he would have liked to clinch an agreement on school zone speed cameras.",
      "House Majority Whip James Burchett, a Valdosta Republican, said that while House members may have held off on passing Senate proposals to \u201cfully vet\u201d them, the chambers have no choice but to work together.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has invoked a rarely used 1798 law that gives a president immense powers to arrest and deport noncitizens in a time of war",
      "It was just a few sentences in a meandering, hourlong presidential speech on a Friday afternoon.",
      "Along with talk about falling egg prices and a vow to expel \u201ccorrupt forces\u201d from the U.S. government, President Donald Trump noted that hundreds of members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua had been arrested.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll be reading a lot of stories tomorrow about what we\u2019ve done with them,\u201d he said at the Justice Department on March 14. \u201cThese are tough people and bad people and we\u2019re getting them out of our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll be very impressed,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump was previewing drama to come that would involve clandestine flights to another continent, a notorious prison, innocents among criminals and a dramatic confrontation between his assertions of presidential power and a federal judge who Trump said had overreached.",
      "The president's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to justify deporting more than 130 Venezuelan men, some of them gang members and others who claim to have been in the United States legally and were seemingly expelled because of their ordinary tattoos, played out over a frenetic 24 hours.",
      "By the time Trump had spoken, hundreds of detained immigrants had been quietly shuttled from across the U.S. to South Texas. Planes had been chartered to take them to their ultimate destination, El Salvador, under a deal with President Nayib Bukele, who proudly calls himself \u201cworld\u2019s coolest dictator.\u201d",
      "The men were herded into a maximum security mega prison in El Salvador, where officials quickly made a show of the new inmates having their heads shaved, then standing shoulder to shoulder in cells so crowded that some prisoners do not have beds.",
      "But soon, stories began to surface that the scene was not quite as it appeared. Some of them men had long insisted they had no gang ties, and their families had produced documents showing they had no criminal records.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for a long time, and I\u2019ve seen some pretty weird stuff,\u201d said Texas attorney John Dutton, who represented a man who disappeared into the Salvadoran prison. \u201cBut to do this in the middle of the night, to send people to another country, and straight to a prison when they haven\u2019t been convicted of a crime?",
      "\u201cIt makes no sense.\u201d",
      "It made sense in the White House.",
      "Trump has been promising for years that he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act to combat illegal immigration. He repeatedly insisted, falsely, that the U.S. was facing an invasion of criminal immigrants.",
      "Tren de Aragua became the face of that threat, and the first target of that law in decades.",
      "Crafted during the presidency of John Adams, the law gives the president broad powers to imprison and deport noncitizens in times of war. It has been used just three times: during the War of 1812 and the two world wars.",
      "The Trump administration had begun edging closer to calling the criminal migrant issue a war, most notably by designating eight Latin American criminal groups, including Tren de Aragua, as \u201cforeign terrorist organizations.\u201d",
      "The administration was telegraphing its logical next move. Immigration lawyers prepared to fight back.",
      "The flights began arriving in the small South Texas city on March 12.",
      "Using jets chartered by a branch of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the ICE Air flights landed in Harlingen from Dallas, Phoenix, El Paso, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee. At least three came from Alexandria, Louisiana, a hub for that state\u2019s network of immigration detention centers.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t until Saturday, March 15, that it became clear to a retired financial executive in Ohio that something unusual was happening.",
      "Two flights, Tom Cartwright noticed, were scheduled from Harlingen to El Salvador.",
      "Deportations are fairly rare on Saturdays, as are deportation flights from Harlingen to El Salvador, said Cartwright, a flight data analyst for the advocacy group Witness at the Border, whose social media feeds are closely watched in immigration circles.",
      "\u201cAll that came together and said to me: There\u2019s something weird here.\u201d",
      "Court documents later showed that for at least the previous week, Venezuelan men in immigration detention centers in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and elsewhere were being moved by bus and plane toward ICE\u2019s El Valle Detention Facility, a 40-minute drive from the Harlingen airport.",
      "One of those men was a makeup artist who said he fled Venezuela last summer after his boss at a state-run news channel publicly slapped him.",
      "In a country where political repression and open homophobia are both part of life, it\u2019s hard to be a gay man who does not support President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Walking and traveling by bus and taxi through Central America and Mexico, Andry Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez Romero hoped to find a new life in the U.S. He used a U.S. Customs and Border Protection phone app to arrange an appointment at a U.S. border crossing in San Diego.",
      "That\u2019s where he was asked about his tattoos, and where his trouble started.",
      "U.S. immigration authorities use a series of \u201cgang identifiers\u201d to help them spot members of Tren de Aragua. Some are obvious, such as trafficking drugs with known Tren members.",
      "Some identifiers are more surprising: Chicago Bulls jerseys, \u201chigh-end urban street wear,\u201d and tattoos of clocks, stars or crowns, according to government instructional material filed in court by the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "Tattoos were key to marking many deported men as Tren members, according to documents and lawyers.",
      "Romero, who is in his early 20s, has a crown tattooed on each wrist. One is next to the word \u201cMom.\u201d The other next to \u201cDad.\u201d The crowns, according to his lawyer, also pay homage to his hometown\u2019s Christmastime \u201cThree Kings\u201d festival, and to his work in beauty pageants, where crowns are common.",
      "Romero, who insists he has no ties to Tren, was taken into ICE custody and transferred to a California detention center.",
      "And then, around March 7, he was suddenly moved to a facility in Laredo, Texas, a three-hour bus ride from the Harlingen airport.",
      "Friday, March 14, was supposed to be quiet for Javier Maldonado.",
      "\u201cI had come in to work late, like 10 in the morning,\u201d said Maldonado, a Texas immigration lawyer based in San Antonio. \u201cI was having my coffee, and thought I was going to do admin work and catch up on emails and phone calls.\u201d",
      "He was wrong.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act was hours away from being invoked, and more than a day from being announced, but word was starting to filter out from a group of Venezuelan men held at El Valle Detention Center, near Harlingen. Around 3 a.m., roughly 100 had been roused from sleep by guards and told they were being deported. Some were told they would be flown to Mexico, some to Venezuela. Many were told nothing.",
      "Ten hours later, the men were back in their bunks. The flight had been canceled, they were told, and they would leave soon.",
      "But a few men contacted relatives or lawyers.",
      "Within hours, an informal legal network was frantically at work, from a lawyer in Brooklyn to a law school professor in Los Angeles to a University of Florida law student interning with an El Paso immigrant advocacy firm. All were working with Texas lawyers like Maldonado who would file petitions in federal court.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a small circle, relatively, of lawyers that do this sort of work,\u201d he said.",
      "Even people who cross illegally into the U.S. have rights. Some of the men the lawyers were defending have Temporary Protected Status, a legal classification that shields roughly 350,000 Venezuelans from deportation.",
      "Communication between lawyers and detainees was often chaotic. Messages sometimes were relayed through relatives in Venezuela.",
      "But guards, said one man, had made something clear.",
      "\u201cThe order from the president is to deport them all.\u201d",
      "Trump was aboard Air Force One that Friday when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act en route to his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.",
      "Tren de Aragua, his proclamation said, was attempting \u201can invasion or predatory incursion\u201d of the United States.",
      "Publicly, though, the administration said nothing.",
      "Still, word was spreading about the planned flights to El Salvador. A Texas lawyer had filmed a bus leaving the El Valle facility under police escort, apparently heading to the airport.",
      "While Trump's use of the law had not yet been announced, two legal advocacy groups, the ACLU and Democracy Forward, felt they had to file preemptively.",
      "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t take a chance that nothing was going to happen,\u201d said Lee Gelernt of the ACLU, the lead attorney.",
      "They spent hours drafting a petition on behalf of five detained Venezuelans who feared being falsely labeled members of Tren and deported. They crafted legal arguments until they felt time was running out.",
      "Finally, they filed the petition with the U.S. District Court in Washington, seeking to halt all deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "It was 2:16 a.m. Saturday.",
      "Later that day, after Judge James E. Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order in response to the ACLU lawsuit and scheduled a 5 p.m. hearing, things in Texas began to move faster.",
      "Guards gathered prisoners at the El Valle detention center, ordering them onto buses for the airport at about 3:30 p.m.",
      "The flights carried a total of 261 deportees, the White House later said, including 137 Venezuelans deported under the Alien Enemies Act, 101 under other immigration regulations, and 23 El Salvadoran members of the gang MS-13.",
      "About 4 p.m. the White House posted Trump\u2019s proclamation.",
      "Roughly an hour later Boasberg opened his hearing over Zoom.",
      "\u201cFirst, apologies for my attire,\u201d he began, dressed in a blue sweater. \u201cI went away for the weekend and brought with me neither a robe nor tie nor appropriate shirt.\u201d",
      "Things quickly grew more serious. Boasberg asked whether the government planned to deport anyone under the new proclamation \u201cin the next 24 or 48 hours.\u201d The ACLU warned that deportation planes were about to take off. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign said he was unsure of the flight details.",
      "Boasberg called a recess so Ensign could get more information. When Ensign came back empty-handed, the judge issued a new order to stop the deportations being carried out under the centuries-old law.",
      "He noted specifically that any planes in the air needed to come back.",
      "\"This is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately,\u201d he told Ensign.",
      "It was about 6:45 p.m.",
      "By then, two ICE Air planes were heading across the Gulf of Mexico and toward Central America. Neither turned around.",
      "The airliners stopped in Honduras before making the short final flight to El Salvador.",
      "Fear swept the plane when the doors opened and the prisoners realized where they were. Many knew the reputation of El Salvador\u2019s prisons.",
      "\u201cEveryone was scared,\u201d a Nicaraguan woman accidently put on a flight said in a legal declaration after returning to the U.S. \u201cSome people had to forcibly be removed from the plane.\u201d",
      "What followed was soon set to music by the El Salvadoran government, which released videos of shackled men struggling to walk as officers forced down their heads and marched them to the immense Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT prison.",
      "The next morning, Bukele, El Salvador\u2019s president, tweeted a New York Post headline saying Boasberg had ordered the planes turned around.",
      "\u201cOopsie \u2026 Too late,\u201d Bukele wrote, adding a laughing/crying emoji.",
      "The Trump administration is now urging the Supreme Court for permission to resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg soon could rule on whether there are grounds to find anyone in contempt of court for defying his court order.",
      "As for Romero, the makeup artist, he's somewhere in CECOT.",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China is retaliating in a determined and at times highly detailed manner to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariffs, led by a retaliatory 34% tax on all U.S. imports next week.",
      "The strong response shows a degree of preparation that leaves Chinese exports in a tough spot but exacts pain from U.S. exporters that could be used as leverage in any future negotiations.",
      "The Chinese tariffs, announced Friday and taking effect Thursday, match the rate of the ones Trump imposed this week on Chinese products flowing into the United States, coming on top of two rounds of 10% tariffs already declared in February and March, citing allegations of Beijing\u2019s role in the fentanyl crisis. China\u2019s latest retaliatory moves include more export controls on rare earth minerals, critical for various technologies, and a lawsuit at the World Trade Organization.",
      "Beijing also suspended imports of sorghum, poultry and bonemeal from a number of U.S. companies, and added over two dozen others to a list of trade-restricted companies while launching an anti-monopoly investigation into DuPont China Group Co., a subsidiary of the multinational chemical giant.",
      "The rapid-fire shots of tariffs and import curbs hearken back to Trump\u2019s first term in office when the U.S. and China engaged in a trade war that spanned most of his first four years in office that continued to a certain extent under his successor, Joe Biden. China responded at the time with 15% duties on coal and liquefied natural gas products, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S.",
      "Beijing also launched last month an anti-monopoly investigation into Google and added PVH, the owner of U.S. fashion brands Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, to its \u201cunreliable entity\u201d list. China also restricted the exports of five rare metals used as key components in the defense and clean energy industries among others.",
      "As the new frictions threaten to escalate into a trade war, here are some key moments in the countries\u2019 years-long trade spat:",
      "Shortly after becoming U.S. president for the first time, Trump, determined to reduce trade deficits with other countries, signs an executive order calling for tighter tariff enforcement in anti-dumping cases.",
      "During a visit to Beijing, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agree to a 100-day plan for trade talks meant to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China. The trade talks fail by July.",
      "Trump launches an investigation into alleged Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property, which the U.S. estimated was costing it up to $600 billion a year.",

      "HOPKINSVILLE, Ky. -- Another round of torrential rain and flash flooding was expected to hit Saturday in parts of the South and Midwest already heavily waterlogged by days of severe storms that in some cases spawned deadly tornadoes.",
      "Round after round of heavy rains have pounded the central U.S., leading to rapidly rising waterways and prompting a series of flash flood emergencies Friday night in Missouri, Texas and Arkansas. Meanwhile, many communities were still reeling from tornadoes that destroyed entire neighborhoods and killed at least seven people earlier this week.",
      "In Frankfort, Kentucky, floodwaters swept a 9-year-old boy away while he was walking to a school bus stop Friday morning, Gov. Andy Beshear said on social media. Officials said Gabriel Andrews' body was found about a half-mile from where he went missing.",
      "The downtown area of Hopkinsville, Kentucky \u2014 a city of 31,000 residents 72 miles (116 kilometers) northwest of Nashville \u2014 was submerged Friday. A dozen people were rescued from homes, and dozens of pets were moved away from rising water, a fire official said.",
      "Tony Kirves and some friends used sandbags and a vacuum to try to hold back rising waters that covered the basement and seeped into the ground floor of his photography business in Hopkinsville. Downtown was \u201clike a lake,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re holding ground,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to maintain and keep it out the best we can.\"",
      "Flash flood emergencies were issued Friday night in at least seven cities in Missouri, Texas and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "One was in Van Buren, Missouri, where there were at least 15 water rescues amid heavy rainfall and a rapidly rising Current River, said Justin Gibbs, weather service meteorologist. Another was in Texarkana, Texas, where the flooded streets resulted in several people having to be rescued from their vehicles, according to the city's police department.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have darn good reason for being out (like one that involves a visit to the emergency room), please stay home and off the roads!!\u201d the police department said on social media.",
      "Heavy rains were expected to continue in parts of Missouri, Texas, Arkansas, Kentucky and elsewhere Saturday and could produce dangerous flash floods. The weather service said 45 river locations in multiple states were expected to reach major flood stage, with extensive flooding of structures, roads and other critical infrastructure possible.",
      "In Christian County, Kentucky, which includes Hopkinsville, 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 centimeters) fell since Wednesday evening, the NWS said Friday afternoon. The rain caused the Little River to surge over its banks, and 4 to 8 inches (10.2 to 20.3 centimeters) more could fall by Sunday, it said.",
      "Hundreds of Kentucky roads were impassable Friday because of floodwaters, downed trees or mud and rock slides, and the number of closures were likely to increase with more rain Saturday, Beshear said.",
      "Flash flooding is particularly worrisome in rural Kentucky where water can rush off the mountains into the hollows. Less than four years ago, dozens died in flooding in the eastern part of the state.",
      "Extreme flooding across a corridor that includes Louisville, Kentucky and Memphis \u2014 which have major cargo hubs \u2014 could also lead to shipping and supply chain delays, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.",
      "Swollen rivers and tributaries also swamped some parts in Ohio on Friday, and Gov. Mike DeWine said about 70 roads were closed. The southern half of the state was expected to see moderate flooding, which has not happened in four years, he added.",
      "Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf. At least 318 tornado warnings have been issued by the NWS since this week\u2019s outbreak began Wednesday.",
      "The outburst comes at a time when nearly half of NWS forecast offices have 20% vacancy rates after Trump administration job cuts \u2014 twice that of just a decade ago.",
      "At least two reports of observed tornadoes were noted Friday evening in Missouri and Arkansas, according to the NWS.",
      "\u201cTAKE COVER NOW!\u201d the weather service said on X in response to the one on the ground around the small Missouri town of Advance.",
      "Earlier in the week, seven people were killed in the initial wave of storms that spawned powerful tornadoes on Wednesday and early Thursday in Tennessee, Missouri and Indiana.",
      "Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said entire neighborhoods in the hard-hit town of Selmer were \u201ccompletely wiped out,\u201d after it was hit by a tornado with winds estimated by the NWS of up to 160 mph (257 kph). Advance warning of storms likely saved lives as hundreds of people sheltered at a courthouse, the governor said.",
      "In neighboring Arkansas, a tornado near Blytheville lofted debris at least 25,000 feet (7.6 kilometers) high, according to weather service meteorologist Chelly Amin. The state\u2019s emergency management office reported damage in 22 counties from tornadoes, wind, hail and flash flooding.",

      "The federal government wants the number of offices that oversee U.S. mine safety laws to align more with a shrinking coal industry",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- The U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration is among the federal agencies selected for spending cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Nearly three dozen MSHA offices would have their leases terminated if the plans come to fruition.",
      "MSHA is responsible for enforcing U.S. mine safety laws. DOGE was created by President Donald Trump and is run by Elon Musk.",
      "According to the DOGE website, 34 MSHA offices in 19 states have been targeted for closure. This includes seven in Kentucky, which would leave the fifth-leading coal producing state with just two MSHA facilities.",
      "There also are four offices slated to close in Pennsylvania; two apiece in California, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Texas and West Virginia; and one each in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming.",
      "Also under consideration for closure are the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement facilities in Lexington, Kentucky, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, shrinking the national footprint of an agency created during the Carter administration to restore land damaged by strip mining and reclaim abandoned and damaged minelands.",
      "Ending the MSHA leases is projected to save $18 million. It\u2019s unclear whether inspectors' positions and other jobs from those offices would be moved to other facilities.",
      "MSHA was created by Congress within the Labor Department in 1978, in part because state inspectors were seen as too close to the industry to force coal companies to take the sometimes costly steps necessary to protect miners. MSHA is required to inspect each underground mine quarterly and each surface mine twice a year.",
      "Agency inspectors are supposed to check every working section of a mine. They examine electrical and ventilation systems that protect miners from deadly black lung disease, inspect impoundment dams and new roof bolts, and make sure mining equipment is safe, said Jack Spadaro, a longtime mine safety investigator and environmental specialist who worked for MSHA.",
      "Mining fatalities over the past four decades have dropped significantly, in large part because of the dramatic decline in coal production. But the proposed DOGE cuts would require MSHA inspectors to travel farther to get to a mine, and Spadaro said that could lead to less thorough inspections.",
      "A review last month of publicly available data by the Appalachian Citizens\u2019 Law Center indicates that nearly 17,000 health and safety inspections were conducted from the beginning of 2024 through February 2025 by staff at MSHA offices in the facilities on the chopping block. MSHA, which also oversees metal and nonmetal mines, already is understaffed. Over the past decade, it has seen a 27% reduction in total staff, including 30% of enforcement staff in general and 50% of enforcement staff for coal mines, the law center said.",
      "The coal industry has been in decline as utilities have installed more renewable energy and converted coal-fired plants to be fueled by cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas.",
      "U.S. coal production was at 1 billion tons (907,000 metric tons) in 2014 and fell to 578 million tons (524 million metric tons) by 2023, the latest year available, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. It has been in a long, steep decline for decades.",
      "Coal industry deaths were in the hundreds throughout the 1950s and 1960s. After MSHA was created, deaths steadily decreased, then dropped even further in the last decade as a growing number of mining companies shut down and thousands of jobs were eliminated. There have been 11 or fewer deaths in each of the past five years, according to MSHA.",
      "Coal employment rebounded from 2022 to 2023, rising 4.2% to 45,476. West Virginia employed the most miners at 14,000, followed by Kentucky at 5,000. About half of the nation\u2019s 560 coal mines are located in West Virginia (165) and Kentucky (112). Despite having just 15 mines, Wyoming was the highest-producing coal state due to mechanization.",

      "After hearing that tariffs would be announced, they made plans the weekend before to lease the car. He said the dealership honored the agreement they worked out before the tariffs were finalized. And although he said the salespeople were a pleasure to deal with, Blackwell sensed a shift in their stance.",
      "\u201cThey know what we know, which is suddenly it flips from a buyer\u2019s market to a seller\u2019s market very quickly,\u201d Blackwell said, adding that he is happy with his choice.",

      "Stewart was there that day but soon stepped away for good, focusing on his love for hunting, fishing and tending to his chickens and his garden when the weather warms.",
      "Coal mining in West Virginia, meanwhile, spent the ensuing years in a political fight that Republicans largely won. As a 2016 presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton was slammed for saying that her plans to shift away from carbon-based fuels like coal would put miners out of business. Trump vowed to save the industry, and while mining jobs have not made a comeback, coal states like West Virginia have become reliable Republican strongholds.",
      "Advocates for the mining industry argue that state government is up to the task of keeping mines safe, although some lawmakers in West Virginia's Republican majority have used the existence of federal inspectors as justification for curtailing the state inspectors' enforcement power. They also point to the dwindling number of mining fatalities \u2014 and mines in general.",
      "Republican Tom Clark, a West Virginia state lawmaker and a former MSHA inspector and supervisor who worked in one West Virginia office slated for closure, said he expected it to shutter years ago. Eight MSHA employees currently work in the Summersville office, Clark said, less than a third of the workforce that existed there about 10 years ago.",
      "Clark said he doesn\u2019t have any concerns for miners, as long as those inspectors are transferred to other coalfield-based offices. Clark, who worked on MSHA's Upper Big Branch investigation, said he supports the Trump administration's efforts to streamline government and stimulate the economy.",

      "Clark said the federal government should not cut down on inspectors and said black lung benefits need to be funded. He said the government should use money they\u2019re saving to make sure those programs have what they need.",

      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend anybody get in the mining industry right now because of what\u2019s going on with Trump and Musk,\u201d he said.",
      "Stewart said he's never supported Trump and never would, but he struggles to explain the loyalty of many West Virginians, including coal miners, to the president. He said Trump had never done anything to help them.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t wrap my brain around why they can\u2019t see what a con man he is. I just hope someday they\u2019ll wake up. It may already be too late.\u201d",

      "Stewart was inside Upper Big Branch when it exploded on April 5, 2010, with a blast he described as \u201churricane force winds.\u201d Before reaching the surface, he tried to revive some of his fallen co-workers, then covered their bodies with blankets.",
      "Investigations determined that worn and broken cutting equipment created a spark that ignited coal dust and methane gas.",
      "After the disaster, MSHA sent inspection teams to conduct impact inspections at mines with a history of repeated problems, many of them underground operations in West Virginia and Kentucky, which have nearly half of the nation\u2019s coal mines. Under the second Trump administration, the impact inspections have stopped.",
      "Joe Main, MSHA\u2019s chief during the Obama administration, said on Musk\u2019s social media site X that weakened MSHA enforcement staffing contributed to the Upper Big Branch disaster and that the proposed DOGE cuts \u201ccan risk miners' lives in an agency already short staffed.\u201d",
      "Some 34 MSHA offices in 19 states have been targeted for closure. Hundreds of federal occupational health employees doing mining-related work and research were laid off this past week as part of cuts to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "\u201cIf you take away all those protections, you're kind of making the workers disposable,\u201d said Dr. Carl Werntz, a West Virginia physician who conducts black lung examinations. \u201cThat's terribly concerning.\u201d",

      "\"My concern is that what Elon Musk is trying to do is break government, not fix it,\" Beshear said.",
      "Conflicts within the coal industry go back over a century. The West Virginia Mine Wars involved a long-running dispute between coal companies and miners fed up with deadly work and poor wages and living conditions. When union organizers showed up, the companies retaliated.",
      "Membership in the United Mine Workers union peaked in 1946, then plummeted as government support waned and the industry waged an all-out war on union mines. Today, a majority of U.S. coal mines are nonunion and the UMW is a shell of the powerful safety advocate it once was.",
      "UMW President Cecil Roberts said workers\u2019 safety will be left \u201csolely in the hands of employers\u201d in the absence of protections from the union and the federal government.",

      "Day after day, Chinese rescue teams haul children and elderly people from collapsed buildings",
      "WASHINGTON -- Day after day, Chinese rescue teams haul children and elderly people from collapsed buildings as cameras beam the thanks of grateful survivors around the world. Russian medical teams show off field hospitals erected in a flash to tend the wounded.",
      "Notably absent from the aftermath of the 7.7-magnitude earthquake in the poor Southeast Asian nation Myanmar: the uniquely skilled, well-equipped and swift search-and-rescue teams and disaster-response crews from the United States.",
      "At least 15 Asian and Western government rescue teams have landed crews reaching hundreds of workers in size, alongside initial pledges of financial aid reaching tens of millions of dollars, as the death toll of the March 28 quake tops 3,000, Myanmar's government says. Cameras showed Vietnam's team on arrival, marching square-shouldered to the rescue behind their country's flag.",
      "While Myanmar\u2019s military junta and civil war have posed challenges, the U.S. government has worked with local partners there previously to successfully provide aid for decades, including after deadly storms in 2008 and 2023, aid officials say.",
      "The American government dwarfs other nations' rescue capacity in experience, capacity and heavy machinery able to pull people alive from rubble. But in Myanmar after the most recent quake, the U.S. has distinguished itself for having no known presence on the ground beyond a three-member assessment team sent days after the quake.",
      "\u201cWe all worried what would be the human impact\u201d of President Donald Trump\u2019s dismantling of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development, said Lia Lindsey, a senior humanitarian policy adviser for Oxfam, which scrambled to provide tents, blankets and other aid to quake survivors.",
      "Now, Lindsey said, \"we're seeing it in real time. We\u2019re seeing it in increased suffering and increased death.\u201d'",
      "The United States, the world\u2019s largest economy, long saw its strategic interests and alliances served by its standing as the world\u2019s top humanitarian donor. Myanmar's quake is as close to a no-show as the nation has had in recent memory at a major, accessible natural disaster.",
      "Current and former senior private and government officials say the Myanmar disaster points to some of the results \u2014 for people in need on the ground, and for U.S. standing in the world \u2014 of the Trump administration's retreat from decades of U.S. policy. That approach held that Washington needs both the hard power of a strong military and the soft power of a robust aid and development program to deter enemies, win and keep friends and steer events.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in Europe for a NATO gathering, rejected a suggestion that the administration was ceding influence abroad by canceling thousands of its aid and development contracts, including for disasters. He told reporters that those complaining were the aid groups, which he accused of profiting off past U.S. aid.",
      "\u201cWe will do the best we can,\" Rubio said Friday. \u201cBut we also have other needs we have to balance that against. We\u2019re not walking away.\"",
      "He pointed to \u201ca lot of other rich countries in the world. They should all be pitching in and do their part.\u201d",
      "Leading Senate Democrats wrote Rubio this week, urging him to scale up U.S. disaster aid to Myanmar \u2014 and fast. Separately, Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke of watching a news broadcast of the disaster showing Chinese government teams at work.",
      "\u201cIt hurt my heart to see where, instead of a USAID ... team leading the response, there was a team from the PRC that was being celebrated for having saved some people in the rubble,\u201d Coons said.",
      "The 2 1/2-month-old Trump administration, through Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency teams, has frozen USAID funding, terminated thousands of contracts and is firing all but a handful of its staff globally. It accuses the agency of waste and of advancing liberal causes. The Myanmar quake is the first major natural disaster since that work started.",
      "The Trump administration and some Republican lawmakers say they will reassemble a reduced slate of aid and development programs under the State Department, fitting their narrower interpretation of work that serves U.S. strategic and economic interests.",
      "Days after the Myanmar quake, the U.S. made its first announcement of help: It was sending a three-member assessment team of non-specialist advisers from a regional USAID office in Bangkok, Thailand. Coincidentally, like hundreds of other USAID staffers around the world, the three had received layoff notices from the Trump administration on March 28 within hours of the quake, current and former USAID officials confirmed.",
      "The administration also promised $2 million in aid, and announced another $7 million Friday. But there's a much larger number at play.",
      "That $9 million total is dwarfed by the roughly $2 billion in payments for previously rendered services and goods that the Trump administration has owed nonprofit humanitarian groups and other contractors and government and nongovernment foreign partners, aid officials say. The Trump administration abruptly shut down USAID and State foreign assistance payments \u2014 including for work already done \u2014 on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day.",
      "Combined with abruptly terminated aid contracts and the freeze on the USAID and State aid and development payments, the U.S. back debt is forcing larger aid operations and businesses to scale back their services to people in need and to slash staff. Some smaller organizations were driven out of business. That was even before the Myanmar quake.",
      "Under court order, the administration is slowly making good on those back payments.",
      "In the meantime, nonprofit groups are having to draw on reserve funds they would normally use for sudden unplanned disasters like the Myanmar quake to pay the bills that the U.S. should have paid, said Lindsey, the Oxfam official.",
      "Asked about the burden that the non-government organizations \u2014 another name for aid groups \u2014 say USAID's unpaid back bills are placing on their work, the State Department said in an email, \u201cThe U.S. government cannot comment on how NGOs manage their financing.\"",
      "Typically, the United States itself would have provided $10 million to $20 million in the initial phase of response to a disaster like the Myanmar quake, with more later for long-term aid and rebuilding, said Sarah Charles, who ran disaster response and overall humanitarian affairs at USAID in the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cWe have a long history in Burma,\u201d Charles said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s an environment that the U.S. government has been operating in over the last many decades.\"",
      "Normally, the United States also would have had 20 to 25 specialized disaster workers on the ground in as few as 24 hours, Charles said. That number would have jumped to 200 or more if USAID had flown in urban rescue teams from California and Virginia. They deploy as self-contained units, with dog handlers and the capacity to feed and provide clean water to the teams, Charles said.",
      "The Trump administration preserved contracts for the California and Virginia rescue teams under pressure from lawmakers. But the contracts for their transport are believed among the thousands of USAID contracts that the administration canceled. That left the U.S. no quick way to move search-and-rescue crews when disaster struck, Charles said.",
      "Britain has pledged $13 million in aid and said it will match up to $5 million in private donations, and China and others have promised financial aid. At least 15 countries sent in dozens or hundreds of rescuers or aid workers, including Russia, China, India and the United Arab Emirates, according to Myanmar officials.",
      "China shares a border and close ties with Myanmar. Chinese rescuers had their first success Sunday, fewer than 48 hours after the quake, when they joined hands with local people to pull an elderly man from a badly damaged hospital in the capital city of Naypyitaw.",
      "By Wednesday, Chinese rescuers had pulled out nine survivors, including a pregnant woman and a child. In Mandalay, Chinese rescuers saved a 52-year-old man who trapped for nearly 125 hours.",

      "Prosecutors are seeking more than seven years in prison for disgraced former congressman George Santos after he pleaded guilty to federal fraud and identity theft charges",
      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors are seeking more than seven years in prison for disgraced former U.S. Rep. George Santos after he pleaded guilty to federal fraud and identity theft charges.",
      "The U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York argued in a court filing Friday that a significant sentence was warranted because the New York Republican\u2019s \u201cunparalleled crimes\u201d had \u201cmade a mockery\u201d of the country\u2019s election system.",
      "\u201cFrom his creation of a wholly fictitious biography to his callous theft of money from elderly and impaired donors, Santos\u2019s unrestrained greed and voracious appetite for fame enabled him to exploit the very system by which we select our representatives,\" the office wrote.",
      "Prosecutors also argued that Santos had been \u201cunrepentant and defiant\u201d for years, dismissing the prosecution as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and refusing to resign from Congress as his web of lies was debunked.",
      "They said his claims of remorse after pleading guilty \u201cring hollow\" and suggested he has a \u201chigh likelihood of reoffending\" given he has not forfeited any of his ill-gotten gains or repaid any of his victims.",
      "Santos\u2019 lawyers, in an email to The Associated Press, dismissed the seven-year proposal as \u201cabsurd and unfounded,\u201d saying it appears \u201cdesigned to beat up on a man that already took full responsibility for his actions.\u201d",
      "In their own sentencing memo Friday, they rejected the notion that Santos will fall back into criminal behavior, noting he has no prior criminal record and also provides \u201ccrucial\u201d support to his sister and her young daughter.",
      "They argued for a two-year prison term, which is the mandatory minimum sentence for aggravated identity theft.",
      "The lawyers maintain such a sentence is in line with those handed to former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and other political figures facing similar financial crimes.",
      "They also touted Santos' cooperation in a separate federal investigation into a Texas man who tried to dupe Santos out of nearly $1 million by posing as a political fixer offering to destroy evidence in his cases.",
      "\u201cThis sentence, coupled with the significant collateral consequences Mr. Santos has already suffered\u2014including the loss of his congressional seat and public humiliation \u2014 would send a clear message that such conduct will not be tolerated,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "A federal judge on Long Island is scheduled to decide Santos\u2019 sentence during a court hearing April 25.",
      "The once-rising Republican, who represented parts of Queens and Long Island, served barely a year in office before he was ousted by his House colleagues in 2023, just the sixth congressperson ever expelled in the chamber\u2019s history.",
      "Santos\u2019 political demise came after it was revealed that he had fabricated much of his life story, leading to questions about how the political unknown had funded his winning campaign.",
      "The now-36-year-old cast himself as a wealthy businessman who had graduated from top colleges, worked at prestigious Wall Street firms and held a valuable real estate portfolio. In truth, he was struggling financially and faced eviction.",
      "Santos admitted in August that he duped voters, deceived donors and stole the identities of nearly a dozen people, including his own family members, to make donations to his congressional campaign.",
      "He was initially due to be sentenced in February, but a judge granted him a three-month reprieve to come up with more than half a million dollars in court fines.",
      "As part of his plea deal, Santos agreed to pay nearly $375,000 in restitution and $205,000 in forfeiture.",
      "Santos\u2019 lawyers said at the time that he had little more than $1,000 in liquid assets and needed more time to build his newly launched podcast \u201cPants on Fire\u201d in order to begin paying off the debt.",
      "Prosecutors maintain Santos profited handsomely from his infamy, arguing he has earned more than $800,000 from appearances on the video-sharing website Cameo and from a new documentary since his expulsion from Congress.",
      "Two of Santos\u2019 campaign staffers have also pleaded guilty to federal charges in connection to the campaign financing scheme.",
      "Sam Miele, his former campaign fundraiser, was sentenced in March to one year and one day in federal prison. He admitted to impersonating a high-ranking congressional aide and charging donors\u2019 credit cards without authorization while raising campaign cash for Santos.",
      "Nancy Marks, Santos\u2019 former campaign treasurer, admitted to filing bogus campaign finance reports filled with fake donors and a fake $500,000 personal loan from Santos himself.",
      "The embellishments helped the campaign hit fundraising thresholds needed to qualify for financial backing from the national Republican Party. Marks is due to be sentenced in May.",

      "The former assistant, identified in court documents as Jane Doe, sued the filmmaker and his production company on Thursday. She is seeking a judge's order to enforce the agreement after Schrader said he couldn\u2019t go through with it. The terms, including a monetary payment, were not disclosed.",
      "\u201cThis is an open-and-shut settlement enforcement matter,\u201d Doe's lawyer, Gregory Chiarello, wrote in court papers accompanying the breach of contract claim.",

      "The lawsuit, filed in a New York court, laid bare allegations that the confidential settlement between Doe, 26, and Schrader, 78, had been intended to keep under wraps.",
      "They include her claim that the filmmaker trapped her in his hotel room, grabbed her arms and kissed her against her will last year while they were promoting his latest film, \u201cOh, Canada,\u201d at the Cannes Film Festival in France.",
      "Two days later, the lawsuit said, Schrader called Doe repeatedly and sent her angry text messages claiming he was \u201cdying\u201d and couldn't pack his bags. When Doe arrived to help, the lawsuit said, Schrader exposed his genitals to her as he opened his hotel room door wearing nothing but an open bathrobe.",
      "Doe alleges Schrader fired her last September after she again rejected his advances.

      "\u201cThe agreement that they're trying to enforce against Mr. Schrader, in plain English, required both parties to sign it before it became legally effective,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cMr. Schrader declined to sign it. It's frankly as simple as that.\u201d",
      "Doe worked for Schrader from 2021 until 2024, according to the lawsuit. During that time, Kessler said, she posted on social media about how much she loved her job and referred to Schrader as an extraordinary mentor and \u201cmy man.\u201d",
      "Schrader rose to fame through his collaborations with director Martin Scorsese, beginning with \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d in 1976.

    "summary": "What made the US step back from the system that it profited handsomely from for decades?",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has built another wall, and he thinks everyone else is going to pay for it. But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out.",
      "The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan.",
      "What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades.",
      "And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy.",
      "The great free trade debate",
      "Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.",
      "Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.",
      "Follow live: US tariffs have global leaders scrambling",
      "The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it \"great\" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax.",
      "On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.",
      "There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations.",
      "Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely.",
      "Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.",
      "But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board.",
      "The rationale behind 'reciprocal' tariffs",
      "It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.",
      "The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports.",
      "In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. \"These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers\u2026 The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\"",
      "This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition \"cheating\" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance.",
      "This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method.",
      "The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data.",
      "While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing.",
      "There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.",
      "The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (\u00a3216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech.",
      "Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations.",
      "'China shock' and the ripple effect",
      "There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\".",
      "That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world.",
      "For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term \"China shock\".",
      "In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy.",
      "Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of \"comparative advantage\". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down.",
      "Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia.",
      "Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this \"China shock\" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south.",
      "The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent.",
      "Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",
      "The influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House.",
      "So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president's clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this.",
      "But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics.",
      "The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere.",
      "The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices.",
      "The first social media trade war",
      "Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich.",
      "The world's consumers have choices.",
      "It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem.",
      "Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers.",
      "Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla's sale slump and Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff.",
      "These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US.",
      "The president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario.",
      "In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist.",
      "This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US.",
      "Perhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs.",
      "For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.",

      "\"Yeah it's ended, the prime minister said that himself this morning,\" he said.",
      "The change meant the UK had to \"build out\" relationships with allies around the world but also invest in the UK's own economy, Jones said, denying ministers were \"scrabbling\" for solutions.",

    "story": [
      "As stock markets continue to tumble after the US imposition of sweeping and swingeing tariffs, many are asking does this qualify as a stock market \"crash\" and what that could mean for them.",
      "The word crash has been used sparingly over the decades and is usually reserved for a fall of over 20% from a recent peak in a day, or over the course of a couple of days.",
      "On 19 October, 1987 - also known as Black Monday - the US stock market lost 23% of its value in a single day, and other stock markets had similar falls. The UK FTSE index fell 23% over two days \u2013 partly because it closes earlier than New York, and so it often plays catch up with whatever happens in the US the next morning.",
      "That was most definitely a crash.",
      "In 1929, the US stock market lost over 20% of its value in two days - and 50% within three weeks. That was the famous Wall Street Crash that ushered in the great depression of the 1930s.",
      "By comparison, the US stock market has lost around 17% of its value from its peak in February and is now down 2% from where it was this time last year.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "Nevertheless, these are the biggest and quickest declines we have seen in world markets since they were gripped by the panic of Covid-19 in early 2020.",
      "A decline of 20% from a peak is considered a \"bear market\" - a description of a market that appears to be more likely to go down than go up. We are very close to that description right now.",
      "How does it affect you?",
      "While many people own stocks and shares directly, most people's exposure to stock markets come through their pension plans. There are two types \u2013 defined benefit schemes which guarantee a fixed pension income, and defined contribution where your pension pot rises and falls with financial markets.",
      "That may sound like defined contribution plans are very vulnerable to this sell off \u2013 but not all of your contributions go into shares. Much of the money goes into safer investments such as government bonds. These tend to increase in value when stock markets fall as they are seen as a \"safe haven\" along with other assets such as gold.",

      "The markets believe that US President Donald Trump's tariff bombshell is expected to raise prices, lower demand and reduce profits, making companies less valuable and more inclined to cut investment and jobs.",
      "So the real warning sign here is not about the value of your pension but about the health of the economy in which we live and work.",

      "Many of her fellow tenants in this apartment block near Madrid's Atocha railway station have similar problems. They say the company that owns the building has stopped responding to requests for basic maintenance in recent months, since informing them that it will not renew their rental contracts.",
      "\"The current rental bubble is encouraging a lot of big owners to do what they are doing here,\" says Blanca. \"Which is to get rid of the current tenants who have been here a long time, in order to have short-term tourist flats, or simply to hike up the rent.\"",
      "Blanca and her fellow tenants have vowed to stay in the building despite what they see as efforts to push them out by the owners, who were not available for comment for this article.",

      "\"The current problem is a huge imbalance between supply and demand,\" says Juan Vill\u00e9n, of Idealista. \"Demand is very good, the economy is growing a lot, but supply is dwindling very fast.\"",
      "Mr Vill\u00e9n offers the example of Barcelona, where rental increases have become notorious. Whereas nine families were competing to rent each property in the city five years ago, that number has risen to 54. Rental costs during that time have increased by 60%, he adds.",
      "\"We need to build more properties,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"And on the rental side we need more people willing to rent their properties, or willing to buy properties, refurbish them and put them on the rental market.\"",

      "This need for more housing has been pushed up in part by the arrival of immigrants who have joined the workforce and are helping drive Spain's economic growth. The ministry also pointed to a lack of social housing, which at 3.4% of total supply, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "In 2007, at the height of a property-ownership bubble, more than 600,000 homes were built in Spain. But high building costs, lack of available land and a shortage of manpower have all been factors in restricting construction in recent years, with just under 100,000 homes completed in 2024.",
      "The government has taken measures to incentivise construction, apportioning land for the building of affordable homes, while trying to ensure that public housing does not end up in the private market, which has been a problem in the past.",
      "But the Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has also expressed a willingness to intervene in the market in order to bring rental prices under control.",
      "At a recent event to mark the opening of 218 low-rent flats in the southern city of Seville, he declared that Spaniards \"want us to act, they want the housing market to operate according to the law of reason, of social justice, not the law of the jungle; they want to ensure that vulture funds and speculators are not doing whatever they like\".",
      "The central government and a number of local administrations have identified short-term tourist accommodation as part of the problem. Last year, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and several cities on the mainland saw protests by locals against surging tourist numbers, with their impact on rental costs the main complaint.",
      "Several city halls have responded by announcing plans to restrict the granting of tourist-flat permits, while Barcelona is going further, revoking the licences of all of the city's 10,000 or so registered short-term apartments by 2028.",
      "The S\u00e1nchez government has also pushed through parliament a housing law, which includes a cap on rentals in so-called \"high-tension\" areas where prices are climbing out of control. Political resistance has meant that the legislation is so far only being implemented in the northern regions of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia, and its success is open to debate.",
      "The Socialist-led regional and central governments have pointed to a 3.7% drop in rental costs in \"high-tension\" areas of Catalonia since the cap's introduction there a year ago, with Barcelona seeing a decrease of 6.4%.",
      "However, critics warn that the rental cap has spooked owners and caused thousands of properties to be withdrawn from the market.",
      "\"On the supply side, the problem is that all measures taken by the local or national governments are going against landlords,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"Even people that were doing build-to-rent new properties have been selling their properties because they don't want to get into the rental market.\"",
      "Another initiative proposed by the central government which has stirred up debate is a tax of up to 100% on properties bought by non-residents from outside the EU, on the grounds that such homes are often barely inhabited. This is a measure that, if rolled out, would heavily affect British buyers.",
      "The conservative opposition has accused the government of being too heavy-handed with its approach. However, as public anger builds over this issue, there are many others who would like the country's leaders to act much more stridently.",
      "Gonzalo \u00c1lvarez, of the Sindicato de Inquilinas e Inquilinos, an organisation that campaigns for tenants' rights, agrees that a shortage of available homes is a problem, but insists that building more is not the answer.",
      "\"There is a lack of housing because homes are being hijacked - on the one hand tourist flats, and on the other hand all the empty flats belonging to vulture funds and the banks,\" he says. \"So there's no need to build more, it's not necessary. But the housing we have has been hijacked.\"",
      "His organisation wants the government to impose drastic mandatory reductions in rent on owners and is threatening to orchestrate a nationwide strike by tenants that would see participants refuse to pay their rent.",

      "David Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand.",
      "\"This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,\" he says.",
      "Many other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament.",
      "Nike is already facing a tight bottom line.",
      "It had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.",
      "But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.",
      "By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%.",
      "That is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.",

      "Mr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer.",
      "\"So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),\" he says.",

      "Theoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: \"Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?\"",
      "Even before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes.",
      "Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.",
      "And Nike relies heavily on US sales, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America.",
      "Sentiment in the US is a \"significant concern\" for Nike as it directly affects demand for its footwear, says Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.",

      "He adds: \"How US trading partners react against the reciprocal tariff policy will also have a major impact.\"",
      "China has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own.",
      "Part of the rationale behind Trump's tariff policy is because he wants more companies to manufacture their goods in the US.",
      "However, Prof Lu does not see Nike, or other companies, significantly reshaping its supply chain any time soon \"due to the complexity involved in footwear manufacturing\".",
      "That includes the time needed to \"consider a long list of factors when deciding where to source their products - quality, costs, speed to market and various social and environmental compliance risks\".",

    "story": [
      "The UK exported nearly \u00a360bn worth of goods to the US last year, making it one of the most important markets for thousands of British businesses.",
      "After President Donald Trump announced a 10% tariff on nearly all UK products, we spoke to businesses from some of Britain's biggest exporters to find out what it could mean for them.",
      "Food and drink: 'We've got fewer orders than normal'",
      "The UK food and drink industry exports a couple of billion pounds worth of goods to the US every year, satisfying Americans's taste for specialist products like smoked salmon, Scotch whisky and artisan cheeses.",
      "Adam Sopher, co-founder and chief executive at Joe & Seph's, the London-based luxury popcorn-maker, says the mere spectre of tariffs had already been affecting the business.",
      "US retailers usually place their orders for Christmas early in the year, but it's had far fewer orders than normal as retailers wait to see what happens.",
      "Joe & Seph's made \u00a38m in sales last year of which 2%-3% came from the US. \"So it is not huge,\" says Mr Sopher. \"But the US is the biggest popcorn market in the world so we had planned that a lot of our growth would come from there.\"",
      "As a consequence, he says, it's now planning to focus on growing its exports to the Middle East and Asia.",
      "However, the 10% tariff was not as bad as he was expecting and US importers aready have to pay a 5.8% tariff on Joe & Seph's goods when they reach American ports.",
      "\"So essentially what's happened is we're going to go from 5.8% to 10% as opposed to zero to 10%,\" says Mr Sopher. It is also lower than the new US tariffs levied on other countries, such as the 20% tax on the European Union.",
      "\"Ironically it could be a good thing,\" he says. \"These retailers who would have sourced from Europe might now say 'actually we'll buy more from the UK.\"",
      "Chemicals: 'We're hoping there is an opportunity'",
      "For something not visible to the naked eye, organic chemicals are a huge US export for the UK, totalling close to \u00a33bn last year.",
      "They are used across a massive range of industries from food to make-up to engines and into agriculture.",
      "Rather than feeling fearful about the US tariff, Robinsons Brothers reckons it may help the West Bromwich-based organic chemicals firm wrestle back American customers from cheaper overseas rivals.",
      "Chief executive Adrian Hanrahan says: \"We supplied a lot more to the US but China and India knocked us out of that because of very low pricing.\"",
      "Under Trump's new regime, China's imports face a 34% tariff while India's products will be taxed at 27%. Robinsons Brothers chemicals are already taxed at 6% when they reach the US",
      "Mr Hanrahan says he is still trying to nail down whether the new 10% US tariff on UK goods means Robinsons Brothers' American customers will be paying an additional 4% or a total 16%.",
      "\"Either way, it is a lot less than China or India will see going into the US,\" he says. \"So I am really hoping and seeing an opportunity for us here in one area.\"",
      "He says that since January, the company has been receiving more enquiries from the US, including two customers Robinsons Brothers lost five years ago \"at great expense\".",
      "At the moment, Robinsons Brothers derives between 1.5% and 2% of total sales - which reached \u00a324m last year - from America.",
      "This \"doesn't seem a lot\" says Mr Hanrahan but they are high margin products.",
      "There are, of course, concerns that rival countries may have to dump products once destined for the US on other markets, such as the UK which, in turn, could drive down domestic prices.",
      "Mr Hanrahan says: \"I am hoping that the UK government is preparing for that and putting something in place to mitigate any form of product dumping in the UK and in the EU.\"",

      "Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest this money to help it grow. Widespread falls in share prices are likely to be bad news for pension savers.",
      "Hundreds of billions of pounds are held in defined contribution pensions at the moment.",
      "So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet.",

      "Some people invest money in what are known as tracker funds. These go up and down in line with the performance of a certain index, such as the FTSE 100.",

      "Live shopping has been popular in the Asia-Pacific region for some time, where social networks such as China's Douyin regularly host live shopping streams, but now European and US brands are experimenting with this new way of selling their products.",
      "Live shopping is a close relative to shopping channels like QVC, where viewers are urged to call in and buy the products demonstrated by presenters.",
      "But live shopping acts as a quicker shortcut from buyer to product, especially in the era of one-click purchases, made popular by online retailers such as Amazon.",

      "\"Li has carefully built his personal brand to demonstrate his expertise and build consumer trust. KOLs are also working within much more sophisticated platform ecosystems,\" Mr Reynolds explains.",
      "Even Ms Krakora admits that not all products work on a live shopping stream.",
      "For example, she prefers to shop for jeans in-person. \"I'm tall, and I have specific cuts of jeans that I wear,\" she says, \"and there are tried-and-true styles and brands I like.\"",
      "Bruce Winder, a retail analyst in Toronto, also says that for some shoppers, the convenience of live shopping might be too attractive.",
      "\"Consumers may get addicted to the show or channel... and some consumers may not be able to stop watching and spending as they get caught up in the moment,\" he adds.",
      "Despite those potential pitfalls, major brands and platforms have jumped on the live shopping bandwagon.",

      "\"Live shopping lets shoppers have a conversation with someone who knows the products being sold, and that generates a lot of excitement,\" says Manish Chandra, the chief executive and founder of Poshmark.",
      "\"It also creates a community where other shoppers are in the same show, and it's really a different experience than a traditional shopping trip.\"",

If the pound weakens against the dollar, then UK firms importing goods from the US will face higher costs. This could then lead to higher prices of these goods in UK shops if companies cannot absorb the increased costs themselves.",
      "Also, if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on the extra costs to customers.",

      "Not only will that limit the pain felt by British businesses compared to their European neighbours, but it could present trading opportunities.",
      "UK exporters to America could have a competitive edge, with US importers only facing half the tax by dealing with UK businesses instead of EU businesses.",

      "US President Donald Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on goods from most countries being imported into the US, with even higher rates for what he calls the \"worst offenders\".",
      "But how exactly were these tariffs -  essentially taxes on imports - worked out? BBC Verify has been looking at the calculations behind the numbers.",
      "What were the calculations?",
      "When Trump presented a giant cardboard chart detailing the tariffs in the White House Rose Garden it was initially assumed that the charges were based on a combination of existing tariffs and other trade barriers (like regulations).",
      "But later, the White House published what might look like a complicated mathematical formula.",
      "But if you unpick the formula above it boils down to simple maths: take the trade deficit for the US in goods with a particular country, divide that by the total goods imports from that country and then divide that number by two.",

      "Explainer: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?",
      "US analysis: Trump's tariffs are his biggest gamble yet",
      "For example, the US buys more goods from China than it sells to them - there is a goods deficit of $295bn. The total amount of goods it buys from China is $440bn.",
      "Dividing 295 by 440 gets you to 67% and you divide that by two and round up. Therefore the tariff imposed on China is 34%.",
      "Similarly, when it applied to the EU, the White House's formula resulted in a 20% tariff.",
      "Are the Trump tariffs 'reciprocal'?",
      "Many commentators have pointed out that these tariffs are not reciprocal.",
      "Reciprocal would mean they were based on what countries already charge the US in the form of existing tariffs, plus non-tariff barriers (things like regulations that drive up costs).",
      "But the White House's official methodology document makes clear that they have not calculated this for all the countries on which they have imposed tariffs.",
      "Instead the tariff rate was calculated on the basis that it would eliminate the US's goods trade deficit with each country.",
      "Trump has broken away from the formula in imposing tariffs on countries that buy more goods from the US than they sell to it.",
      "For example the US does not currently run goods trade deficit with the UK. Yet the UK has been hit with a 10% tariff.",
      "In total, more than 100 countries are covered by the new tariff regime.",
      "'Lots of broader impacts'",
      "Trump believes the US is getting a bad deal in global trade. In his view, other countries flood US markets with cheap goods - which hurts US companies and costs jobs. At the same time, these countries are putting up barriers that make US products less competitive abroad.",
      "So by using tariffs to eliminate trade deficits, Trump hopes to revive US manufacturing and protect jobs.",
      "But will this new tariff regime achieve the desired outcome?",
      "BBC Verify has spoken to a number of economists. The overwhelming view is that while the tariffs might reduce the goods deficit between the US and individual countries, they will not reduce the overall deficit between the US and rest of the world.",
      "\"Yes, it will reduce bilateral trade deficits between the US and these countries. But there will obviously be lots of broader impacts that are not captured in the calculation\", says Professor Jonathan Portes of King's College, London.",
      "That's because the US' existing overall deficit is not driven solely by trade barriers, but by how the US economy works.",
      "For one, Americans spend and invest more than they earn and that gap means the US buys more from the world than it sells. So as long as that continues, the US may continue to keep running a deficit despite increasing tariffs with it global trading partners.",
      "Some trade deficits can also exist for a number of legitimate reasons - not just down to tariffs. For example, buying food that is easier or cheaper to produce in other countries' climates.",
      "Thomas Sampson of the London School of Economics said: \"The formula is reverse engineered to rationalise charging tariffs on countries with which the US has a trade deficit. There is no economic rationale for doing this and it will cost the global economy dearly.\"",

      "Mr Wills says he split the cost of the tariff with his US importer so the price would stay the same for their American customers.",
      "\"I imagine we'll be doing what we did last time, and trying to keep the shelf price as it was before,\" he says.",

      "Financial director Denise Cole says she does not want tariffs on her products but understands why President Trump has brought them in.",
      "\"I've seen UK manufacturing decimated and the same has happened in America so he's looking after his own which is exactly what it says on the tin with Trump.\"",
      "She says there was a lot of panic over tariffs and any changes could be \"short-lived\".",
      "\"I really don't think it's going to impact us in a negative way,\" she says. \"The specialist products we sell, they don't manufacture in the US anyway, they would struggle to get them elsewhere.",
      "\"Our own government has done me more damage by increasing employer National Insurance Contributions,\" she says. \"That's added \u00a335,000 to my costs - that's a whole person's wages.

    "summary": "The UK has been hit with 10% tariffs by the US, but there is uncertainty as to the impact of them.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has announced fresh import taxes on goods being imported to America in the latest escalation of the global trade war.",
      "The UK has been hit with a 10% tariff on nearly all of its goods being brought into the US, which Trump says is a retaliation to UK tariffs on American goods, but uncertainty remains over the potential impact on British consumers.",
      "Here's how you and your money could be affected.",
      "1. Prices could go up, but could also go down",
      "The tariffs Trump has just announced will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US.",
      "Clarissa Hahn, economist at Oxford Economics, says this means that the initial impact of price rises will be on US consumers, as American firms are likely to pass on the extra costs to their customers.",
      "However, she adds people in the UK could subsequently be affected by the measures, which come into effect on 5 April.",
      "One way is via the value of the pound and exchange rates, which dictate the cost to  UK businesses importing goods and raw materials from abroad. If import costs go up, these extra costs could be passed on to consumers through higher prices.",
      "Following Trump's speech on Wednesday, exchange rates between the dollar and pound fluctuated. If the value of the dollar strengthens as some economists have predicted, import costs could rise for UK firms importing goods.",
      "Higher prices in the UK could also \"prompt workers to demand higher wages\", which would further raise costs for businesses, according to Ahmet Ihsan Kaya, principal economist, at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.",
      "Ms Hahn adds if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on extra costs to customers.",
      "However, some economists have suggested prices could also initially fall as a result of Trump's decision to impose tariffs.",
      "Swati Dhingra, economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US, may instead send them to countries such as the UK which don't have such steep tariffs, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods in the UK.",
      "\"Tariffs of the proposed magnitude are likely to prompt firms that export to the US to lower their prices to retain demand for their products,\" she suggests.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "The countries hit hardest by new US tariffs - Trump's plan at a glance",
      "How were Donald Trump's tariffs calculated?",
      "2. It could affect your job",
      "British companies exporting goods to the US are set to be the hardest hit from the latest measures.",
      "The UK exported almost \u00a360bn worth of goods to the US last year, mainly machinery, cars and pharmaceuticals. Other industries, which are big exporters to the US, include fishing and electronics.",
      "If US demand for UK products dwindles due to the extra charges importers face, this could hit profit margins and ultimately lead to UK job cuts unless British firms find new customers outside the US.",
      "According to the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, Jaguar Land Rover and the Mini factory in Cowley, Oxford, appear to be the most exposed to US tariffs on cars.",
      "It says more than 25,000 jobs in the UK car manufacturing industry \"could be at risk\" with a 25% tariff coming into effect on Thursday, with one in eight UK-built cars exported to the US.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry is also heavily reliant on trade with the US, says Ms Hahn, of Oxford Economics.",
      "The US makes up 40% of AstraZeneca's sales and 50% of GSK's. Although both British-headquartered firms have manufacturing facilities in America, raw ingredients for life-saving medicines and vaccines travel between the UK, EU and US. Under tariffs the firms could be hit with multiple tax charges as they cross borders to be developed.",
      "There is also the issue of how tariffs work when they collide with pricing caps that both the NHS and other health organisations set for buying drugs in bulk.",
      "3. Interest rates may stay higher for longer",
      "UK interest rates dictate the costs households have to pay to borrow money for things such as mortgages, credit cards and loans. Higher rates also boost returns for savers.",
      "They are currently at 4.5%, but economists are predicting two more rate cuts by the end of the year.",
      "However, the Bank of England highlighted US tariffs as a reason why it avoided cutting rates further last month, saying economic and global trade uncertainty had \"intensified\".",
      "If prices are pushed up for long enough to affect the rate of inflation - this could mean interest rates stay higher for longer.",
      "Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, said it was Bank's job \"to make sure that inflation stays low and stable\" and that would be \"looking very closely\" at the impact of tariffs."

      "The tariff rate will be 24% on goods from Japan, and 26% from India.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs have shaken global trade, but disruption often creates opportunity.",
      "Starting 9 April, Indian goods will face tariffs of up to 27% (Trump's tariff chart lists India's rate as 26%, but the official order says 27% - a discrepancy seen for other nations too). Before the tariff hike, US rates across trading partners averaged 3.3%, among the lowest globally, compared to India's 17%, according to the White House.",
      "However, with the US imposing even higher tariffs on China (54%), Vietnam (46%), Thailand (36%) and Bangladesh (37%), India \"presents an opportunity\" in textiles, electronics and machinery, according to the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).",
      "High tariffs on Chinese and Bangladeshi exports open space for Indian textile manufacturers to expand in the US market. While Taiwan leads in semiconductors, India can tap into packaging, testing and lower-end chip manufacturing - if it strengthens infrastructure and policy support. Even a partial supply chain shift from Taiwan, driven by 32% tariffs, could work in India's favour.",

      "Live updates: Reaction to Trump's tariffs announcement",
      "At a glance: The countries hit hardest by these plans",
      "Explainer: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?",
      "Analysis: Trump's tariffs are his biggest gamble yet",
      "Machinery, automobiles and toys - sectors led by China and Thailand - are ripe for tariff-driven relocation. India can capitalise by attracting investment, scaling production and boosting exports to the US, according to a note by GTRI.",
      "But will India be able to seize the moment?",
      "High tariffs have increased costs for companies dependent on global value chains, hobbling India's ability to compete in international markets. Despite growing exports - primarily driven by services - India runs a significant trade deficit. India's share of global exports is a mere 1.5%. Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties. With his new tariffs, the fear is that Indian exports will be less competitive.",
      "\"Overall, the US's protectionist tariff regime could act as a catalyst for India to gain from global supply chain realignments,\" says Ajay Srivastava of GTRI.",
      "\"However, to fully leverage these opportunities, India must enhance its ease of doing business, invest in logistics and infrastructure and maintain policy stability. If these conditions are met, India is well-positioned to become a key global manufacturing and export hub in the coming years.\"",
      "That's easier said than done. Biswajit Dhar, a trade expert from the Delhi-based Council for Social Development think tank, points out that countries like Malaysia and Indonesia are possibly better positioned than India.",
      "\"We may regain some lost ground in garments now that Bangladesh faces higher tariffs, but the reality is we've treated garments as a sunset sector and failed to invest. Without building capacity, how can we truly benefit from these tariff shifts?\" says Mr Dhar.",
      "Since February, India has ramped up efforts to win Trump's favour - pledging $25bn in US energy imports, courting Washington as a top defence supplier and exploring F-35 fighter deals. To ease trade tensions, it scrapped the 6% digital ad tax, cut bourbon whiskey tariffs to 100% from 150% and slashed duties on luxury cars and solar cells. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's Starlink nears final approval. The two countries have launched extensive trade talks to narrow the US's $45bn trade deficit with India.",
      "Yet, India did not escape the tariff war.",
      "\"India should be concerned - there was hope that ongoing trade negotiations would shield it from reciprocal tariffs. Facing these tariffs now is a serious setback,\" says Abhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade.",
      "One upside: pharmaceuticals are exempt from reciprocal tariffs, a relief for India's generic drug makers. India supplies nearly half of all generic medicines in the US, where these lower-cost alternatives account for 90% of prescriptions.",
      "However, exports in key sectors like electronics, engineering goods - automobile parts, industrial machines - and marine products could take a hit. It would be especially troubling for electronics, given the heavy investments through India's flagship \"production-linked incentives\" (PLI) schemes to boost local manufacturing.",
      "\"I'm apprehensive about our exporters' capacity - many are small manufacturers who will struggle to absorb a 27% tariff hike, making them uncompetitive. High logistical costs, rising business expenses and deteriorating trade infrastructure only add to the challenge. We're starting at a major disadvantage,\" says Mr Dhar.",
      "Many see these tariffs as Trump's bargaining chip in trade negotiations with India. The latest US Trade Representative report underscores Washington's frustration with India's trade policies.",
      "Released on Monday, the report flags India's strict import rules on dairy, pork and fish, requiring non-GMO certification without scientific backing. It also criticises India's sluggish approval process for genetically modified products and price caps on stents and implants.",
      "Intellectual property concerns have landed India on the 'Priority Watch List', for which the report cites weak patent protections and a lack of trade secret laws. The report also frets about data localisation mandates and restrictive satellite policies, straining trade ties further. Washington fears India's regulatory approach is increasingly mirroring China's. If these barriers were removed, US exports could rise by at least $5.3bn annually, according to the White House.",
      "\"The timing couldn't be worse - being in the middle of trade negotiations only deepens our disadvantage. This isn't just about market access; it's the whole package,\" says Mr Dhar. Also, gaining an edge over Vietnam or China won't happen overnight - building opportunities and competitive strength takes time."

      "Economists have warned these levies - and those introduced in response by other countries - could push prices up for American consumers.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.",
      "So which things could become more expensive?",
      "Cars",
      "The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade.",
      "Most analysts estimate that the auto tariffs will add thousands of dollars to the prices of new cars in the US, which reached a record average of $49,738 in December, according to Cox Automotive. As competition for used cars increases, so could the prices paid for them.",
      "Even for cars made in the US, prices will probably rise.",
      "Many US car companies also have operations in Mexico and Canada, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them.",
      "Component parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.",
      "The new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt for now while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties.",
      "Anderson Economic Group has estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by roughly $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle.",
      "Experts say these costs are likely to be passed on to customers, though Trump himself has said he \"couldn't care less\" if that happens as he believes it will encourage Americans to buy American-made cars instead.",

      "Beer, whisky and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "Modelo, and many foreign-made beers, will also be affected by the expanded aluminium tariff which will include canned beers starting on 4 April. Most of the beverage in the US - 64.1% - is poured out of cans, according to the Beer Institute.",
      "Meanwhile, representatives from the American, Canadian, and Mexican spirit industries argued in a joint statement that drinks like bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila, and Canadian whisky \"can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So, given they have to be made in those locations, supplies might be affected, leading to price rises.",
      "Trump has also threatened a 200% tariff on alcohol from the EU, which could make Spanish wine, French champagne, or German beer more expensive for Americans, though it is not clear if this will be carried out.",
      "Houses",
      "The US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs.",
      "Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Imports from the rest of the world could also be affected.",
      "On 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production.",

      "The US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.",

      "\"Everything has to be perfect,\" says the production specialist. \"So many different things can affect other things that can affect the final product in such a massive, massive way.\"",
      "Mr Barrientos works for Varjo, one of a growing number of companies in Finland developing innovations that can assist military forces and governments in preparing for or reacting to conflict.",
      "The Nordic nation, with a population of just five million, has 368 defence tech companies, according to research for Tesi, a state-funded venture capital company, released last September.",
      "Around 40% of these are start-ups and scale-ups, with many growing at rates of 30% to 40% if their tools are dual-use technologies that can also be used in other industries.",
      "Helsinki is now among the top five cities in Europe for defence, security and resilience investments, according to a separate report released in February by tech data platform Dealroom, in collaboration with the Nato Innovation Fund, an independent venture capital fund launched in 2023 with funding from 24 Nato allies.",
      "Varjo says its headsets are being used to provide 80 simulation programmes to Nato forces in the US and Europe.",
      "In simple terms, its products are more advanced versions of the virtual reality headsets used in gaming.",
      "But they combine synthetic artificial content with views of real-world environments.",
      "This \"mixed reality\" experience \"squeezes the training continuum\" for fighter pilots, says the firm's CEO Timo Toikkanen, because they no longer have to travel long distances to complete war simulations in giant aircraft hangers, which are expensive to power and run. \"You can do 99% of the same [training] inside of the headset.\"",
      "The start-up had already attracted heavy investment prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and started working with medical research companies and car manufacturers.",
      "But Mr Toikkanen says the start of the conflict and Finland's admission to Nato a year later \"just kind of put everything on steroids\" in terms of interest in its defence offering.",
      "Since March 2022 the company has raised more than \u20ac50m (\u00a342m; $54m) in additional funding.",
      "Mr Toikkanen says that before the war technologies that could be used by military forces used to be \"kind of a red flag\" for investors concerned about social and environmental responsibilities, and Varjo's executives would \"tiptoe around\" that side of the business when seeking funding.",
      "Now the opposite is now true.",
      "\"Investors are looking for companies that are active in the field of defence technology and it's not frowned upon anymore,\" he explains.",
      "Following President Trump's return to office in January, Mr Toikkanen says there's been a renewed interest in its products from European militaries in the wake of rising geopolitical tensions.",

      "He highlights national surveys which suggest at least 80% of the Finnish population are prepared to fight for their country, and agrees with Mr Nelson that this \"spirit to be ready to defend\" has trickled into start-up and business strategies, and is likely to fuel the sector's continued growth.",
      "Defence tech companies launching in Finland have also been boosted by a strong general tech scene in the country.",
      "Many of the country's tech alumni \u2013 including Mr Toikkanen at Varjo \u2013 honed their skills at Nokia, the former global mobile phone giant which has its roots in Finland.",
      "It ran into financial difficulties following the launch of Apple's iPhone in the mid-2000s, but this encouraged a sizable number of former employees to launch or invest in new companies.",
      "Although not as mature as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Helsinki has spawned a handful of unicorn businesses, worth a billion dollars or more, including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura and game developer Supercell.",
      "There is also strong state support for the defence tech scene. Last year Business Finland, a government agency that promotes investment and innovation, launched a new defence and digital resilience programme which is directing \u20ac120m towards supporting research and development initiatives from small businesses and startups.",
      "\"Our current government\u2026 they are really enforcing this kind of public-private collaboration,\" says the programme's director Kirsi Kokko. \"I think they understand the urgency.\"",
      "Despite the rapid growth of defence tech in Finland, the sector is facing a range of local and European-wide challenges.",
      "Mr Hietala, the founder of airship technology platform Kelluu, describes something of a \"culture clash\" between agile start-ups and large defence companies and governments that have typically required years of experimentation and prototyping before acquiring new technologies.",
      "\"That's really on the opposite side of the spectrum for start-ups, in which the DNA is that we will fail fast and rapidly, and you don't have every start-up succeed.\"",
      "At Business Finland, Ms Kokko says the Nordic nation is also impacted by strong global competition for the software talent needed to grow defence tech and dual use businesses.",
      "But while Finland's compact size and long dark winters might put off some potential recruitments, she hopes the nation's reputation for innovation, flat working hierarchies and low crime levels can attract employees with the right skill sets - alongside its success in the sector so far.",

      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",

      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",

      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Imagine an electric drone mixed with a fixed wing plane - that is the concept behind a new two-seater aircraft being developed by start-up company, Skyfly.",
      "The Axe promises the flexibility of a helicopter but without the cost, noise pollution or carbon emissions.",
      "It is a vertically capable aircraft, or Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, which means it can take off like a helicopter.",
      "It also has two fixed wings that allows it to take off and land from a runway.",
      "The company claims the Axe has a top speed of 100mph, it can carry up to 172kg - approximately the weight of two 13.5st adults - and has a range of 100 miles, about the distance from Oxford to the Isle of Wight.",
      "The team, based near Banbury in Oxfordshire, has taken five years to fine tune the design.",
      "\"Compared to a conventional aircraft it's got eight motors which is very strange,\" says Dr Bill Brooks, Skyfly's chief technical engineer.",
      "\"And it's a tail-first layout called a canard so it's got the tail at the front.  The all up weight is 750kg but 240kg of that are batteries so all the structure is carbon fibre to keep it as light as possible,\" Dr Brooks says.",
      "Safety is an important part of the design too.",
      "'Environmental benefits'",
      "The large wings help it to glide in the event of power failure and there are two motors at the end of each wing so that if one fails the other can compensate.",
      "It is also equipped with an emergency ballistic parachute to bring the aircraft and passengers down safely.",
      "As well as being safer and cleaner than conventional aircraft, Michael Thompson, Skyfly's chief executive, says electric models are significantly quieter too.",
      "\"When you're taking off, you're no longer annoying everyone around you from a noise perspective, so I do think electric propulsion brings not only environmental benefits but from a noise pollution point of view, it's a huge benefit as well,\" he says.",
      "Who is it marketed at?",
      "Other eVTOLs under development include those looking to provide an electric flying-taxi service like Bristol-based Vertical Aerospace (VA) .",
      "VA, as well as Archer and Joby in the US, are designing electric powered aircraft to carry up to four passengers.",
      "Skyfly's Axe, by comparison, is more compact and aimed at the private market.",
      "The do-it-youself kit-plane comes with a price tag of \u00a3250,000.",
      "It is aimed at existing pilots who want to transition away from diesel piston engines.",
      "Jason Pritchard, executive editor of eVTOL Insights, says it is also likely to appeal to flying clubs in order to train new members:",
      "\"The eVTOL aircraft industry is still in its infancy with initial operations a few years away, but it also needs to train large numbers of pilots in the coming years,\" he says.",
      "\"Additionally, the Axe's design can also train pilots with the skills and controls necessary to land an aircraft without power, which is a necessary tool.\"",
      "What about charging infrastructure?",
      "While the Axe can be charged up overnight with a conventional three-pin plug, just like EV cars, electric aircraft will need the charging infrastructure to be scaled up.",
      "Aerovolt, based in West Sussex, has installed rapid chargers at seven UK airports with 40 more in the pipeline.",
      "Its founder, Philip Kingsley-Dobson, says demand is growing.",
      "\"A lot of piston aircraft can't use leaded fuel in the future so they're looking for alternatives and ways we can decarbonise the lower end of aviation,\" he says.",
      "'Cutting edge'",
      "There are no eVTOL aircraft currently permitted to fly in the UK.",
      "Skyfly's Axe has successfully completed manned test flights in both hover and forward flight modes but still needs to be certified by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).",
      "With 40 pre-orders from buyers all over the world, the company hopes to deliver the new model to customers early next year.",
      "A CAA spokesperson said: \"We are working with innovators to test and fly brand new forms of aviation that keeps the UK at the cutting edge of flight technology and supports the sector to grow.",

      "The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan.",
      "What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades.",
      "And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy.",
      "The great free trade debate",
      "Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.",
      "Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.",
      "Follow live: US tariffs have global leaders scrambling",
      "The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it \"great\" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax.",
      "On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.",
      "There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations.",
      "Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely.",
      "Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.",
      "But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board.",
      "The rationale behind 'reciprocal' tariffs",
      "It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.",
      "The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports.",
      "In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. \"These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers\u2026 The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\"",
      "This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition \"cheating\" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance.",
      "This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method.",
      "The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data.",
      "While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing.",
      "There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.",
      "The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (\u00a3216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech.",
      "Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations.",
      "'China shock' and the ripple effect",
      "There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\".",
      "That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world.",
      "For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term \"China shock\".",
      "In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy.",
      "Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of \"comparative advantage\". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down.",
      "Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia.",
      "Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this \"China shock\" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south.",
      "The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent.",
      "Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",
      "The influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House.",
      "So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president's clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this.",
      "But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics.",
      "The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere.",
      "The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices.",
      "The first social media trade war",
      "Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich.",
      "The world's consumers have choices.",
      "It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem.",
      "Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers.",
      "Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla's sale slump and Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff.",
      "These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US.",
      "The president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario.",
      "In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist.",
      "This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US.",
      "Perhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs.",
      "For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.",

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer watched in his flat. Chancellor Rachel Reeves saw it in her study. The Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, accompanied by staff and pizza, took in President Donald Trump's big tariffs reveal on Wednesday from his office in Old Admiralty Arch, from where the British Navy was directed to protect and control trade on the high seas in days gone by.",
      "Ministers can only dream of having that kind of power now, as the UK watches on in growing horror at the bust-up between the US and China.",
      "\"Sometimes people don't realise they are living through a moment of history,\" a cabinet minister notes, as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping square up to each other, and stock markets plunge. Trump has slapped a 10% tariff on all nations \u2013 including the UK \u2013 for imports into the US, and much higher rates on some countries, including China, which has responded with fresh tariffs of its own.",
      "So what's happening in Whitehall right now to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?",
      "Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be?",
      "China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down",
      "The PM is spending another dramatic weekend working the phones from the peace of his country pad, Chequers. So far, the other calls that could really matter, from US negotiators, have not yet resumed.",
      "Trump dangled a possible trade deal that might exempt the UK from some of the costs from tariffs during the pair's chummy White House press conference in February. There have been significant negotiations since then by a team of around 20, led out of No 10 by Michael Ellam, the Treasury and banking veteran, and the PM's business adviser Varun Chandra alongside the business secretary.",
      "Those talks included ideas about the UK watering down rules on electric vehicles, possible changes to a tax on tech companies (\"space to talk about it\", one minister says) and changes to online safety rules (\"not happening\", says a government source).",
      "But as the US government prepared for its announcements on Wednesday, talks about a deal ground to a halt. Now, after the announcement, the \"ball is in their court\", said one government source involved, waiting to hear if, in the chaos of Trump's new tariff world, the White House can find time and energy to push a deal with the UK.",
      "\"We're expecting to hear from them any moment,\" one of those involved hopes. The risk, in the visible turmoil, is that any economic agreement could become a case of: don't call us, we'll call you. We'll be asking Darren Jones, the Treasury Minister, about it when he join us in the studio tomorrow.",
      "If a deal is done, however, do not expect an all-singing all-dancing arrangement. Instead, \"it would be a basic agreement on principles \u2013 rather than a super detailed trade agreement\", says a government source, contrasting these \"quick and dirty\" moves to long-running negotiations with India (\"we're on our 15th chapter with them!\").",
      "Uncertainty around the talks, and the limited nature of what a deal could achieve in any case, means No 10 is \"not sitting here waiting for it \u2013 it's not the basket where all our eggs are\".",
      "For weeks the government told us they were preparing for all kinds of scenarios. A secret cabinet committee was considering how the UK might react if Trump's tariffs materialised.",
      "But now they are here, the actual response is\u2026 not to respond, and to spend four weeks asking businesses if they would like the government to respond later on. That is not just Whitehall dither: at this stage, there seems to be almost zero appetite among ministers to join in with the rounds of tariffs between the US, China, and perhaps the EU in coming days.",
      "One Whitehall figure working with business says \"there has not been a single voice in business, big or small, saying this is the wrong strategy\".",
      "Ministers' approach to get businesses on board, like when Sir Keir invited dozens of big wigs to No 10 the morning after Trump's tariff announcement, is in part because of the anger when the government increased National Insurance contributions. \"The really calm reaction,\" one source says, \"is because we got people into the headspace where tariffs were going to happen \u2013 one of the businesses said they were being borderline stalked, we've been trying to persuade business to trust the process.\"",
      "The government is in no rush, and has no enthusiasm to introduce its own new tariffs, and for now at least, demands on them to do so are muted. According to a minister: \"Most people have considerable numbers of jobs in their constituencies on the line \u2013 even in cabinet there might have been some question marks but there weren't this week.\"",
      "And they joke that the Lib Dems, who are calling for tariffs in retaliation, \"keep demanding a trade war but I don't think they'll lead the nation\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who also does not want extra tariffs, will be on tomorrow's show too.",
      "But just as the government is going slow on hitting back, they are cracking heads to crack on with their existing plans faster.",
      "This isn't all about Trump. I understand the chancellor is looking at whether any of the money announced in the government's vital Spending Review can be brought forward from June. If government departments are able to finalise their deals, can that be sorted and made public as soon as possible?",
      "There are discussions too about whether it's possible to speed up the long waited-for Industrial Strategy \u2013 a plan to get investment into the UK pencilled in for June, but could it be brought forward? A decision hasn't been made but the prime minister is again, his team indicate, trying to use the jeopardy around the world as an impetus to push the government machine harder. \"We have to run quickly towards this,\" a government source says \u2013 and the chancellor is looking at it this weekend.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "You might feel, haven't I heard this before? You'd be right. Since the start of the year, the prime minister and the chancellor have both repeatedly said the government has to go faster, work harder. So why after years in opposition weren't Starmer's team ready to go with all of these changes when they got into office? For a government that promised to be radical, its plans have not always been forthcoming.",
      "You may not fancy the kind of radicalism we're seeing out of the White House, but radical it certainly is. To compete, the UK may need to be that too.",
      "It is ludicrous to imagine the PM is \"very happy\" that the UK has been hit with tariffs as Trump suggested \u2013 \"artistic licence\", a government source remarked. No British action can completely insulate our economy from disruption abroad. But the government's own actions do matter, and this could be a defining moment.",
      "While there's been no lack of trying to soften the blows for the UK, the government's hopes have been dashed already. First, ministers believed the UK could escape tariffs, then they said they were prepared in case, then disappointed when they arrived.",
      "As Sir Keir spends another weekend on the phone, and his officials wait for their phone to ring, the government doesn't know what it will be able to say next.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",

      "Sir James Eadie, the First Treasury Counsel, told the court there was no obligation for the government to subsidise private education in any way.",
      "The main objective of the VAT policy is to raise additional tax revenue to invest in public services, \"including the state education system\", the government argued.",
      "It consulted extensively on the policy design, \"weighing the pros and cons\" of possible exemptions for small faith schools, international schools and children with special education needs.",
      "They also looked at whether introducing it in September 2025, rather than January 2025, would be more appropriate, the court was told.",

      "The government plans to spend the money raised on more teachers for state schools in England.",
      "But a legal challenge to the policy has been taken to the High Court, with some families and schools claiming it is discriminatory and in breach of human rights laws.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods or services and the standard rate is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education.",
      "Private school fees are liable for 20% VAT from 1 January.",
      "About half of England's private schools are also charities, so receive an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "Separate legislation will be introduced to remove this tax relief, but plans to remove private schools' charitable status have been dropped.",
      "Why was the VAT policy challenged in court?",
      "The legal challenge was brought by three groups: the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,400 private schools, a smaller group of Christian faith schools, and the parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They argued that the policy goes against the legal right to an education.",
      "They also claim the policy is discriminatory, as those families attending low-paying faith schools, or with children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) who do not have an education, health and care plan (EHCP), say their needs \"cannot be adequately met in the state sector\".",
      "But the government said the main objective of the VAT policy is to raise additional tax revenue so they can raise standards for the 94% of children who attend state schools.",
      "Their lawyers argued that those who wish to opt out of \"the system of universally accessible, state-funded education\" are free to choose any private education for their child that they can afford, or to educate their child at home.",
      "If the legal challenge is successful, the government could consider whether it would amend the policy, but it would be under no obligation to do so.",
      "How will the extra money be spent?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",

      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "In October's Budget, the government allocated different sources of funding to address other issues in schools, like crumbling buildings and a stretched system for pupils with special educational needs.",
      "How much do private schools cost?",

      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Will private school fees go up for everyone?",
      "Applying VAT does not necessarily mean fees will go up by 20%. Some private schools may decide to put up their fees more than others.",
      "On average, the government expects fees to increase by around 10%.",
      "The average cost of private school fees has risen by 55% since 2003, even without VAT, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tanks says.",

      "What could the tax change mean for state schools?",
      "The government does not expect a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "It estimates that around 37,000 students will move to the state sector over the long term, but believes class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which says it would be possible for the state sector to \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",

It is 8.30am and she looks a little tired \u2013 she runs several businesses, a foundation and is currently pregnant with her fifth child, though she and her husband Malcolm plan to have more.",
      "\"At least seven,\" she declares, \"and as many as I can physically carry - 12 would be even more brilliant.\"",
      "The US couple, aged 37 and 38, ardently believe that the world needs to have more babies or risk civilisational collapse. They have become the poster children for pronatalism, a movement that believes falling birth rates are a big problem for society. And that big families are the answer.",
      "For the last five years, they have spread the word about their goal by opening up their home for interviews and photoshoots. They claim to have used special technology, during the IVF process, to screen their embryos for traits such as intelligence.",
      "\"The studies let us know what our genetic predilection for IQ is,\" they told an undercover reporter in 2023. \"We will never choose a child who is less privileged in IQ than either of us.\"",
      "Speaking today, however, Malcolm admits, \"The easiest way to [spread the word about pronatalism] was to turn ourselves into a meme... If we take a reasonable approach to things and say things are nuanced, nobody engages. And then we go and say something outrageous and offensive and everyone's into it.\"",
      "But since Donald Trump was sworn in as US President for the second time earlier this year, they have taken their evangelising to a new level. The Collinses now see certain people in the White House as potential allies - and they fully intend to capitalise on that.",
      "Elon Musk, who is said to have fathered 14 children, has called fertility decline \"the biggest danger civilisation faces, by far\". He has donated $10m (\u00a37.75m) to the Population Wellbeing Initiative in Texas, which conducts research into fertility, parenting, and the future of population growth.",
      "The US Vice President JD Vance has also spoken openly about his views on procreation. At an anti-abortion rally in January he declared: \"I want more babies in the United States of America.\"",
      "There are early indications that the Trump administration is prioritising family too. On 18 February, Trump signed an executive order to improve access for IVF that recognised \"the importance of family formation and that our nation's public policy must make it easier for loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children\".",
      "Pronatalists are buoyed by this and many hope it is a sign of things to come.",
      "The facts of fertility decline are clear. The US is at a record low of 1.62 children per woman, and by the end of the century the UN projects a majority of countries will have a shrinking population. That will have a profound effect on society and our economies. Some people believe we can adapt over time to this new reality, but pronatalists are less sanguine.",
      "But there is a political element to the movement too. Pronatalists are almost exclusively from the political right. Malcolm and Simone Collins, for example, describe themselves as former liberals who became disillusioned with progressive, \"woke\" politics.",
      "They see themselves as pragmatic and profoundly anti-bureaucratic.",
      "\"We are a coalition of people who are incredibly different in our philosophies, our theological beliefs, our family structures,\" says Malcolm. \"But the one thing we agree on is that our core enemy is the urban monoculture; the leftist unifying culture.\"",

      "The conference brings together two strands in pronatalism that come from very different branches of the American right: both conservative Christians and members of the so-called 'tech right,' an ascendant wing that came out of the libertarian, start-up culture of Silicon Valley.",
      "Some are connected to the current US government. Michael Anton was appointed by Trump as the Director of Policy Planning at the State Department. He spoke at last year's conference.",
      "Other speakers at this year's conference included Carl Benjamin, who has links to far-right activist Tommy Robinson, and Charles Cornish-Dale, an influencer who goes by the name Raw Egg Nationalist.",
      "\"It's like an unholy alliance,\" says Catherine Pakaluk, an economist, mother of eight and stepmother of six. She too spoke at the conference but is reluctant to call herself a pronatalist. \"It's a complicated movement and includes people with very different positions,\" she says.",
      "One thing they have in common, however, is that they all want their message to be heard at the highest levels of government.",
      "Some believe they already are being heard. \"[If you ask me] do we have pronatalists in the White House right now who are pushing policy,\" says Malcolm, \"my response to this would be, 'I mean, duh, like Elon and JD Vance'.\"",
      "In President Trump's executive orders to date, there has been little apart from the order on IVF that could be seen as directly pro-family. But pronatalist thinking may be starting to influence policy that is less explicitly about fertility.",

      "Roger Severino, Vice-President of Domestic Policy at right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation, sees the influence of JD Vance in that policy. \"Vance comes at it from a long history of pro-family thinking and policymaking,\" he says.",
      "Vance has often spoken about the need to fix a \"broken culture\" that is tearing the US family apart, by undermining men.",

      "This idea has been echoed in pronatalist circles.",

      "Malcolm says he has already made attempts to influence the White House. He claims to have engaged in \"backroom channelling of influential people, making sure that pronatalism became normal to talk about within the centres of power, and that ended up dripping its way up to administration and core tech culture\".",
      "They are in discussions on pronatalist policy with the Heritage Foundation. Then there is a rather more direct approach they claim to have taken. \"We have submitted draft executive orders to the Trump administration,\" says Simone.",

      "Their connection to power is thanks to the so-called tech right, a reactionary movement against liberalism led by some of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley. Those in the tech right include Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel \u2013 who sponsored Vance's Senate race and has invested in fertility technology \u2013 and venture capitalists David Sacks and Marc Andreessen.",
      "Simone Collins was formerly the managing director of an exclusive members' club run by Mr Thiel, and the couple say they ran two other invite-only networking groups for business elites. Their Pronatalist Foundation, founded in 2021, received just under $500,000 (\u00a3387,000) through a fund of the Skype co-founder, Estonian billionaire Jann Tallinn.",

      "One of those most divisive issues in pronatalism are the mention of certain aspects related to genetics among some of its tech right proponents. It's something that has prompted concern, in particular around the ethics of this, on all sides of the political spectrum.",
      "Patrick T Brown, a fellow at the right-leaning American Ethics and Public Policy Centre working on pro-family policy, suggests that the executive order to improve access to IVF could show the influence of the tech-right on policy. But he has his concerns about that influence, particularly around embryo screening. \"Turning children into consumer products is something that I really worry about,\" he says. \"That leads to a troublesome place.\"",
      "Some of those attending the recent conference describe themselves as \"race realists\", and one has published offensive views alleging a link between intelligence and race that, according to many scientists, are plain wrong.",
      "Geneticist Adam Rutherford describes the data used as \"fraudulent and racist, drawn from hopeless sample sizes that wouldn't constitute valid scientific evidence to anyone vaguely interested in truth.",
      "\"These assertions are recapitulations of historical ideas of scientific racism.\"",
      "The associations with extreme views in the movement is one of the reasons some people don't like to call themselves pronatalists. Catherine Pakaluk is one of them. \"I think there probably are some people who are just pure eugenicists or white supremacists,\" she says.",

      "The question that remains is, where does all of this leave pronatalists - and just how much power do they wield?",
      "According to some onlookers, their impact is already being felt. \"There's definitely strong influence from pronatalists in the Trump White House,\" claims Ms Cohen. \"I think an outstanding question is how this will all overlap with efforts to restrict birth control and contraception, and how this will affect debates around spending like on childcare funding.\"",
      "Mr Carney is more circumspect: \"Vance is very pro-family and very pronatalist, and he wants the government to promote families and to help drive up the birth rate - but JD Vance is not the president. I don't think Donald Trump has firm conviction on this.\"",
      "He also believes there might be resistance to some pro-family policies, pointing out that at least some of the Republicans in control of Congress don't like the idea of family support. \"They think that it's welfare to the undeserving.\"",
      "The attention gleaned by the Collinses, and by the recent conference, is undoubtable. But one expert suggests they are doing little more than stirring up controversy.",
      "\"If you go to Capitol Hill, and talk to members of Congress or governors in states across America, they don't necessarily even recognise the problem,\" argues Mr Brown.",
      "As he puts it, \"the incentives of the internet\" aren't always the incentives of a successful mass movement. \"And what gets attention is provocation and being edgy and crossing the line. That gets clicks, that gets followers.",

      "How much is the minimum wage increasing by?",
      "1. Shop around",
      "For some services you can often get a better deal simply by calling the company you are with and saying you are considering leaving.",
      "\"Shop around for better deals, and haggle with your existing provider,\" says Alice Haine, from professional services group Evelyn Partners.",
      "\"It's always worth haggling. Haggle for everything.\"",
      "That applies to a whole range of bills, including insurance, energy, and broadband.",
      "\"Our research shows that switching providers if you're out of contract can slash broadband, pay TV and mobile bills by up to \u00a3235,\" says Emily Seymour, from consumer group Which?",
      "Gas and electricity are often the biggest bills people face and the price cap set by the regulator is rising by 6%, so it is worth finding the best deal for you.",
      "That may include choosing a fixed rate deal, says Ms Seymour. If you charge an electric vehicle or use appliances overnight, look for a deal with a cheaper night tariff.",
      "\"We'd also recommend taking a meter reading as close to 31 March as possible to ensure you're billed the correct amount for your energy usage,\" she says.",
      "2. Cut back",
      "One surefire way to keep your bills down is to reduce what you use.",
      "Taking shorter showers and putting in a showerhead with a slower flow will save money on your water and energy bills.",
      "\"You have to treat water as an expensive resource,\" Ms Haine says.",
      "Getting a water meter fitted may save you money, she adds.",
      "Smart meters for electricity and gas can also help you keep tabs on what is pushing up your energy bills most, the Energy Saving Trust says.",
      "The trust advises draught-proofing your home, including round floorboards, pipework and old extractor fans, and setting the thermostat to the lowest comfortable temperature. For most people, it says, that is between 18\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C.",
      "MoneySavingExpert says you can save money by using the principle: \"heat the human, not the home\". Using hot water bottles and electric blankets should work out cheaper than turning up the radiators.",
      "You can also change the settings on combi or conventional boilers to save money, says Martin Lewis at MoneySavingExpert.",
      "When it comes to transport bills, you can't avoid the vehicle tax rise unless you ditch the car altogether.",
      "But if you are taking the train it is also worth checking whether a railcard will help, points out Ms Seymour.",
      "\"To cut costs on rail fares, we'd recommend booking tickets in advance and splitting fares where possible,\" she says.",
      "3. Get help",
      "If you are struggling to pay your household bills, don't panic, says Richard Lane, chief client officer at the StepChange Debt Charity. He suggests creating a detailed budget that captures all your income and expenditure.",
      "\"This will allow you to get a clear picture of your finances and see how much you have leftover to pay toward any debts or make savings,\" he says.",
      "Then check what support you are entitled to.",
      "Water companies offer lower \"social\" and hardship tariffs for people on very low incomes, so it is worth calling your provider. People claiming benefits can often also get lower tariffs for broadband.",
      "\"These organisations have a regulatory responsibility to treat customers fairly and will be able to offer you tailored support,\" Mr Lane added.",
      "There is the government's Warm Home Discount, for people with high energy costs on a very low income, including Pension Credit. And people on low incomes are also eligible for a reduction in council tax.",
      "Check if you qualify for a free TV licence. If you are over 75 and on Pension Credit or live with someone who is, then you will.",
      "You may also be able to boost your income. Check which benefits you are entitled to on the independent MoneyHelper website, backed by the government, or using benefits calculators run by Policy in Practice and charities Entitledto and Turn2us.",
      "If you are struggling with debt here are some other organisations that may be able to help."

    "summary": "Sir Sam Mendes' forthcoming Beatles biopics have cast four modern-day heartthrobs - here's why.",
    "story": [
      "The Fab Four came together on stage this week for an all-star Beatles announcement that left some of the internet swooning.",
      "No, Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr aren't reuniting through AI for a joint album with Taylor Swift.",
      "Instead, the 60s rock 'n' roll icons will be played by four leading heartthrobs of the moment: Paul Mescal (McCartney), Harris Dickinson (Lennon), Joseph Quinn (Harrison) and Barry Keoghan (Starr), in a big-screen quadrilogy directed by Sir Sam Mendes - all set for release in 2028.",
      "Each actor fits the mould of \"the internet's boyfriends\" - a term defined by Glamour magazine as \"a famous or semi-famous male person whom your entire Twitter feed has a crush on at the same time\".",
      "When Sir Sam walked out on stage with his \"band\" at Las Vegas' CinemaCon on Tuesday, the message was clear.",
      "If 1960s Beatlemania was defined by teenage girls fainting and screaming, the plan now is arguably to get Gen Z - in internet parlance  - \"screaming, crying, throwing up\" from behind their phone screens in excitement.",
      "\"Each star brings their own brand of modern-day hysteria,\" says The Standard's celebrity correspondent Lisa McLoughlin, \"the kind fuelled by social media virality and fan video edits\".",
      "This is particularly true of Mescal, whose \"popularity mirrors a smidge the frenzy the Beatles once sparked\".",
      "After shooting to fame in 2020's BBC adaptation of Normal People, the Irishman scored an Oscar nomination as a tormented father in Aftersun, before finding blockbuster status in Gladiator II - rising from indie heartbreaker to Hollywood heartthrob.",
      "Similar is true of fellow Irishman Keoghan. Also Oscar-nominated for Banshees of Inisherin, he embraced rugged sex symbol status in last year's cult hit Saltburn.",
      "Dickinson and Quinn are earlier in their trajectory, but still burning bright - the former recently starring alongside Nicole Kidman in erotic thriller Babygirl and the latter turning heads in Netflix's Stranger Things.",
      "McLoughlin describes the casting as \"logical and predictable\" - a strategic move as the band look to secure their legacy with a new generation, while studios grapple with the ambition of luring streaming era, post-Covid, audiences back to the cinema not once, but four times in close proximity.",
      "A day in the life?",
      "The timing and scope of the project sums up the Beatles' unique heritage as the best-selling band of all-time - the catalyst for shifting youth culture and the boundaries of pop.",
      "It's been 56 years since all four members last recorded together. Lennon was shot dead just over a decade later at 40, while Harrison died of cancer in 2001, aged 58. The two surviving Beatles, Sir Paul and Sir Ringo, are now into their 80s.",
      "And yet, as the band's only official biographer Hunter Davies told Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday: \"The strange thing about the Beatles is that the longer we get from them, the bigger they become\".",
      "Recent years have seen Sir Paul seemingly work to bookend the Beatles' music - becoming Glastonbury's oldest ever headliner at 80, before driving the 2023 release of Now and Then, a \"final\" Beatles track rebuilt from Lennon's demo vocals. It became the band's 18th UK number one single, over five decades from their last, and won a Grammy.",
      "The forthcoming biopics appear to be a way of continuing this on the big screen.",
      "Four years on from Peter Jackson's sprawling Get Back docuseries, this is the first time that all four band members and their estates have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film.",
      "The casting reflects the distinct identities and histories of the members, each offering something different to lovelorn girls and copycat boys so intoxicated by Beatlemania.",
      "McLoughlin feels the choices \"make commercial sense\" as the perfect foil for an audience now two generations removed from the original Beatlemania.",
      "\"They all have dedicated younger fan bases (many of whom may not be regular cinema-goers or deeply connected to the Beatles), acting credibility and experience leading or co-leading major productions\".",
      "Each film will focus on an individual member of the band. \"They intersect in different ways - sometimes overlapping, sometimes not,\" Sir Sam explained.",
      "\"They're four very different human beings. Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply.\"",
      "'Binge cinema'",
      "The Barbenheimer phenomenon of summer 2023 highlighted the increasing influence online audience reactions hold on cultural currency.",
      "It also turbocharged Hollywood's acceptance of \"event cinema\" as a way to lure younger audiences. A generation that Warner Bros Discovery's executive director Vera Chien previously told Forbes, already see the streaming-social media relationship as the norm.",
      "Sir Sam's four-film schedule plays into this. It's aimed at creating what Sony executive Tom Rothman described as \"the first bingeable theatrical experience\".",
      "\"Frankly, we need big cinematic events to get people out of the house,\" Sir Sam said.",
      "Films can now develop distinct digital identities through audience projection, as seen by the viral success of Saltburn.",
      "The makers of the Beatles biopics are arguably betting on its cast of \"internet boyfriends\" pulling younger audiences - without the same nostalgic attachment to the Beatles - engaged on social media and, executives hope, looking up from phone screen to big screen.",
      "The extent to which musical performances will feature is unknown.",
      "But the Beatle biopics could capitalise on the booming money-spinning genre that's found awards success over the past decade. .",
      "It's also proven fertile heartthrob ground, with the Beatles cast following Jacob Elordi and Austin Butler's turns as Elvis, alongside Timothee Chalamet's Oscar-nominated take as Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "Still, there are risks, says Dade Hayes, business writer at Deadline and co-author of Binge Times.",
      "He says that whilst he commends Rothman's \"clever handle\" and the cinephile in him values the biopics' \"bold statement about the value of cinemas and communal viewing,\" market realities present cautionary signs.",
      "First, the UK box office is yet to fully bounce back from the pandemic, whilst US takings are more than 20% below pre-Covid levels. \"If people aren't dying to return at regular intervals to cinemas,\" says Hayes, \"then you are holding an expensive set of assets that are hard to monetise\".",
      "And a multi-release strategy relies on the \"fuse being lit with the first instalment\", Hayes says.",
      "He points to Kevin Costner's Horizon films, originally envisioned as a multi-part theatrical franchise, only to flounder once the first instalment tanked, as an example of the dangers.",
      "For McLoughlin, the three-year gap between the casting announcement and 2028 release date adds further risk, especially in the fast-moving online space where fanbases can shift.",
      "Liverpool walking alone",
      "But beyond industry dynamics there's also a cast talking point much closer to home.",
      "The Beatles biopics, celebrating four Scouse lads who conquered the world and put Liverpool on the map, will not feature any local talent in the lead roles.",
      "As one Liverpudlian put it in a TikTok video liked over 200,000 times: \"I love Mescal as much as the next gal but [the lack of representation] is breaking my heart\".",
      "McLoughlin agrees, pointing out that James Corden last week urged the TV industry to be \"bolder\" and back ideas that \"might scare you a little.\" She feels film studios should do the same.",
      "\"The Beatles themselves were unknown until they weren't,\" she says. \"This could have been a chance for a newcomer to have their own Beatles moment - rising from obscurity in real-time\".",
      "And perhaps the biggest missed opportunity of all McLoughlin adds, is the failure to put Liverpudlian actors front and centre in a Beatles biopic. \"The band is Liverpool's greatest cultural export, yet the city's deep talent pool was completely overlooked,\" she adds.",
      "Social media, meanwhile, is already awash with doubt over Keoghan's ability to deliver a consistent Scouse accent, questioning his attempts in Saltburn.",
      "Still, as Hunter Davies put it, the Beatles have long been more than just a local band. They keep growing.",
      "Way back in 1966, Lennon infamously described them as bigger than Jesus. Over five decades on, the studio behind the four films - and perhaps cinema in general - is no doubt banking on a Beatlemania revival."

    "published": "Sun, 06 Apr 2025 00:18:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Two homeowners had very different experiences when the elusive artist chose their walls for his work.",
    "story": [
      "Sam was lying in bed one morning when her tenant in a house she owned in Margate sent her a photo of a piece of graffiti that had appeared on the wall outside.",
      "Astonishingly, it looked like a Banksy. It would turn out to be perhaps the graffiti artist's most interesting new artwork of recent years,\u202fValentine's Day Mascara (pictured above), which was revealed in Margate on Valentine's Day, 2023.",
      "Bamboozled, Sam googled: what do you do when you wake up with a Banksy on your wall?",
      "\"What did Google say about that?\" I asked her.",
      "\"Nothing! And I was like, I need to contact the council, I need to find an art gallery who can advise me.\"",
      "Sam called Julian Usher at Red Eight Gallery. Julian's team, conscious that new Banksys are under immediate threat from street cleaners, the weather, rival graffiti artists and other art dealers, promised he'd be in Margate within the hour: \"We knew we had to get the piece covered,\" say Julian.",
      "And there was another reason Julian got to Margate double-quick: if Banksy chooses your wall for one of his drawings, you could be seriously in the money.",
      "For the second season of my BBC Radio 4 podcast The Banksy Story, which is called When Banksy Comes To Town, I've been following the very different fates of two sets of homeowners who wake up one day to find a Banksy on their wall. The season shows just how important his graffiti becomes for a local community \u2013 and why people disagree so vehemently about what should happen after it's discovered.",
      "Sam became the custodian of\u202fValentine's Day Mascara, which speaks to the theme of domestic violence, incidents of which usually spike each Valentine's Day. It's a complicated bit of work. A peppy 50s housewife with a black eye has bludgeoned her partner. A real pan with flecks of red is at her feet, and his painted legs are upended into the real fridge-freezer that Banksy left by the wall. A broken plastic chair testifies to the fight they have had.",
      "Later on the day it appeared, refuse collectors arrived to spirit away the fridge-freezer. This precipitated a free-for-all, with the public helping themselves to the remnants. It was mayhem.",
      "A media scrum, a wrong-footed local council, millions of global onlookers. Exactly, one suspects, what Banksy wanted.",
      "And this time, just for laughs, he left behind oil painter Peter Brown, commissioned to capture the scenes he would miss. I spoke to Pete \"The Street\" Brown for my series. \"The whole reason I was employed was because Banksy was questioning what was the art about,\" Pete explained. \"Is it about the graffiti? Or is it about the reaction afterwards, and what happens to it?\"",
      "As luck would have it, Pete was captured on video just as Banksy's team were putting the finishing touches to Valentine's Day Mascara \u2013 a video that The Banksy Story managed to obtain. In it we can see that one of Banksy's team let a local kid play with their drone.",
      "\"They're in the process of putting a large piece on a wall and yet they're taking the time to teach a kid how to fly a drone,\" says Steph Warren, who used to work with Banksy and who appeared in my first series - about the artist's rise and rise. \"Very sweet!\"",
      "Alongside Sam, I've been following the story of Gert and Gary. They, like Sam, did not want me to use their last name. A 30ft-high seagull appeared one morning on the wall of their buy-to-let in Lowestoft in Suffolk. The bird needed to be massive for Banksy's ambitious visual gag to work. The artist had shoved large yellow insulation strips into a skip that now looked like a fast-food container that the seagull divebombed to steal chips.",
      "Banksy had chosen his wall well. Visitors arriving by train were treated to this witty meditation on the scourge of Britain's seaside towns, equal parts warning and celebration. The\u202fLowestoft Seagull\u202fwas part of Banksy's\u202fGreat British Staycation, his post-Covid lockdown campaign to cheer us all up at the prospect of a summer holiday spent in the UK.",
      "But Gert was not cheered-up at all. \"It's not a seagull, it's an albatross!\" she quipped when I went to interview her.",
      "\"How did you know it was a Banksy?\" I asked.",
      "\"There was scaffolding erected on the side of the house. I tried to find out if it was a particular scaffolding firm, but there was no phone number,\" Gert replied. \"On the Monday morning the letting agency informed me that I could possibly have a Banksy. By then the scaffolding had gone and this seagull appeared.\"",
      "This fits with what we know of Banksy's modus operandi. He claims hiding in plain sight is the best way to remain invisible. \"If questioned about your legitimacy,\" he wrote in his book Wall & Piece, \"simply complain about the hourly rate.\"",
      "What do we know about Banksy?",
      "Nine days of Banksy, but what do the works mean?",
      "It's a good gag. But how fun is it for the folk on the other end of his spray can?",
      "I found that with good hustling skills a Banksied homeowner might see their bank balance expanded, but it's not an easy process.",
      "As Gert explains, exasperated, \"Lowestoft people commented that it belongs to Lowestoft\u2026 But nobody's turned up to say, 'we'll help you protect it'. It doesn't belong to the person filming it, or the person taking pictures with their children. The problem is mine!\"",
      "Gert had to contend with people putting their children into the skip for photo opportunities, the council trying to charge her for Perspex screens, and the threat of a Preservation Order which might have cost her \u00a340,000 a year.",
      "And the two stories I've been following have ended up having entirely different outcomes.",
      "Both artworks have been taken off the houses they were painted on \u2013 a complex, expensive operation that uses specialist equipment \u2013 so they can be sold. But while the Banksy in Margate is now on the verge of selling for well over \u00a31m, with a sizeable chunk set to go to a domestic violence charity, and with the piece remaining in the town for the foreseeable future, the Banksy up the coast in Lowestoft languishes in a climate-controlled warehouse, costing its owners \u00a33,000 per month.",
      "It has cost Gert and her partner Gary around \u00a3450,000 so far to preserve the piece and although there are buyers sniffing around, nobody has bought it yet. Speaking about the situation, Gary told me: \"I'm so angry at what's going on.\"",
      "Not everyone approves of people trying to sell Banksy's street art.",
      "Steph Warren \u2013 who starred in the first series of The Banksy Story\u202fas the only person ever to work for Banksy without signing his non-disclosure agreement \u2013 suggests that worried homeowners should simply \"get busy with five litres of white emulsion and paint it out\".",
      "Owner of street-art gallery Stelladore in St Leonards, Warren is a purist, who feels that art made for the street should remain there, no matter its value. \"With Banksy, where he puts the art is fundamental,\" she says. \"Remove the work from the precise place on the streets that he put it, and the work instantly loses its power. Context is everything.\"",
      "But Banksy has elevated graffiti into a new art form, now monetised \u2013 street art. Banksy's signed prints can sell for six-figure sums. Graffiti, or street art, has not just come of age, it is now an asset class. Given this, how can any homeowner feel okay about scrubbing away a Banksy without feeling as if they have smashed a Ming vase?",
      "One thing I know for sure: if you wake up with a Banksy on your wall, you'll have to make a series of clever decisions to come out of it unscathed. As Sam says, after two years of dealing with the Banksy circus, \"going back to normal life now is going to be terribly boring\".",

    "summary": "The singer has won thousands of new fans on the Sabrina Carpenter tour, seven years into her career.",
    "story": [
      "When Rachel Chinouriri played London's O2 Arena last month, she cried.",
      "The new wave indie songwriter was there as the support act for Sabrina Carpenter, just a week after her first Brit Awards, where she was nominated for artist of the year.",
      "Seven years after her debut single, those milestones felt like a validation.",
      "No wonder she shed a tear.",
      "\"A lot of it was stress relief,\" says the 26-year-old, \"but I also felt strangely at home.",
      "\"I was just like, 'Wow, is this my life'.\"",
      "Chinouriri was booked for the tour after Carpenter fell in love with her song All I Ever Asked and started playing it as her walk-on music in the US.",
      "We speak on the 14th date, as she prepares to play Assago, Italy. By this point, she's having a blast \u2013 bounding across the catwalk every night, and dropping to her knees between songs to talk to the audience at eye level.",
      "But she admits the first couple of shows were \"slightly rough\".",
      "\"I filmed Graham Norton for the first time on Friday, then it was the Brit Awards on Saturday. The tour started in Dublin on Monday, and I had to film a music video on my day off.\"",
      "\"I was having a lot of first time experiences and trying to figure out what I was comfortable with on the road,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd say from show five, I was starting to enjoy myself.\"",
      "If there were nerves, they didn't show.",
      "The singer's infectious energy and knotty pop-rock songs have been picking up new fans in every city. One reviewer called her set \"the perfect sweet treat before the main feast\". At the end of March, she surpassed 4 million monthly listeners on Spotify for the first time. Adele sent her a bouquet of roses.",
      "Rachel Chinouriri is officially having a moment - but it hasn't come quickly.",
      "A former Brit School student, she released her first single, So My Darling, in 2018, and spent the next few years honing her sound.",
      "The 2019 EP Mama's Boy was a mellow blend of soulful pop, while 2021's Four\u00b0 In Winter was full of atmospheric electronic soundscapes.",
      "Underneath it all, though, Chinouriri was an indie kid. Raised in Croydon by strict Zimbabwean parents, she'd only been allowed to listen to Christian music at home. When they went out, the singer and her siblings would blast out hits by Coldplay, MIA, Lily Allen and Daughter.",
      "Once she incorporated those sounds to her music, Chinouriri's career took off. All I Ever Asked \u2013 a chirpy rock anthem that disguises a desperately sad story about being undervalued \u2013 won her support slots with Lewis Capaldi and Louis Tomlinson.",
      "Florence Pugh declared herself a fan, and ended up starring in the video for Never Need Me, a killer kiss-off to a boyfriend who left her dangling.",
      "For a musician who'd suffered crippling anxiety as a teenager (\"I was pulling my hair out, and having panic attacks\") the success was entirely unexpected.",
      "\"British culture is quite self-deprecating,\" she says, \"so when I was younger, I just didn't believe I could do these things.",
      "\"Even the fact I can say I'm a two-time Brit nominee is still quite surreal. Then I'm like, Why is it surreal?",
      "\"I do deserve it because I've been making music since I was 16, and I haven't stopped'.\"",
      "Chinouriri's debut album, the noughties-flavoured What A Devastating Turn Of Events, was finally released last May.",
      "Initially charting at number 17, it has continued to sell steadily, thanks to the continued popularity of All I Ever Asked on TiKTok, as well as Chinouriri's scene-stealing festival performances.",
      "Reflecting on her rise, she says there is a \"privilege to having a slow-paced career\".",
      "\"I've seen what happens when you skyrocket or go viral. If I'd a massive hit song when I was 21, I wouldn't have been ready in any way, shape or form \u2013 mentally or professionally. I'd be panicking.",
      "\"So now that things are skyrocketing, I just need to remember that what I'm good at is writing how I feel and turning those feelings into music.",
      "\"And even though there's more opinions about what I'm doing now, I need to trust my gut.\"",
      "Unexpected love affair",
      "What A Devastating Turn Of Events was a huge emotional purge. Among the topics she discussed: Racism, school bullying, self-harm, alcoholism, alienation and toxic relationships.",
      "A recurring theme was men who take more from a relationship than they put back in.",
      "\"I'm quite a caregiver by nature, and that attracts boys who need a lot of help, or are very insecure,\" the singer reflects.",
      "\"I tend to be the person's 'mother', which isn't fun, because I have to be the strong one and there's no room for my emotions.\"",
      "But the days of heartbreak are over. Last year, the singer unexpectedly found herself in a new kind of relationship, one where her needs are as important as her partner's.",
      "It's written all over her new EP, Little House. \"Kissing me under the indigo / I begged for the morning sun not to rise / Oh, what a beautiful starry night,\" she sings, totally besotted, on the ballad Indigo.",
      "The lead single, Can We Talk About Isaac, even uses her new partner's real name. His photo is on the artwork.",
      "\"It's quite a brave move,\" she laughs, \"but I'm a hopeless romantic, and I don't want to lose being able to document my life in song.",
      "\"It's a risk that whoever wants to date me was going to have to take!\"",
      "The title track documents their chance meeting at a pub: \"With two pints in his hands, he came over and said, 'Nice to meet you'.\"",
      "\"He's very sweet, he's got a very simple friendship group, he likes going to the pub \u2013 but he does so much for me. It's the first experience I've ever had of being taken care of.",
      "\"He's changed my life, no matter what happens between us. We're both just really in love with each other and having a having a blast.\"",
      "At the moment, though, the couple have been forced apart. The Sabrina Carpenter tour lasts five weeks, after which Chinouriri sets off for her first headline tour of North America.",
      "It comes six months after the singer had to pull out of a US support slot with alt-pop star Remi Wolf.",
      "She says the dates would have left her penniless, even with financial support from her record label.",
      "\"As much as I would have loved that tour, I wouldn't have been able to pay my rent, which was very, very scary,\" she says.",
      "\"My fans were like, 'Let's help out. Let's do a GoFundMe for 10 grand', but it was far beyond 10 grand.",
      "\"It was like, who's going to pay for visas, where's your band going to sleep, what are people going to eat?",
      "\"It was a big wake up call. It made me reassess; do I need to be styled all the time? Do I need to travel this way all the time?",
      "\"So now, I'm able to go back now in full force and upgrade my venues and sell out almost the entire tour, which is mental.\"",
      "The cancellation taught her to slow down instead of grabbing every opportunity she's offered.",
      "It's a sign that Chinouriri is finally shedding the self-doubt that clouded her early career.",
      "The success of the Sabrina Carpenter tour is a prime example.",
      "\"There's always a risk as an opener, that people might be completely uninterested, but this has been the complete opposite,\" she says.",
      "\"Having the entire arena sing songs with you is such a blessed feeling to have.\"",
      "It won't be long before she's selling out those arenas on her own."

      "Val Kilmer is joking around in his trailer on the set of Top Gun, pretending to bark demands into a packet of More cigarettes as if it's a phone and he's talking to the studio boss.",
      "\"He wants more! More sex! More drugs! More wine! More tobacco! More headaches! More ulcers! More herpes! More women! And less of Tom Cruise!\"",
      "Co-stars Rick Rossovich and Barry Tubb, also on a break from playing the film's elite fighter pilots, are in the trailer too, cracking up with laughter.",
      "Rossovich, aka Kilmer's on-screen partner Slider, is apparently the person who wants \"more\". Wearing shades but no shirt, he proceeds to pretend to throw a chair at Kilmer's head, before jumping out of the trailer into the sunshine and dancing off.",
      "Kilmer took his video camera everywhere to film behind the scenes, and picked these snapshots of the carefree tomfoolery on the Top Gun set in 1985 as the opening shots for a 2021 documentary about his life.",
      "\"He had the first video camera I'd ever seen,\" recalls Tubb, who played Wolfman. \"They got so tired of telling him to turn it off on the set of Top Gun that they finally just let it go.",
      "\"We had a fun time with it because we tried to catch everyone on the toilet with the video camera. That was our goofing around. So there's video somewhere of everyone with the door open on the toilet. We were goofballs.\"",
      "He adds: \"Cruise never hung out with us. It was all of us, except for Cruise. He was method acting as the loner, and we were all at this beach hotel, riding motorcycles down hallways and things.\"",
      "And Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, \"unlike some producers, threw parties every other night\", he says. \"And so it was definitely in the air.\"",
      "'Young and bulletproof'",
      "Tubb is one of many former co-stars who have been fondly remembering Kilmer's acting and his antics, following his death at the age of 65.",
      "\"He was the coolest cat I've ever met,\" Tubb tells BBC News. \"Not only did he have great acting chops, but he was funny as hell.\"",
      "Top Gun was a breakthrough for Kilmer, who played Iceman, the rival to Cruise's hotshot Maverick at the US Navy's academy for elite fighter pilots.",
      "On screen, saving the USA from Soviet MiG jets was serious business. Off screen, filming in California and Nevada, things were less serious.",
      "\"As Sean Penn once said, working in Hollywood is like being in high school with money,\" Tubb says.",
      "\"I was 22 years old, and I was the younger of the bunch.",
      "\"We had a deal that if one of us wanted to go to Mexico, all of us had to go. And Val had his van from high school, so we would all pile into Val's van and go over to Mexico for dinner.",

      "\"[Director] Tony Scott heard me say that and he said, 'Keep that in'. We were doing things like that. We were cutting up and having fun the whole time.\"",
      "'Play up the rivalry with Tom'",
      "Kilmer originally didn't want to appear in the film, saying he throught the script was silly and he disliked its warmongering.",
      "To the audition, he \"wore oversize gonky Australian shorts in nausea green\" in an attempt to put the producers off, he wrote in his autobiography.",
      "\"I read the lines indifferently. And yet, amazingly, I was told I had the part.\"",
      "The script contained \"very little\" substance to Iceman's character, he said in his documentary.",
      "\"So I attempted to make him real. I manifested a backstory for him, where he had a father who ignored him, and as a result, was driven by the need to be perfect in every way. This obsession with perfection is what made him so arrogant.\"",
      "He added that he would \"purposely play up the rivalry between Tom's character and mine off screen\" as well as on.",
      "\"What ended up happening is the actors, in true method fashion, split into two distinct camps.",
      "\"You had Maverick and Goose on one side, and Slider, Hollywood, Wolfman and me, Iceman, on the other.",
      "\"It was fun to play up the conflict between our characters, but in reality I've always thought of Tom as a friend, and we've always supported each other.\"",
      "By the time a sequel was finally shot in 2018 and 2019, Kilmer had suffered from throat cancer. He had a tracheotomy operation, affecting his voice and making it difficult to speak.",
      "But Cruise was the one who insisted Iceman should return. The pair shared a highly emotional scene as Kilmer's character, now an admiral, typed out part of his side of the conversation on a screen, before sharing a hug.",
      "\"Cruise couldn't have been cooler,\" Kilmer said. \"Tom and I took up where we left off. The reunion felt great.\"",
      "Many of the cast had remained friends after the original film, Tubb says, and Rossovich's home in the Hollywood Hills became the \"Top Gun club house\".",
      "\"I remember going to Rick's house and they were painting Rick's kitchen, and Val got up on top of the refrigerator and did 20 minutes of Hamlet. Never missed a word.\"",
      "Kilmer was \"an actors' actor\", who raised the bar for the rest of the cast, Tubb says.",
      "\"He had a level of artistry that transcended the Hollywood norm.",
      "\"Val was a cool cat. Also, he could back it up. I remember seeing The Doors movie and I just saw Jim Morrison.",
      "\"His ability to disappear into characters was incredible. Same with Iceman.\"",
      "He adds: \"Val, among his peers, was well loved. He came fully loaded.\"",
      "The love for Kilmer has shone through in the tributes from his fellow actors.",
      "Kelly McGillis, who played Cruise's love interest Charlie and starred with Kilmer in 1999's At First Sight, told the BBC in a statement: \"I need some time to process what Val has meant in my walk here on Earth.",
      "\"He was an enigmatic presence sprinkled here & there throughout my journey. A force with depth & weight which will take some time to sort out.",
      "\"There are just so many feelings at the moment.",
      "\"Gratitude being the first.\"",
      "Cheeseburgers on set",
      "English actor and dancer Will Kemp, who appeared alongside Kilmer in the 2004 slasher film Mindhunters, said the news of his death came as a \"real shock\".",
      "He recalls how the star had set him at ease and made him laugh with his \"wicked sense of humour\" when he was a nervous young actor on his first production.",
      "\"I entered into it with sort of trepidation really because I had heard all sorts of rumours about possible bad behaviour on set, and also he's this acting legend that I'd grown up with.",
      "\"But Val was really sweet, fun, generous, but really, really unpredictable!\"",
      "His memories of his first ever big scene will forever be tied up with Kilmer.",
      "\"I have a very clear memory of the first scene that I shot that was in a helicopter, and we're flying around with [director] Renny Harlin shouting, 'why are we not shooting?'",
      "\"We're halfway through take one, and Val - totally unscripted - somehow pulls out a cheeseburger and was just casually munching on it.",
      "\"He turns over to me and goes, 'hey, is everybody having fun?'",
      "\"It just blew my mind.\"",
      "Kemp, also known for his portrayal of the Swan in Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake, admitted Kilmer's acting methods on set sometimes appeared to be \"crazy\" while at other times there were \"moments of absolute genius\".",

      "\"His father was killed in a pit accident when Philip was only 14... he wasn't that close to his mother and he'd been very close to his father.\"",
      "Philip was an avid reader and theatre lover who won a scholarship to Cardiff University to read Maths when he was only 16.",
      "\"In a way he forged a whole new persona,\" said Angela.",

      "According to a press release, Tracks II will feature 83 songs, of which 74 have never been officially released in any form.",
      "Many of the tracks, including Fugitive's Dream and Don't Back Down on Our Love, have circulated on bootlegs for years, but will finally be heard in studio quality.",
      "Springsteen said the release had been made possible when the Covid-19 pandemic allowed him to \"finish everything I had in my vault\".",
      "Fans have known for years that Springsteen's vault contains hours and hours of unheard material.",
      "Speaking to Variety magazine in 2017, the star admitted: \"We've made many more records than we released. Why didn't we release those records? I didn't think they were essential.",
      "\"I might have thought they were good, I might have had fun making them... but over my entire work life, I felt like I released what was essential at a certain moment, and what I got in return was a very sharp definition of who I was, what I want to do, what I was singing about.",
      "\"And I still basically judge what I'm doing by the same set of rules.\"",
      "In a video trailer for Tracks II, Springsteen added: \"I often read about myself in the '90s as having some lost period or something.",
      "\"And I really, really was working the whole time.\"",
      "First track released",
      "Fans will finally get to hear those \"lost\" songs in June.",
      "Springsteen said they would offer a glimpse into the home recordings he made after the commercial success of Born To Run and Born In The USA freed him from the pressure of using commercial recording studios.",
      "\"The ability to record at home whenever I wanted allowed me to go into a wide variety of different musical directions,\" he said in a statement.",
      "That includes the \"sonic experimentation\" of Faithless, a film soundtrack to a movie that never got made.",
      "Other unreleased albums include the country-leaning Somewhere North of Nashville, cut in May 1995; and Twilight Hours, an orchestrated pop album that was written and recorded in the same period as 2018's Western Stars.",
      "There are also the \"richly-woven border tales\" of Inyo, whose song titles - including The Aztec Dance and Ciudad Juarez - suggest a Latin American influence.",
      "Springsteen described the last disc, Perfect World, as \"the one thing on this that wasn't initially conceived as an album\", instead highlighting several songs he wrote with longtime collaborator Joe Grushecky in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "As a first taste of the collection, he released Rain In The River, from Perfect World, whose muscular drums and squalling feedback showcase the raw power of his regular backing band E Street Band.",
      "The announcement comes a month before Springsteen kicks off his European tour, with dates in Manchester, Liverpool, Marseille, Berlin and Prague, amongst others.",
      "The 75-year-old recently vowed to keep playing live \"until the wheels come off\", but said he had scaled back his tours after his wife, Patti Scialfa, was diagnosed with myeloma, a rare blood cancer.",

      "After a pair of low-key, introspective albums, Ed Sheeran has returned to his roots with a shimmering new pop single, Azizam.",
      "The track sees the star incorporate Middle Eastern influences, inspired by producer Illya Salmanzadeh's Persian heritage.",
      "The title means \"my dear\" or \"my darling\" in Farsi, and the track incorporates instruments like the ghatam, a clay pot commonly used as percussion in Southern India, and the santur, a hammered dulcimer of Iranian origin.",
      "\"Now the song's finished, and it's out, I'm discovering more and more every single day that Persians are really, really proud of their culture, and it's great to celebrate it,\" Sheeran told BBC Radio 1.",
      "Azizam is released in a crowded week for new music, with comeback songs by Miley Cyrus, Wet Leg and Elton John all vying for streams.",
      "Sheeran's track doesn't stray too far from his usual pop template, but the Persian influences will undoubtedly bolster his figures in the Middle East - the world's fastest-growing music market.",
      "It's a trick the star has pulled before.",
      "A voracious music fan with an instinct for new commercial opportunities, he's collaborated with Afrobeats stars like Burna Boy and Fireboy DML, learned Spanish for a record with Colombian singer J Balvin, tipped his hat to Irish folk music on Galway Girl, and even sang in Punjabi during a recent concert in Mumbai.",
      "Talking about the creation of Azizam, the star said he'd had \"a hell of a lot of fun\" immersing himself in Persian music.",
      "\"I loved how a lot of rhythms, scales, melodies and instruments were different but similar to the Irish trad music I had grown up with.\"",

      "Early reviews have largely been positive, with a few caveats.",
      "Awarding it three stars, The Guardian said the Persian elements felt incidental to what was an overwhelmingly \"Anglo-Saxon\" pop song.",
      "\"Azizam does its job with the kind of ruthless efficiency you might expect from Sheeran in unabashed pop mode,\" wrote pop critic Alexis Petridis.",
      "\"It has a hook that fully digs into your brain the first time you hear it, and proves impossible to dislodge thereafter.",
      "The song is \"banal, featherweight musical Esperanto\", added the Telegraph's Neil McCormick.",
      "\"Lighter than candy floss and twice as sticky... It will be number one on every Spotify playlist by tomorrow, inescapable all spring and summer, and the next time you ask me, I'll probably declare it a bubblegum classic.\"",

      "\"I'm from an Iranian family,  and there are so many Persian music influences in the song, which is amazing to hear,\" they said.",

      "He also suggested that he was planning a posthumous release, containing songs written throughout the course of his life. Speaking to host Jimmy Fallon, he joked that album would be called Eject.",
      "His new material comes at a crucial crossroads in his career. One of the biggest-selling acts of the 2010s, the star's last two albums underperformed.",
      "Subtract, released in May 2023, presented a more understated, introspective side to the star's bubbly pop persona - with production from The National's Aaron Dessner.",
      "Although it received some of the best reviews of his career, it was his first album not to go platinum in the UK.",
      "A companion album, Autumn Variations, released later the same year, fared even worse.",
      "Despite debuting at number one, it left the Top 40 after two weeks, and has yet to be certified gold - meaning it has sold fewer than 100,000 copies.",
      "However, the star remains one of the world's most-streamed acts. On Spotify, 12 of his songs have topped 1 billion plays.",

      "Last Swim, Sasha Nathwani's first feature film, is the story of an ambitious British Iranian teen, Ziba (played by Deba Hekmat), who, along with her group of friends savours a day of total freedom, as well as experiencing tough decisions and heartbreak, before the group go their separate ways after school.",
      "The director tells the BBC that \"the film was developed and made by Millennials, but it's a Gen Z coming of age story\".",
      "He says his interest in making the film was exploring the idea of lost youth and that the script, co-written by producer Helen Simmons, was written at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, although filmed after restrictions ended.",
      "\"It's not a pandemic film,\" he says, \"but it was developed during that time when young people from all over the world were having the seminal years of their lives taken away.",
      "\"When Helen and I were writing it, the world was opening up and closing down, then opening up and closing down again. There was this pressure, and I remember seeing young people in the park, and thinking how must it be for them?",
      "\"They all live with their parents, they've only got one day together, and tomorrow the world's going to close down again.",
      "\"So the question I was trying to pose with the film was, if you had one day to reclaim your youth, what would you do?\"",
      "Nathwani, who's previously directed music videos as well as short films, says that it's his belief things have worsened for the young after Covid-19.",
      "\"I felt that the world was fraught when we were making it, when we were writing it, and now it's going out into the world, there's an argument that things are even worse now,\" he says.",
      "\"When I was 17 or 18, growing up in London, the city didn't feel inaccessible. It felt accessible, and I didn't feel like doors were being closed in my face.",
      "\"Now I don't even know how a young person has a 24-hour period of freedom without breaking the bank.\"",
      "He added: \"We're in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. Not only do things cost so much, but there just aren't opportunities. Education is challenging for lots of different reasons, and some people don't have access because of the exorbitant costs.",
      "\"You see that in the film, as Ziba and her friends are going their separate ways.\"",
      "Anxious about the future",
      "A 2023 study from Oxford University found that the mental health of young people had deteriorated during the UK's three Covid-19 lockdowns, compared with a similar study conducted before the pandemic.",
      "And the latest ONS (Office for National Statistics) figures found that around one in seven 16-24 year olds were not in work, education or training between October-December 2024.",
      "Figures from the King's Trust charity from February 2025 found that most of the 16-25 year olds it had surveyed felt anxious about the future on a daily basis.",
      "Most of the cast members of Last Swim are Gen Z, although Gangs of London actress Narges Rashidi also stars in the story, as Ziba's mother.",
      "Lead star Hekmat, a Kurdish British model and actor, was aged 21 when the film was made.",
      "\"As a generation, there have been things thrown at us, but also taken away,\" she says.",
      "\"That's true of me, but when I look at my brothers, that's when my heart really goes out to the young. My brothers just turned 18 and 20 years old, they were going through adolescence during Covid, there so many changes in their personal and school life anyway, and then for all of that to happen.",
      "\"We're all still regrouping and refiguring ourselves out.\"",
      "'Gen Z friendship'",
      "Filmed in the UK heatwave of 2022, Last Swim takes Ziba and her group of friends through well-known spots of London such as Portobello Road, Hampstead Heath and Primrose Hill by car, bike and train.",
      "Industry publication Screen Daily said the film was \"shot, one suspects, with a touch of guerrilla ingenuity... Last Swim also has a palpably improvised component in the friends' genially pitched running banter.\"",
      "The director agrees that the young cast had freedom to change the script \"to make it as authentic as possible\".",
      "\"I think whenever you tell a story about young characters, you need to give them a certain amount of flexibility,\" Nathwani says.",
      "\"If there was a more natural way of delivering a line in a language that they would more authentically use, we would then write that into the script.",
      "\"And they were very good at challenging me as well. They would challenge me about choices that I and Helen had made on the page if they didn't feel it rang true of their characters.\"",
      "\"This is Gen Z friendship on screen,\" adds Hekmat.",
      "\"Sasha says that his [Millennial] generation is the one of hard knocks and they didn't grow up with the idea that mental health needed to be considered in day to day lives,\" she says.",
      "\"I think a great way of seeing how connected this film is to Gen Z is just the friendship that me and the rest of the gang have together.",
      "\"They're not afraid to ask each other about their feelings and the boys aren't afraid to open up a bit more. I think it's really reflective of our friendships in the way that we are able to speak to each other.\"",
      "As independent cinema tries to seek a greater audience amongst the young post-Covid-19, Nathwani says he hopes his film captures the energy of youth, although tapping into some much harder emotions and decisions.",
      "\"That's the interesting thing about that strange time between school and further education, because the bond that you have with your friends from school will never be closer, tighter than it is during that summer,\" he explains.",
      "\"And the moment that summer ends, those bonds tend to break because people go in different directions. And just in the context of what's happening in the UK, but across the world too, I think that's really challenging for young people, more so than I think we envision.\"",

      "He had extraordinary range: excelling in comedies, westerns, crime dramas, musical biopics and action-adventures films alike.",
      "And perhaps his best performance combined his skills as a stage actor with a fine singing voice, to bring to life 1960s-counterculture icon Jim Morrison, in Oliver Stone's film The Doors.",
      "Critic Roger Ebert wrote: \"If there is an award for the most unsung leading man of his generation, Val Kilmer should get it.",
      "\"In movies as different as Real Genius, Top Gun, Top Secret!, he has shown a range of characters so convincing that it's likely most people, even now, don't realise they were looking at the same actor.\"",

      "His parents were Christian Scientists, a movement to which Kilmer would adhere for the rest of his life.",
      "He attended Chatsworth High School, in the San Fernando Valley, where future actor Kevin Spacey was among his classmates and where he developed a love of drama.",
      "Kilmer's ambition was to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada), in London, but his application was rejected because, at 17, he was a year below the minimum entry age.",
      "Instead, Kilmer became the then youngest pupil to enrol at the Julliard School, in New York, one of the world's most prestigious drama conservatories.",
      "A gifted student, Kilmer co-wrote and made his stage debut in How It All Began, a play based on the life of a German radical, at the Public Theatre.",
      "But he recalled a tough regime.",
      "\"I had a mean teacher once, who kind of said, 'How dare you think you can act Shakespeare? You don't know how to walk across the room yet,'\u2026 and in a way, that's true,\" Kilmer said.",
      "Minor parts, including in Henry IV Part 1 and As You Like It, preceded a meatier role as Alan Downie in the 1983 production of Slab Boys, with Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon.",
      "Kilmer made his film debut in spy spoof Top Secret!, written by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker. He played star Nick Rivers, sucked into an East German plot to reunify Germany.",
      "The film proved Kilmer had a good voice and he later released an album under the name of his fictional character.",
      "He also published a book of poetry, My Edens After Burns, some of which reflected on a relationship with a young Michelle Pfeiffer.",
      "Two years later, Kilmer played Lt Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, Tom Cruise's deadly fighter pilot rival in Top Gun.",
      "A thrilling patriotic Cold War buddy movie, it cost just $15m (\u00a312m) to make but took more than $350m at the box office.",

      "The couple had two children but divorced after eight years of marriage.",
      "Despite his rising popularity in the cinema, Kilmer did not abandon the stage, playing Hamlet at the 1988 Colorado Shakespeare Festival, and then Giovanni in a New York production of 'Tis Pity She's a Whore.",
      "But in the 1990s, he proved he could carry a major film as a lead actor.",
      "Director Stone had long wanted to make a biopic of The Doors, focusing on the band's singer, who had died of a drugs overdose in Paris in 1971.",
      "A number of actors were considered, including John Travolta and Richard Gere, before Stone chose Kilmer because of his physical resemblance to Morrison and strong singing voice.",
      "In his trademark single-minded approach, Kilmer lost weight and learned 50 Doors songs by heart, as well as spending time in a studio perfecting Morrison's stage style.",
      "And in his 1996 biography of Oliver Stone, James Riordan said the surviving Doors could not tell recordings of Kilmer singing their songs from Morrison's original.",
      "Kilmer also played Elvis Presley in Tony Scott's True Romance, written by Quentin Tarantino, and sickly alcoholic gambler and dentist Doc Holliday in the 1993 film Tombstone - a retelling of the story of Wyatt Earp's gunfight at the OK Corral, which some critics called his finest performance.",
      "In 1995, Kilmer replaced Michael Keaton in the third of a trilogy of Batman films, Batman Forever.",
      "But he later said he had been uncomfortable with the role and declined to play it in the follow-up, Batman and Robin.",
      "Kilmer's reputation for being difficult on set had reportedly exploded into open warfare with the director, Joel Schumacher, normally the most temperate of men, who called his leading man's behaviour \"difficult and childish\".",
      "John Frankenheimer, who directed Kilmer in The Island of Dr Moreau, was even blunter.",
      "\"I don't like Val Kilmer,\" he said. \"I don't like his work ethic and I don't want to be associated with him ever again.\"",
      "The actor responded: \"When certain people criticise me for being demanding, I think that's a cover for something they didn't do well. I think they're trying to protect themselves.",
      "\"I believe I'm challenging, not demanding, and I make no apologies for that,\" he told the Orange County Register newspaper in 2003.",

      "In the early 2000s, there was no shortage of film appearances - but Kilmer's cinema career had hit a plateau.",

      "In 2021, Kilmer made Val, a documentary about his life.",
      "It delved into his darkest places and experiences, including his brother Wesley's accidental drowning as a teenager and the breakdown of his marriage.",
      "A year later, there was time for a final starring role.",
      "Planned for a decade, Top Gun: Maverick reunited Kilmer and Cruise, updating their former rivalry in the post-Cold War era.",

      "\"It's time to let go,\" Iceman tells Maverick in one poignant scene.",
      "Kilmer will be remembered as a complicated man and a fine but difficult actor.",
      "He never embraced the kind of Hollywood party lifestyle his looks and fame might have brought him.",

Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally \u2013 many go years without seeing a health professional.",
      "\"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\"",
      "Stark differences",
      "Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy.",
      "\"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\"",
      "But he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest \u2013 a larger gap than is seen for women \u2013 and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75.",
      "\"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\"",
      "NHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer.",
      "\"Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.\"",
      "Mr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates.",
      "But he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work.",
      "He adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men.",
      "Despite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs.",
      "\"How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them \u2013 they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,\" says Prof White.",
      "Ethnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes.",
      "Wake-up call",
      "But none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. \"Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.\"",
      "He has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players.",
      "Men are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities.",
      "\"It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.\"",
      "Similar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes.",
      "The Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects.",
      "Prof White says now is the time to build on these foundations \u2013 something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help \"shine a spotlight\" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 \u2013 that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government.",
      "But he also wants it to act as a \"wake-up call\" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider.",
      "\"Look at your waist size \u2013 if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people.",
      "\"Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help.\"",

    "story": [
      "The family of a mother who died from cervical cancer after twice being wrongly told she had negative results have been awarded undisclosed damages.",
      "The misreporting of Louise Gleadell's cervical screening results was admitted by University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust following her death aged 38 in March 2018.",
      "An internal review in 2017 found the samples, taken four years apart, were not good enough to produce reliable results but neither Ms Gleadell - a mum to three boys - nor her relatives were told about the \"inadequate\" samples while she was still alive.",
      "Her family have now been given an undisclosed payout, with the trust apologising for its mistakes that had \"devastating consequences\".",
      "Ms Gleadell, from Cossington in Leicestershire, was diagnosed with cervical cancer two years prior to her death. It was, by that stage, too late to have surgery.",
      "Two cervical screening tests, carried out in 2008 and 2012, were misreported to her as negative.",
      "It meant that over a four-year period, she had been given false reassurance about her health when she was developing cervical cancer, and the opportunity to treat pre-cancerous cells passed.",
      "In fact, following the trust's 2017 internal review, both samples were found to have been \"inadequate\", and it found Ms Gleadell should have been invited back to have the tests repeated.",
      "Ms Gleadell's sisters, Laura and Clare Gleadell, say their grief has been compounded by knowing that their sister's death was avoidable.",
      "Laura, 43, said: \"Her death was preventable and that for us is ultimately really hard.",
      "\"It would not have developed into cancer had she been recalled in either 2008 or 2012.",
      "\"If she had had treatment for cell abnormalities before it even developed into cancer, she would not have died.\"",
      "Clare stressed knowing the test results were misreported and led to her death is \"incredibly hard to live with\".",
      "The 40-year-old added: \"It is something we probably think about most days, if not every day.\"",
      "The sisters described Louise as devoted to her three boys, who were aged two, 11 and 13 when they lost their mum.",
      "\"Family to her was everything,\" they said.",
      "Louise began feeling unwell in late 2015, experiencing pain, abnormal bleeding and unexpected weight loss.",
      "By February of the following year, she was so concerned about her health that she paid privately for an ultrasound scan.",
      "The findings led to further investigations, and a biopsy provided by the NHS led to a diagnosis of cervical cancer in March.",
      "Louise underwent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and brachytherapy - which is internal radiation treatment. Initially, she recovered well but a few months later developed new symptoms.",
      "Towards the end of 2016, doctors told her the disease was terminal.",
      "With donations, Louise travelled abroad for immunotherapy in Germany but ultimately it did not stop the fatal spread of the cancer. She died at the Loros Hospice in Leicester.",
      "The NHS routinely looks back and re-examines test findings after someone is diagnosed with cervical cancer.",
      "After appointing solicitors to examine the case, the family found out that the NHS trust knew of the misreporting of the results in the summer of 2017 - before Louise died.",
      "It is not clear why Louise was not told about this.",
      "Specialist clinical negligence lawyer, Gemma Lewis, of Moosa-Duke Solicitors, uncovered the situation and said the trust should have told Louise.",
      "\"I don't think the family should have had to find out from me,\" she added.",
      "\"Someone with a medical background should have explained things, who could answer any follow-up questions.",
      "\"It should not take a legal investigation - that they might not have decided to undertake - to uncover the truth.\"",
      "Richard Mitchell, chief executive at the trust, said: \"I am deeply sorry that mistakes were made in how we cared for and communicated with Louise and for the devastating consequences.",
      "\"Errors like those in Louise's care are rare, and there have been significant improvements in cervical screening since 2019 when human papillomavirus (HPV)  testing was introduced nationally.",
      "\"Locally, following an investigation into Louise's care, we have strengthened our processes for sharing the findings of cervical screening quality audits to ensure timely and open communication.",
      "\"We understand Louise's family may still have questions and we have reached out to offer a meeting.\"",
      "Following the trust's apology, Louise's sisters stressed that they would encourage all women to go for a cervical screening.",
      "The NHS says cervical screening checks a sample of cells from your cervix for certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV).",
      "These types of HPV can cause abnormal changes to the cells in your cervix and are called \"high risk\" types of HPV.",
      "If high risk types of HPV are found during screening, the sample of cells is also checked for abnormal cell changes.",
      "If abnormal cells are found, they can be treated so they do not get a chance to turn into cervical cancer.",
      "Louise's sisters added that they intended to take up the trust's offer of a meeting.",
      "Clare said: \"We have unanswered questions - exactly how and why was Louise given false information after her smears and why, after her diagnosis, when the mistakes were highlighted were the family not told?",
      "\"The hardest part is seeing Louise's three boys without their mother. It's heartbreaking - the impact of went wrong has been awful.\"",

      "Susan was no more than puzzled when she saw the first results from her home DNA testing kit.",
      "Now a woman in her mid 70s, she had never known much about her grandfather, and paid for the private test to see if it threw up anything unusual.",

      "Her case is now the second of its type uncovered by the BBC. Lawyers say they expect more to come forward driven by the boom in cheap genetic testing and ancestry websites.",
      "Out of the blue",
      "A sharp, funny woman with shoulder-length white hair, Susan tells me her story from her sunny front room somewhere in southern England.",
      "Her husband is sitting next to her, jogging her memory and chipping in from time to time.",
      "After taking that DNA test almost a decade ago, the genealogy company entered her data into its vast family tree, allowing other users to make contact with their genetic relatives \u2013 close or distant.",
      "Six years later she received a message out of the blue.",
      "The stranger said that his data matched hers in a way that could only mean one thing: he must be her genetic sibling.",
      "\"That was just panic. It was every emotion I could think of, my brain was all over the place,\" she says.",
      "Susan's first reaction was that she may have been secretly adopted. Both her parents had died some years before, so she plucked up the courage and asked her older brother.",
      "He was sure the whole thing was a scam. His sister had always been part of his life, and he was \"absolutely certain\" that one of his first memories was of his mother being pregnant.",
      "Susan though still had her suspicions. She was slightly taller than her brother and, with her striking blonde hair, had never looked like the rest of family.",
      "Her eldest daughter did some digging and found a copy of all the births registered in the local area on the day her mother was born.",
      "The next baby girl on the list, registered at the same NHS hospital, had the exact same surname as the man who had contacted her through the genealogy website.",
      "It couldn't be a coincidence. The only possible explanation was a mistake or mix-up in that maternity ward more than seven decades ago.",
      "Until recently cases like this were unheard of in the UK, although there have been a handful of examples in other countries.",
      "The standard practice in the NHS today is to place two bands around babies' ankles immediately after birth and keep mother and child together through their hospital stay.",
      "In the 1950s maternity care was very different. Babies were often separated, placed in large nursery rooms and cared for by midwives.",
      "\"The whole system was far less sophisticated back then,\" says Jason Tang, from the London law firm Russell Cooke, which is representing Susan.",
      "\"It may be that staff didn't attach a card or tag immediately, or that it simply fell off and was put back on the wrong baby or on the wrong crib.\"",
      "From the late 1940s the UK also saw a post-war baby boom putting more pressure on busy maternity services in the newly formed NHS.",
      "This, of course, meant nothing to Susan for decades.",
      "She grew up as part of a \"normal, working class\" household, met her husband and ended up working for the NHS herself in a \"hands-on\" clinical role.",
      "Other than \"a bit of the usual trauma\" in her teenage years, she remembers her parents as a \"very good, loving\" couple who \"did everything they could and always encouraged me\".",
      "\"In a way, I'm so glad they are not here anymore to see this,\" says Susan. \"If they are up there watching me, I really hope they don't know what's gone on.\"",
      "If home DNA tests had been available earlier, she doesn't think she could have told them the truth \"because it would have been so awful\".",
      "\"But I really don't think that for me, anything has changed about them, they are still mum and dad,\" she says.",
      "On the other hand, her relationship with the man she has always known as her older brother has, she thinks, been strengthened by what she's gone through.",
      "\"It's actually brought us closer together. Now we meet up more often and I get cards sent to 'my dear sister',\" she says.",
      "\"Both he and his wife have been absolutely fantastic, honestly I cannot praise them enough.\"",
      "She remembers receiving another \"lovely letter\" from a cousin at the time who told her, \"Oh don't worry, you're still part of the family\".",
      "As for her new blood relations, she says the situation has been more difficult.",
      "She has met up with the man who contacted her, her biological sibling, and laughs as she remembers how similar they both looked.",
      "\"If you'd put a wig on him and a bit of makeup, it could honestly have been me,\" she jokes.",
      "She has also seen photographs of the other woman who she was swapped with at birth, and her sons.",
      "But building a relationship with that new side of her family has not been easy.",
      "\"I know they are my biological relatives but I didn't grow up with them so there's not that emotional connection there,\" she says.",

    "story": [
      "April Hubbard sits on the theatre stage where she plans to die later this year.",
      "She is not terminally ill, but the 39-year-old performance and burlesque artist has been approved for assisted dying under Canada's increasingly liberal laws.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "She is speaking to BBC News from the Bus Stop Theatre, an intimate auditorium with a little under 100 seats, in the eastern city of Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "Illuminated by a single spotlight on a stage she has performed on many times before, she tells me she plans to die here \"within months\" of her imminent 40th birthday. She'll be joined by a small group of her family and friends.",
      "April plans to be in a \"big comfy bed\" for what she calls a \"celebratory\" moment when a medical professional will inject a lethal dose into her bloodstream.",
      "\"I want to be surrounded by the people I love and just have everybody hold me in a giant cuddle puddle and get to take my last breath, surrounded by love and support,\" she says.",
      "April was born with spina bifida and was later diagnosed with tumours at the base of her spine which she says have left her in constant, debilitating pain.",
      "She's been taking strong opioid painkillers for more than 20 years and applied for Medical Assistance in Dying (Maid) in March 2023. While she could yet live for decades with her condition, she qualified to end her life early seven months after applying. For those who are terminally ill it is possible to get approval within 24 hours.",
      "\"My suffering and pain are increasing and I don't have the quality of life anymore that makes me happy and fulfilled,\" April says. Every time she moves or breathes, she says it feels like the tissues from the base of her spine \"are being pulled like a rubber band that stretches too far\", and that her lower limbs leave her in agony.",
      "We meet April as, almost 3,000 miles away, MPs are scrutinising proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. They voted in principle in support of those plans in November 2024, but months of detailed scrutiny have followed - and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could possibly become law.",
      "This week, the BBC witnessed a man's death in California, where assisted dying laws are far more similar to those being considered in Westminster.",
      "Critics say Canada is an example of the \"slippery slope\", meaning that once you pass an assisted dying law it will inevitably widen its scope and have fewer safeguards.",
      "Canada now has one of the most liberal systems of assisted dying in the world, similar to that operating in the Netherlands and Belgium. It introduced Maid in 2016, initially for terminally ill adults with a serious and incurable physical illness, which causes intolerable suffering. In 2021, the need to be terminally ill was removed, and in two years' time, the Canadian government plans to open Maid to adults solely with a mental illness and no physical ailment.",
      "Opponents of Maid tell us that death is coming to be seen as a standard treatment option for those with disabilities and complex medical problems.",
      "\"It is easier in Canada to get medical assistance in dying than it is to get government support to live,\" says Andrew Gurza, a disability awareness consultant and friend of April's.",
      "Andrew, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, says he respects April's decision, but tells us: \"If my disability declines and my care needs got higher, I'd still want to be here. To know there's a law that's saying you could easily end your life - it's just really scary.\"",
      "Before she was approved for Maid, April was assessed by two independent physicians who were required to inform her of ways to alleviate her suffering and offer alternative treatments.",
      "\"The safeguards are there,\" she says, when we press her about disabled people who feel threatened by assisted dying, or whether Maid is being used as a shortcut to better quality care. \"If it's not right for you and you're not leading the charge and choosing Maid, you're not going to be able to access it unless it's for the right reasons,\" she adds.",
      "There were 15,343 Maid deaths in 2023, representing around one in 20 of all deaths in Canada - a proportion that has increased dramatically since 2016 and is one of the highest in the world. The average age of recipients was 77.",
      "In all but a handful of cases, the lethal dose was delivered by a doctor or nurse, which is also known as voluntary euthanasia. One doctor we spoke to, Eric Thomas, said he had helped 577 patients to die.",
      "Dr Konia Trouton, president of the Canadian Association of Maid Assessors and Providers, has also helped hundreds of patients to die since the law was introduced.",
      "The procedure is the same each time - she arrives at the home of the person who has been given approval for Maid and asks if they wish to go ahead with it that day. She says the patients always direct the process and then give her the \"heads up and ready to go\".",
      "\"That gives me an honour and a duty and a privilege to be able to help them in those last moments with their family around them, with those who love them around them and to know that they've made that decision thoughtfully, carefully and thoroughly,\" she adds.  If the answer is yes, she opens her medical bag.",
      "Demonstrating to the BBC what happens next, Dr Trouton briefly puts a tourniquet on my arm. She shows me where the needle would be inserted into a vein in the back of my hand to allow an intravenous infusion of lethal drugs.",
      "In her medical bag she also has a stethoscope. \"Strangely, these days I use it more to determine if someone has no heartbeat rather than if they do,\" she tells me.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "Some 96% of Maid provisions are under \"track one\" where death is \"reasonably foreseeable\". Dr Trouton says that means patients are on a \"trajectory toward death\", which might range from someone who has rapidly spreading cancer and only weeks to live or another with Alzheimer's \"who might have five to seven years\".",
      "The other 4% of Maid deaths come under \"track two\". These are adults, like April, who are not dying but have suffering which is intolerable to them from a \"grievous and irremediable medical condition\".",
      "That is in stark contrast to Labour MP Kim Leadbeater's bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, which says patients must be expected to die within six months. The Westminster bill would not allow doctors to give a lethal dose \u2013 rather patients would have to self-administer the drugs, usually by swallowing them.",
      "Death via intravenous infusion normally takes just a few minutes, as the lethal drugs go straight into the bloodstream, whereas swallowing the drugs means patients usually take around an hour or two to die, but can take considerably longer, although they are usually unconscious after a few minutes.",
      "Dr Trouton told me she regarded the Canadian system as quicker and more effective, as do other Maid providers. \"I'm concerned that if some people can't swallow because of their disease process, and if they're not able to take the entire quantity of medication because of breathing difficulties or swallowing difficulties, what will happen?\"",
      "'Canada has fallen off a cliff'",
      "But opponents argue it's being used as a cheaper alternative to providing adequate social or medical support.",
      "One of them is Dr Ramona Coelho, a GP in London, Ontario, whose practice serves many marginalised groups and those struggling to get medical and social support. She's part of a Maid Death Review Committee, alongside Dr Trouton, which examines cases in the province.",
      "Dr Coelho told me that Maid was \"out of control\". \"I wouldn't even call it a slippery slope,\" she says \"Canada has fallen off a cliff.\"",
      "\"When people have suicidal ideations, we used to meet them with counselling and care, and for people with terminal illness and other diseases we could mitigate that suffering and help them have a better life,\" she says. \"Yet now we are seeing that as an appropriate request to die and ending their lives very quickly.\"",
      "While at Dr Coelho's surgery I was introduced to Vicki Whelan, a retired nurse whose mum Sharon Scribner died in April 2023 of lung cancer, aged 81. Vicki told me that in her mum's final days in hospital she was repeatedly offered the option of Maid by medical staff, describing it as like a \"sales pitch\".",
      "The family, who are Catholic, discharged their mother so she could die at home, where Vicki says her mum had a \"beautiful, peaceful death\". \"It makes us think that we can't endure, and we can't suffer a little bit, and that somehow now they've decided that dying needs to be assisted, where we've been dying for years.",
      "\"All of a sudden now we're telling people that this is a better option. This is an easy way out and I think it's just robbing people of hope.\"",
      "'Not a way I want to live'",
      "So is Canada an example of the so-called slippery slope? It's certainly true that the eligibility criteria has broadened dramatically since the law was introduced nine years ago, so for critics the answer would be an emphatic yes and serve as a warning to Britain.",
      "Canada's assisted dying laws were driven by court rulings. Its Supreme Court instructed Parliament that a prohibition on assisted dying breached the country's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The extension of eligibility for those who were not terminally ill was in part a response to another court decision.",
      "In Britain, judges in the most senior courts have repeatedly said any potential change to the law around assisted dying is a matter for Parliament, after the likes of Tony Nicklinson, Diane Pretty and Noel Conway brought cases arguing the blanket ban on assisted suicide breached their human rights.",
      "April knows some people may look at her, a young woman, and wonder why she would die.",
      "\"We're the masters of masking and not letting people see that we're suffering,\" she says. \"But in reality, there's days that I just can't hide it, and there's many days where I can't lift my head off the pillow and I can't eat anymore.",
      "\"It's not a way I want to live for another 10 or 20 or 30 years.\"",

    "story": [
      "Younger children should not be given any drinks containing artificial sweeteners, UK experts are now advising.",
      "The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) recommendations apply to beverages such as sugar-free 'toothkind' squash that has ingredients such as aspartame, stevia, saccharin and sucralose.",
      "It says preschool children should become accustomed to drinking water instead.",
      "Sweeteners may help older children cut down on sugar though.",
      "What are artificial sweeteners?",
      "Eating too much sugar increases the risk of tooth decay and some long-term health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease.",
      "Artificial sweeteners were developed as a substitute, providing a sweet taste with few or no calories.",
      "All of the ones used in the UK are approved and have undergone rigorous safety tests.",
      "But some are concerned that they enhance preferences for sweet tastes in children which can be hard to overcome.",
      "Are sweeteners healthier than sugar?",
      "After reviewing the available evidence, SACN says proof that sweeteners are cutting tooth decay is \"poor\", although a reduction in free sugars, alongside \"other positive changes to diet\", is likely to be beneficial to health overall.",
      "It says there may be some value in using sweeteners to help reduce weight gain in the short to medium term, but \"it is not essential and is not the only option.\"",
      "And the SACN committee experts are concerned about \"the gap in data\" on UK population exposure to sweeteners.",
      "They say there is currently \"insufficient evidence\" to carry out a full risk assessment and are asking goverment to gather more.",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said government was committed to turning the tide on obesity, taking bold action to crack down on child-targeted junk food advertising on TV and online.",
      "Prof Robin May, Chief Scientific Adviser at the Food Standards Agency, said: \"We strongly support SACN's call for industry to make data on the quantity of these sweeteners in their ingredients publicly available to provide better information on how much people are consuming and to help inform our assessments of these ingredients.\"",
      "Prof Graham Finlayson, Chair in Psychobiology, University of Leeds, said it was reasonable to be cautious, especially in children, but the evidence wasn't strong enough to dismiss non-sugar sweeteners as a tool for reducing sugar intake.",
      "\"With obesity and diabetes rates rising, knee-jerk policy changes could do more harm than good,\" he warned.",
      "The International Sweeteners Association (ISA) said: \"As part of an overall healthy diet and lifestyle, low/no calorie sweeteners can be used to further public health objectives on sugar intake reduction.",
      "\"ISA supports SACN's call for continued investment in high-quality, long-term research.\"",

    "story": [
      "Women in England and Wales are likely to continue having babies later in life, and having smaller families, than previous generations, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) projections.",
      "The ONS says girls turning 18 in 2025 are likely to have an average of one child per woman by the age of 35 - unlike their mothers' generation, which had an average of one child per woman by the time they were 31.",
      "They are also projected to have an average of 1.52 children during their lifetimes - down from 1.95 children for their mothers and 2.04 children for their grandmothers.",
      "The new analysis marks the first time the ONS has explored how fertility levels could change in future generations.",
      "It looks at fertility patterns for women born in 1978 alongside patterns for their mothers' generation - assumed to be those born in 1951 - and projections for their daughters' generation - considered to be those born in 2007, who turn 18 this year.",
      "It shows those born in 1978 on average have one child by the time they reach 31. For their mothers' generation, this occurred by the age of 26.",
      "By projecting this trend forwards into the future, the ONS found that women born in 2007 are likely to have an average of one child by the time they are 35.",
      "For girls born in 2025, this is projected to occur by the time they are 36.",
      "Kerry Gadsdon, from the ONS, said the trend may be driven by \"financial pressures and the timing of other life events such as partnership formation and moving into your own home generally happening later\".",
      "The data also shows the largest average family size for women born in England and Wales over the past 100 years was for girls born in 1934 and 1935, who went on to have an average of 2.42 children.",
      "Projections suggest a steady fall began in the early 1980s - to an average of 1.80 children for women born in 1990, 1.54 for those born in 2000, 1.52 for those born in 2007 - who turn 18 this year - and 1.46 for girls born this year.",
      "Women born in 2007 are projected to have most of their children after they have turned 30. By contrast, women born in the first few decades of the 20th century had already had most of their children by the time they had reached the same age.",
      "The latest analysis comes months after the ONS published data which found the fertility rate in England and Wales had dropped to its lowest on record.",
      "Only 591,072 babies were born in 2023, fewer than in any year since 1977 and a fall of more than 14,000 on the previous year, the ONS said.",
      "Research suggests pregnancy at older ages increases the risk of complications during pregnancy and labour.",
      "There is also research to suggest more women in their late 30s will experience difficulties conceiving than women in their late 20s or early 30s.",

      "The 30-year-old, a project manager and DJ from Macclesfield who has lived in Sydney since 2017, said the couple had been \"living in a state of uncertainty\" for years as they waited for an outcome of an appeal against the decision.",
      "The Australian Department of Home Affairs said it cannot comment on individual cases.",
      "Ms Mathers and Mr O'Leary, 31, from East London, met while backpacking in the country in 2017 and have lived there ever since.",
      "He started a business in the carpentry and construction trade three years ago, and said the couple had \"made the most of our lives here\".",
      "But Ms Mathers's diagnosis of the relapsing-remitting variant of MS in 2020 has led to a visa battle with authorities that could see the pair thrown out of the country.",
      "MS is a neurological condition where immune cells in the body attack the brain and spinal cord, leading to symptoms including muscle stiffness and problems walking and talking.",
      "The disease affects everyone differently, and in those with the relapsing remitting variant, symptoms can fluctuate mild to severe, according to the NHS.",
      "Ms Mathers has received treatment in Australia under a reciprocal health agreement with the UK and said her condition had been \"well managed\" so far.",
      "But the couple's requests for permanent residency were rejected in 2023 due to the costs associated with her medical care.",

    "summary": "Wayne Hawkins believes terminally ill people should be able to die when they choose, but others in the state disagree.",
    "story": [
      "It's 10am, and in a little over two hours, Wayne Hawkins will be dead.",
      "The sun is shining on the bungalow where the 80-year-old lives in San Diego, California with his wife of more than five decades, Stella.",
      "I knock on the door and meet his children - Emily, 48, and Ashley, 44 - who have spent the last two weeks at their father's side.",
      "Wayne sits in a reclining chair where he spends most of his days. Terminally ill, he is too weak to leave the house.",
      "He has invited BBC News to witness his death under California's assisted dying laws - if MPs in London vote to legalise the practice in England and Wales, it will allow some terminally ill people here to die in a similar way.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "Half an hour after arriving at Wayne's house, I watch him swallow three anti-nausea tablets, designed to minimise the risk of him vomiting the lethal medication he plans to take shortly.",
      "Are you sure this day is your last, I ask him? \"I'm all in,\" he replies. \"I was determined and decided weeks ago - I've had no trepidation since then.\"",
      "His family ask for one last photo, which I take, and you can see at the top of this page. As usual, Stella and Wayne are holding hands.",
      "Shortly after, Dr Donnie Moore arrives. He has got to know the family over the past few weeks, visiting them on several occasions alongside running his own end-of-life clinic. Under California law, he is what is known as the attending physician who must confirm, in addition to a second doctor, that Wayne is eligible for aid in dying.",
      "Dr Moore's role is part physician, part counsellor in this situation, one he has been in for 150 assisted deaths before.",
      "On a top shelf in Wayne's bedroom sits a brown glass bottle containing a fine white powder - a mixture of five drugs, sedatives and painkillers, delivered to the house four weeks before. The dosage of drugs inside is hundreds of times higher than those used in regular healthcare and is \"guaranteed\" to be fatal, Dr Moore explains. Unlike California, the proposed law at Westminster would require a doctor to bring any such medication with them.",
      "When Wayne signals he is ready, the doctor mixes the meds with cherry and pineapple juice to soften the bitter taste - and he hands this pink liquid to Wayne.",
      "No one, not even the doctor, knows how long it will take him to die after taking the lethal drugs. Dr Moore explains to me that, in his experience, death usually occurs between 30 minutes and two hours of ingestion, but on one occasion it took 17 hours.",
      "This is the story of how and why Wayne chose to die. And why others have decided not to follow the same course.",
      "We first met the couple a few weeks earlier, when Wayne explained why he was going ahead with the decision to have an assisted death - a controversial measure in other parts of the world.",
      "\"Some days the pain is almost more than I can handle,\" he said. \"I just don't see any merit to dying slow and painfully, hooked up with stuff - intubation, feeding tubes,\" he told me. \"I want none of it.\"",
      "Wayne said he had watched two relatives die \"miserable\", \"heinous\" deaths from heart failure.",
      "\"I hate hospitals, they are miserable. I will die in the street first.\"",
      "Wayne met Stella in 1969; the couple married four years later. He told us it was something of an arranged marriage, as his mother kept inviting Stella for dinner until eventually the penny dropped that he should take her out.",
      "They lived for many years in Arcata, northern California, surrounded by sweeping forests of redwood trees, where Wayne worked as a landscape architect, while Stella was a primary school teacher. They spent their holidays hiking and camping with their children.",
      "Now Wayne is terminally ill with heart failure, which has already brought him close to death. He has myriad other health issues including prostate cancer, liver failure and sepsis which brings him serious spinal pain.",
      "He is expected to live less than six months, qualifying him for an assisted death in California. His request to die has been approved by two doctors and the lethal medication is self-administered.",
      "It was during our first meeting that he asked the BBC to return to observe his final day, saying he wanted terminally ill adults in the UK to have the same right to an assisted death as him.",
      "\"Britain is pretty good with freedoms and this is just another one,\" he said. \"People should be able to choose the time of their death as long as they meet the rules like six months to live or less.\"",
      "Stella, 78, supports his decision. \"I've known him for over 50 years. He's a very independent man. He's always known what he wants to do and he's always fixed things. That's how he's operating now. If this is his choice, I definitely agree, and I've seen him really suffer with the illness he's got. I don't want that for him.\"",
      "Wayne would also qualify under the proposed new assisted dying law in England and Wales. The measures return to the House of Commons later this month, when all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on changes to the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill.",
      "The proposed legislation, tabled by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, says that anyone who wants to end their life must have the mental capacity to make the choice, that they must be expected to die within six months, and must make two separate declarations - witnessed and signed - about their wish to die. They must satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible.",
      "MPs in Westminster voted in favour of assisted dying in principle last November but remain bitterly divided on the issue. If they ultimately decide to approve the bill, it could become law within the next year and come into practice within the next four years.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "There are also divisions here in California, where assisted dying was introduced in 2016. Michelle and Mike Carter, both 72 and married for 43 years, are each being treated for cancer - Mike has prostate cancer that has spread to his lymph nodes, and Michelle's advanced terminal ovarian cancer has spread throughout much of her body.",
      "\"I held my mother's hand when she passed; I held my father's hand when he passed,\" Michelle told me. \"I believe there's freedom of choice however for me, I choose palliative care\u2026 I have God and I have good medicine.\"",
      "Michelle's physician, palliative care specialist Dr Vincent Nguyen, argued that assisted dying laws in the US state lead to \"silent coercion\" whereby vulnerable people think their only option is to die. \"Instead of ending people's lives, let's put programmes together to care for people,\" he said. \"Let them know that they're loved, they're wanted and they're worthy.\"",
      "He said the law meant that doctors have gone from being seen as healers to killers, while the message from the healthcare system was that \"you are better off dead, because you're expensive and your death is cheaper for us\".",
      "Some disability campaigners say assisted dying makes them feel unsafe. Ingrid Tischer, who has muscular dystrophy and chronic respiratory failure, told me: \"The message that it sends to people with disabilities in California is that you deserve suicide assistance rather than suicide prevention when you voice a desire to end your life.",
      "\"What does that say about who we are as a culture?\"",
      "Critics often say that once assisted dying is legalised, over time the safeguards around such laws get eroded as part of a \"slippery slope\" towards more relaxed criteria. In California, there was initially a mandatory 15-day cooling off period between patients making a first and second request for aid in dying. That has been reduced to 48 hours because many patients were dying during the waiting period. It's thought the approval process envisaged in Westminster would take around a month.",
      "'Goodbye,' Wayne tells his family",
      "Outside Wayne's house on the morning of his death, a solitary bird begins its loud and elaborate song. \"There's that mockingbird out there,\" Wayne tells Stella, as smiles flicker across their faces.",
      "Wayne hates the bird because it keeps him awake at night, Stella jokes, hand in hand with him to one side of his chair. Emily and Ashley are next to Stella.",
      "Dr Moore, seated on Wayne's other side, hands him the pink liquid which he swallows without hesitation. \"Goodnight,\" he says to his family - a typical touch of humour from a man who told us he was determined to die on his terms. It's 11.47am.",
      "After two minutes, Wayne says he is getting sleepy. Dr Moore asks him to imagine he is walking in a vast sea of flowers with a soft breeze on his skin, which seems appropriate for a patient who has spent much of his life among nature.",
      "After three minutes Wayne enters a deep sleep from which he will never wake. On a few occasions he lifts his head to take a deep breath without opening his eyes, at one point beginning to snore softly.",
      "Dr Moore tells the family this is \"the deepest sleep imaginable\" and reassures Emily there is no chance her dad will wake up and ask, \"did it work?\"",
      "\"Oh that would be just like him,\" Stella says with a laugh.",
      "The family start to reminisce about hiking holidays and driving around in a large van they converted to become a camper. \"Me and dad insulated it and put a bed in the back,\" says Ashley.",
      "On the walls are photos of Emily and Ashley as small children next to huge carved Halloween pumpkins.",
      "Dr Moore is still stroking Wayne's hand and occasionally checking his pulse. For a man who Emily says was \"always walking, always outdoors, always active\", these are the final moments of life's journey, spent surrounded by those who mean most to him.",
      "At 12.22pm Dr Moore says, \"I think he's passed\u2026 He's at peace now.\"",
      "Outside, the mockingbird has fallen silent. \"No more pain,\" says Stella, embracing her children in her arms.",
      "I step outside to give the family some space, and reflect on what we have just seen and filmed.",
      "I have been covering medical ethics for the BBC for more than 20 years. In 2006, I was present just outside an apartment in Zurich where Dr Anne Turner, a retired doctor, died with the help of the group Dignitas - but California was the first time I had been an eyewitness to an assisted death.",
      "This isn't just a story about one man's death in California - it's about what could become a reality here in England and Wales for those who qualify for an assisted death and choose to die this way.",
      "Whether you're for or against the proposed new Westminster law, the death of a loved one is a deeply personal and emotional time for a family. Each death leaves an imprint, as will Wayne's.",

    "summary": "Sir Keir Starmer has suggested there could be state intervention to protect UK business from tariffs introduced by Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said the era of globalisation has \"ended\" following Donald Trump's new tariffs.",
      "It comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer suggested in a Sunday Telegraph article he was about to announce state intervention to protect UK firms from the US president's move.  The UK was among nations hit with a 10% \"baseline\" import duty, and negotiations on a trade deal to reduce tariffs are continuing.",
      "\"Globalisation as we've known it for the last couple of decades has come to an end,\"  Jones added, in a BBC interview.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch disagreed that globalisation was over and pointed to \"great\" trading relationships with other countries.",
      "Starmer vows to protect UK businesses from tariff 'storm'",
      "UK draws up list of US products it could hit with tariffs",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "Some analysts fear a global recession following Trump's so-called Liberation Day, when he announced sweeping import taxes, sparking retaliatory action from countries including China and Canada.",
      "The prime minister has said the government \"will do everything necessary to protect Britain's national interest\" and is \"ready to use industrial policy\" to help shelter businesses, because \"the world as we know it has gone\".",
      "Live updates: US tariffs have global leaders scrambling",
      "Live updates: US tariffs have global leaders scrambling",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Jones was asked whether globalisation - which has resulted in a boom in imports of cheap fashion, electrical goods and other products - was over.",
      "\"Yeah it's ended, the prime minister said that himself this morning,\" he said.",
      "The change meant the UK had to \"build out\" relationships with allies around the world but also invest in the UK's own economy, Jones said, denying ministers were \"scrabbling\" for solutions.",
      "He insisted the government was \"trying to get ahead of these challenges\",",
      "Jones said that is why the government needed to \"invest in the domestic economy, both for UK businesses, but also our public services... which is why our plan for change is investing in the NHS and skills as well as industrial policy\".",
      "Amid reports that elements of the spending review and the industrial strategy could be brought forward from their expected June publication date, Jones said Labour had been working on the industrial strategy since it was in opposition.",
      "Pressed on whether measures would be brought forward, Jones deferred to Sir Keir's announcement expected in the coming days and laughed when Kuenssberg said \"that sounds almost like a yes, but you're not allowed to say it to us this morning\".",
      "The UK government has continued its policy of not responding to US tariffs with counter-tariffs, as other countries have done - preferring, ministers have said, a \"calm\" approach focused on a UK-US trade deal.",
      "\"We're hoping to do a deal,\" Jones said, adding on tariffs that \"we have a better outcome than other comparable countries as a consequence of our diplomacy\".",
      "The Liberal Democrats have called for MPs to be allowed to vote on any deal struck with Trump due to concerns about the possibility of changes to regulations around farming, online content and the digital services tax on US social media giants.",
      "The party's deputy leader Daisy Cooper said it would be \"deeply undemocratic\" to sideline Parliament on these \"critical\" issues.",
      "She said: \"Both Conservative and Labour MPs should commit now to voting down any Trump deal that sells out British farmers and their high food standards or waters down our online safety rules.\"",
      "Asked to rule out watering down the Online Safety Act, Labour's Jones said protections for children are \"non-negotiable\" and committed to ensuring that social media platforms are \"designed in a way that protects children from harm\".",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed has previously said \"we won't undercut British farmers on welfare or environmental standards\" in order to secure a US trade deal.",
      "However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has previously suggested the UK could change its taxes on big tech firms as part of a deal to overturn US tariffs, despite the digital services tax bringing in about \u00a3800m per year since its introduction in 2020.",
      "Speaking on the Kuenssberg programme, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch agreed that retaliatory tariffs were not a solution because they would only harm UK consumers.",
      "However, she said she did not agree that globalisation was over, insisting what was happening was only \"fragmentation\", adding \"we still have a great trading relationship with many other countries\".",
      "Badenoch added the Labour government should pick up the deal former Prime Minister Boris Johnson had tried to negotiate with Trump during his previous presidency, which ended in 2020.",
      "Prior to that, Johnson and his successor Liz Truss tried to push Trump's predecessor Joe Biden to open trade talks but negotiations petered out without a deal being struck.",
      "Rishi Sunak managed to agree the Atlantic Declaration with Biden, including commitments on easing trade barriers, closer defence industry ties, a data protection deal and more co-operation on AI.",
      "Asked whether a UK-US trade deal was indeed \"oven-ready\", as Badenoch has previously claimed several times, the Tory leader suggested the government should \"pick up where we left off\".",
      "She continued: \"We had six rounds of negotiations where there were some decisions that were concluded and they can pick that up and take it.",
      "\"The most important thing is removing tariffs -  the tariffs are going to be disruptive for our businesses... That is going to make a whole mess of the tax take that [Chancellor] Rachel Reeves thought she was going to be getting in her budget.",
      "\"We are in a worse place now because of the decisions that Labour has made and people out there are suffering.\"",

      "The Israeli immigration authority said Interior Minister Moshe Arbel denied entry to all four passengers after they were questioned. It accused them of travelling to \"document the security forces\".",
      "Badenoch first made her comments when asked on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show whether Israel was entitled to refuse entry to the MPs.",
      "\"Countries should be able to control their borders,\" she said. \"What I think is shocking is that we have MPs in Labour who other countries will not allow through, I think that's very significant...",
      "\"I believe that the people who represent us in Parliament should be people who should be able to go anywhere in the world and people not be worried about what they're going to do when they go into those countries.\"",
      "Badenoch said the reason given by the Israelis was that \"they don't believe that they're going to comply with their laws\" and \"there are many people that we don't allow into our country and I don't think we should be setting precedents in a different way\".",
      "Tagging a video of the Conservative leader's comments on X, Lammy posted: \"It's disgraceful you are cheerleading another country for detaining and deporting two British MPs.",
      "\"Do you say the same about Tory MPs banned from China?",
      "\"This government will continue to stand up for the rights of our MPs to speak their mind, whatever their party.\"",
      "Reposting the criticism, Badenoch said: \"Unlike China, Israel is our ally and a democracy. A good Foreign Sec would be able to make that distinction.",
      "\"Perhaps Labour MPs could put UK national interest first and do their jobs instead of campaigning for airports in Kashmir or promoting Hamas propaganda in parliament.\"",
      "Further criticism came from Davey on X, who posted: \"Kemi Badenoch has once again shown unbelievably poor judgement by failing to back two British MPs denied entry to Israel.",
      "\"Yet another complete shocker.\"",
      "Foreign Affairs Committee chairwoman Dame Emily Thornberry told Sky News she was \"completely gobsmacked\" by Badenoch's comments.",
      "\"This is nonsense,\" the Labour MP said. \"You have to stand up for what's right, Kemi Badenoch, and you should stand in solidarity with other parliamentarians who were just going to Israel and the West Bank to find out what was going on.\"",
      "Badenoch was also contradicted by Tory MP Fuller, who told LBC that Conservative MPs had experienced similar issues in China and he wanted to support the right to travel to other countries.",
      "\"I want to support my colleagues,\" said Fuller. \"This isn't a partisan thing, as a parliamentarian, we live in a difficult world at the moment.",
      "\"Democracies are under threat, we should support them in those circumstances, whether China, Israel, or anywhere...",
      "\"On this, my personal view is, parliamentarians should be allowed free passage to other countries, to our allies. We should look at that in a poor light. We should be supporting them.\"",
      "Fuller spoke about his boss again on Times Radio, saying he thought MPs on official trips are \"going there to be better informed about the situation and then report back to their parliamentary colleagues about what they have found\".",
      "\"Democracy isn't a guarantee in life,\" he said. \"Freedom isn't guaranteed.\"",

      "The Falkland Islands was surprised to be hit by one of the most punishing tariff rates on US President Donald Trump's \"worst offenders\" list, a member of the Falklands parliament has told the BBC.",
      "The British overseas territory is facing a 42% tax on the goods it exports to the US under Trump's shake-up of international trade.",
      "Teslyn Barkman, who oversees trade in the parliament, said the taxes would impact the economy, which is heavily dependent on the sale of fish to the EU and the US.",
      "But Barkman said the Falklands government would not respond with retaliatory tariffs and wanted a \"warm\" relationship with the US.",
      "Only eight other countries or territories dubbed the \"worst offenders\" for trade imbalances were given higher rates on Trump's list of tariffs, which are due to come into effect on Wednesday.",
      "\"It was a surprise,\" Barkman told the BBC. \"The fact a global superpower such as the US was paying attention to us at all caught us off guard.\"",
      "With a population of about 3,600 people, the Falkland Islands is an archipelago located in the South Atlantic Ocean.",
      "The territory has a government and sets its own trade policy, while the UK takes responsibility for its defence and foreign affairs.",
      "In 2023, the Falklands government reported a national income of \u00a3280m, with fishing accounting for 60% of gross domestic product (GDP).",
      "\"We're a village running a country,\" said Barkman, who holds responsibility for trade and economic development in the Legislative Assembly.",
      "\"So the sum of our trade exports is massive in terms of GDP.\"",

      "\"The UK government has a responsibility to step up and defend British citizens everywhere \u2013 including in the Falklands.",
      "\"President Trump has arbitrarily decided to hit Falklanders with some of his highest tariffs in an outrageous act of aggression that cannot be allowed to stand.\"",
      "Barkman said the Falklands was still trying to figure out why Trump decided to levy a 42% tariff on its goods. The US imposed a 10% tariff on UK products.",
      "As analysis by BBC Verify showed, the tariffs are based on a calculation that factors in the difference in goods traded between the US and other countries.",
      "\"We're certainly not looking at any anything retaliatory at all,\" Barkman said.",
      "\"We need to understand how that figure was arrived at because certainly the Falkland Islands approach has been that we're here to support the UK and her Western allies.",
      "She added: \"We want a warm relationship with the US as well.\"",
      "She said tourism was also a big contributor to the territory's economy, with large numbers of Amercians coming to see the renowned penguins living on the Falklands.",
      "\"Maybe that's an opportunity for us to build a closer relationship,\" Barkman said.",
      "She said the Falklands was working with the UK government to understand how the US tariff could be reduced or removed.",
      "EU tariffs on fish from the Falklands are a similarly pressing issue, given that is where the vast majority of those exports go.",

    "story": [
      "Male fruit flies that drink alcohol become more attractive to females, according to a new study.",
      "Adding alcohol to males' food increases their release of chemicals that attract females and leads to higher mating success.",
      "Fruit flies, or Drosophila melanogaster, are often found around our food waste bins as they feed on rotting fruit which gradually produces alcohol.",
      "Scientists have been trying to study why they are attracted to alcohol and how it affects them.",
      "Previous research has studied different theories about this attraction, such as the flies were seeking a euphoric state or a substitute for the high of mating among males rejected by females.",
      "Study author Bill Hansson, head of the Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology at the Max Planck Institute, said such research has taken an anthropomorphic view of fly behaviour, whereas this latest study suggests drinking alcohol gives the flies a reproductive advantage.",
      "\"We don't think flies drink alcohol because they are depressed,\" he said.",
      "The fly's attraction both to the carbohydrates and yeast in rotting fruit, as well as to the alcohol, cannot be separated, he added.",
      "In the study, alcohol, and particularly methanol, increased the males' production and release of chemical sex signals, called pheromones, which made them more attractive to females.",
      "Pheromones are released into the air from one individual to influence the behaviour of another animal of the same species.",
      "Males were therefore strongly attracted to alcohol, especially those males which  had never mated.",
      "The new study also showed that the fly's response to smelling alcohol is controlled by three different neural circuits in its brain.",
      "While two are responsible for attracting male flies to small amounts of alcohol, a third ensures that excessive amounts have a deterrent effect.",
      "Because alcohol is toxic, the fly's brain must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of drinking it, and it does this by balancing signals of attraction with aversion.",
      "\"This means that the flies have a control mechanism that allows them to get all the benefits of alcohol consumption without risking alcohol intoxication,\" lead author Ian Keesey, of the University of Nebraska, said.",

      "The pressure group Fighting Dirty has threatened legal proceedings against the EA over what it called a \"lack of action\" over the issue of tyre exports.",
      "The EA has asked the group to wait until its own review is complete, and it has also asked File on 4 Investigates to share the evidence from its investigation.",
      "The UK generates about 50 million waste tyres (nearly 700,000 tonnes) every year. According to official figures, about half of these are exported to India, supposedly to be recycled.",
      "But BBC File on 4 Investigates revealed that some 70% of tyres exported to India from the UK and the rest of the world are being sent to makeshift industrial plants, where they are \"cooked\" in order to extract steel, small amounts of oil as well as carbon black - a powder or pellet that can be used in various industries.",
      "Conditions at these plants - many of which are in rural backwaters - can be toxic and harmful to public health, as well as potentially dangerous.",

    "story": [
      "Sewage spilled illegally into England's largest lake on a record number of days last year, an analysis of water company data by campaigners suggests.",
      "The analysis, which the BBC had exclusive access to, used United Utilities operational data to establish when the company was discharging sewage into Windermere when it should by law have been treating some of it.",
      "The campaigners from Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (WASP) and Save Windermere identified 140 illegal spill days in 2024, more than in any of the three previous years.",
      "United Utilities told BBC News that the campaigners' findings were \"inaccurate\" and some of the data \"erroneous\".",
      "The company declined to put in writing, despite repeated requests, any specific examples of mistakes or omissions.",
      "Regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency are both currently investigating United Utilities operations.",
      "Sewage dumped illegally in Windermere over 3 years",
      "Government vows to clean up England's largest lake",
      "Water firm behind spills says fixes will take time",
      "Part of the Lake District National Park Unesco World Heritage Site, Windermere is home to more than 14,000 people and its scenery attracts an estimated seven million visitors per year.",
      "But its pristine image is under threat. Regular discharges of sewage into Windermere have been blamed for increasing nutrient levels and turning parts of the lake green \u2013 so called \"algal blooming.\"",
      "The BBC has regularly reported on discharges into Windermere. Last October it was revealed that a single pumping station had illegally spilled more than 140 million litres of raw sewage between 2020 and 2023. In 2023 BBC Panorama said United Utilities was misreporting pollution incidents.",
      "Earlier in March environment secretary Steve Reed called the amount of pollution entering the lake \"a disgrace\" and pledged to clean it up.",
      "Last week the Environment Agency said United Utilities had spilled 77,817 times in 2024, the highest figure of all England's water companies.",
      "Many of the spills will have been legal. All water companies are legally allowed to discharge raw sewage to stop the network getting overwhelmed and this now happens regularly during periods of heavy rain.",
      "But almost all pumping stations and treatment plants operate under an environmental permit which specify that they must process or \"pass forward\" a certain amount of sewage and rainwater before spilling starts.",
      "The campaigners cross-referenced United Utilities datasets showing when an asset was spilling against how much sewage it was treating at the time. The campaigners' analysis \u2013 which has been shared with and scrutinised by the BBC -  found days when illegal spills appear to have occurred at each of six sewage facilities around the lake, which combined to 140 days in 2024. That's more than in any of the previous three years, as the chart below shows.",
      "The longest illegal spill the analysis identified was for 10 days from Hawkshead pumping station, which flows into Windermere via Cunsey Beck.",
      "\"This is an indication that their works have not been maintained properly or they're not being watched over properly,\" says Prof Peter Hammond, a mathematican and retired academic from campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution.",
      "Prof Hammond's analysis of water company data has been cited by regulators and he has been praised in Parliament by water company executives for bringing problems to light they were previously unaware of.",
      "The latest analysis covers four years of data from six sites that discharge sewage into the Lake Windermere catchment.",
      "Comparisons over a longer time period are impossible as United Utilities has only had made full data sets available since 2021.",
      "The regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency have since 2021 been investigating whether the water companies have been treating enough sewage before they start to spill. The EA call it a \"major criminal investigation\" while Ofwat call it \"the largest and most complex Ofwat has ever undertaken\".",
      "Last week Yorkshire Water agreed to a \u00a340m \"enforcement action\" after Ofwat uncovered \"serious failures\" in how it operated its treatment plant and network.",
      "Ofwat declined to comment on the campaigner's findings as their investigation into United Utilities is ongoing.",
      "In response to concerns about United Utilities the Environment Agency last year reviewed all of its environmental permits in the Windermere catchment and says this led directly to the water company tripling its investment plans for the area to \u00a3200m.",
      "\"We are currently carrying out investigations into suspected pollution incidents on the Windermere catchment and are unable to comment on these in detail until they have reached a conclusion,\" an EA spokesperson said when the campaigners' analysis was shared with them.",
      "\"Where we find breaches of environmental permits, we will take the appropriate enforcement action up to and including a criminal prosecution.\"",
      "United Utilities, which provides services to more than seven million people across north-west England, is more than \u00a39bn in debt. Its chief executive Louise Beardmore confirmed to parliament in February that she was last year paid \u00a31.4m including a bonus of \u00a3420,000.",
      "\"The methodology used by the campaigners is different to that used by the Environment Agency for its compliance assessments,\" the water company said in a statement.",
      "\"On top of that, erroneous data has been used, tags and naming conventions in data sets appear to have been misunderstood, and assumptions seem to have been made on whether different types of flow meters have been installed.\"",
      "\"The methodology fails to use other corroborating information from the sites which would prove that spills did not occur. As a result, the numbers quoted are inaccurate.\"",
      "BBC News presented United Utilities with five examples of illegal spills the campaigners' analysis had identified using the company's data and asked for any evidence or explanation as to why they were not illegal. United Utilities repeatedly declined to do so in writing or on camera.",
      "\"What we're seeing is the failure of privatisation. We're seeing a prioritisation of dividend returns over the long-term environmental protection of places like Windermere\" says Matt Staniek from Save Windermere.",
      "\"The bill payer has paid for a service that has never fully been provided, and the illegality demonstrates that for all to see.\"",
      "Over the next five years bills in the United Utilities area will go up by 32% above the rate of inflation. On average that will mean a rise of \u00a386 for the year that starts in April.",
      "Louise Beardmore said the rises will fund the \"largest investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in over 100 years\".",
      "For Windermere that's set to mean nine wastewater treatment works, including two that were included in the campaigners' analysis being upgraded and a reduction in the number of overflows discharging into the lake.",

    "story": [
      "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.",
      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",
      "But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.",
      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",
      "\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.",
      "\"It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.\"",

    "summary": "Gothenburg has to pay a financial penalty if it misses certain annual sustainability goals.",
    "story": [
      "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.",
      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",
      "But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.",
      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",
      "\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.",
      "\"It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.\"",
      "Back in Gothenburg, the city's current environmental and social targets run until 2030. Mr Block says that the detailed yearly SLL reporting shows to potential future investors in the city what a difference their money would make.",
      "\"Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,\" he says.",
      "\"I can't change the credit worthiness of the city, but I can change how investors look at our sustainability work, and make it more attractive to them.\"",

      "The firm unveiled the much-anticipated console on Wednesday, the same day US President Donald Trump announced his sweeping new global tariffs.",
      "It said then that US pre-orders would open in a matter of days, but it has been now been forced to revise its plans.",
      "\"Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the US will not start April 9 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,\" it said in a statement.",
      "It says it still intends to launch the console on June 5, as originally planned.",
      "Nintendo confirmed the announcement applies to the US market only, so UK pre-orders will not be affected.",
      "Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.",
      "Japan, where the gaming company is based, has been hit with a 24% tariff - a cost which the firm must swallow or pass onto consumers.",
      "Trump says that his global tariffs will boost the US economy and protect jobs - but Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called them a \"national crisis\" on Friday according to local media.",

    "summary": "The BBC gets hands-on with the hotly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2, launching in June.",
    "story": [
      "After months of speculation, Nintendo has confirmed the successor to its wildly popular Switch console will be released on 5 June, when it will cost \u00a3395.99 to buy in the UK.",
      "But it's not so much the price of the Switch 2 but its games that have been raising eyebrows, with the new Mario Kart World that is being released alongside it coming in at a whopping \u00a374.99 for a physical copy.",
      "Fans will have to wait weeks before seeing what the new console and game are like - and whether they are worth that sort of money - but here's what I found when Nintendo gave me a chance to try them both out.",
      "When I first got my hands on the Switch 2, one thing became very clear to me - like the name suggests, Nintendo wants you to know this is a direct sequel to the Switch.",
      "This isn't like the jump from the Wii to the confusingly named Wii U, swapping motion controllers for a tablet that looked dated even back when the console released.",
      "Instead, the Switch 2 looks and feels just like its predecessor, with buttons in the places you'd expect - and a much larger (and nicer) screen.",
      "What's it like to play?",
      "It's fair to say Mario Kart World makes a fantastic first impression, thanks to the console having more power under the hood.",
      "It looks spectacular compared to previous Switch titles, though we're still talking about cartoony graphics - make no mistake, the console is more powerful but it's no match for the higher spec PlayStation 5, let alone PS5 Pro.",
      "And in my three races the standout feature wasn't the swishy new graphics or the controller, it was a trick that is becoming Nintendo's hallmark: making the new feel familiar.",
      "Despite having never picked up a Switch 2, I stormed my way to consecutive first place finishes, much to the chagrin of those around me.",
      "But it doesn't come cheap.",
      "The digital version of the game costs \u00a366.99, it's another \u00a38 on top of that for a physical copy - or pay an an extra \u00a335 for a version of the Switch 2 with it built-in, something which pushes the console price to \u00a3429.99.",
      "According to industry expert Christopher Dring, these wallet-emptying prices are down to the costs involved in manufacturing - and President Donald Trump's tariff blitz.",
      "\u201cThese cartridges are exclusively made in Japan, which is a country that's just been hit with a 24% tariff from the US Government, and the threat of those tariffs may have impacted Nintendo's pricing decisions globally,\u201d he said.",
      "In the US, Mario Kart World will be priced at $79.99, with the console selling for $449.99 (or $499.99 with Mario Kart bundled in).",
      "Mouse control and Donkey Kong destruction",
      "But there\u2019s more to the Switch 2 than Mario Kart.",
      "Fans will no doubt have been excited to see the hotly anticipated Metroid Prime 4,  the first game in the series in 18 years.",
      "But while they will be familiar with the typical way of playing - moving and aiming with joysticks and shooting with the \"A\" button - there\u2019s a significant new feature too.",
      "At any point in the game you can rotate the controller, put it on a surface and use it like a mouse. Fans of PC games will immediately feel at home with this, and it's a neat bit of engineering to be able to switch up on-the-fly without having to enter any menus.",
      "The optical mouse controls pop up elsewhere too, with PC strategy game Civilization VII a game that massively benefits.",
      "But in both cases, I do wonder how long you can play with the controller like this before the ergonomics become an issue. I have to admit I found myself wondering why I wasn't just playing on my PC with mouse controls and a comfortable resting position.",
      "Still, the fact that this is built in to the hardware means we may see the Switch 2 as the obvious home of future PC ports to home consoles.",
      "And there is another trick up Nintendo\u2019s sleeve - both controllers can be held like this and used as mice, opening up some interesting possibilities. In particular, futuristic wheelchair basketball game Drag x Drive, where both \"mice\" are pushed to mimic moving wheels.",
      "Elsewhere, Donkey Kong Bananza will be the first time the ape mascot has had a 3D platforming game of his own in 25 years, so there was some pressure on Nintendo to deliver a game which justified the wait.",
      "For lack of a better term it\u2019s a destruct-em-up - you can destroy much of the floor and scenery in each level.",
      "But there's that dreaded price news again. A digital copy will cost \u00a358.99, while a physical copy retails at \u00a366.99.",
      "It seems Nintendo has a lot to offer Switch fans - but it will be taking a fair bit from them too.",
      "Rivals and originals",
      "Some other titles I got to see in action were updated versions of Cyberpunk 2077 and Yakuza 0 - both of which big hitters on rival consoles which were deemed too complex to run on the original Switch.",
      "Like the other Switch 2 games, they looked good - and of course they will benefit as the new console, like the original, can play games on the go.",
      "The original Switch created the genre of the hybrid console - one which works on a TV and as a portable system.",
      "But since that launch in 2017, things have changed a bit.",
      "Now, it has a rival in the Steam Deck, a hybrid machine with the power to play most PC games.",
      "Nintendo would say something its rivals don\u2019t have is that long list of exclusive titles.",
      "But there is a bit of a theme here: Nintendo has consciously gone for continuity.",
      "The console is the Switch 2, rather than having a completely new name. Many of those exclusives Nintendo is so proud of are new games in established series, while others are remasters of modern classics.",
      "I had great experiences with these games in the 20 minutes I had with them.",
      "But for fans to get value for those high prices they will want something that holds up over weeks and months of gameplay.",
      "Will the Switch 2's slick nostalgia hit provide that? We'll start to find out in June."

      "They will also be able to block or report their children's friends, and the platform will provide more information about which games young users are playing.",
      "The measures will only apply to children who are under the age of 13 and have parental controls set up on their accounts.",
      "The announcements comes after the CEO of Roblox, Dave Baszucki told the BBC that parents should keep their children off the platform if they were \"not comfortable\" with it.",
      "Roblox - the most popular site in the UK for gamers aged eight to 12 - has been dogged by claims that some children are being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games.",
      "However, in his BBC interview, Mr Baszucki stressed that the company was vigilant about protecting its users, with \"tens of millions\" of people having \"amazing\" experiences on Roblox.",
      "Announcing the latest safety features, Roblox's Chief Safety Officer Matt Kaufman said: \"These tools, features, and innovations reflect our mission to make Roblox the safest and most civil online platform in the world.\"",

      "Parents with linked accounts of children who are 12 and under can now block such titles if they are uncomfortable with them.",
      "They will also be able to go further in managing who their children are friends with.",

      "The research is based on a Norwegian survey of more than 45,000 students.",
      "It indicates that each additional hour of screen time was linked to a 63% increase in insomnia risk, and 24 minutes less sleep.",

      "Options included watching films or TV, checking social media, browsing the internet and gaming.",
      "Among those saying they used screens in bed before sleep, 69% said they used social media as well as other screen-based activities.",
      "Participants were also asked to identify how many nights a week they would engage with such media, and for how much time, as well as how often they had difficultly falling or staying asleep, waking up early or experiencing tiredness.",
      "It identified those who said they experienced such issues at least three nights or days a week, for at least three months as experiencing insomnia.",

      "They also note that the study's reliance on survey data of self-reported experiences may mean it contains biases, and its findings should not be considered globally representative.",
      "Joshua Piper, a sleep clinician at ResMed UK, said the study provided \"valuable, mounting evidence\" of electronic device use negatively impacting sleep.",
      "\"It steals both opportunity and the quality of your sleep, which is why some may struggle for onset, others struggle to stay asleep,\" he told the BBC.",
      "While people may try to mitigate the impact by adjusting screen brightness or using night mode, Mr Piper said previous studies suggested it was scrolling and engaging with a device that was likely to cause sleep disruptions.",

      "The sleep disorder is among a whole host of problems people have reported experiencing with sleep - with late night phone use and doomscrolling often blamed.",
      "While common practice, the actual impact of using social media or scrolling through online content in bed on physical and mental health remains contested.",
      "Still, experts recommend that people stop using digital devices shortly before trying to go to sleep.",
      "They also say establishing a routine by going to bed and getting up at the same time every day may help improve sleep.",
      "Mental health charities Mind and Rethink recommend trying to do something relaxing before going to sleep such as breathing exercises, reading a book or having a bath, rather than trying to force yourself to sleep.",

      "When the ambulances responded and approached the area, aerial surveillance monitors informed the soldiers on the ground of the convoy \"advancing suspiciously\".",

      "Israel has admitted its earlier account claiming the vehicles approached without lights was inaccurate, attributing the report to the troops involved.",
      "The video footage shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wore reflective hi-vis uniform.",

    "summary": "Wigs and beauty contests are big business in Ivory Coast, but the industry is facing change.",
    "story": [
      "Long, flowing wigs and weave extensions have dominated the catwalks of Ivory Coast's massively popular beauty pageants for years.",
      "Contestants in the West African nation often spend a huge amount of money on their appearance, from outfits to hairdos - with very few choosing the natural look.",
      "In more than six decades, there have only been two notable exceptions, the most recent was Marl\u00e8ne-Kany Kouassi, who took the Miss Ivory Coast title in 2022 - looking resplendent with her short natural hair, the crown becoming her only adornment.",
      "Her victory was not only unusual in Ivory Coast but across the world, where Western beauty standards are often the desired look both for those entering contests and for the judges.",
      "Changes are slowly creeping in - last December Ang\u00e9lique Angarni-Filopon, from the French Caribbean island of Martinique, made headlines when she was crowned Miss France, mainly because of her age - she is 34 - and she also sported short Afro hair.",
      "But this year the organisers of the Ivorian competition are shaking things up right from the start.",
      "Wigs, weaves and hair extensions have been banned from the preliminary stages of the competition, which are held in 13 cities across the country (as well as two abroad for those in the diaspora).",
      "\"We want the candidates to be natural - whether with braids or straightened hair, it should be their own. Beauty must be raw,\" Victor Yapobi, president of the Miss Ivory Coast organising committee, told the BBC.",
      "Ivory Coast is the only African country enforcing the ban for a national competition.",
      "Mr Yapobi said the organisers in Ivory Coast had long been trying to promote a more natural look - for example cosmetic surgery is a no-no and skin lightening is frowned upon.",
      "\"We decided this year to truly showcase the natural beauty of these young women,\" he said.",
      "Other changes have also been implemented, like allowing slightly shorter women to compete - the minimum is now 1.67m (5.4ft), increasing the age by three years to 28 and - crucially - lowering the entrance fee by more than $30 (\u00a325) to $50.",
      "\"This change in criteria is because we observed these young women were putting up a lot of money to participate, and it was becoming a bit of a budget drain.\"",
      "When the BBC joined the first preliminary pageant in Daloa, the main city in the western region of Haut-Sassandra, one contestant was overjoyed by the new rules - feeling it gave her a better chance of success as she prefers not to wear wigs.",
      "\"I would see other girls with long, artificial hair, and they looked so beautiful,\" 21-year-old Emmanuella Dali, a real estate agent, told the BBC.",
      "\"This rule gives me more pride as a woman - as an African woman.\"",
      "The move aimed at celebrating natural African beauty has sparked a lively debate across the country, where wigs and extensions are popular.",
      "As a fashion choice, many women love the creativity that wigs and weaves allow them. They also serve as what is called \"protective style\", which means minimising the daily pulling and tugging on hair that can cause breakages.",
      "This was reflected by some contestants in Daloa who felt the rule removed an element of personal expression.",
      "\"I'm a wigs fan. I love wigs,\" said contestant and make-up artist Astrid Menekou. The 24-year-old told the BBC she was initially shocked by the no-wig, no-extensions stipulation.",
      "\"I didn't expect this rule! But now? I like my hair, and that's OK.\"",
      "The new rule has made the competitors think more about concepts of beauty - and changed some opinions, like those of Laetitia Mouroufie.",
      "\"Last year, I had extensions because I thought that's what beauty meant,\" the 25-year-old student told the BBC.",

      "The president's office described Shahram Dabiri's trip as \"unjustifiable and unacceptable given the ongoing economic challenges\" in Iran.",
      "A picture of Dabiri and his wife posing in front of MV Plancius, which was bound for Antarctica, circulated widely on social media and caused outrage in Iran.",

      "Last December, Yoon's shock martial law declaration cost him the confidence of much of the country. But among his supporters, his ongoing legal troubles have only further buttressed the image of a wronged saviour.",

      "Entwined on these YouTube channels are narratives of the opposition Democratic Party being obsequious to Beijing and trying to curry favour with Pyongyang.",
      "After the Democratic Party won at the polls by a landslide last April, some of these channels claimed that Yoon was a victim of electoral interference led by China, and that North Korea sympathisers lurking among the opposition were behind the ruling party's defeat. Similar claims were echoed by Yoon when he tried to justify his short-lived martial law declaration.",

While conservatives in South Korea have been \"very divided and feeble\" over the last decade, he says, Yoon is \"now more popular with them than he was before he tried to introduce martial law\".",

    "story": [
      "Last year, on 17 September, at around 15:30, a pager which a nurse called Adam was given at the start of his shift at a hospital in Lebanon received a message. The devices had been distributed by Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim group, to thousands of its members, including Adam, and he said it was how he and his colleagues expected to be alerted of emergencies or a disaster.",
      "\"The pager started beeping non-stop and, on the screen, it said 'alert',\" Adam, who did not want to use his real name for safety reasons, said. The text appeared to have been sent by the group's leadership. To read it, he had to press two buttons, simultaneously, with both hands. Adam did it many times, but the beeps continued. \"Then suddenly, as I was sitting at my desk,\" he said, \"the pager exploded\".",
      "On his phone, Adam showed me a video of the room, filmed by a colleague minutes after he was rescued. There was a trail of blood on the floor. \"I tried to crawl to the door because I had locked it while I changed my clothes,\" he said. The blast had opened a hole in the wood desk. I noticed a beige-like object. \"That's my finger,\" he said.",
      "Hezbollah is known for being a powerful militia and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. But in Lebanon, it is also a significant political movement with representation in parliament and a social organisation. Here, being a Hezbollah member does not necessarily mean you are a fighter. In fact, many are not. Adam told me he had never been one. People can work in the group's large array of institutions that include hospitals and emergency services, for example.",
      "Hezbollah had decided to equip members with low-tech pagers for communicating rather than smartphones which it feared could be used by Israel, its arch-enemy, to gather sensitive information about the group. It turned out, though, that the devices which Hezbollah had distributed were part of a years-long elaborate Israeli plan: an explosive compound had been concealed within the pagers, waiting to be activated \u2013 and that is what happened on that day.",
      "In the attack, Adam, who is 38, lost his thumb and two fingers on his left hand, and part of a finger on the other. He was blinded in his right eye, which has been replaced with a glass eye, and has only partial sight in the other. He showed me a picture of him in a hospital bed, taken an hour after the explosion, with his face burned, entirely blooded, covered with bandages. Despite his wounds, Adam remained committed to Hezbollah. I asked him how he felt when he looked at himself like that. \"Very good,\" he said in English. Then, in Arabic, he told me: \"Because we believe that the wounds are a kind of medal from God. Honouring what we go through fighting a righteous cause.\"",
      "But the group is no longer the force it was since being dealt a devastating blow in Israel's bombing campaign and invasion of Lebanon, which followed the pager attacks, and faces serious challenges. At home, there is discontent among some supporters over the lack of funds for reconstruction, while the new government has vowed to disarm the group. In neighbouring Syria, the ouster of Bashar al-Assad's regime has disrupted the route used by Iran, its main supporter, for the supply of weapons and money.",
      "I visited communities in southern Lebanon that were destroyed by Israel's attacks, and saw that support for Hezbollah appeared undimmed. But, in views rarely expressed to media, others who backed it said the war had been a mistake, and even questioned the group's future as a military force.",
      "You can listen to more from Hugo in his radio documentary - Crossing Continents: Hezbollah in trouble - here",
      "Hezbollah, or Party of God, was created in the 1980s in response to Israel's occupation of Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war. To this day, the destruction of Israel remains one of its official goals. Their last war had been in 2006, which was followed by years of relative calm. Violence flared up again in 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. When Israel started bombarding Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel, saying it was acting in support of Palestinians. Israel responded with air strikes on southern Lebanon, and tens of thousands of people were forced to flee on both sides of the border.",
      "The pager attacks were a turning point in what had been, until then, an intensifying but relatively contained conflict. The devices exploded as people were working, shopping or at home. About a dozen people, including two children, were killed, and thousands wounded, many of them maimed. The attack caused anger in Lebanon, because of what was seen as its indiscriminate nature. A day later, walkie-talkies used by the group suddenly exploded too. I was at a funeral of some of the victims of the pagers when there was a loud blast. Hezbollah members, desperate, asked us to turn off our cameras or phones, as no-one knew what else could explode.",
      "In the following weeks, Israel carried out a relentless bombing campaign and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Across the country, around 4,000 people were killed and almost 18,000 others wounded. For Hezbollah, the conflict proved to be catastrophic. The group's top leaders were assassinated, many of its fighters killed and much of its arsenal destroyed. Among the dead was Hassan Nasrallah, who had been the head of Hezbollah for more than 30 years, assassinated in a massive air strike on the group's secret headquarters under apartment blocks in the Dahieh, where Hezbollah is based in Beirut.",
      "At the end of November, battered, the group agreed on a ceasefire that was essentially a surrender.",
      "Southern Lebanon is the heartland of Lebanon's Shia Muslim community, which is the bulk of Hezbollah's support base, and one of the regions of the country where the group has traditionally had a significant presence. I travelled to the border town of Kfar Kila, which had a pre-war population of 15,000 and was one of the first to fall when Israel invaded. Israel's stated war goal was to allow the return of residents to its northern communities, which had been emptied because of Hezbollah's attacks. In Kfar Kila, there was almost nothing left standing, and yellow Hezbollah flags dotted the huge piles of broken concrete and twisted metal.",
      "A 37-year-old woman called Alia had come with her husband and three daughters, aged 18, 14 and 10. The youngest was wearing a badge with a smiley picture of Nasrallah. \"I only knew that this was my house because of the remains of this plant over there, the roses, and this tree,\" Alia told me. From the street, she pointed at what she could identify in the rubble. \"This is the couch. There, the curtains. That was the living room. And that was the bedroom. That's my daughter's bicycle,\" she said. \"There's nothing to recover\".",
      "According to the World Bank, costs related to reconstruction and recovery are estimated at $11bn (\u00a38.5bn) across the country. One of Hezbollah's immediate challenges is to give financial help to people affected by the war, which is crucial to keep supporters on board. Those who lost their houses have received $12,000 to cover for a year's rent. But the group has not promised money to rebuild what was destroyed or to give compensation for destroyed businesses. The limited support is already fuelling discontent. Aila's shop had stock worth $20,000, and she was concerned no-one would cover her losses.",
      "Iran, Hezbollah's backer, is one of the group's main sources of funds, weapons and training. But Lebanon's international allies want to cut off any financial support from Iran, to put even more pressure on Hezbollah, and say there will be no help if the Lebanese government does not act against Hezbollah. With the group weakened militarily, critics see this as a unique opportunity to disarm it.",
      "Alia told me: \"We don't want any aid that comes with conditions about our arms... We won't allow them to take our dignity, our honour, take away our arms just for us to build a house. We'll build it ourselves.\"",
      "It is not surprising that Hezbollah's supporters remain defiant. For many, the group is a fundamental part of their lives, essential in their identities. But Hezbollah's power is seen - and felt - beyond its base. Before the war, its military wing was considered to be stronger than the Lebanese national army. A solid parliamentary bloc means that virtually no major decision has been possible without Hezbollah's consent. Because of Lebanon's fractured political system, the group has representation in the government. In short, Hezbollah has had the ability to paralyse the state, and many times has done so.",
      "But the war has diminished the group's domestic position too. In January, the Lebanese parliament elected a new president, former army chief Joseph Aoun, after a two-year impasse that critics had blamed on Hezbollah. In the past, its MPs and allies would walk out of the chamber when a vote was scheduled. But Hezbollah, severely wounded and with its communities in need of help, felt it could no longer block the process, which was seen as vital to unlock some international support. In his inauguration speech, Aoun promised to make the Lebanese army the sole carrier of weapons in the country. He did not mention Hezbollah, but everyone understood the message.",
      "Ultimately, Hezbollah's future may lie with Iran. One of the reasons for Iran to have a strong Hezbollah in Lebanon was to deter any Israeli attack, especially on its nuclear facilities. This is now gone. Other groups backed by Iran in the region, part of what it calls the Axis of Resistance, have also been significantly weakened, including Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen. And the fall of the Assad regime in Syria has interrupted Iran's land corridor to Lebanon - and Hezbollah. Even if Iran decides to rearm Hezbollah, it will not be easy.",
      "Nasrallah has been succeeded by Naim Qassem, his former deputy, who is not seen as charismatic or influential. From time to time, rumours emerge of internal disagreements. And whispers of dissent among the rank and file are spreading. In southern Lebanon, I met a businessman who did not want to have his name published, fearing that he could become a target on social media. On the wall of his office, he had pictures of Hezbollah's leaders. Now, he was critical of the group.",
      "\"The mistakes have been huge,\" he said. \"Hezbollah decided to engage in a war to support Gaza without proper calculations, without consulting the people or the Lebanese state\". (To date, Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.) He told me a lot of supporters shared his view. \"If Hezbollah don't do a proper reassessment of the situation... they will destroy themselves and harm us along the way. We brought this destruction on ourselves, and we're now suffering\".",
      "As part of the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah agreed to remove its weapons and fighters from southern Lebanon, and a Western diplomatic official told me the group had largely done it. Israel was required to withdraw its troops, but has remained in five positions, saying this is needed for the safety of its border communities. The Israeli military has also carried out air strikes on targets and people it says are linked to Hezbollah. Lebanon says the Israeli permanence in Lebanese territory and its attacks are violations of the deal.",
      "Discussions about Hezbollah's disarmament are likely to be difficult and long. A source familiar with the group told me one of the options was for Hezbollah's arsenal, believed to still include long-range missiles, to be put under the control of the state, while its fighters, estimated to be several thousand, could be integrated into the Lebanese army.",
      "The businessman told me: \"A lot of the families, especially those of wounded and martyred fighters, are totally dependent on Hezbollah. These people won't disengage from Hezbollah immediately\u2026 Without a plan, it would be a recipe for internal conflict. It would drive Lebanese to fight against each other\".",
      "For weeks, I tried to interview a representative from Hezbollah, but no-one was made available.",
      "Adam, the pager casualty, has now returned to his work as a nurse. He no longer does nightshifts, however, as he cannot see well. The explosion also left shrapnel in his head and chest. As he gets tired easily, he needs to take constant breaks to rest. Physiotherapy sessions are helping him adapt to using what is left of his left thumb and middle finger.",
      "Prominent in his living room, is a picture he framed, of himself, with his injured hands, holding a pager. He shared with me another picture, of his maimed hand, only now it also bore a tattooed message which expressed that his wounds were a cheap sacrifice in honour of Nasrallah, the late Hezbollah leader. He, like many, still believes in the group's purpose, and the role it plays.",

      "The removal of General Timothy Haugh comes amid what appears to be a wider purge of top security officials at the agency and at the White House.",
      "Democrats have said they are \"deeply disturbed\" by the move and say it jeopardises  national security.",
      "It is not clear why Gen Haugh was removed, but it comes after a meeting between President Donald Trump and far-right activist Laura Loomer on Wednesday.",
      "Ms Loomer reportedly urged Trump to fire specific employees whom she suspected lacked support for his agenda.",
      "She posted on X that Gen Haugh and his deputy Wendy Noble, who US media reported was also sacked, \"have been disloyal to President Trump. That is why they have been fired.\"",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has denied that Ms Loomer played a role in the firings.",
      "Before the firings were reported, Trump told reporters he would get rid of any staff deemed to be disloyal.",
      "\"We're always going to let go of people \u2013 people we don't like or people that take advantage of, or people that may have loyalties to someone else,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.",
      "When asked whether Ms Loomer played a role, he said: \"No, not at all.\"",
      "Trump made the comments as reports emerged of the firings of at least three other officials at the White House National Security Council (NSC), following the reported meeting with Ms Loomer. The president did not confirm names.",
      "The National Security Agency (NSA) referred the BBC to the Office of the Secretary of Defense Public Affairs for comment, which said on Friday it had seen the reports but had nothing to offer at this time, and would provide more information when it became available.",
      "The White House previously told the BBC that the NSC \"won't comment on personnel\" matters.",
      "The top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees - Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence - disclosed Gen Haugh's firing to CBS.",
      "Himes said in a statement that he was \"deeply disturbed\" by the decision, CBS reported.",
      "\"I have known General Haugh to be an honest and forthright leader who followed the law and put national security first \u2014 I fear those are precisely the qualities that could lead to his firing in this Administration,\" Himes said.",
      "Those fired from the NSC on Thursday included Brian Walsh, a director for intelligence; Thomas Boodry, a senior director for legislative affairs; and David Feith, a senior director overseeing technology and national security, CBS reported.",
      "It was not clear if Gen Haugh and Ms Noble's removals were connected to those at the NSC.",
      "The firings follow a major controversy involving the NSC last month when senior officials inadvertently added a journalist to a Signal messaging thread about military strikes in Yemen.",
      "Gen Haugh, who was not on the Signal chat, testified on Capitol Hill last week about the leak.",
      "The extent to which that controversy played a role in the firings is unclear.",
      "Trump has so far stood by top officials involved in the incident, including National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who took responsibility for the Atlantic magazine reporter being added to the Signal chat, and said it was an accident.",
      "According to CBS, a source familiar with the situation said the Signal incident \"opened the door\" to looking into staff members believed not to be sufficiently aligned with Trump, while Ms Loomer's visit sealed the fate for those who were terminated.",
      "The administration has been looking at outside meetings held by national security staff, reprimanding some for meeting people not believed to be aligned with the president, according to the source.",
      "Aboard Air Force One en route to Miami, Florida, on Thursday, Trump praised Ms Loomer and confirmed he had met with her, calling her a \"great patriot\" and a \"very strong person\".",
      "\"She makes recommendations\u2026 sometimes I listen to those recommendations,\" he said. \"I listen to everybody and then I make a decision.\"",
      "In a phone call with the BBC, Ms Loomer said it would be \"inappropriate\" to divulge details of her meeting with Trump on Wednesday.",
      "\"It was a confidential meeting,\" she said. \"It's a shame that there are still leakers at the White House who leaked this information.\"",
      "She texted a statement that said: \"It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my research findings.",
      "\"I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of STRONG VETTING, for the sake of protecting the President of the United States of America and our national security.\"",
      "Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, who posted information in the chat, is now the subject of an internal review into his use of Signal and whether he complied with his department's policies, the Pentagon's office of the acting inspector general said on Thursday.",
      "Inspector general offices routinely conduct independent investigations and audits of federal agencies, and look into possible security breaches.",

      "On Tuesday, a former USAID official told the BBC the shuttering of the agency, led by the billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, meant the White House could not send teams from the US to save lives in the immediate aftermath of the 28 March magnitude 7.7 earthquake.",

      "Speaking to reporters at a Nato meeting in Brussels,  Rubio blamed the military regime in Myanmar for the lack of access, even though the state department said earlier this week the country had made a formal request for assistance.",
      "Former USAID officials say their work is seen as non-political, and they have previously accessed countries regarded as politically hostile.",
      "\"That would have impeded our response, no matter what,\" said Rubio.",
      "\"That said, we are willing to continue to help in the humanitarian crisis. Other countries need to do so as well. China is a very rich country. India is a rich country. There are a lot of other countries in the world, and everyone should pitch in.\"",
      "China and India were among the first to have teams on the ground in Myanmar, according to former American humanitarian officials.",
      "Rubio dismissed the accounts of humanitarian aid experts who said the inability to deploy a large US rescue team was due to the USAID cuts.",
      "\"These are people that make millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in these NGOs [non-governmental organisations] all over the world that stand up and they get flooded with the US taxpayer money, and then we have to spend 10 [or] 100 million dollars to get 10 million to people. We're not doing that anymore. Okay? We have stopped. We are no longer going to spend 10 million, 100 million dollars to get 10 million to recipients.",

We will be there, and we will be helpful [but] there are a lot of other rich countries, they should also pitch in and help\u2026 we are going to do our part,\" Rubio added.",
      "As news of the Myanmar earthquake emerged, the White House had reportedly tried to deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) from the US - but could not do so because the Trump administration's cuts had cancelled logistics contracts and fired officials who oversaw such deployments, according to the former officials.",
      "The cuts to USAID had been led by Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) after President Trump targeted foreign assistance on his first day in office, calling it an \"industry\" that was in many cases \"antithetical to American values\".",

    "published": "Thu, 03 Apr 2025 17:55:22 GMT",
    "summary": "The move is announced hours after Israel's PM, who is sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrives in Budapest for a state visit.",
    "story": [
      "Hungary is withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC), its government has announced.",
      "A senior official in Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government confirmed this hours after Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who is sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrived in Hungary for a state visit.",
      "Orban had invited Netanyahu as soon as the warrant was issued last November, saying the ruling would have \"no effect\" in his country.",
      "In November, ICC judges said there were \"reasonable grounds\" that Netanyahu bore \"criminal responsibility\" for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war between Israel and Hamas. Netanyahu has condemned the ICC's decision as \"antisemitic\".",
      "The ICC, a global court, has the authority to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.",
      "Hungary is a founding member of the ICC, which counts 125 member states, and will be the first European Union nation to pull out of it. A withdrawal has no impact on ongoing proceedings.",
      "During a joint press conference, Orban asserted that the ICC had become a \"political court\". He added the court's decision to issue a warrant against the Israeli leader \"clearly showed\" this.",
      "Netanyahu meanwhile hailed Hungary's \"bold and principled\" decision to withdraw from the court.",
      "\"It's important for all democracies. It's important to stand up to this corrupt organisation,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "A statement from the Israeli prime minister's office on Thursday said Netanyahu and Orban had spoken with US President Donald Trump about the decision and the \"next steps that can be taken on this issue\".",
      "Earlier Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar thanked Orban on X for his \"clear and strong moral stance alongside Israel\".",
      "\"The so-called International Criminal Court lost its moral authority after trampling the fundamental principles of international law in its zest for harming Israel's right to self-defence,\" Sa'ar added.",
      "Hungary's decision aligns with its broader foreign policy stance under Orban, who has cultivated close ties with Israel and adopted a critical view of international institutions perceived as infringing on national sovereignty.",
      "While Hungary's withdrawal may carry symbolic weight and political implications, it does not significantly alter the ICC's operational capacity or legal framework.",
      "The court has faced similar challenges in the past and continues to function with broad international support.",
      "But Hungary's criticism of the ICC as \"politically biased\" and its decision to withdraw as Netanyahu visits may set a precedent for other nations to question or abandon their commitments to international justice based on political alliances or disagreements with specific rulings.",
      "The US, Russia, China and North Korea are among the nations that are not part of the ICC, and therefore do not recognise its jurisdiction.",
      "Israel is also not part of the treaty, but the ICC ruled in 2021 that it did have jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, because the UN's Secretary General had accepted that Palestinians were a member.",
      "Hungary now needs to send written notification to the UN Secretary General to leave the treaty, with the withdrawal taking effect one year later, according to article 127 of the Rome Statute, which established the ICC.",
      "ICC spokesman Fadi El-Abdullah told the BBC: \"On the visit of Mr Netanyahu, the court has followed its standard procedures, after the issuance of an arrest warrant. The court recalls that Hungary remains under a duty to cooperate with the ICC.\"",
      "Since the warrant was issued, Hungarian authorities should technically arrest Netanyahu and hand him over to the court in the Hague, although member states do not always choose to enforce ICC warrants.",
      "In Europe, some ICC member states said they would arrest the Israeli leader if he set foot in their country, while others, including Germany, announced that Netanyahu would not be detained if he visited.",
      "But Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Thursday Hungary's announcement was \"a bad day for international criminal law\".",
      "\"Europe has clear rules that apply to all EU member states, and that is the Rome Statute. I have made it clear time and again that no one in Europe is above the law and that applies to all areas of law,\" she added.",
      "On the other side of the Atlantic, the US has condemned the ICC's decision to issue warrants for Netanyahu's arrest and he has visited the country since it was issued in November. His visit to Hungary marks Netanyahu's first trip to Europe since then.",
      "Hungarian Defence Minister Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky, greeted Netanyahu on the tarmac of Budapest airport on Wednesday night, welcoming him to the country.",
      "Israel is appealing against the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and strongly rejects the accusations. It both denies the authority of the ICC and the legitimacy of the warrants.",
      "Netanyahu said at the time that it was a \"dark day in the history of humanity\", and that the ICC had become \"the enemy of humanity\".",
      "\"It's an antisemitic step that has one goal - to deter me, to deter us from having our natural right to defend ourselves against enemies who try to destroy us,\" he said.",
      "In the same ruling, ICC judges also issued a warrant against Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, who Israel says is dead. Hamas also rejected the allegations.",
      "The visit comes as Israel announced it was expanding its Gaza offensive and establishing a new military corridor to put pressure on Hamas, as deadly Israeli strikes continued across the Palestinian territory.",
      "The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed some 1,200 people and led to 251 hostages being taken to Gaza. Since then, Israeli military attacks have killed more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza say."

    "story": [
      "Social media influencers pose a \"new and increasing threat\" for uncontacted indigenous people, a charity has warned after the arrest of a US tourist who travelled to a restricted Indian Ocean island.",
      "Mykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov, 24, allegedly landed on North Sentinel Island in an apparent attempt to make contact with the isolated Sentinelese tribe, filming his visit and leaving a can of coke and a coconut on the shore.",
      "Survival International, a group that advocates for the rights of tribal people, said the alleged act endangered the man's own life and the lives of the tribe, calling it \"deeply disturbing\".",
      "The US said it was aware and \"monitoring the situation\".",
      "Andaman and Nicobar Islands' police chief HGS Dhaliwal told news agency AFP that \"an American citizen\" had been presented before the local court and was remanded for three days for \"further interrogation\".",
      "AFP, citing Mr Dhaliwal, said Mr Polyakov blew a whistle off the shore of the island in a bid to attract the attention of the tribe for about an hour.",
      "He then landed for about five minutes, leaving his offerings, collecting samples and recording a video.",
      "The police chief told AFP: \"A review of his GoPro camera footage showed his entry and landing into the restricted North Sentinel Island.\"",
      "It is illegal for foreigners or Indians to travel within 5km (three miles) of the islands in order to protect the people living there.",
      "According to police, Mr Polyakov has visited the region twice before - including using an inflatable kayak in October last year before he was stopped by hotel staff.",
      "On his arrest earlier this week, the man told police he was a \"thrill seeker\", Indian media reported.",
      "Survival International said the Sentinelese have made their wish to avoid outsiders clear over many years and underlined that such visits pose a threat to a community which has no immunity to outside diseases.",
      "Jonathan Mazower, spokesperson for Survival International, told the BBC they feared social media was adding to the list of threats for uncontacted tribal people. Several media reports have linked Mr Polyakov to a YouTube account, which features videos of a recent trip to Afghanistan.",
      "\"As well as all the somewhat more established threats to such peoples - from things like logging and mining in the Amazon where most uncontacted peoples live - there are now an increasing number of... influencers who are trying to do this kind of thing for followers,\" Mr Mazower said.",
      "\"There's a growing social media fascination with this whole idea.\"",
      "Survival International describes the Sentinelese as \"the most isolated Indigenous people in the world\" living on an island around the size of Manhattan.",
      "Mr Mazower told the BBC an estimated 200 people belong to the tribe, before adding it was \"impossible\" to know its true number.",
      "Few details are known about the group, other than they are a hunter-gatherer community who live in small settlements and are \"extremely healthy\", he said.",
      "He added that the incident highlighted why government protections for communities such as the Sentinelese are so important.",
      "The UN's Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention sets out obligations for governments to protect affected people's rights. India's government has an initiative focusing on tribal welfare, but the country has come under criticism in recent years for failing to protect against evictions.",
      "It is not the first time an outsider has attempted to make contact with the Sentinelese.",
      "In November 2018, John Allen Chau, also a US national, was killed by the tribe after visiting the same island.",
      "Local officials said the 27-year-old was a Christian missionary.",
      "Mr Chau was shot with bows and arrows upon landing. Reports at the time suggested he had bribed fishermen to take him to the island.",

    "story": [
      "India's longest and most holy river, the Ganges, is home to thousands of dolphins. But their survival is under threat.",
      "But these aren't like the ones found in oceans. They don't leap out of the water in spectacular arcs; surface for long intervals or swim in an upright position. Instead, they swim sideways, spend much of their time underwater, have long snouts and are almost completely blind.",
      "These are Gangetic dolphins, a species of river dolphin - and India's national aquatic animal - that's found largely in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system in the northern part of the country.",
      "A new survey finds India's rivers host around 6,327 river dolphins - 6,324 Gangetic and just three Indus dolphins. A majority of the Indus dolphins are found in Pakistan as the river flows through both the South Asian countries.",
      "Both these dolphin species are classified as \"endangered\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
      "Researchers from the Wildlife Institute of India surveyed 58 rivers across 10 states between 2021 and 2023 to produce the first comprehensive count of India's river dolphins.",
      "The origins of river dolphins are as fascinating as the creatures themselves. Often called \"living fossils\", they evolved from marine ancestors millions of years ago, say scientists.",
      "When the sea once flooded low-lying areas of South Asia, these dolphins moved inland - and when the waters receded, they stayed. Over time, they adapted to murky, shallow rivers, developing traits that set them apart from their ocean-dwelling cousins.",
      "Experts say the new survey is crucial for tracking river dolphin populations. Since 1980, at least 500 dolphins have died - many accidentally caught in fishing nets or killed deliberately - highlighting the ongoing threat to the species.",
      "Conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha says that up until the early 2000s, there was very little awareness about river dolphins.",
      "In 2009, the Gangetic river dolphin was declared India's national aquatic animal to boost conservation. Steps like a 2020 action plan and a dedicated research centre in 2024 have since helped revive its numbers.",
      "However, conservationists say there's still a long way to go.",
      "Dolphins continue to be poached for their flesh and blubber, from which oil is extracted to use as fishing bait. Other times, they collide with boats or get caught in fishing lines and die.",
      "Nachiket Kelkar of the Wildlife Conservation Trust told Sanctuary Asia magazine that many fishermen often didn't report accidental deaths of dolphins fearing legal trouble.",
      "Under Indian wildlife laws, accidental or targeted dolphin killings are treated as \"hunting\" and carry strict penalties. As a result, many poor fishermen quietly dispose of the carcasses to avoid fines.",
      "River cruise tourism, which has picked up in India in the past decade, has further threatened their habitat. Dozens of cruise trips operate on both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.",
      "\"There's no doubt that disturbances from cruises will gravely impact the dolphins, which are sensitive to noise,\" conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha told The Guardian newspaper.",
      "Mr Sinha believes that increased vessel traffic could push Gangetic dolphins towards extinction, much like it did to Baiji dolphins in China's Yangtze river.",
      "River dolphins face threats partly due to their own evolution. Nearly blind, they rely on echolocation - high-pitched sound pulses that bounce off objects and return as echoes - to navigate murky waters. While this trait suits their habitat, it also makes them vulnerable to modern threats.",
      "Their poor eyesight and slow swimming speed make river dolphins especially prone to collisions with boats and other obstacles. Adding to their vulnerability is their slow reproductive cycle - they mature between six and 10 years of age and females typically give birth to just one calf every two to three years.",
      "But Mr Sinha is hopeful about the future of river dolphins in India. \"Government initiatives have played a big role in saving the dolphins. A lot has been done but a lot more remains to be done too,\" he says."

    "summary": "The Spanish government is moving to make renting more affordable and boost the supply of homes.",
    "story": [
      "Blanca Castro puts on a builder's helmet before opening the door to her kitchen. Inside it, the ceiling has a large hole that is dripping water and it looks as if it could collapse at any moment.",
      "Because the kitchen is unusable, Blanca has to wash her dishes in the bathtub, and she has improvised a cooking area with a gas camping stove in a corner of her living room.",
      "Many of her fellow tenants in this apartment block near Madrid's Atocha railway station have similar problems. They say the company that owns the building has stopped responding to requests for basic maintenance in recent months, since informing them that it will not renew their rental contracts.",
      "\"The current rental bubble is encouraging a lot of big owners to do what they are doing here,\" says Blanca. \"Which is to get rid of the current tenants who have been here a long time, in order to have short-term tourist flats, or simply to hike up the rent.\"",
      "Blanca and her fellow tenants have vowed to stay in the building despite what they see as efforts to push them out by the owners, who were not available for comment for this article.",
      "The tenancy contracts last five years, during which time rent is fixed, but this area of central Madrid has seen housing costs soar in recent years.",
      "\"For another home like this [in this area], I'd have to pay double or more what I'm paying now,\" says Blanca. \"It's not viable.\"",
      "She and her neighbours are among millions of Spaniards who are suffering the consequences of a housing crisis caused by spiralling rental costs.",
      "While salaries have increased by around 20% over the past decade, the average rental in Spain has doubled during the same period. There has been an 11% increase over the last year alone, according to figures provided by property portal Idealista, and housing has become Spaniards' biggest worry.",
      "It's also generating anger, with Spaniards taking to the streets to demand action from the authorities to make housing more affordable. On Saturday, 5 April thousands of people protested in Madrid and dozens of other cities.",
      "A report by Spain's central bank found that nearly 40% of families who rent now spend more than 40% of their income on their accommodation.",
      "\"The current problem is a huge imbalance between supply and demand,\" says Juan Vill\u00e9n, of Idealista. \"Demand is very good, the economy is growing a lot, but supply is dwindling very fast.\"",
      "Mr Vill\u00e9n offers the example of Barcelona, where rental increases have become notorious. Whereas nine families were competing to rent each property in the city five years ago, that number has risen to 54. Rental costs during that time have increased by 60%, he adds.",
      "\"We need to build more properties,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"And on the rental side we need more people willing to rent their properties, or willing to buy properties, refurbish them and put them on the rental market.\"",
      "How Spain's economy became the envy of Europe",
      "Spain looks to immigrants to drive economy",
      "M\u00e1laga tourism: 'People feel the city is collapsing'",
      "The central government has described the situation as \"a social emergency\" and agrees that a lack of supply is driving the crisis. Last year, the Housing Ministry estimated that the country needs between 600,000 and one million new homes over the next four years in order to meet demand.",
      "This need for more housing has been pushed up in part by the arrival of immigrants who have joined the workforce and are helping drive Spain's economic growth. The ministry also pointed to a lack of social housing, which at 3.4% of total supply, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "In 2007, at the height of a property-ownership bubble, more than 600,000 homes were built in Spain. But high building costs, lack of available land and a shortage of manpower have all been factors in restricting construction in recent years, with just under 100,000 homes completed in 2024.",
      "The government has taken measures to incentivise construction, apportioning land for the building of affordable homes, while trying to ensure that public housing does not end up in the private market, which has been a problem in the past.",
      "But the Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has also expressed a willingness to intervene in the market in order to bring rental prices under control.",
      "At a recent event to mark the opening of 218 low-rent flats in the southern city of Seville, he declared that Spaniards \"want us to act, they want the housing market to operate according to the law of reason, of social justice, not the law of the jungle; they want to ensure that vulture funds and speculators are not doing whatever they like\".",
      "The central government and a number of local administrations have identified short-term tourist accommodation as part of the problem. Last year, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and several cities on the mainland saw protests by locals against surging tourist numbers, with their impact on rental costs the main complaint.",
      "Several city halls have responded by announcing plans to restrict the granting of tourist-flat permits, while Barcelona is going further, revoking the licences of all of the city's 10,000 or so registered short-term apartments by 2028.",
      "The S\u00e1nchez government has also pushed through parliament a housing law, which includes a cap on rentals in so-called \"high-tension\" areas where prices are climbing out of control. Political resistance has meant that the legislation is so far only being implemented in the northern regions of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia, and its success is open to debate.",
      "The Socialist-led regional and central governments have pointed to a 3.7% drop in rental costs in \"high-tension\" areas of Catalonia since the cap's introduction there a year ago, with Barcelona seeing a decrease of 6.4%.",
      "However, critics warn that the rental cap has spooked owners and caused thousands of properties to be withdrawn from the market.",
      "\"On the supply side, the problem is that all measures taken by the local or national governments are going against landlords,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"Even people that were doing build-to-rent new properties have been selling their properties because they don't want to get into the rental market.\"",
      "Another initiative proposed by the central government which has stirred up debate is a tax of up to 100% on properties bought by non-residents from outside the EU, on the grounds that such homes are often barely inhabited. This is a measure that, if rolled out, would heavily affect British buyers.",
      "The conservative opposition has accused the government of being too heavy-handed with its approach. However, as public anger builds over this issue, there are many others who would like the country's leaders to act much more stridently.",
      "Gonzalo \u00c1lvarez, of the Sindicato de Inquilinas e Inquilinos, an organisation that campaigns for tenants' rights, agrees that a shortage of available homes is a problem, but insists that building more is not the answer.",
      "\"There is a lack of housing because homes are being hijacked - on the one hand tourist flats, and on the other hand all the empty flats belonging to vulture funds and the banks,\" he says. \"So there's no need to build more, it's not necessary. But the housing we have has been hijacked.\"",
      "His organisation wants the government to impose drastic mandatory reductions in rent on owners and is threatening to orchestrate a nationwide strike by tenants that would see participants refuse to pay their rent.",
      "\"The [central and local] governments are not setting any limits,\" says Mr \u00c1lvarez. \"So who is going to? We will have to do it.\"",

    "summary": "Yasin Akrul says his arrest was a warning to stop others taking pictures of the demonstrations in Turkey.",
    "story": [
      "It was early morning on 23 March when the police came to Yasin Akgul's door in Istanbul \u2013 while his children were still in bed. Just hours before, the Turkish photojournalist had returned home from covering mass anti-government protests. Now he was a wanted man.",
      "\"I went to the door and saw there was a lot of police,\" he says. \"They said they had an arrest order for me but gave me no details. My son was awake, and I couldn't even tell him what was happening as I didn't get it myself.\"",
      "Akgul, 35, has seen \"plenty of action\" in more than a decade as a photojournalist with the AFP news agency \u2013 from war-torn Syria to IS-controlled Iraq. On home soil in Turkey, he has been beaten by the police several times while taking pictures, he says - including on World Peace Day \u2013 and has been detained \"so many times\".",
      "But being arrested at home was a first.",
      "\"A chill fell over the house,\" he tells us. \"In my work, at the protests, I have seen a lot of violence, and tear gas, but having the police in my home, I felt more afraid.\"",
      "Akgul was one of seven journalists arrested in dawn raids. All had been covering the protests sparked by the arrest of the city's opposition mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu \u2013 the main political rival of Turkey's long-time leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "The protesters say the mayor's arrest over corruption charges, which he denies, is politically motivated \u2013 an attempt to end his hopes of becoming the country's next president.",
      "The authorities had banned the protests but had been unable to stop them.",
      "Akgul is facing charges of \"taking part in illegal rallies and marches\". He says the aim is clear \u2013 to stop others taking pictures of the biggest unrest in Turkey in more than a decade.",
      "He was in the thick of it \u2013 gas mask on \u2013 when he took some of the most iconic images of the night.",
      "His photos show a man dressed as a whirling dervish (a dancing mystic) being pepper-sprayed by a line of riot police \u2013 striking images of a battle for the soul of Turkey that went around the world, before landing him behind bars.",
      "\"This message is to all the journalists,\" he says. \"Don't shoot (take pictures), don't speak, don't film. They are making other journalists afraid that if they go back into the field, they could face the same thing.\"  The fact that he works for an international news agency, AFP, makes that message even louder, he believes.",
      "It has been received and understood.",
      "\"After we were arrested, many freelance journalists could not shoot the next day. Everyone was afraid,\" he told us, sitting on his couch at home with his wife Hazal by his side.",
      "Their three-year-old daughter, Ipek, lay on the couch, holding her father's hand. Their son, Umut, eight, listened on, wearing a Harry Potter-style hat and glasses.",
      "Akgul believes those arrested were carefully chosen \u2013 among them seasoned photojournalists. \"They are trying to remove us from the front lines,\" he says.",
      "Plenty of his friends \u2013 fellow journalists - have already removed themselves, leaving Turkey because they faced charges or feared they would.",
      "For now, his family is among many here worrying that they could be torn apart by the courts. The government says the judiciary is independent. Human rights groups say judges are under political control, and Turkish democracy is being eroded, year on year.",
      "President Erdogan \u2013 who has many loyal supporters - retains a tight grip on the levers of power. He says the protests are \"street terrorism\" and accuses the opposition of leading \"a movement of violence\". He has predicted that the demonstrations will wane.",

      "As Yasin Akgul was being released from prison on the morning of 27 March, the BBC's Mark Lowen was being deported from Istanbul, after 17 hours in detention. He was given papers saying he was \"a threat to public order\".",
      "The authorities later said \u2013 after the BBC reported the story \u2013 that he had been deported because he lacked accreditation.",
      "It's not only journalists who are at risk. One of the mayor's own lawyers was detained briefly \"on fictitious grounds\", according to a social media post that Ekrem Imamoglu sent from his cell in a high security prison.",
      "His legal team fight on, but they too are feeling the chill.",
      "\"The right to a defence, I think, is sacred. It's part of a fair trial that your lawyers should feel comfortable and safe,\" says Ece Guner, who is both a lawyer, and an adviser to the mayor.",
      "\"It would be a lie to say that no-one is worried, to be honest,\" she tells us, \"but we still feel we have a duty to our country to say the truth, to preserve democracy, and the rule of law.\"",
      "Where does Turkish democracy stand now? Some here fear it's on its last gasp.",
      "In the past two weeks or so \u2013 since the protests began on 19 March - around 2,000 people have been detained, according to Turkey's interior ministry.",

      "\"Public bodies are under threat,\" she says. \"If they speak out and use their voices with authority, there is an attempt to stifle them immediately.\"",
      "She expects that the coming months will see continuing attempts to limit the protests, and \"render them invisible\".",
      "That won't be hard given the government's extensive control of the media here.  The huge demonstrations held so far didn't lead the bulletins on state TV and pro-government outlets, and when they were shown the protesters were referred to as terrorists.",
      "The most recent rally - last weekend - attracted several hundred thousand people, at the least. The opposition claims more than two million people attended.",
      "Some families brought several generations with them to hear calls for change under a warm sun. We saw the usual heavy police presence but this time there was no tear gas, or rubber bullets. This rally was not banned.",
      "Among the throng we met Alp, 32, who said he had come to defend democracy while there was still time. We didn't ask for a surname \u2013 many protesters prefer not to give theirs. He said he was concerned about the risk of arrest.",

      "\"So, all of us are in danger right now. But we have to stand up. That's our only choice. If we don't do anything, if we just watch, the battle is lost already.\"",

      "Opposition polls suggest President Erdogan would lose to Imamoglu \u2013 if he were freed from jail and able to run as a candidate.",
      "The president himself should not be able to run - as he is already in his second term - but there's speculation here that he could try to change the constitution.",
      "The opposition insists there will be weekly protests from now on. If so, it looks certain that the arrests will continue.",
      "It's unclear if Yasin Akgul's case will go to trial, but the charges against him remain. Despite the danger he hopes to keep telling the story here.",

    "summary": "What impact will the introduction of hefty tariffs on countries in Asia have on Nike's iconic US trainer?",
    "story": [
      "The Nike Air Jordan 1 is, in some ways, the iconic US trainer. It's a popular line by a large American brand, created four decades ago for homegrown basketball legend Michael Jordan.",
      "But although Nike sells most of its products in the US, almost all of its trainers are made in Asia \u2013 a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs salvo against foreign countries he accuses of \"ripping off\" Americans.",
      "Nike's shares fell 14% the day after the tariffs announcement, on fears over the impact they could have on the company's supply chain.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "So what will all this mean for the price of Nike's trainer?",
      "It depends on how much of the cost increase Nike decides to pass on to customers, if any, and how long they think the tariffs will actually be in place for.",
      "'Competitive industry'",
      "Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%.",
      "Hopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a \"very productive\" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls.",
      "But most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up.",
      "Swiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes.",
      "Meanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its trainer production.",
      "\"Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realise there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,\" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note.",
      "David Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand.",
      "\"This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,\" he says.",
      "Many other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament.",
      "Nike is already facing a tight bottom line.",
      "It had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.",
      "But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.",
      "By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%.",
      "That is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.",
      "Rahul Cee, who set up the trainer review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low.",
      "Mr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer.",
      "\"So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),\" he says.",
      "Another option would be instead of bringing out a new design every one to two years, to refresh the design cycle every three to four years.",
      "Things could change fast",
      "Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, says most companies were looking at Wednesday's announcement as \"still far from the final conclusion\".",
      "\"I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,\" he says.",
      "Theoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: \"Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?\"",
      "Even before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes.",
      "Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.",
      "And Nike relies heavily on US sales, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America.",
      "Sentiment in the US is a \"significant concern\" for Nike as it directly affects demand for its footwear, says Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.",

      "Nintendo pulls Switch 2 pre-orders in US over Trump tariffs",

      "He adds: \"How US trading partners react against the reciprocal tariff policy will also have a major impact.\"",
      "China has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own.",

      "South Korea's president has been removed from office after the Constitutional Court voted unanimously to uphold his impeachment.",
      "Yoon Suk Yeol was suspended from duty in December after being impeached by parliament, following his failed attempt to impose martial law.",
      "The ruling on Friday was met with tears of joy and sadness among Yoon's critics and supporters, who had gathered in various parts of Seoul to watch the verdict live.",
      "A snap election to vote for Yoon's replacement must be held by 3 June.",
      "What next for South Korea?",
      "After months of anxiously waiting, South Koreans have some badly needed closure. The country can now start to repair and move forward, the first step being to elect a new leader.",
      "But the crisis Yoon has unleashed is far from over. Although his military takeover only lasted six hours, the political fallout has only intensified with each month that has passed.",
      "The night of 3 December, when Yoon ordered troops to storm parliament, changed something in South Korea's psyche. It reawakened the ghosts of the country's violent, dictatorial past, showing people that martial law was not, as most had assumed, consigned to history.",
      "Many are still upset by what happened that night, and afraid that the threat of martial law could be brandished again by future zealous politicians.",
      "Today's verdict therefore came as a relief to most, who cheered on the streets of Seoul as the verdict was read out. It is a victory for South Korea's democracy, that for a while looked as if it was on dangerous ground.",
      "The Constitutional Court was damning in its criticism of Yoon's authoritarian power grab, as all eight judges voted to remove him from office.",
      "Moon Hyung-bae, acting president of the bench, said Yoon's short-lived military takeover was not justified, and that he had \"[gone] against the people he was supposed to protect\".",
      "He added that the implementation of martial law \"damaged people's basic political rights\" and \"violated the principles of the rule of law and democracy\".",
      "Already, there are serious calls to change South Korea's constitution \u2013 to strengthen its institutions and limit the powers of the president - to guard against this happening again. However, it will take a particularly patriotic future president to sign off on reducing their own authority.",
      "South Korea more polarised than ever",
      "As Yoon leaves office, he leaves behind not just a shaken country, but a divided one. In the aftermath of that shocking December night, South Koreans were mostly united in their disgust for the president and what he had attempted to do.",
      "But Yoon showed no remorse. He dug in, fought his trial at every step, and continued to dangle the same unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that he used to justify his military takeover.",
      "He claimed that the country and his political opposition had been infiltrated by North Korean and Chinese spies, and that these \"anti-state forces\" had rigged past elections.",
      "Gradually more and more people believed him. To them Yoon is now a political martyr \u2013 the victim of an establishment that had been overrun by \"communists\".",
      "His conspiracy theories have firmly taken root, and far-right extremism is flourishing. Thousands protest every week in the centre of Seoul. They were on the streets on Friday, and will be there again Saturday, claiming the country's politicians and judges are corrupt and elections are rigged.",
      "And these are not fringe views.",
      "More than a third of people now say they do not trust the Constitutional Court which delivered Yoon's verdict; more than a quarter do not trust the voting system.",
      "Within this climate of distrust, South Korea must head to the polls. Yoon's successor needs to be chosen in the next 60 days. These days are sure to be fraught and even more divisive. Many may not accept the result that comes.",
      "Yet South Korea urgently needs a new leader who can advocate for the country as a whole, having been without one for months.",
      "It quickly needs to figure out how to deal with President Trump, having started on the backfoot. His 25% tariffs on cars and steel have dealt Seoul, and its ailing economy, an early a blow, but many believe worse is coming; that it is only time until Trump turns his gaze to the Korean peninsula, and when he does he will try to force South Korea to pay more for its defence and cut a deal with Seoul's arch enemy, Kim Jong Un.",
      "Yoon's legal team has accused the court of politicising the ruling.",
      "\"The whole process of this trial itself was not lawful and unfair,\" said one of his lawyers, Yoon Gap-geun.",
      "\"I feel regrettable that this completely is a political decision,\" he said.",
      "But politicians are calling for unity, asking everyone to accept the verdict, so South Korea can start to move on.",
      "Yoon's political party, the PPP, has conceded, but Yoon himself has not. In a statement he apologised to his supporters for his \"shortcomings\" without mentioning the ruling.",
      "\"I am truly sorry and regretful that I could not live up to your expectations,\" he said.",
      "\"It has been a great honor to serve the Republic of Korea. I am deeply grateful to all of you who supported and encouraged me, despite my many shortcomings,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "On a quick drive around the small Ohio town of Delta, you can spot nearly as many Trump flags as American stars-and-stripes banners.",
      "And at the petrol station near the Ohio Turnpike, the pumps bear relics of the last administration, with slogans slamming Trump's predecessor: \"Whoever voted for Biden owes me gas money!\"",
      "This is Trump country - the Republican ticket easily won here in November's presidential election by a margin of almost two-to-one. And while the markets are in turmoil following Trump's unveiling of expansive global tariffs this week, plenty of people in Delta and hundreds of Midwestern towns like it still back the president's plans.",
      "Those plans, to impose tariffs of between 10% and 50% on almost every country, have upended global trade and led to warnings that prices could soon rise for American consumers. Trump, meanwhile, has said the move will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry and raise revenue.",
      "For some in Delta, the president's argument about fairness resonates.",
      "\"I don't want people in other countries to suffer, I really don't,\" said Mary Miller, manager of the Delta Candy Emporium, which sits in the middle of the village's Main Street. \"But we need to have an even playing field.\"",
      "Miller, a three-time Trump voter, believes other countries haven't played fair on trade. And like many here, she prefers to buy American-made goods.",
      "As she watches over her stock of multi-coloured confectioneries, many of them made in the US, and weighs up how they might be impacted by fresh import taxes, she recalls how decades ago she heard that one of her favourite brands was moving its factories abroad. She hasn't bought another pair of Levi's jeans since.",
      "Miller is unfazed by the possibility of price increases, which many economists say these new tariffs will bring.",
      "\"Sometimes you have to walk through fire to get to the other side,\" she said.",

      "These sentiments are common in Delta, a village of around 3,300 people less than 100 miles (160km) south of Detroit, even as other Midwestern towns brace for sharp shocks.",
      "The automotive industry, with its complicated global supply chains, seems particularly vulnerable to the impact of major new tariffs, with companies in Michigan to the north and Indiana to the west already announcing factory shutdowns and job cuts.",
      "But on the outskirts of Delta, there is a cluster of steel businesses that have been here since the 1990s and which may be better placed in a new era of American protectionism.",
      "One of these businesses, North Star BlueScope, has urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium. At the same time, however, it has asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.",
      "North Star BlueScope did not respond to interview requests, but in a back room at the nearby Barn Restaurant, a few local steelworkers who had just finished the night shift were drinking beers together early on Friday morning.",
      "The workers, who asked not to be named, mostly laughed and shrugged when asked about the sweeping new tariffs that were announced by Trump at the White House on Wednesday.",
      "It was a pretty clear indication that this economic news is unlikely to ruin their weekend.",
      "Outside the restaurant, some Delta locals considered the possible upsides of these import taxes.",
      "\"Nobody's frantic. We're not going to lose any sleep over it,\" said Gene Burkholder, who has a decades-long career in the agriculture industry.",
      "Although he owns some stocks, Mr Burkholder said they were long-term investments and he was not obsessing over the sharp drops in the two days following the president's announcement.",
      "\"If you have some spare cash, maybe it's a good time to buy some shares while they're cheap,\" he said.",
      "A couple of booths over, as she finished eating breakfast with her son Rob, Louise Gilson said - quietly - that she did not really trust the president.",
      "But Gilson, along with many people here, said she wanted to see action. She wholeheartedly agreed when another diner commented: \"Trump may be wrong, but at least he's trying.\"",
      "\"The other people wouldn't have done squat,\" she said, referring to the Democratic Party.",
      "The Gilsons agreed that the big local industrial employers have generally been good neighbours, contributing to the local economy, charities and the wider community, even as they have seen some less desirable effects of industrial development and worry about unequal sharing of the economic pie.",
      "And as they recounted Delta's history, they described a gradual erosion in quality of life that they believe has made many people willing to roll the dice even when economists say Trump's tariff plan comes with stark risks.",
      "\"It was a good little town to grow up in,\" Rob Gilson recalled. But he said it now seemed less safe and friendly than when he was growing up in the 60s and 70s.",
      "\"It seems like the heart of America is gone,\" he said.",
      "Delta, Louise Gilson added, \"is the kind of place where 25% or 30% of the people are struggling with their demons\".",

      "Thursday was a \"terrible\" and \"devastating\" day for people involved in Lesotho's textile sector as they digested the news that the country's exports to the US would be hit by a 50% import tax, or tariff.",
      "Teboho Kobeli, who founded Afri-Expo Textiles and employs 2,000 people in the country, could barely disguise his distress as he told the BBC about the impact of potentially losing a huge chunk of the US market because the prices of his goods will have to increase.",
      "The small southern African nation has become the poster child for the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) \u2013 a 25-year-old piece of US legislation guaranteeing duty-free access to American consumers for certain goods from Africa.",
      "Considered the cornerstone of US-Africa economic relations, the aim was to help industrialise the continent, create employment and lift dozens of countries out of poverty.",
      "It was based on a philosophy of replacing aid with trade.",
      "The act's overall impact is debateable but it has been credited with creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, particularly in the textiles sector.",

      "How jeans and diamonds pushed Lesotho to the top of Trump's tariffs list",
      "Like so much that has come out of the White House in the whirlwind first few weeks of his presidency, Wednesday's announcement has sown confusion \u2013 especially, in this case, in Africa.",
      "On the one hand there is Agoa, with its tariff-free arrangement, and on the other there is Trump outlining tariffs ranging from 10% (including Kenya, Ethiopia and Ghana) to 31% (South Africa) and 50% (Lesotho).",
      "Which takes precedence?",
      "South Africa, which exports metals and cars to the US, believes this spells the end of Agoa.",
      "\"The reciprocal tariffs effectively nullify the preferences that sub-Saharan Africa countries enjoy under Agoa,\" South Africa's foreign and trade ministers said in a joint statement on Friday.",
      "But Kenya's Principal Secretary for Foreign Affairs Korir Sing'oei had a different take.",
      "\"It is our considered view that until the law lapses end of September 2025 or unless repealed earlier by Congress, the new tariffs imposed by President Trump will, in any event, still not be immediately applicable,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Kenya, which exports clothes to the US, has tried to put a brave face on the issue, saying that as it was not hit as hard as other textile exporters, such as Vietnam and Sri Lanka, it would still have a competitive advantage.",
      "Whatever happens to Agoa in the immediate term, it seems that Trump's sweeping tariffs have scuppered hopes of the legislation being renewed.",
      "The Clinton-era law, which in the current climate is beginning to feel like a relic of a bygone time, was up for renewal later this year.",
      "Since 2000, certain African countries had duty-free access to the US market for a raft of goods including clothing and textiles, cocoa products and wine, as well as crude oil.",
      "The access was tied to a number of conditions including free market policies, labour and human rights and political pluralism. Thirty-two countries from sub-Saharan Africa were eligible as of last year.",
      "In 2023, two-way trade under Agoa totalled $47.5bn (\u00a336.4bn), with the US exporting $18.2bn billion worth of goods and imports amounting to $29.3bn.",
      "By virtue of being among the continent's largest economies, South Africa and Nigeria have dominated trade under the act, but Lesotho has taken full advantage and has become a significant exporters of garments to the US, supplying brands such as Walmart, GAP and Old Navy.",
      "But a future without Agoa \u2013 for Lesotho and others \u2013 presents big challenges.",
      "If nothing changes, \"a tariff of 50% sounds like a death knell to the Agoa manufacturing in Lesotho\", says Mukhisa Kituyi, a former secretary-general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development and a former Kenyan trade minister.",
      "In 2018, the World Bank modelled a scenario where Lesotho experienced the sudden loss of Agoa privileges and found that the impact would \"reach 1% of GDP\" within two years. The report concluded that impact on welfare would be \"dramatic.\"",
      "But, as witnessed with the aid cuts, arguing about the human impact or fairness will not fly in the current set-up, in the face of \"disruptive populism and post-fact, post-truth society\", Dr Kituyi argues.",
      "He thinks countries, like Kenya, that have the new tariffs set at 10% could still try to hold ground in the US market, with the exporters and their American importers negotiating how to absorb the new taxes without raising prices for the consumer too much.",
      "As Dr Kituyi was involved in trade negotiations, including Agoa, he has seen first-hand the effort that goes into \"fine-tuning these processes\" to create a \"shared benefit from stable, predictable rules-based trading\".",
      "But now, he reckons, such agreements are \"hostage to the wishes of the dominant political group in America\".",
      "Michelle Gavin, a senior fellow for Africa policy studies at the Washington-based Council for Foreign Relations, said the way the new tariffs have been calculated \"makes no sense at all\" to economists.",
      "It's difficult to sort of see \"any kind of clear strategy or intention,\" from the Trump administration so far, she tells the BBC.",
      "But the decisions will only exacerbate the loss of American influence in Africa, she warns. China, already the continent's biggest trading partner, could take further advantage.",
      "\"It looks like a withdrawal, an ignoring of an entire huge region of the world,\" Ms Gavin says.",
      "Coming shortly after the Trump administration severely pared back the US Agency for International Development, leading to the cancelation of both humanitarian and life-saving health assistance, the analyst says America appears to be \"destroying its own instruments of influence with abandon now\".",
      "How were Donald Trump's tariffs calculated?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Tariffs are yet another example of colossal, upending change",
      "Agoa has long been viewed as an important tool of US soft power, especially in countering the growing influence of China and Russia in Africa.",
      "There has in the past been bipartisan support for it among American legislators, and Dr Kituyi sees this as \"a glimmer of hope\".",
      "A bill seeking a renewal of Agoa until 2041 was released by Democrat Senator Chris Coons over a year ago, but it may not make any progress in the current Congress.",
      "Ms Gavin does not believe that Agoa is now a priority given the global upheaval Trump's drastic and unpredictable policy shifts have created.",
      "\"I think a non-reciprocal trade agreement is a very tough sell for this Congress, which is dominated by the Republican Party that has thus far been quite accommodating of the administration's agenda.\"",
      "She believes that while it \"makes good sense as a matter of policy,\" it is unlikely to be front and centre of legislators' agenda \"as a matter of politics\" even if Congress starts to assert itself more.",
      "As Trump's tariffs throw the world into turmoil, the specific needs of the continent are unlikely to be uppermost for others around the world.",
      "If Agoa does become defunct, Africa will have to look within itself and make good on the promises of creating a continental free-trade area. It will also have to work harder to find new trading partners or expand existing markets.",

      "But a week or so ago the rollercoaster ride began.",
      "After Vladimir Putin had proposed replacing President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration with \"external governance\" in Ukraine under the auspices of the UN, President Trump made it known that he was \"angry\" with Putin.",
      "\"I was disappointed in a certain way, some of the things that were said over the last day or two having to do with Zelensky,\" Trump commented on 30 March. \"Because when [Putin] considers Zelensky not credible, he's supposed to be making a deal with him.

    "summary": "Israeli air strikes on bases in Syria are a warning to Turkey to keep its military assets away.",
    "story": [
      "A growing confrontation between Israel and Turkey over influence in Syria is posing a serious challenge for Syria's fragile new government.",
      "On Wednesday night, Israel bombed several military targets in Syria, including two airports \u2013 Hama military airport and the T4 base near Homs.",
      "Syria's foreign ministry said the bombardment virtually destroyed the Hama base.  A prominent Syrian human rights group said four defence ministry employees were killed, and a dozen other people injured.",
      "The air strikes hit Syria, but their real target was Turkey.",
      "Shortly afterwards, Israel's foreign minister accused Turkey of playing a \"negative role\" in Syria, and Israel's defence minister warned Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, that he would \"pay a very heavy price\" if he allowed \"hostile forces\" to enter his country.",
      "Ankara is currently negotiating a joint defence pact with Sharaa's new government, and there have been widespread reports that Turkey is moving to station aircraft and air defence systems at Syria's T4 and Aleppo airbases.",
      "Some analysts compared Israel's intense air strikes on Hama airport this week with the much lighter bombing on the edge of the T4 base, suggesting that Turkey may have already moved some equipment there and that Israel was calibrating its attack to avoid a full-blown escalation.",
      "Relations between Israel and Turkey have nose-dived since the Gaza war began in October 2023, with Ankara introducing trade restrictions and accusing Israel of genocide.",
      "That regional tension is now playing out on new ground in Syria.",
      "After the air strikes on Wednesday, Turkey's foreign ministry accused Israel of destabilising the region by \"both causing chaos and feeding terrorism\" and said it was now the greatest threat to the security of the region.",
      "But foreign minister Hakan Fidan told Reuters news agency that his country was not seeking confrontation with Israel, and that Syria could set its own policies with its southern neighbour.",
      "Syria's new leader has repeatedly signalled that he was not looking for confrontation with Israel.  Soon after sweeping President Bashar al-Assad from power last December, he told the BBC that Syria would not pose a threat to any country.",
      "He has even left the door open to normalising diplomatic relations with Israel in the future, telling the Economist last month that Syria wanted peace with all parties, but that it was too early to discuss such a sensitive issue.",
      "His top priority since taking power has been to unite a bitterly divided Syria, and pacify external relations with its neighbours, while he cements his power and control.",
      "But Israel has not made that easy. Its military interventions in Syria are fuelling conflict with both external powers like Turkey, and with internal groups like jihadists in the country's south.",
      "Once an implacable enemy of Syria's former president and his Iranian ally, Israel is also suspicious of Sharaa, a man who once led the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda and whose new government is backed by Turkey.",
      "Since he took power, Israel's military has repeatedly pounded Syrian weapons stores, airfields and other military sites left by the former regime, to avoid them falling into enemy hands, it says.",
      "It has also occupied a demilitarised buffer zone, set up after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and has sent forces onto the Syrian side of a nearby mountain, setting up nine bases across the area.",
      "Israeli troops are also making regular incursions into Syria's south-western provinces, vowing to prevent the presence of any armed groups or government forces there.",
      "Earlier this week, the local government in the southern city of Deraa said nine civilians were killed in an Israeli bombardment, during the deepest incursion there yet by Israeli forces.",
      "Another four people were killed in Israeli shelling near the village of Koya late last month, after local gunmen tried to stop the advance of Israeli forces there.",
      "Since then, mosques in both Deraa and Damascus have reportedly called for jihad against Israeli forces.",
      "Charles Lister, head of the Syria Programme at the US-based Middle East Institute, which studies the region, has counted more than 70 ground incursions into south-west Syria since February, describing this as \"an extraordinarily dangerous moment \u2013 and an unnecessary one\".",
      "Since the fall of Assad four months ago, he says, not one attack has targeted Israel from Syria and the country's security forces have intercepted \"at least 18 weapons shipments destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon, and dismantled at least eight formerly Iranian-linked rocket launch sites\".",
      "Many Syrians are disappointed by Israel's response to their new government. They watched for years as Israel targeted the Assad regime, and believed that Assad's fall would bring the chance for a less confrontational relationship with Israel.",
      "Some say that view is now changing.",
      "\"We used to believe that the Israeli army was only targeting Assad's regime forces,\" said Ismail, a restaurant owner in the west of the country.  \"But its continued, incomprehensible bombings are sadly making us think that Israel is an enemy of the Syrian people.\"",
      "Syria is vulnerable because its internal divisions are easily inflamed by regional and global interventions. The roots of sectarian conflict run deep here, nourished by decades of repressive rule by the Assad family, members of Syria's Alawite minority.",
      "Ahmed al-Sharaa's attempts to reassure the country's minorities were interrupted in early March by an explosion of violence in Syria's coastal region \u2013 a stronghold of the former regime.",
      "At least 1,000 Alawite civilians or disarmed fighters were massacred by pro-government forces, after government units were ambushed in a co-ordinated attack led by remnants of Syria's former armed forces.",
      "Those former armed forces were once backed by Iran.  Some analysts believe their remnants may still be receiving some support from Tehran.",
      "Syrians celebrated the fall of Bashar al-Assad as an end to their civil war, and a chance to unite.",
      "But outside powers helped fuel that civil war for more than a decade, and its neighbours are now eyeing the vacuum left by Assad. The risk is growing that Syria will again fall victim to the conflicts of outside powers, played out on Syrian soil."

    "summary": "Could the National Rally retaliate in parliament by attempting to bring down the fragile coalition government?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Andrew read this article",
      "Outrage is a precious political currency and France's far right has spent this week attempting, furiously and predictably, to capitalise on the perceived injustice of a court's decision to block its totemic leader, Marine Le Pen, from standing in the 2027 presidential election.",
      "The airwaves have been throbbing with indignation.",
      "\"Be outraged,\" said one of Le Pen's key deputies, on French television, in case anyone was in doubt as to what their reaction should be.",
      "But it remains unclear whether Le Pen's tough sentence will broaden support for her party, the National Rally (RN), or lead to greater fragmentation of the French far right. Either way, it has created a feverish mood among the nation's politicians.",
      "Le Pen and her allies have boldly declared that France's institutions, and democracy itself, have been \"executed\", are \"dead\", or \"violated\". The country's justice system has been turned into a \"political\" hit squad, shamelessly intervening in a nation's right to choose its own leaders. And Marine Le Pen has been widely portrayed, with something close to certainty, as France's president-in-waiting, as the nation's most popular politician, cruelly robbed of her near-inevitable procession towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.",
      "\"The system has released a nuclear bomb, and if it is using such a powerful weapon against us, it is obviously because we are about to win the elections,\" Le Pen fumed at a news conference, comparing herself to the poisoned, imprisoned, and now dead Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny.",
      "As France assesses its latest political tremors, an uneven pushback has begun.",
      "No clear frontrunner for president",
      "Nervous about the impact the judgement may have for the country's frail coalition government, the Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has admitted to feeling \"troubled\" by Le Pen's sentence and worried about a \"shock\" to public opinion.",
      "But other centrist politicians have taken a firmer line, stressing the need for a clear gap between the justice system and politics.",
      "An early opinion poll appears to show the French public taking a calm line, bursting \u2013 or at least deflating \u2013 the RN's bubble of outrage. The poll, produced within hours of the court's ruling, showed less than a third of the country \u2013 31% - felt the decision to block Le Pen, immediately, from running for public office, was unjust.",
      "Tellingly, that figure was less than the 37% of French people who recently expressed an interest in voting for her as president.",
      "In other words, plenty of people who like her as a politician also think it reasonable that her crimes should disqualify her from running for office.",
      "And remember, French presidential elections are still two years away \u2013 an eternity in the current political climate.",
      "Emmanuel Macron is not entitled to stand for another term and no clear alternative to Le Pen, from the left or centre of French politics, has yet emerged. Le Pen's share of the vote has consistently risen during her previous three failed bids for the top job but it is premature, at best, to consider her a shoo-in for 2027.",
      "Le Pen's crime and punishment",
      "Anyone who followed the court case against her and her party colleagues in an impartial fashion would struggle to conclude that the verdicts in Le Pen's case were unreasonable.",
      "The evidence of a massive and coordinated project to defraud the European Parliament and its associated taxpayers included jaw-droppingly incriminating emails suggesting officials knew exactly what they were doing, and the illegality of their actions.",
      "That the corruption was for the party, not for personal gain, surely changes nothing. Corruption is corruption. Besides, other parties have also been found guilty of similar offences.",
      "Regarding the punishments handed out by the court, here it seems fair to argue that Le Pen and her party made a strategic blunder in their approach to the case.",
      "Had they acknowledged the facts, and their errors, and cooperated in facilitating a swift trial rather than helping to drag the process out for almost a decade, the judges \u2013 as they've now made clear \u2013 might have taken their attitude towards the case into consideration when considering punishments.",
      "\"Neither during the investigation nor at the trial did [Le Pen] show any awareness of the need for probity as an elected official, nor of the ensuing responsibilities,\" wrote the judges in a document explaining, often indignantly, why they'd delivered such a tough sentence.",
      "They berated Le Pen for seeking to delay or avoid justice with \"a defence system that disregards the uncovering of the truth\".",
      "Hypocrisy among the elite",
      "It is worth noting, here, the wider hypocrisy demonstrated by elites across France's political spectrum who have recently been muttering their sympathy for Le Pen. It is nine years since MPs voted to toughen up the laws on corruption, introducing the very sanctions - on immediately banning criminals from public office - that were used by the judges in this case.",
      "That toughening was welcomed by the public as an antidote to a judicial system stymied by an indulgent culture of successive appeals that enabled \u2013 and sometimes still enables - politicians to dodge accountability for decades.",
      "Le Pen is now being gleefully taunted by her critics online with the many past instances in which she has called for stricter laws on corruption.",
      "\"When are we going to learn the lessons and effectively introduce lifelong ineligibility for those who have been convicted of acts committed while in office or during their term of office?\" she asked in 2013.",
      "Reasonable people can reasonably disagree about the court's sentencing decisions in Le Pen's case. But the notion \u2013 enthusiastically endorsed by populist and hard-right politicians across Europe and the US \u2013 that she is a victim of a conspiratorial political plot has clearly not convinced most French people.",
      "At least not yet.",
      "Future of France's far right",
      "So where does this verdict \u2013 clearly a seismic moment in French politics \u2013 leave the National Rally and the wider far-right movement?",
      "The short answer is that no one knows. There are so many variables involved \u2013 from the fate of Le Pen's fast-tracked appeal, to the RN's succession strategy, to the state of France's precarious finances, to the broader political climate and the see-sawing appetite for populism both within France and globally \u2013 that predictions are an even more dubious game than usual.",
      "The most immediate question \u2013 given the slow pace of the legal appeal that Le Pen has vowed to initiate \u2013 is whether the RN will seek prompt revenge in parliament by attempting to bring down the fragile coalition government of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou.",
      "That could lead to new parliamentary elections this summer and the possibility that the RN could capitalise on its victim status to increase its lead in parliament and perhaps, even, to push the country towards a deadlock in which President Macron might \u2013 yet another \"might\" \u2013 feel obliged to step down.",
      "One person who will now be facing extra scrutiny is Le Pen's almost but not quite anointed successor, 29-year-old Jordan Bardella, who could be drafted in as a replacement presidential candidate if Le Pen's own \"narrow path\" towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e remains blocked on appeal.",
      "If social-media-savvy Bardella's popularity among French youth is any indication of his prospects, he could well sweep to victory in 2027. He has found a way to tap into the frustrations of people angry about falling living standards and concerns about immigration.",
      "But turning youthful support into actual votes is not always straightforward, and other, more experienced and mainstream figures on the right may well be sensing an opportunity too.",
      "The Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, is widely seen to be emerging as a potential contender. Some even wonder if the provocative television personality, Cyril Hanouna, might become a serious political force on the right of French politics.",
      "Meanwhile, Bardella, like the RN in general, has been on a highly disciplined mission to detoxify the party's once overtly racist and antisemitic brand. In February, for instance, he abandoned plans to speak at America's far-right CPAC event after Donald Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon made a Nazi salute.",
      "But this week's events have revealed that the RN is enthusiastically committed to the distinctly Trump-ian and populist strategy of blaming its misfortunes on a \"swamp\" of unelected officials. Bardella, meanwhile, complained about the recent closure of two right-wing media channels alongside his party's own legal struggles.",
      "\"There is an extremely serious drift today that does not reflect the idea we have of French democracy,\" he said.",
      "It's the sort of language that goes down well with the RN's core constituency, but its broader appeal may be limited in a country that remains, in many ways, deeply attached to its institutions.",
      "To frame it another way, will French voters be more motivated by the belief that Le Pen was unfairly punished, or by concern that the judges involved have since been the victims of death threats and other insults?",
      "As for Marine Le Pen, she has vowed that she will not be sidelined. But her destiny is not entirely in her own hands now. At the age of 56 she has become a familiar figure, fiery at times, but personally approachable, warm and, in political terms, profoundly influential and disciplined. So what next for her?",
      "France has had one Le Pen or other (Marine's father, Jean-Marie ran four times) on their presidential ballot paper since 1988. Always unsuccessfully.",
      "History may well look back on this week as the moment Marine Le Pen's fate was sealed, in one of three ways: as France's first female and first far-right president, swept to power on a tide of outrage. As the four-time loser of a French presidential election, finally denied power by the taint of corruption. Or as someone whose soaring political career was brought to an early and shuddering halt by her own miscalculations over a serious embezzlement scandal.",

    "summary": "Big in Asia, live shopping involves brands putting on live shows to sell direct to shoppers.",
    "story": [
      "After graduating college Kelsey Krakora worked full time in a steakhouse, bartending and serving meals.",
      "She had dabbled with selling clothes online, but only part-time.",
      "But in 2021 that all changed for Cleveland-based Ms Krakora.",
      "She switched to selling clothes on Whatnot and then Poshmark - online marketplaces where people can also use live video to sell items.",
      "\"My first live show with Poshmark was 27th November 2022. I sold zero things on my first show... but that didn't last long!\"",
      "Now she sells around 100 items per show, worth about $1,000 in sales (\u00a3773).",
      "Her shows are on average three hours long and she does between two and three a week.",
      "\"These events are inclusive, welcoming, you can shop in your PJs, and there's no need to head to the shopping mall,\" says Ms Krakora.",
      "Live shopping has been popular in the Asia-Pacific region for some time, where social networks such as China's Douyin regularly host live shopping streams, but now European and US brands are experimenting with this new way of selling their products.",
      "Live shopping is a close relative to shopping channels like QVC, where viewers are urged to call in and buy the products demonstrated by presenters.",
      "But live shopping acts as a quicker shortcut from buyer to product, especially in the era of one-click purchases, made popular by online retailers such as Amazon.",
      "Also, as younger generations increasingly cut the cord and can't access cable TV, shopping channels don't hold the same relevance as they once did.",
      "It's estimated the live shopping market has reached $32bn, with the most active sectors being fashion, cosmetics and collectibles.",
      "A 2024 survey from digital commerce platform VTEX found that 45% of US consumers have browsed or purchased from live shopping events in the past 12 months.",
      "Guillaume Faure, chief executive of LiveMeUp, which provides live shopping video software, remembers when interest in live shopping surged.",
      "\"When Instagram introduced Reels, and when YouTube launched Shorts, we saw live shopping really take off.\"",
      "He's noticed the popularity of tutorials and how-to videos in live shopping events, such as how hosts can teach shoppers how to apply a certain type of make-up, or arrange a variety of flowers to deliver the most evocative bouquet.",
      "However, some analysts think that live shopping is likely to have a limited appeal.",
      "\"Many companies have tried live shopping but it simply doesn't scale,\" says Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research.",
      "\"Maybe it works in China where they don't have the same kind of store density we have in the US, where it's better for consumers to go and try something on rather than watch a host try on a piece of clothing,\" she adds.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds,  academic director of the Oxford Institute of Retail Management, University of Oxford, also highlights that the Chinese market is different.",
      "\"In China, so-called key opinion leaders (KOLs) like Li Jiaqi, the so-called 'Lipstick King, are well established,\" he says.",
      "\"Li has carefully built his personal brand to demonstrate his expertise and build consumer trust. KOLs are also working within much more sophisticated platform ecosystems,\" Mr Reynolds explains.",
      "Even Ms Krakora admits that not all products work on a live shopping stream.",
      "For example, she prefers to shop for jeans in-person. \"I'm tall, and I have specific cuts of jeans that I wear,\" she says, \"and there are tried-and-true styles and brands I like.\"",
      "Bruce Winder, a retail analyst in Toronto, also says that for some shoppers, the convenience of live shopping might be too attractive.",
      "\"Consumers may get addicted to the show or channel... and some consumers may not be able to stop watching and spending as they get caught up in the moment,\" he adds.",
      "Despite those potential pitfalls, major brands and platforms have jumped on the live shopping bandwagon.",
      "Nordstrom, Kit Kat, Samsung and L'Oreal have sold products during these streams as hosts showcased new or discounted products, and joining Poshmark as the host for these events are Amazon, eBay, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.",
      "\"Live shopping lets shoppers have a conversation with someone who knows the products being sold, and that generates a lot of excitement,\" says Manish Chandra, the chief executive and founder of Poshmark.",
      "\"It also creates a community where other shoppers are in the same show, and it's really a different experience than a traditional shopping trip.\"",
      "For some brands live shopping has been a game-changer.",
      "High-end fragrance brand The House of Amouage partnered with Nordstrom in late 2024 to bring their live shopping events to the US.",
      "Oman-based Amouage was following up on the success they enjoyed in China. In the 140 live streams they hosted with Chinese influencers on the social platforms Douyin and Taobao in 2023, they sold more than 3,000 units.",
      "The firm's chief creative officer Renaud Salmon says it's helping the company learn about what its customers want.",
      "\"In the past, we would have used customer satisfaction surveys,\" says Mr Salmon, \"but with live shopping, we get feedback right away and I bring that back to my team to help refine our products.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fundamentally wrong, was how Germany's outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, described the new Trump tariffs.",
      "A unilateral attack - that was the view of Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron called them brutal, unfounded and certain to have a \"massive impact\" on the European economy.",
      "He convened an emergency meeting with representatives of French businesses most affected by the newly announced 20% tariffs on EU goods sold to the US and issued a call to arms to European business \"not to invest in America for some time until we have clarified things\".",
      "\"What message would we send by having major European players investing billions of euros in the American economy at a time when [the US] is hitting us?\" he said.",
      "For France it's wine, champagne and the aeronautical industry, for Germany it's cars, and for Italy it's luxury goods. It's well known these sectors sell well abroad and now risk being clobbered by US import taxes.",
      "Overall, the chemicals, machinery and equipment industries in the EU are seen as the most vulnerable to the tariffs.",
      "But dig a little deeper and there are other EU sectors, reliant on the US market, that could come as a bit of a surprise.",
      "French cognac, generally dismissed as an old person's tipple in Europe, is the booze of choice for many American rappers, playing a prominent role in the music and lifestyle of stars like Jay-Z, 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg. More than 40% of French brandy is exported to the US.",
      "Spain exports a lot of gas turbines to the US, alongside tonnes of olive oil.",
      "Which EU countries are most exposed?",
      "When we look at which EU countries are most exposed to the US in terms of GDP, the picture is also not quite what you might imagine.",
      "Ireland is highly dependent on the US in terms of goods and services. Those exports - a lot linked to the pharmaceutical industry (which is currently exempt from the 20% tariffs, until the US boosts its own production) and also tech - make up a fifth of Ireland's GDP.",
      "Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are more exposed than the EU average in terms of services exports.",
      "Belgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia are in a similar position when it comes to goods.",
      "Germany has a greater exposure to the US than the other major EU economies, at over 5% of GDP, followed by Italy (about 4%), France (3%) and Spain (just over 2%). These figures were collated in 2024 by CaixaBank research based on Eurostat figures for the previous year.",
      "Will the EU retaliate?",
      "The response to the new US tariffs is being coordinated at EU HQ in Brussels. The European Commission deals with all overarching trade matters for the bloc's members.",
      "Commission President Ursula von der Leyen claims they hold \"a lot of cards\", including the strength to negotiate and the power to push back.",
      "The US economy is mighty. It makes up 25% of global GDP.",
      "But the EU single market of 450 million people (the biggest single market in the world) stands very close in size at 22% of global GDP.",
      "So, yes, the EU can bite - hard - as well as bark when it comes to retaliating against Donald Trump's tariffs. Especially if, as EU figures have suggested, the bloc targets US services like Big Tech, possibly including Apple, Meta, Amazon and even Elon Musk's platform X.",
      "But that risks a new backlash by the Trump administration. And the EU wants to avoid upping the ante.",
      "If you take politics into account, not just economics, the EU has less room for manoeuvre than you might think.",
      "Take energy supplies, the EU has been buying US liquified natural gas (LNG) after it weaned itself off Russian gas following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Tricky to reduce or heavily tax those imports. That would badly impact EU consumers, not only US industry, and it would worsen already dismal relations with the US.",
      "Think of all the recent rows over defence spending and Ukraine. Aside from the economic hell the EU sees and hopes to avoid in the new Trump tariffs, the bloc also really wants to sidestep a trade war with the country that used to be Europe's best friend.",
      "So, the Brussels plan is: threaten heavy retaliation, hope Donald Trump is persuaded to negotiate, then pray he'll stage a U-turn on tariffs.",
      "The EU's trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, says he's speaking to his US counterparts on Friday. It's an opening gambit. The EU is in no rush to retaliate.",
      "What could the EU offer the US in a negotiation?",
      "The Trump administration has ruled out any country negotiating its way out of the new tariffs before they become live this weekend. But after that, what could the EU offer the US president to persuade him to back down?",
      "Trump is incandescent about the EU's massive trade surplus. It sells far more goods than it buys from the US. The surplus for 2024 was around $200bn (\u20ac180bn; $153bn).",
      "It's the other way round when it comes to services - the US sells far more to the EU than the other way round. That is why the EU thinks its main retaliatory leverage against the US would lie in services, like banks and big tech.",
      "To redress the goods imbalance, the EU could offer to buy more LNG from the US, or more military equipment, following its pledge to Washington to do more for its own security.",
      "But that would break a different EU promise - to boost withering European arms industries by trying to buy EU when re-arming EU countries. It is something the US has already objected to, so that's tricky.",
      "Brussels could also cut direct and indirect tariffs on US goods. It could lose quotas on US agricultural produce.",
      "It would be hugely reluctant to comply with another US ask: to water down its much-trumpeted digital regulations, aimed at limiting monopolies and placing restrictions on speech and content in the EU.",
      "How bad can this all get?",
      "How do you price in the possible collapse of the international trading system, EU officials ask.",
      "European firms fret about their markets being flooded by cheap goods from non-EU countries that are also hit by Trump tariffs and seeking to sell elsewhere.",
      "The risk is very real when it comes to China. Trump is slapping more that 50% tariffs on Beijing when you add it all up.",
      "Would the EU have to ratchet up its import duties on Chinese goods to protect itself and could that lead to an unintended trade war with China?",
      "These are anxious and hugely uncertain economic times.",
      "Which is why the European Commission says it also wants to focus on matters it can control - if EU capitals agree - and that is reducing internal barriers within the EU single market.",
      "Those barriers, such as tax regimes, vary from country to country and impact the EU's overall economic growth and competitiveness.",
      "The IMF calculates they're equivalent to a 45% tariff on EU manufacturing; 110% when it comes to services.",
      "That is far higher than the tariffs now imposed on the EU by Donald Trump.",
      "EU countries say they're united in combating those. So far they've been divided over completing their own internal market."

      "The tariffs announced by Trump on Wednesday will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US. This means the initial impact of price rises is likely to be on US consumers, if American firms pass on the extra costs.",
      "However, some economists think the tariffs could strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies. If the pound weakens against the dollar, then UK firms importing goods from the US will face higher costs. This could then lead to higher prices of these goods in UK shops if companies cannot absorb the increased costs themselves.",

      "Robert Jones, from Cardiff, asks Kevin Peachey, Cost of living correspondent, about the impact of tariffs on our pension investments.",
      "There is little doubt Trump's announcement on tariffs has led to immediate moves in share prices and are also likely to have a longer-term economic impact.",
      "Robert and Stephen have mentioned the drop in the value of their pension investments, and the situation will be unsettling for millions of people with any kind of investments.",
      "Experts say that investors have always had to ride economic shocks. Investments, by definition, require a long-term outlook and strategy. So, they are urging people not to panic or make knee-jerk decisions.",
      "That said, for those about to draw on investments, it may be more worrying, albeit that most pension savings are moved into safer holdings like cash or bonds as people approach retirement age. The state pension is unaffected.",
      "Does the UK have a 'Brexit benefit' over the EU?",
      "Paul Naldrett from Windsor asks Business correspondent Marc Ashdown if the UK's position outside of the European Union is actually an opportunity as the EU is given 20% tariffs.",
      "Some are referring to a \"Brexit benefit\" because the UK is only subject to 10% tariffs rather than the 20% being slapped on the EU.",
      "Not only will that limit the pain felt by British businesses compared to their European neighbours, but it could present trading opportunities.",
      "UK exporters to America could have a competitive edge, with US importers only facing half the tax by dealing with UK businesses instead of EU businesses.",
      "British firms - and consumers - could also benefit from cheaper goods finding their way here instead of America if the extra costs prove insurmountable.",
      "But, there are concerns about the impact that could have on homegrown industries if cheap products, possibly with lower standards, flood the UK market."

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on goods from most countries being imported into the US, with even higher rates for what he calls the \"worst offenders\".",
      "But how exactly were these tariffs -  essentially taxes on imports - worked out? BBC Verify has been looking at the calculations behind the numbers.",
      "What were the calculations?",
      "When Trump presented a giant cardboard chart detailing the tariffs in the White House Rose Garden it was initially assumed that the charges were based on a combination of existing tariffs and other trade barriers (like regulations).",
      "But later, the White House published what might look like a complicated mathematical formula.",
      "But if you unpick the formula above it boils down to simple maths: take the trade deficit for the US in goods with a particular country, divide that by the total goods imports from that country and then divide that number by two.",
      "A trade deficit occurs when a country buys (imports) more physical products from other countries than it sells (exports) to them.",

      "UK: What this means for you and your money",
      "Explainer: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?",
      "US analysis: Trump's tariffs are his biggest gamble yet",
      "For example, the US buys more goods from China than it sells to them - there is a goods deficit of $295bn. The total amount of goods it buys from China is $440bn.",
      "Dividing 295 by 440 gets you to 67% and you divide that by two and round up. Therefore the tariff imposed on China is 34%.",
      "Similarly, when it applied to the EU, the White House's formula resulted in a 20% tariff.",
      "Are the Trump tariffs 'reciprocal'?",
      "Many commentators have pointed out that these tariffs are not reciprocal.",
      "Reciprocal would mean they were based on what countries already charge the US in the form of existing tariffs, plus non-tariff barriers (things like regulations that drive up costs).",
      "But the White House's official methodology document makes clear that they have not calculated this for all the countries on which they have imposed tariffs.",
      "Instead the tariff rate was calculated on the basis that it would eliminate the US's goods trade deficit with each country.",
      "Trump has broken away from the formula in imposing tariffs on countries that buy more goods from the US than they sell to it.",
      "For example the US does not currently run goods trade deficit with the UK. Yet the UK has been hit with a 10% tariff.",
      "In total, more than 100 countries are covered by the new tariff regime.",
      "'Lots of broader impacts'",
      "Trump believes the US is getting a bad deal in global trade. In his view, other countries flood US markets with cheap goods - which hurts US companies and costs jobs. At the same time, these countries are putting up barriers that make US products less competitive abroad.",
      "So by using tariffs to eliminate trade deficits, Trump hopes to revive US manufacturing and protect jobs.",
      "But will this new tariff regime achieve the desired outcome?",
      "BBC Verify has spoken to a number of economists. The overwhelming view is that while the tariffs might reduce the goods deficit between the US and individual countries, they will not reduce the overall deficit between the US and rest of the world.",
      "\"Yes, it will reduce bilateral trade deficits between the US and these countries. But there will obviously be lots of broader impacts that are not captured in the calculation\", says Professor Jonathan Portes of King's College, London.",
      "That's because the US' existing overall deficit is not driven solely by trade barriers, but by how the US economy works.",
      "For one, Americans spend and invest more than they earn and that gap means the US buys more from the world than it sells. So as long as that continues, the US may continue to keep running a deficit despite increasing tariffs with it global trading partners.",
      "Some trade deficits can also exist for a number of legitimate reasons - not just down to tariffs. For example, buying food that is easier or cheaper to produce in other countries' climates.",
      "Thomas Sampson of the London School of Economics said: \"The formula is reverse engineered to rationalise charging tariffs on countries with which the US has a trade deficit. There is no economic rationale for doing this and it will cost the global economy dearly.\"",

      "\"I have great respect for President Xi [Jinping] of China, great respect for China, but they were taking tremendous advantage of us,\" Trump said during his roughly hour-long address.",
      "Holding up a chart listing countries and territories that he said had put up trade barriers to US goods, Trump said: \"If you look at that... China, first row, 67%. That's tariffs charged to the USA, including currency manipulation and trade barriers.\"",
      "\"We are going to be charging [them] a discounted reciprocal tariff of 34%,\" he added. \"In other words, they charge us, we charge them, we charge them less. So how can anybody be upset?\"",
      "But China's Commerce Ministry immediately called the move \"a typical act of unilateral bullying\" and pledged to take \"resolute countermeasures to safeguard its rights and interests\".",
      "And state news agency Xinhua accused Trump of \"turning trade into an over simplistic tit-for-tat game\".",
      "Experts believe Beijing has good reason to be upset.",
      "For one, the latest announcement is an add on to existing tariffs of 20% on Chinese goods.",
      "Secondly, by imposing heavy tariffs on other South East Asian countries including Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos, it has 'slammed the door shut' on how China rejigged its supply chains to get around the tariffs imposed on Beijing during Trump's first term.",
      "There were five Asian nations in the 10 countries and territories hit with the highest tariffs.",
      "The taxes are adding up for China",
      "Trump has imposed new tariffs on Chinese imports since returning to the White House in January, ratcheting up levies to 20%.",
      "In less than a week, these tariffs will jump to 54%, apart from on products like cars, steel and aluminium, which will be subjected to lower tariffs.",
      "Beijing has also been on the receiving end of other Trump trade salvos.",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, the President signed an executive order to end a provision for low-value parcels from China.",
      "This had allowed Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu to ship packages with a retail value of under $800 (\u00a3617) to the US, without taxes and inspections.",
      "Close to 1.4 billion shipments entered the US under the provision in the last financial year, according to customs data.",
      "The removal of the exemption could force some Chinese firms to pass the extra cost on to customers, making their goods less competitive in the US.",
      "When taken together, this is a worrying picture for Beijing, said Deborah Elms from the Hinrich Foundation consultancy.",
      "\"I don't think the new tariffs are necessarily aimed at China. But when the United States stacks tariffs on top of each other, specifically towards China, the numbers become eye-watering quite quickly.\"",
      "\"China and the Chinese will have to retaliate. They are not going to be able to sit back and watch this,\" she said.",
      "Supply chain hit",
      "Trump also imposed heavy tariffs, ranging from 46% to 49%, on Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.",
      "This represents \"a full-frontal assault on Beijing's extended supply chain,\" said Stephen Innes from investment firm SPI Asset Management.",
      "\"Vietnam... and others in the periphery are collateral damage in what is shaping up to be the most aggressive realignment of US trade policy in a generation,\" he added. \"This isn't tit-for-tat - it's strategic containment via tariff warfare.\"",
      "Laos and Cambodia, which are among the poorest countries in the region, are heavily dependant on Chinese investment in supply chain infrastructure. The high tariff rates are expected to hit both countries hard.",
      "China is Vietnam's largest trading partner. It was one of the key beneficiaries of US-China tensions during Trump's first term.",
      "In 2018, Trump hit China with tariffs, causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products. Some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam.",
      "This has led to an increase of exports from Vietnam to the US, with Chinese companies that have moved production there contributing to that figure.",
      "\"Vietnam was clearly targeted [by Trump] due to its role as a conduit for China's circumvention of previous tariffs\", former US trade negotiator Stephen Olson told the BBC.",
      "While the US remains Vietnam's biggest export market, China is its largest supplier of goods, accounting for more than a third of imports, according to the latest official data.",
      "Chinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year.",
      "Pushan Dutt, a professor at the INSEAD business school, said the new taxes on South East Asia will be \"prohibitive\" for China.",
      "\"China has a problem with demand and in the last Trump administration their firms had nimbly reacted to tariffs by rejigging supply chains and moving them to [South East Asian nations]. This door has been slammed shut,\" he added.",
      "But Trump's taxes on the region will also impact US companies that manufacture goods in South East Asia.",
      "For instance, American businesses including technology giants Apple and Intel, and sportswear giant Nike have large factories in Vietnam.",
      "A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam found that most US manufacturers there expect to lay off staff if tariffs are imposed.",
      "'Tough choices' ahead",
      "There is the question of what China can do to respond to the new tariffs, given it only has days before they are due to take effect.",
      "Mr Olson said he expects Beijing to have a \"forceful\" response with tariffs and other measures making it more difficult for US companies to operate in China.",
      "With the Chinese economy already facing challenges, Beijing faces \"tough choices\" in the days ahead, said Professor Dutt.",
      "\"Exporting to other regions threatens de-industrialisation in these destinations - and political leaders there are unlikely to accept this. That means China has to finally unleash domestic demand and the Chinese household,\" he added.",
      "The tariffs could also push China to try and build alliances with other Asian nations who have been on the receiving end of the tariffs.",
      "Wang Huiyao, a former China Communist Party member who works with the Center for China and Globalisation think tank, called on Asian countries to \"work together to go through this difficult time and fight protectionism\".",
      "\"In the end, the US could be losing all the influence and isolate itself,\" he added.",
      "Some discussions are already underway. China, South Korea and Japan recently held their first economic talks in five years.",
      "They agreed to speed up talks for free trade agreement - which was first proposed over a decade ago.",
      "The new tariffs could give them added incentive to do so.",
      "However, Beijing could face some short-term pain while talks with Washington take its course.",
      "\"Ultimately, the US and China are headed for a negotiating table where they'll try to reach some type of a grand bargain on a wide range of issues,\" Mr Olson said.",
      "\"That won't necessarily happen soon and I expect things to get worse before they get better,\" he added."

      "Almost every building we saw had cracks running through at least one of its walls, unsafe to step into. At the main city hospital they're having to treat patients outdoors.",
      "Myanmar's military government has said it's not allowing foreign journalists into the country after the quake, so we went in undercover. We had to operate carefully, because the country is riddled with informers and secret police who spy on their own people for the ruling military junta.",
      "What we witnessed was a people who had very little help coming their way in the face of this massive disaster.",

      "Even before the earthquake Myanmar was in turmoil - locked in a civil war that has displaced an estimated 3.5 million people. Its military has continued operations against armed insurgent groups despite the disaster.",
      "This means that security forces are too stretched to put their full might behind relief and rescue operations. Except in some key locations, we didn't see them in large numbers in Mandalay.",
      "The military junta has put out a rare appeal for international aid, but its uneasy relations with many foreign countries, including the UK and the US, has meant that while these countries have pledged aid, help in the form of manpower on the ground is currently only from countries like India, China and Russia, among a few others.",
      "And so far those rescue efforts appear to be focused on structures where masses of people are feared trapped \u2013 the high-rise Sky Villa condominium complex which was home to hundreds of people, and U Hla Thein Buddhist academy where scores of monks were taking an examination when the earthquake struck.",

      "Many of Mandalay's historical sites have also suffered significant damage, including the Mandalay Palace and the Maha Muni Pagoda, but we could not get in to see the extent of the damage.",
      "Access to everything - collapse sites, victims and their families - was not easy because of the oppressive environment created by the military junta, with people often fearful of speaking to journalists.",
      "Close to the pagoda, we saw Buddhist funeral rituals being held on the street outside a destroyed house. It was the home of U Hla Aung Khaing and his wife Daw Mamarhtay, both in their sixties.",
      "\"I lived with them but was out when the earthquake struck. That's why I survived. Both my parents are gone in a single moment,\" their son told us.",
      "Their bodies were extricated not by trained rescuers, but by locals who used rudimentary equipment. It took two days to pull out the couple, who were found with their arms around each other.",
      "Myanmar's military government says 2,886 people have died so far, but so many collapse sites have still not even been reached by the authorities, that that count is unlikely to be accurate. We may never find out what the real death toll of the earthquake was.",
      "Parks and open spaces in Mandalay have turned into makeshift camps, as have the banks of the moat that runs around the palace. All over the city we saw people laying out mats and mattresses outside their homes as evening approached, preferring to sleep outdoors.",
      "Mandalay is a city living in terror, and with good reason. Nearly every night since Friday there have been big aftershocks. We woke up to an aftershock of magnitude 5 in the middle of the night.",
      "But tens of thousands are sleeping outdoors because they have no home to return to.",
      "\"I don't know what to think anymore. My heart still trembles when I think of that moment when the earthquake struck,\" said Daw Khin Saw Myint, 72, who we met while she was waiting in a queue for water, with her little granddaughter by her side. \"We ran out, but my house is gone. I'm living under a tree. Come and see.\"",
      "She works as a washerwoman and says her son suffers from a disability which doesn't allow him to work.",
      "\"Where will I live now? I am in so much trouble. I'm living next to a rubbish dump. Some people have given me rice and a few clothes. We ran out in these clothes we are wearing.",
      "\"We don't have anyone to rescue us. Please help us,\" she said, tears rolling down her cheeks.",
      "Another elderly woman chimes in, eyes tearing up, \"No one has distributed food yet today. So we haven't eaten.\"",
      "Most of the vehicles we saw pulling up to distribute supplies were small vans with limited stocks - donations from individuals or small local organisations. It's nowhere near enough for the number of people in need, leading to a scramble to grab whatever relief is available.",
      "Parts of Mandalay's main hospital are also damaged, and so in an already difficult situation, rows and rows of beds are laid out in the hospital compound for patients.",
      "Shwe Gy Thun Phyo, 14, has suffered from a brain injury, and has bloodshot eyes. She's conscious but unresponsive. Her father tries to make her as comfortable as possible.",
      "There were very few doctors and nurses around to cope with the demand for treatment, which means families are stepping in to do what medical staff should.",
      "Zar Zar has a distended belly because of a serious abdominal injury. Her daughter sits behind her, holding her up, and fans her, to give her some relief from the heat.",
      "We couldn't spend a lot of time at the hospital for fear of being apprehended by the police or military.",
      "As the window to find survivors of the earthquake narrows, increasingly those being brought into the hospital are the dead.",
      "Nan Sin Hein, who is waiting outside the collapsed building where her son was trapped, was initially stoical, but she now looks like she is preparing to face what seems like the most likely outcome.",
      "\"I'm heartbroken. My son loved me and his little sisters. He struggled to support us,\" she says.",
      "\"I am just hoping to see my son's face, even if he is dead. I want to see his body. I want them to do everything they can to find his body.\""

      "Commit to What Matters",
      "I had come from a world of higher-end restaurants, of finesse and creativity. So a tapas restaurant was not exactly what I was looking for. But my new partners in Washington, DC, had a clear idea: they wanted to open a Spanish restaurant that was fun. They called it Jaleo, which means \"merrymaking, a joyful celebration,\" inspired by the John Singer Sargent painting of a Spanish woman dancing to guitars. It lives in Boston, but it had traveled on loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and they had seen it there. They even painted a reproduction of it on a wall of the new restaurant.",
      "I understood that sense of joy. I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like tables. I prefer standing up at bars. If I can, I like to hop around to five different bars and eat good food at each one. Jaleo was a chance to show how I like to enjoy life. These little plates of tapas were also a chance to give people more access to different bites of Spanish food, different tastes of the various regions of Spain. Maybe people didn't know what they wanted to eat, and the small plates would be a way to move a little bit further out of their comfort zones. Of course, it was an opportunity to make a mark for myself. And I could do that while being a kind of ambassador for my country, in the capital of the United States, not too far from the White House and the US Capitol. It felt like an extension of my military service, going from port to port on a historic tall-mast ship, showing the best of Spain to the world.",
      "I knew there were immigrants before me who had brought Spanish food to every corner of America. They opened restaurants, maybe some of them played guitar or danced flamenco. They were mythical places. Tio Pepe in Baltimore. Caf\u00e9 San Martin in New York. Montse Guill\u00e9n's El Internacional in Tribeca, which was short-lived but put Spanish food and drink on the map. There was already a high-end Spanish restaurant in Washington called Taberna del Alabardero, and the more informal Churreria Madrid in Adams Morgan.",
      "Washington at that time was not seen as a culinary mecca, even by the people of DC, and Jaleo opened in a downtown neighborhood, known as Penn Quarter, that was empty at night. But it would not stay that way. It would become a very important part of the city, not too far away from where all the big decisions were made that affected the country and the world. It was a part of the city where senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and business executives would gather. It was the home of new businesses like America Online, and so many other amazing new companies. Slowly but surely, Jaleo became a huge success.",
      "That's not to say it was easy. I was young, just twenty-three years old, and I was still learning how to run a kitchen. The movie in my head cast me as the creative guy, but now I needed to learn how to run the place. Fortunately, I had a wonderful, patient teacher: Ann Cashion, who was the first executive chef of Jaleo, showed me how to do the job properly, even though I preferred the creative side of things.",
      "We didn't really know whether American diners would accept these little plates, or the idea of sharing plates at all. What happened if people didn't want to share? Our waiters were concerned and would often tell me how some people said they weren't comfortable with sharing. I had a simple answer. If they didn't want to share, they could move the plate ten inches closer to them and use their knife and fork to protect the dish for themselves. I wasn't going to Americanize tapas for them. It's what we did in the south of Spain and in Catalonia. They would adapt because it was a fun way to be with friends. Who doesn't want to dig a fork into the plate of the person across the table?",
      "My heart was full of the joy that comes from introducing Spanish food to new people. That joy translated into happy guests eating the dishes I knew. Jaleo was a place where I could share what I knew about Spanish food: croquetas, gazpacho, gambas al ajillo, sangria. But it was also a way to learn more about what I didn't know about Spanish food. I had not traveled all across Spain at the age of twenty-three, nor did I know about all of Spanish gastronomy. Far from it. The reality is that you need to keep learning in any line of work. People say I'm one of the biggest experts in Spanish cooking, but I still feel clueless sometimes. Every time I go back to Spain and discover a new ingredient or a new dish, it feels to me the same as looking at the stars. You can see a few, but how many more are out there that you cannot see? You can read books, and you can travel, but learning is a lifetime of curiosity and discovery.",
      "Sometimes that work can feel less joyful and more of struggle. In particular, in those early days, it was a struggle to buy the right ingredients. Believe it or not, I'm a pragmatic guy. You can support the local economy, buying local fruit and vegetables for instance. But there are some ingredients that cannot be replaced. I observed the success of Italy, where they have been amazingly successful in supporting the small towns where their unique food products are made. I believed we could do the same for the small towns and food producers of Spain. Manchego cheese is like no other. Sweet roasted piquillo peppers are unique. Our olive oil is the envy of Europe, and even gets repackaged under Italian names. Our sherry vinegar is unmatched. And nothing compares to our pure-bred Ib\u00e9rico ham, the very best ham in the world. You can't have Spanish cooking without some of the staples. It was a symbiotic relationship.",
      "Still, importing food is not always easy. There are regulations and policies, rules to protect consumers and businesses. The US Department of Agriculture insists that slaughterhouses operate according to American standards, not European ones, if they want to sell their meat in the United States. They need to be inspected, even though Europeans have been eating these foods for centuries without any problems. It was crazy but also fascinating. Of course, it wasn't just a question of safety; there were concerns that ham from Spain would hurt ham in America. So one day I met a bearded man visiting Washington, and he happened to be a great Ib\u00e9rico ham producer who was investing to comply with US regulations at his slaughterhouse: Santiago Mart\u00edn, the owner of Embutidos Ferm\u00edn. I helped producers like Santiago navigate these challenges with Congress and the administration, finding a lawyer who assisted the Italians in bringing Parma ham to America. Because in reality these European hams were much more expensive than the American hams, and they helped elevate the perception of all pork products in America. It was a win-win for America and Spain.",
      "That's the world of work. Your commitment to your values, to what's important, can turn a seemingly small decision\u2014like buying a type of roasted pepper or a slice of ham\u2014into something as big as international relations.",
      "Your sense of responsibility is what matters. How was I going to be a Spanish chef without all these ingredients? I had to do the work, just like other chefs and importers who made Spanish food available in the United States. People like Tim Harris, who created the incredible Spanish food store La Tienda, and Juana Gimeno Faraone, who started La Espa\u00f1ola Meats. Or Almudena de Llaguno and Steve Metzler bringing Spanish wines to America; and Jorge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, who would walk the streets of Manhattan with a big bag filled with wine bottles, trying to get his wines into a few restaurants. The whole ecosystem of Spanish food people kept me going, and I needed to play my part, too.",
      "So Jaleo became much more than a restaurant; it was a way to build bridges between these two countries, to inspire American chefs to buy and cook with Spanish ingredients, to spread the culture that made me who I am. Something like 80 percent of all restaurants close before they reach their five-year anniversary. Jaleo has now been open for thirty years, and we have new Jaleos in Orlando, Las Vegas, and even Dubai. Because we committed from the first year to what we value\u2014to what matters\u2014even when we didn't yet have all the expertise to make it happen.",
      "I feel a sense of joy when I see Ib\u00e9rico ham, or Spanish anchovies, or wines from the Bierzo region in restaurants and shops. I know that nothing would have happened without the persistence and vision of so many people who may now be forgotten. They built the bridges that will last forever\u2014because they cared so deeply.",
      "Follow what you feel is your purpose\u2014not what others tell you to do. Otherwise you lose your soul and become a commodity. Don't be a commodity. Be true to yourself.",

    "summary": "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2.",
    "story": [
      "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2, which will introduce interactive chat and screenshare functions to connect gamers. Pre-orders in the U.S., however, will not start April 9 as expected \"in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,\" Nintendo said, promising to update timing soon.",
      "At its 60-minute Nintendo Direct presentation, the company revealed a more vibrant display on the Switch 2, a larger screen and several games that will launch with the console.",
      "Central to its updated system is a new \"C\" button on its Joy-Con controller, which will launch a new \"GameChat\" feature that allows you to \"communicate with friends and family while playing a game\" and lets you share your game screen with other players. A built-in microphone will also allow you to chat with other gamers. The \"GameChat\" feature requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service.",
      "\"When you think about some of the biggest titles on (the Nintendo Switch), it's like Mario Kart, Super Mario Jamboree, even though that's quite a new title, has cracked the top 10 of most play games on the console. So, it does make a lot of sense that the sort of headline feature is geared primarily towards that sort of use,\" said Hannah Cowton-Barnes, a London-based video game industry expert for Tech Advisor.",
      "Perhaps the most contemporary function yet for the Switch 2 is the ability to use the Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse. The developer displayed multiple ways to use the new function in games, such as angling a club in a golf game.",
      "The new portable console features a 7.9 inch LCD screen that displays in 1080p. Nintendo also revealed in the live stream that, when docked, the system will be able to support 4K resolution for compatible games.",
      "Wednesday's presentation started off with an extended look at \"Mario Kart World\" \u2014 the console's launch bundle game \u2014 which adds a bit of flair to the series with in-game characters doing tailwhips, flips, rail grinds and other tricks.",
      "The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed \"Project 007,\" revisiting a classic Nintendo 64 console hit revered by many first-person shooter fans.",
      "Nintendo also announced two more Switch 2 exclusives featuring its marquee characters. \"Donkey Kong Bananza,\" a 3D adventure with the big ape punching his way through a huge underground world, arrives July 17. \"Kirby Air Riders,\" a racing game from the director of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, is due later in the year.",
      "Third-party exclusives likely to create some buzz include Koei-Tecmo's \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" a hack-and-slash prequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,\" coming this winter. From Software's \"The Duskbloods,\" a baroque multiplayer title from the creators of Elden Ring, is scheduled for 2026.",
      "Miss the GameCube? Nintendo said Switch Online subscribers will be able to access a limited selection of GameCube titles such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" and \"F-Zero GX.\"",
      "The new console will be backwards compatible \u2014 able to play physical and digital Switch games \u2014 but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal SD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console using a transfer feature.",
      "The original Switch, released in 2017, is \"one of the most popular game consoles of all time,\" Scott Stein, editor-at-large at CNET,\u00a0told CBS News Boston in January.",
      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",
      "\"There's a lot of stuff it does well but there's a lot of stuff that people I think want it to do better for playing games they can play elsewhere,\" he said, noting the ability to take it on the go differentiates it from other gaming consoles.",
      "How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?",
      "Nintendo will retail the Switch 2 for $449.99 at launch, which is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. A separate bundle that includes the new \"Mario Kart World\" game will also be available for $499.99.",
      "Gene Park, a Washington Post reporter covering video games and gaming culture, told CBS News the console is \"a little pricey, but it is a more powerful system.\"",
      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have hit the video game console industry at a fragile moment, said Joost van Dreunen, author of \"One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.",
      "\"At the beginning of a new hardware cycle, all of a sudden we're looking at this price hike,\" said van Dreunen, a games industry researcher. \"I had originally predicted that the Switch 2 would be $400. Now it's announced that it's $450. That $50 difference is a Trump tax.\"",
      "The tariffs, he said, impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and that region at large.",
      "The early stages of a hardware life cycle are already very low margin, or usually a loss for hardware manufacturers, van Dreunen said. Those manufacturers typically eat the margin in order to get the devices out to stores.",
      "\"But with an increased tariff, that means that margin is probably even worse than it historically is. But their hands are kind of tied. They can't not progress. They can't not launch a new hardware generation. So for the consumer base, people are just going to pay more.\"",
      "The Consumer Technology Association also predicted President Trump's tariffs would drive up prices of video game consoles, and retailers like Best Buy have warned they may have to raise prices due to the tariffs.",
      "Nintendo plans to host \"Switch 2 Experience\" events in several countries, where gamers can get a hands-on experience with the new system. Those events are planned for cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris beginning this month.",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "The smoldering intensity of actor Val Kilmer (Dec. 31, 1959-April 1, 2025) radiated off movie screens with his memorable turns as brooding artists, obsessive criminals, doomed lawmen, and a fighter jock nicknamed Iceman. He starred in such films as \"Top Gun,\" \"Heat,\" \"Tombstone\" and \"The Doors.\"",
      "While attending New York City's Juilliard School (he was admitted at age 17), Kilmer co-wrote and appeared in the play \"How It All Began.\" In 1983 he starred on Broadway in the play \"Slab Boys,\" opposite Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn. He made his movie debut in the 1984 spoof \"Top Secret!\" (from the creators of \"Airplane!\"), followed by \"Real Genius.\"",
      "One of his most memorable characters, that of pilot Tom Kazansky in 1986's \"Top Gun,\" almost didn't happen. Kilmer wrote in his 2020 memoir, \"I'm Your Huckleberry,\" that he initially turned down the role: \"I didn't want the part. I didn't care about the film. The story didn't interest me.\" Script changes led to his signing up.",
      "As a charismatic leading man, Kilmer commanded the screen playing Doc Holliday in the western \"Tombstone,\" a demolition expert in the bank heist film \"Heat,\" and rock idol Jim Morrison in \"The Doors.\" \u00a0Other films included \"Willow,\" \"Thunderheart,\" \"True Romance,\" \"The Ghost and the Darkness,\" \"The Saint,\" \"Alexander,\" \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,\" \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu,\" \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans,\" \"Joe the King,\" \"Spartan,\" \"Twixt,\" and \"Wonderland.\"",
      "Kilmer wrote, directed and starred in a one-man stage show in which he played humorist Mark Twain, titled \"Citizen Twain.\" He also published two books of poetry. Following treatments for cancer, Kilmer repeated the role of Iceman in the 2022 sequel, \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"",
      "A low point may have been when he donned the Batman costume to star in the 1995 film \"Batman Forever.\" He explained in the documentary \"Val\" that the suit constricted his performance: \"It was frustrating until I realized that my role in the film was just to show up and stand where I was told to.\"",
      "Kilmer's reputation for being difficult on set would dog him (John Frankenheimer, who replaced the fired director of \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" told Entertainment Weekly that there were two things he would never do: \"Climb Mount Everest, and work with Val Kilmer again\"). But he was also praised by fellow actors for his immersion into his characters.",
      "In a tribute to Kilmer, actress Jennifer Tilly recalled\u00a0the audition process for Oliver Stone's \"The Doors\": \"It was kind of a cattle call. They paired together potential Jims with potential Pamelas. And they were running behind so we were spilling out of the casting office, sitting on the porch, the lawn, and the driveway. All of a sudden, a sixties convertible came screeching up, blaring Doors Music at top volume. And a guy jumped out and strode inside: He had wild hair and he was barefoot, shirtless, and wearing nothing but a pair of tight leather pants. We all looked at each other like\u2026 Who is this guy? We were more than a little shook by the sheer audacity of his entrance. Well of course it was Val Kilmer and from that minute on, nobody else stood a chance.\""

      "Val Kilmer, the acclaimed, brooding actor who starred in a string of blockbuster hits in the 1980s and 1990s, has died at the age of 65.",
      "Kilmer died Tuesday night in Los Angeles, surrounded by family and friends, his daughter, Mercedes Kilmer, said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Val Kilmer died from pneumonia. He had recovered after a 2014 throat cancer diagnosis that required two tracheotomies.",
      "The New York Times was first to report on Kilmer's death.",
      "A unique talent, Kilmer was praised as an acting chameleon who took on varied and challenging roles, and the results were often memorable. Beginning with \"Top Gun\" alongside Tom Cruise in 1986, he turned in one iconic performance after another \u2014 able to transition effortlessly between leading man and supporting roles.",
      "There was his turn as Jim Morrison in the 1991 Oliver Stone classic \"The Doors,\" and as the quick-witted Doc Holliday in the 1993 Western \"Tombstone.\" He followed that up in 1995 as Batman in \"Batman Forever\" and played a bank robber in Michael Mann's 1995 crime thriller \"Heat.\"",
      "His last major film credit was in 2022's \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" in which he reprised his role as Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky.",
      "Toward the end of \"Val,\" the 2021 documentary on his career, Kilmer said, \"I have behaved poorly. I have behaved bravely. I have behaved bizarrely to some. I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed. And I am blessed.\"",
      "Kilmer, who attended the prestigious Juilliard School, experienced the ups and downs of fame more dramatically than most. His break came in 1984's spy spoof \"Top Secret!\" followed by the comedy \"Real Genius\" in 1985. Kilmer would later show his comedy chops again in films including \"MacGruber\" and \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.\"",
      "His movie career hit its zenith in the early 1990s as he made a name for himself as a dashing leading man, starring alongside Kurt Russell and Bill Paxton in \"Tombstone,\" as Elvis' ghost in \"True Romance\" and as a bank-robbing demolition expert in Mann's film \"Heat\" with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.",
      "The actor - who took part in the Method branch of Suzuki arts training - threw himself into parts. For his role in \"Tombstone,\" he filled his bed with ice for the final scene to mimic the feeling of dying from tuberculosis. To play Morrison, he wore leather pants all the time, asked castmates and crew to only refer to him as Jim Morrison and blasted The Doors for a year.",
      "That intensity also gave Kilmer a reputation that he was difficult to work with, something he grudgingly agreed with later in life, but always defending himself by emphasizing art over commerce.",
      "\"In an unflinching attempt to empower directors, actors and other collaborators to honor the truth and essence of each project, an attempt to breathe Suzukian life into a myriad of Hollywood moments, I had been deemed difficult and alienated the head of every major studio,\" he wrote in his memoir, \"I'm Your Huckleberry.\"",
      "One of his more iconic roles - as hotshot pilot Kazansky opposite Cruise - almost didn't happen. Kilmer was courted by director Tony Scott for \"Top Gun\" but initially balked. \"I didn't want the part. I didn't care about the film. The story didn't interest me,\" he wrote in his memoir. He agreed after being promised that his role would improve from the initial script.",
      "Kilmer vs. the Batman costume",
      "One career nadir when he played Batman in Joel Schumacher's goofy, garish \"Batman Forever\" with Nicole Kidman and opposite Chris O'Donnell's Robin - before George Clooney took up the mantle for 1997's \"Batman & Robin\" and after Michael Keaton played the Dark Knight in 1989's \"Batman\" and 1992's \"Batman Returns.\"",
      "Janet Maslin in The New York Times said Kilmer was \"hamstrung by the straight-man aspects of the role,\" while Roger Ebert deadpanned that he was a \"completely acceptable\" substitute for Keaton. Kilmer, who was one and done as Batman, blamed much of his performance on the suit.",
      "\"When you're in it, you can barely move and people have to help you stand up and sit down,\" Kilmer said in \"Val.\" \"You also can't hear anything and after a while people stop talking to you, it's very isolating. It was a struggle for me to get a performance past the suit, and it was frustrating until I realized that my role in the film was just to show up and stand where I was told to.\"",
      "His next projects were the film version of the 1960s TV series \"The Saint\" - fussily putting on wigs, accents and glasses - and \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" with Marlon Brando, which became one of the decade's most infamously cursed productions.",
      "David Gregory's 2014 documentary \"Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau,\" described a cursed set that included a hurricane, Kilmer bullying director Richard Stanley, the firing of Stanley via fax (who sneaked back on set as an extra with a mask on) and extensive rewrites by Kilmer and Brando. The older actor told the younger at one point: \"'It's a job now, Val. A lark. We'll get through it.' I was as sad as I've ever been on a set,\" Kilmer wrote in his memoir.",
      "In 1996, Entertainment Weekly ran a cover story about Kilmer titled \u2033The Man Hollywood Loves to Hate.\u2033 The directors Schumacher and John Frankenheimer, who finished \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" said he was difficult. Frankenheimer said there were two things he would never do: \u2033Climb Mount Everest and work with Val Kilmer again.\u2033",
      "Other artists came to his defense, like D. J. Caruso, who directed Kilmer in \u2033The Salton Sea\u2033 and said the actor simply liked to talk out scenes and enjoyed having a director's attention.",
      "\u2033Val needs to immerse himself in a character. I think what happened with directors like Frankenheimer and Schumacher is that Val would ask a lot of questions, and a guy like Schumacher would say, 'You're Batman! Just go do it,'\u2033 Caruso told The New York Times in 2002.",
      "After \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" the movies were smaller, like David Mamet human-trafficking thriller \"Spartan\"; \u2033Joe the King\u2033 in 1999, in which he played a paunchy, abusive alcoholic; and playing the doomed '70s porn star John Holmes in 2003's \"Wonderland.\" He also threw himself into his one-man stage show \"Citizen Twain,\" in which he played Mark Twain.",
      "\"I enjoy the depth and soul the piece has that Twain had for his fellow man and America,\" he told Variety in 2018. \"And the comedy that's always so close to the surface, and how valuable his genius is for us today. Still, we battle racism and greed. The same country, it's greatness and it's tragedy.\"",
      "Kilmer's early years",
      "Kilmer spent his formative years in the Chatsworth neighborhood of Los Angeles. He attended Chatsworth High School alongside future Oscar winner Kevin Spacey and future Emmy winner Mare Winningham. At 17, he was the youngest drama student ever admitted at the Juilliard School in 1981.",
      "Shortly after he left for Juilliard, his younger brother, 15-year-old Wesley, suffered an epileptic seizure in the family's Jacuzzi and died on the way to the hospital. Wesley was an aspiring filmmaker when he died.",
      "\u2033I miss him and miss his things. I have his art up. I like to think about what he would have created. I'm still inspired by him,\u2033 Kilmer told the Times.",
      "While still at Juilliard, Kilmer co-wrote and appeared in the play \"How It All Began\" and later turned down a role in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Outsiders\" for the Broadway play, \"Slab Boys,\" alongside Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn.",
      "Kilmer published two books of poetry (including \"My Edens After Burns\") and was nominated for a Grammy in 2012 for spoken word album for \"The Mark of Zorro.\" He was also a visual artist and a lifelong Christian Scientist.",

    "summary": "Multiple FDA labs were cut amid Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs this week.",
    "story": [
      "Some of the Food and Drug Administration's efforts to support testing for the ongoing bird flu outbreak have been disrupted due to steep layoffs at the agency, multiple officials told CBS News Thursday, in the latest fallout from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s cuts to the nation's federal health agencies.",
      "In one example, a planned FDA exercise with a network of veterinary testing labs around the country to ensure they are able to detect the virus in milk has been suspended, due to the elimination of the agency's food safety lab in Illinois, two federal health officials said.",
      "Officials had planned the exercise for 40 laboratories across the FDA-backed Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, as well as additional government-backed and private labs, which are using different methods to test for the virus.",
      "\"Unfortunately, significant Reductions In Force (RIF), including a key quality assurance officer, at FDA's Human Food Program Moffett Center has caused immediate and significant impact on the Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network,\" read an email sent Thursday to members of the laboratory network, obtained by CBS News.",
      "News of the disruption to the FDA exercise was first reported by Reuters.",
      "The effort \"would have been critical to ensure confidence in the laboratory methods for food safety and animal health,\" the email read.",
      "Labs are testing milk both to detect the virus in sick cattle as well as for food safety purposes, an official said.",
      "The department has laid off some 10,000 workers under a plan drawn up by Kennedy and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting task force. The FDA lost around 3,500 full-time employees due to the layoffs, including staff supporting the agency's food and drug safety inspectors.",
      "\"This overhaul is about realigning HHS with its core mission: to stop the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again. Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year, and we must shift course,\" an HHS official said in a statement.",
      "The official said that HHS layoffs \"focused personnel cuts on redundant or unnecessary administrative positions.\"",
      "\"HHS also reduced its regional footprint by moving out of the highest cost cities, shuttering offices in Boston, Chicago, NYC, San Francisco, and Seattle,\" the statement said.",
      "Other federal labs have been gutted due to Kennedy's cuts, including U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention labs investigating STD and hepatitis outbreaks.",
      "Another disrupted bird flu effort was at the FDA's San Francisco-area food safety testing lab, two officials said.",
      "That lab is responsible for food safety testing for both humans and animals, officials said. One official said the lab had been setting up to begin testing pet food for bird flu, as part of the agency's regulatory response to outbreaks.",
      "Now the lab has been closed, with staff also completely eliminated as part of Kennedy's cuts on Tuesday. It is unclear whether the agency's remaining labs will be able to fill the gap.",
      "Several multistate recalls of pet food for bird flu contamination have been announced by health authorities in recent months, after cats and other animals were sickened. The virus has been especially lethal to pet cats.",
      "In the final days of the Biden administration, the FDA's veterinary center called on pet food manufacturers to take additional steps to ensure their products were free of the virus.",
      "Through the center, the FDA has oversight over the safety of drugs and food given to animals, including pets.",

      "The Department of Health and Human Services has said layoffs ordered\u00a0by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with some 10,000 workers let go from the department, would not directly cut FDA's inspections staff. But in meetings among federal health officials, the agency's remaining leaders have grappled with how to deal with major delays and disruptions caused by the loss of administrative and management staff who had supported the agency's inspectors, according to two FDA officials.",
      "\"These administrative functions are being streamlined as part of HHS' transformation initiative to make the agency more efficient and responsive. FDA inspectors were not impacted and this critical work will continue,\" an HHS spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The inspections and investigations office will now need to work with FDA's drug, device and food centers to reprioritize their workload for the rest of the year, one official said. That will mean trimming routine \"surveillance inspections\" for more urgent tasks, the official said, like inspections of firms where the agency has been alerted to a safety risk or follow-up visits to ensure that drugmakers or food producers have fixed previous violations.",
      "One of the biggest immediate impacts on the agency's inspectors stems from the elimination of the office's travel operations division, one official said. The team's work ranged from booking flights to coordinating with the State Department to secure translators needed for inspections of drugmakers and food producers abroad.",
      "\"As of yesterday, all front-line investigators will now be spending significant time processing their own travel and related administrative requirements, rather than spending that time in firms ensuring the American consumer is protected,\" one FDA official told CBS News.",
      "A pilot program of unannounced foreign inspections has also been paused due to the cuts, an official said, because of the loss of staff that had been tasked with quickly securing translators around the world.",
      "The FDA has long struggled to meet its own inspection goals, which was worsened by a backlog created during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a January report by the Government Accountability Office, the FDA was facing a swelling list of food safety inspections that were on track to miss deadlines mandated by Congress, as they struggled to hire and retain qualified inspectors.",
      "While current inspections are still taking place, multiple FDA officials said that cuts are likely to worsen delays caused by other challenges introduced by the Trump administration's efforts to cut spending in recent months.",
      "As one example, multiple officials said that field operations have been hampered by a new government-wide $1 limit on spending cards. Any spending above that limit requires a cumbersome approval process.",
      "Inspectors had already been asked to plan their inspections a month in advance due to the delays caused by the spending limit, one official said.",

      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2,231 points, or 5.5%, and is down 14% since peaking in February. The Nasdaq Composite slid 963 points, or 5.8%. That means the the tech-heavy index is now in a bear market, or when stocks drop at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "Tech stocks have flailed this week because of concerns that American tariffs on China \u2014 along with countermeasures from Beijing \u2014 will hurt the high-tech sector, which has been key to driving corporate profits.",

      "Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, told clients that the U.S. could tip into a recession later this year unless the U.S. moves to ease tariffs.",
      "\"In the near term, we believe the effective tariff rates could be higher still, and without President Trump taking active steps to reduce tariffs over the next three to six months, we are likely to enter a downside scenario, including a meaningful U.S. recession and lower equity markets,\" he said in a research note.",
      "The free-fall amounts to the biggest two-day drop for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since March 2020, when the pandemic began, and has wiped out trillions of dollars in investor wealth.",

      "Overseas markets also slid Friday. In overnight trading in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dropped 2.8%, while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%. In European trading, Germany's DAX lost 2%, France's CAC 40 in Paris dipped 1.6% and Britain's FTSE 100 shed 1.7%.",
      "U.S. growth downgraded",
      "Economists have downgraded their outlook for U.S. economic growth this year as Mr. Trump piles tariffs on a growing list of countries, warning that the levies are likely to boost inflation. That could reduce consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, as well as crimp business investment.",
      "Import taxes are largely borne by businesses, which typically pass on part or much of those added costs to consumers. As a result, Americans could face higher prices for electronics, household appliances, cars, clothing, furniture, and food such as coffee and chocolate, according to economists.",
      "\"Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,\" Powell said\u00a0Friday.",
      "According to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research firm, the Trump administration's tariffs could cost U.S. households more than $1,900 this year.",
      "David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, thinks U.S. trade officials will eventually lower tariff rates as they negotiate with their counterparts abroad. But that process is likely to take time, and the investment bank doesn't expect a speedy reversal in U.S. tariffs. As a result, UBS economists have lowered their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to less than 1%.",
      "China strikes back",
      "Investors are also nervously watching as the barrage of U.S. tariffs prompts retaliation from key trading partners. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014 materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose trade sanctions on 27 additional U.S. companies.",

    "story": [
      "Europe vowed retaliation. China plotted tariffs of its own. Mexico scrambled to blunt the blow. But while the world's leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports, Argentina's right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "As part of his enthusiastic outreach to Mr. Trump, Argentine President Javier Milei flew from one of the planet's southernmost nations all the way to Palm Beach for 24 hours to receive an award honoring his libertarian agenda and, he'd hoped, to chat with Mr. Trump, who was also scheduled to attend the right-wing \"American Patriot\" gala.",
      "\"Make Argentina Great Again!\" Milei bellowed from the ballroom stage at at Mar-a-Lago late Thursday.",
      "It would have been the fourth face-to-face meeting between the leaders since Mr. Trump's election victory last November as President Milei, who has imposed a sweeping austerity program to fix Argentina's long troubled economy, offers himself as one of Mr. Trump's strongest allies in the global culture war against the \"woke\" left.",
      "Whether Milei's staunch alliance with Mr. Trump can actually help crisis-stricken Argentina remains to be seen, analysts say.",
      "\"He has a special relationship with Trump that has been good for him politically, but he needs to translate that into being good for the country economically,\" said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, director for the Americas at New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \"He hasn't managed to do that yet.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Milei pulled Argentina out of the World Health Organization after the U.S. announced its own exit.",
      "He threatened to quit the Paris climate accord after Mr. Trump did. He outlawed gender change treatments for minors after Mr. Trump banned transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. He even promoted a cryptocurrency token echoing the $Trump memecoin \u2014 at great political cost. In Milei's case, the cryptocoin Libra collapsed and left investors holding the bag, to the tune of $250 million. He later admitted that he posted about the coin without properly vetting the details.",
      "Milei has also slashed government spending, similarly to what Mr. Trump and Elon Musk have done with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has reduced government spending in Argentina by over 30% since taking office in 2023 by eliminating about a dozen government agencies, laying off 10% of the federal workforce and freezing state wages and pensions. While the cuts have lowered the country's hyperinflation, they have pushed up unemployment and poverty rates. Weekly protests have been held criticizing the cuts.",
      "The cuts were something Milei promised while running for office, even wielding a chainsaw during his campaign. He then gifted Musk\u00a0a giant chainsaw modeled\u00a0after the power tool. Musk waved the chainsaw during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "Railing against socialism and feminism at speaking events all over the world \u2014 including at CPAC \u2014 Milei has fashioned himself into something of a MAGA celebrity.",
      "Argentinian government reacts to Trump tariffs",
      "While U.S. partners and rivals alike were criticizing Mr. Trump's tariffs, a tux-clad Milei was holding forth beside a painting of Mr. Trump's pumped fist, reveling in the opportunity to prove himself a dogged champion of the American president.",
      "\"As you can see, we conduct policy with actions, not mere words, and on that we agree with President Donald Trump,\" Milei told the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, drawing cheers at the mention of the American president's name as he spoke in Spanish.",
      "In Buenos Aires, Milei's government sought to reconcile Mr. Trump's major round of tariffs with its own radical libertarian ideology and fervent support for free trade.",
      "\"We do not believe this is an attack on free trade, quite the opposite,\" Milei's spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said of Mr. Trump's announcement. \"I don't see why there should be so much concern about this.\"",
      "For all the leaders' mutual flattery, Argentina was slapped with a 10% minimum tariff. But officials framed it as uniquely preferential treatment. The front page of Argentina's largest-circulation daily, Clar\u00edn, declared: \"Trump raises the tax on our products less than on other countries.\"",
      "In Washington, Argentine Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein on Thursday held what he described as \"highly productive\" meetings with top U.S. trade negotiator Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, releasing rosy statements promising that Argentina was on its way to negotiating a free-trade agreement with the U.S.",
      "Milei praised progress toward the free deal in his Mar-a-Lago speech. But far more important to the Argentine leader is a hoped-for $20 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The badly needed cash would help Milei keep his ambitious economic reforms on track as pressure mounts on the country's sparse foreign currency reserves.",
      "Milei has already used executive powers to remove the need for Congress to approve a new IMF program. But the loan hasn't cleared the finish line, with negotiators still haggling over how much cash Argentina, a serial defaulter that owes some $44 billion to the fund, will be allowed to access up-front.",
      "It was against this backdrop on Wednesday that Milei, accompanied by his economy minister, hopped on the plane to the U.S., the fund's biggest stakeholder. He told journalists he expected \"an informal meeting\" with Mr. Trump, who was instrumental during his first term in helping Argentina secure a major $56 billion loan from the fund in 2018.",
      "But on Friday, Milei's much-anticipated photo-op with Mr. Trump was nowhere to be found in his publicist's slick montage of the Argentine president snapping selfies with fans on Mar-a-Lago's red carpet.",
      "The president's office said nothing about his meeting \u2014 or, non-meeting \u2014 with Mr. Trump, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach very late Thursday evening after attending an event with professional golfers at one of his golf courses near Miami. The White House didn't say whether he and Milei met.",
      "Major Argentine newspapers cited anonymous officials saying the leaders never met, drawing instant scorn from his political enemies.",
      "\"When I woke up, I thought I'd find on TV the photo-op with your 'friend' Trump that you went looking for,\" left-wing former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner wrote on social media. \"What a way to mess around and spend money on nothing.\"",

      "When announcing his latest round of tariffs on April 2, President Trump veered into the subject of eggs, noting that prices \"dropped now 59%, and they're going down more, and the availability is fantastic.\"",
      "Wholesale egg prices \u2014 or the price paid by large buyers like grocery stores \u2014 have declined 43% since year start, with much of the decline occurring since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. While retail data for March isn't yet available, grocery stores tell CBS MoneyWatch that lower prices are now starting to trickle down to consumers, and that there should be plenty of eggs available for Easter and Passover later this month.",
      "Lower egg prices may represent a bright point for consumers at a time when inflation remains sticky, and\u00a0may reignite\u00a0this year due Mr. Trump's tariffs, economists say. The new levies are set to hit all imports from food products to automobiles. Egg prices have declined partly due to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's five-point plan to tackle the issue, which includes battling the bird flu and importing eggs\u00a0from nations including Turkey and South Korea.",
      "Egg prices at Northeast grocery chain Stew Leonard's have declined recently, with conventional eggs now down to to about $5.99 a dozen from $10 a dozen at their peak in December, said Andrew Hollis, director of sales.",
      "\"We're definitely back to low price eggs again \u2014 there's lot of relief and plenty of supply,\" Hollis told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our demand will go up 40% for Easter, so we're not worried at all and feel like we'll have plenty of eggs on the shelf.\"",
      "Demand for eggs also fell due to the high retail prices at the end of 2024, which caused some households to cut back on buying them, Hollis added. That's allowed farmers to rebuild their supply, he said.",
      "Walmart, one of the nation's biggest grocers, also said that its egg prices have declined in recent weeks, although it didn't specify the decline. A dozen eggs are retailing for about $5 a dozen, according to Walmart's website.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Friday said he would sign another executive order to delay enforcement of a law that effectively bans TikTok, amid talks about a possible deal to sell the widely popular platform.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0signed an executive order on his first day directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days. The order instructed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against \"any entity for any noncompliance.\" The executive order expires Saturday, April 5.",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday he wouldn't enforce the law for at least another 75 days.",
      "\"My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed,\" the president wrote. \"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark.' We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.\"",
      "A deal had been reached Wednesday between investors, TikTok's Beijing-based parent company ByteDance and the U.S. government that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, according to a source familiar with the plans. The deal allowed ByteDance to keep a minority stake, and Mr. Trump planned to sign an order approving the deal and allowing for a 120-day closing period.",
      "But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House on Thursday that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, ByteDance, originally had until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services.",
      "TikTok\u00a0briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action.",
      "Apple and Google did not\u00a0restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores for nearly a month after Mr. Trump issued the first directive.",
      "Even though Mr. Trump has declined to enforce the ban, the law is still on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. But the law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok in the event of a sale.",
      "When TikTok challenged the law last year, it argued that it never had a choice between divestment or a ban because a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\" The Chinese government previously vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user.",
      "In a statement after Mr. Trump's announcement Friday, a ByteDance spokesperson acknowledged the company has been in discussions with the U.S. government about \"a potential solution.\"",
      "\"An agreement has not been executed. There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested last month he could ease tariffs on the Chinese if they approved the deal.",
      "\"Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,\" the president said on March 27. \"Every point in tariffs is worth more than TikTok.\"",
      "But on Wednesday he announced he would impose a 34% additional tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S.",
      "Lawmakers, however, are likely to be dissatisfied if any deal does not fully sever ties between ByteDance and TikTok.",
      "\"If ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal \u2014 plain and simple,\" Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China Committee, said last month.",
      "He said a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while using ByteDance's algorithm runs afoul of the law because ByteDance would still have access to user data.",
      "\"This setup reeks of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014 in 2023, through the failed Project Texas, ByteDance tried to create the illusion of better data privacy by storing Americans' data on U.S. servers, all while ByteDance kept its grip on the platform. On the surface, shifting data storage to the United States might have seemed like a reasonable fix, but it ignored the real issue: ByteDance's control over TikTok,\" Moolenaar\u00a0wrote in an opinion piece in the National Review last month.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. But the Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Moolenaar and Republican members of the China committee said in a statement Friday that they \"stand firm\" in their position.",
      "\"Any resolution must ensure that U.S. law is followed, and that the Chinese Communist Party does not have access to American user data or the ability to manipulate the content consumed by Americans,\" they said. \"We remain committed to enforcing the framework established by Congress to safeguard the American people.\"",
      "During a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last year, then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who's now secretary of state, explained that U.S. officials viewed TikTok as a national security threat because the algorithm that powers the platform is controlled by a China-based company. The Chinese government, he said, could force TikTok to give it access to the data it collects on tens of millions of Americans or use it to push propaganda to them.",
      "\"TikTok does not work without that algorithm, and that algorithm is controlled by a company that's controlled by the Chinese Communist Party under the law of China,\" Rubio said.",
      "Three Democratic senators\u00a0wrote to Mr. Trump in March asking him to work with Congress to find a long-term solution to TikTok's survival. The senators \u2014 Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Cory Booker of New Jersey \u2014 said they opposed a TikTok ban, but called it \"unacceptable and unworkable\" for the Trump administration \"to continue ignoring the requirements in the law.\"",
      "TikTok challenged the law in court, but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court days before it took effect. The Supreme Court's decision said the divest-or-ban law does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",

      "The Fed chair's remarks come two days after Trump unveiled\u00a0sweeping tariffs that have upended the global economy and sent stock prices in the U.S. and overseas plunging, with investors nervously watching as key trading partners retaliate. China on Friday said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, the day after Mr. Trump's new tariffs go into effect.",
      "In written remarks delivered in Arlington, Virginia, Powell said that the tariffs and their impacts on the economy and inflation are \"significantly larger than expected.\" He also said that the import taxes are \"highly likely\" to lead to \"at least a temporary rise in inflation,\" but added that \"it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent.\"",
      "\"Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,\" Powell said. \"Our obligation is to ... make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,\" he added.",
      "Powell's focus on inflation suggests that the Fed will likely keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at about 4.3% in the coming months. That is likely to disappoint Wall Street investors, who now expect five interest rate cuts this year, a number that has increased since President Donald Trump announced the tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Trump on Friday, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, urged Powell to cut rates, writing that now would be the \"PERFECT time\" to do it. The president went on to criticize the Fed chair as \"always 'late,'\" adding that \"he could now change his image, and quickly.\"",
      "Economists forecast that the tariffs will weaken the economy, possibly threaten hiring, and push up prices. In that scenario, the Fed could cut rates to bolster the economy, or it could keep rates unchanged \u2014 or even hike them \u2014 to combat inflation. Powell's comments suggest the Fed will mostly focus on inflation.",
      "\"At the Fed, we are squarely focused on achieving the dual-mandate goals Congress has given us of maximum employment and stable prices,\" said Powell. \"While uncertainty is high and downside risks have risen, the economy is still in a good place. The incoming data show solid growth, a labor market in balance, and inflation running much closer to, but still above, our 2% objective.\"",
      "Tricky combination",
      "Weaker growth and higher prices are a tricky combination for the Fed. Typically the central bank would reduce its key interest rate to lower borrowing costs and spur the economy in the event of slower growth, while it would raise rates \u2014 or keep them elevated \u2014 to slow spending and combat inflation.",
      "\"We are closely watching this tension between the hard and soft data,\" said Powell. \"As the new policies and their likely economic effects become clearer, we will have a better sense of their implications for the economy and for monetary policy.\"",
      "Some positive news arrived Friday when the government reported that hiring accelerated in March, with\u00a0228,000 jobs added, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, from 4.1%.",
      "Yet those figures measure hiring in mid-March, before the scope of the duties became clear. The tariffs have also raised uncertainty about how the economy will fare in the coming months, which could limit businesses' willingess to invest and hire.",
      "\"The Fed is in a tough spot with inflation set to accelerate and the economy poised to slow,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide.",

      "Mr. Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs included a whopping 50% levy on the small, impoverished nation's imports, and the Lesotho government quickly said it would send a delegation to Washington.",
      "\"We need to urgently travel to the U.S. to engage with its executives and plead our case,\" Trade Minister Mokhethi Shelile told reporters Thursday. \"My biggest concern was the immediate closure of factories and job losses.\"",
      "Lesotho's annual gross domestic product of $2 billion is highly reliant on exports, mostly of textiles, including jeans.",
      "\"There are 11 factories in the country, most of which export goods to the U.S. and provide employment to 12,000 workers,\" Shelile said. \"Goods currently in production will be affected by these tariffs and will not be exported to the U.S.\"",
      "He said he'd asked factories to continue operating \"while we work on solutions,\" and added that the U.S. action showed his country needed to \"diversify\" its trade relationships, which he said it had already started exploring.",
      "\"We cannot rely solely on the U.S.,\" he said. \"While this transition will take time, the process is already underway.\"",
      "To determine the rates of its new tariffs, the White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers. Economists have questioned the methodology, and many\u00a0foreign governments have complained\u00a0the levies are unfair and misrepresent their trade imbalances with the U.S.",
      "The White House claims, by way of that formula, that Lesotho imposes 99% tariffs and other barriers on U.S. imports.",
      "Below is a look at the small kingdom, sometimes called \"the Switzerland of Africa\" thanks to its mountainous landscape. It took a bigger tariff hit from the White House this week than any other country.",

      "With an annual gross domestic product of just over $2 billion, Lesotho is largely dependent on South Africa \u2014 it biggest trading partner \u2014 from which it imports most of its food, selling water in return.",
      "The economy has been heavily reliant on textile exports bound for the United States through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade deal, which provides duty-free access to the U.S. market for some African products. The Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on African nations has raised questions over how likely the White House is to renew the AGOA pact when it expires in September.",

      "The country also pioneered the growing of cannabis for medical use in Africa.",
      "Unemployment has remained stubbornly high, hitting nearly 25% in 2023, according to the World Bank.",
      "\"Poverty and inequality remain significant challenges,\" the World Bank says. \"Despite efforts to improve living standards, a significant portion of Lesotho's population lives below the poverty line, with rural areas being particularly affected. Access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and clean water remains limited, contributing to poor health outcomes and educational attainment. High rates of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis further strain the healthcare system, reducing the workforce and increasing the dependency ratio.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 12:41:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists say that President Trump's wide-ranging new tariffs raise the risk of a recession or stagflation.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is promising that his April 2 \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0volley of tariffs will \"make America wealthy again\" by repatriating manufacturing jobs and reviving demand for American-made products. But many economists are taking a different view, warning that the tariffs could lead to more dire economic scenarios, including a recession or stagflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has said the two new tariffs he unveiled Wednesday \u2014 a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and so-called\u00a0reciprocal tariffs\u00a0applied to imports from about 90 nations \u2014 will revitalize American manufacturing, create jobs and generate federal revenue.",
      "But economists are ringing alarm bells as they digest the impact of the wide-ranging tariffs, which they forecast will accelerate inflation and dampen U.S. economic growth. That's because Mr. Trump's tariffs will be paid by U.S. businesses that import goods and materials from other countries, and they are likely to pass on some or all of those costs to consumers through higher prices.",
      "As a result, experts say, inflation is likely to reignite, which could cause some U.S. households to back on spending. Because consumer spending accounts for about 70 cents of every $1 in GDP, economic growth could slow.",
      "Together, those outcomes could create \"stagflation,\" a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that describes periods when economic growth falters even as prices remain painfully high.",
      "The risks of recession\u00a0\u2014 a downturn that includes at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the nation's gross domestic product \u2014 are also rising due to Mr. Trump's latest tariffs, according to new estimates from several Wall Street economists.",
      "If the fresh U.S. tariffs spur retaliatory measures from other nations, \"serious recessions\" could emerge both in the U.S. and globally, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. A U.S. recession would likely reduce GDP by 2% and boost unemployment next year to 7.5%, up from its current rate of 4.1%, he estimated.",
      "On Friday, China announced it would implement a 34% retaliatory tariff on U.S. imports beginning April 10, a day after Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs are slated to go into effect.",
      "Still, for now that scenario remains unlikely, with Zandi assigning it a 15% probability. If the Trump administration drops some tariffs and offers exemptions for some products or nations, a recession would be more mild, with unemployment topping out at 5.5%, he added. Zandi said he is giving a 35% probability to this outcome.",
      "To be sure, while many economists are raising the likelihood of a recession, they also say the economy remains relatively strong, with low unemployment and steady growth. Much depends on whether the Trump administration sticks with its tariffs or eases up on some policies.",
      "Brace for higher inflation",
      "More certain is that Mr. Trump's tariffs will boost inflation, noted Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. Consumer prices could accelerate by 1 percentage point by year-end, he added, which would boost the inflation rate close to 4% from its current level.",
      "That could prove painful for many Americans, including for supporters of Mr. Trump who backed his candidacy because of his promises to \"end the inflation nightmare\" of the post-pandemic years. According to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll,\u00a0 most Americans said the president has focused too much on\u00a0tariffs, which they fear could end up raising prices, and not enough on lowering consumer costs.",
      "A hike in inflation from Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs could add $1,000 in annual costs for low-income households, Daco estimated. Products ranging from Apple's iPhones, which are largely manufactured in China, to clothing made in Vietnam could spike in price due to the reciprocal tariffs, with those nations facing rates of 34% and 46%, respectively.",
      "However, other estimates predict a bigger hit to Americans' budgets, with the Yale Budget Lab forecasting that the April 2 tariffs will cost a typical household about $2,148.",
      "\"With the most significant tariff increases targeting countries central to the U.S. supply chain for consumer goods \u2014 China, Vietnam, Taiwan and Cambodia \u2014 households should expect higher prices across a wide range of everyday items,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.",
      "Here's what other top economists are predicting",
      "Oxford Economics: \"[T]he announced tariffs will significantly raise the effective U.S. tariff rate to slightly less than 30%, matching levels not seen since the 1930s .... Oxford Economics' Global Economic Model [forecasts] U.S. GDP growth at 1.4% and core inflation rising to 3.9% this year.\" \u2014Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist",
      "PNC Financial Services: \"The U.S. economy is in good shape at the start of the second quarter, but the ongoing trade war has increased the risk of near-term recession dramatically.\" \u2014Economist Ershang Liang",
      "Nationwide: \"[W]e revise down our real GDP growth estimate to a range of zero \u20130.5% Q4/Q4 2025 (previously we forecast 1% \u2013 1.5% growth, while significant retaliation by our trading partners could tip GDP growth negative and result in a recession.\" \u2014Chief economist Kathy Bostjancic",
      "Capital Economics: \"[W]e see U.S. GDP growth slowing to around 1.5% annualized, but the risks are to the downside and we would put the odds of a recession at about 30%. U.S. CPI inflation now looks set to jump to around 4.5% later this year.\" \u2014Its global economics team",
      "Deutsche Bank: \"[T]hese actions could potentially shave 1 - 1.5 [percentage points] from growth this year and add a broadly similar amount to core PCE inflation .... Recession risks will likely rise materially if these tariffs are sustained.\" \u2014Economics team",
      "Morningstar: \"The tariff hikes announced April 2, if maintained, represent a self-inflicted economic catastrophe for the U.S. .... We haven't yet published a full update, but we'll likely be reducing our U.S. real GDP growth forecast for 2025 and 2026.

      "At its 60-minute Nintendo Direct presentation, the company revealed a more vibrant display on the Switch 2, a larger screen and several games that will launch with the console.",
      "Central to its updated system is a new \"C\" button on its Joy-Con controller, which will launch a new \"GameChat\" feature that allows you to \"communicate with friends and family while playing a game\" and lets you share your game screen with other players. A built-in microphone will also allow you to chat with other gamers. The \"GameChat\" feature requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service.",
      "\"When you think about some of the biggest titles on (the Nintendo Switch), it's like Mario Kart, Super Mario Jamboree, even though that's quite a new title, has cracked the top 10 of most play games on the console. So, it does make a lot of sense that the sort of headline feature is geared primarily towards that sort of use,\" said Hannah Cowton-Barnes, a London-based video game industry expert for Tech Advisor.",
      "Perhaps the most contemporary function yet for the Switch 2 is the ability to use the Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse. The developer displayed multiple ways to use the new function in games, such as angling a club in a golf game.",
      "The new portable console features a 7.9 inch LCD screen that displays in 1080p. Nintendo also revealed in the live stream that, when docked, the system will be able to support 4K resolution for compatible games.",

      "The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed \"Project 007,\" revisiting a classic Nintendo 64 console hit revered by many first-person shooter fans.",

      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",

      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",

    "story": [
      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations will face only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries will be charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports will face the baseline rate of 10%, while China will face a 34% tariff.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his\u00a0Wednesday remarks.",
      "Asian nations will face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic. On top of China's 34% reciprocal tariff, imports from that nation will also face previously announced 20% tariffs, bringing that nation's total rate to more than 60%, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries likely to retaliate against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",

    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014\u00a0China announced Friday that it will impose a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10. The new tariff matches the rate of the U.S. tariff announced by President Trump this week, which he called a \"reciprocal\" measure, claiming China had tariffs and other measures in place on U.S. goods already that amounted to a 67% trade barrier.",
      "For Mr. Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, the White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers, in reaching its decision on how heavily to tariff almost every other country in the world. Economists have questioned the methodology, and many foreign governments have complained the levies are unfair and misrepresent their trade imbalances with the U.S.",
      "The Commerce Ministry in Beijing also said in a notice that it will impose more export controls on rare earths, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries.",
      "Here's what economists are saying about Trump's tariffs",
      "Here's what economists are saying about Trump's tariffs",
      "Included in the list of minerals subject to controls was samarium and its compounds, which are used in aerospace manufacturing and the defense sector. Another element called gadolinium is used in MRI scans.",
      "China's customs administration said it had suspended imports of chicken from two U.S. suppliers, Mountaire Farms of Delaware and Coastal Processing. It said Chinese customs had repeatedly detected furazolidone, a drug banned in China, in shipments from those companies.",
      "Additionally, the Chinese government said it has added 27 firms to lists of companies subject to trade sanctions or export controls. Among them, 16 are subject to a ban on the export of \"dual-use\" goods. High Point Aerotechnologies, a defense tech company, and Universal Logistics Holding, a publicly traded transportation and logistics company, were among those listed.",
      "Beijing also announced Friday that it had filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization over the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "Later Friday, Mr. Trump criticized China's decision to match his tariffs, saying in a social media post: \"CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED \u2014 THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!\"",
      "The Trump administration's unveiling of its massive package of tariffs this week has proven a gut-punch for global stocks, with American markets recording their worst day of losses Thursday since the COVID pandemic struck. That hemorrhaging of stock values continued in Asian and European markets Friday as China announced its retaliation \u2014 becoming the first country to do so since Mr. Trump made his announcement at the White House on Wednesday.",
      "China and other nations have voiced hope that new trade agreements with Washington can be struck, and they stress they will pursue negotiations that Mr. Trump has indicated an openness to, but even close allies such as the United Kingdom, which was hit with the minimum 10% base rate tariff on Wednesday, have also made clear that retaliatory measures remain under consideration.",

      "Asian stocks fell further Friday, though markets in Shanghai, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia were closed for holidays, limiting the extent of the day's declines, The Associated Press reported. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 2.8% while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%.",

      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",

This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",

With car prices expected to rise under the tariffs, experts\u00a0are advising shoppers in the market for new vehicles to buy them now, in order to avoid paying thousands of dollars more under the auto tariffs.",
      "\"Vehicles on lots and the inventory that exists today has not been impacted by tariffs, so it's a good time to buy a car,\" Joe McCabe, president and CEO of AutoForecast Solutions, a provider of automobile industry insights, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has to fit within the financial boundaries of the consumer, but this would be the preferred time to do it.\"",
      "There's evidence that consumers are following that advice. In its first-quarter sales report Tuesday, Ford said buyers flocked to its dealerships, ahead of anticipated increases in car prices.",
      "Retail sales \u2014 or direct-to-consumer-sales \u2014 rose 5% in the first quarter, driven by a 19% surge during the month of March, the Michigan-based automaker reported. The company did not state outright that the bump was related to Trump's upcoming tariff announcement.",
      "Burlington, Vermont-based artist Val Hird is among the consumers who rushed to lock in a deal on her vehicle of choice before April 2, which Mr. Trump has referred to as \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "A day before Mr. Trump announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on vehicles on auto parts imported into the U.S., Hird had decided to purchase a vehicle, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Hird said she had wanted a Toyota RAV4 Plug-in hybrid, but her local Toyota dealer did not have the car in stock. \"I would have ordered one, except we just found out there are going to be tariffs. So, we assumed if it's not yet in the country, or in transit to the country, that would probably throw it into the 'who knows what the price will be' category,\" she said of her reluctance to place an order on a new car.",
      "Instead, Hird located a used version of her preferred car model at another dealership in Rhode Island, which she \"leapt to the phone\" to buy.",
      "She ultimately paid $45,453 for the pre-owned Toyota hybrid. Had that particular model not been available, Hird said she would have forewent the purchase of a car altogether and waited to see how the trade war progressed.",
      "\"I don't live in a world where I can spend an extra $10,000,\" Hird said of the anticipated tariff-related price hikes on cars.",
      "Tariff talk at dealerships grows",
      "Analysts say that tariffs are top of mind for consumers, with dealers saying consumers are increasingly weaving talk of the levies into their car-buying conversations.",
      "Data from Cox Automotive, which owns several popular car insight sites, including Kelley Blue Book, Autotrader and Dealer.com, shows a dramatic uptick in car shopping activity in recent days. There was a 27% uptick in visits to Kelly Blue Book Thursday after Mr. Trump announced 25% auto tariffs.",
      "On Friday, users logged 54% more new car leads on Dealer.com, meaning they submitted inquiries to dealers about vehicles they were interested in buying. Auto Trader notched an uptick of 16% in used car leads.",
      "\"It makes a lot of sense; I would assume that people would have gotten started researching to see what things look like now,\" Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "More pressure on cost-conscious to buy now",
      "Car prices are likely to rise when tariffs go into effect.",
      "\"With Trump's 'Liberation Day' here it is becoming crystal clear this tariff/U.S. policy will cause pure chaos to the global auto industry and will raise the prices of a typical car to a U.S. consumer by $5k to $10k out of the gates,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a report. \"We stress that the concept of a U.S. car maker with parts all from the U.S. is a fictional tale that does not exist and would take years to make this concept a reality.\"",
      "By contrast, vehicles currently sitting on dealers' lots are insulated from the levies.",
      "\"If consumers are seeing prices on lots saying, 'here's the tariff adjustment cost,' they should challenge that, because sitting inventory is not subject to tariffs,\" Aaron Bragman, Detroit bureau chief of Cars.com, a car buying marketplace, told CBS MoneyWatch. He noted that existing inventory is relatively stable. \"There are vehicles to be had, we aren't seeing an inventory crunch right now.\"",
      "Indeed, McCabe said dealers are seeing increased interest in vehicles on lots from consumers, and \"are going to be more picky on their consumers to get the best price they can.\"",
      "Said McCabe, \"They know the supply and demand issue will change pretty quickly with the tariff impact.\"",
      "That's why his advice to consumers who need a new car is to start shopping now. \"If you need car and can afford it, get out there now,\" he said.",
      "In particular, motorists on the lower end of the income scale should consider making their car purchases immediately, he said, because any kind of price hike could push them out of the market for a vehicle altogether.",
      "\"There's a cost-conscious consumer that if you start tariffing them, they'll stop buying the vehicle because it doesn't fit in their budget,\" McCabe said.",

    "summary": "President Trump rolled out new tariffs on April 2 aimed at easing trade imbalances. Here's which products could become more expensive as a result.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation-weary Americans may soon find they're paying more for a host of products after President Trump announced two new types of tariffs on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day\" because he believes the measures will erase trade imbalances between the U.S. and other nations.",
      "While Mr. Trump characterizes tariffs as paid by other nations, they are in fact paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart or Amazon. Because the tariffs create higher costs for those businesses, they typically pass on all or some of the tariffs to consumers through price hikes.",
      "The new tariffs introduced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday include a 10% universal tariff, as well as so-called reciprocal tariffs on more than 60 countries that are trade partners with the U.S. The tariffs will be additive, meaning that imports will face both the universal tariff of 10% plus the specific reciprocal import levies targeting each nation.",
      "During his announcement, Mr. Trump's said the tariffs will would eventually lower prices for Americans, an issue on which voters say they want him to focus. But economists are predicting instead that consumers and businesses will likely encounter higher inflation, with price hikes on everything from food imports like coffee and chocolate to iPhones and other electronics manufactured outside the U.S.",
      "\"For all of President Trump's talk of a new 'golden age,' this huge tax increase will inevitably result in higher prices for American families, lower growth and business investment, and diminished exports and manufacturing output as the country's factories face retaliation abroad and costlier inputs (roughly half of all imports) at home,\" said Scott Lincicome and Colin Grabow, trade experts at the Cato Institute, in an email.",
      "They added, \"With today's announcement, U.S. tariffs will approach levels not seen since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which incited a global trade war and deepened the Great Depression.\"",
      "The Trump administration said there are some exclusions to the tariffs, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals, although it added that these products might be subject to tariffs at a later time.",
      "Which products will become more expensive with tariffs?",
      "Because of the 10% universal tariff on imports, any imported good is likely to become more expensive in the coming weeks and months as American companies digest the import duties and adjust their prices in response.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of an appliance jumped more than 11%, adding about $86 to the cost of a new unit,\u00a0according\u00a0to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "Electronics like iPhones and TVs",
      "Among the nations targeted by Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs are China, Taiwan and South Korea, who are top exporters of electronics to the U.S., from Apple iPhones to television sets.",
      "The Trump administration plans to hit China with a reciprocal tariff of 34%, which means that products manufactured there and imported into the U.S. could see higher prices soon after the levies go into effect on April 9.",
      "Almost all iPhones are still manufactured in China, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, although Apple has shifted some of its iPhone fabrication to India. However, the Trump administration will also be adding a 26% reciprocal tariff to Indian imports, it said on Wednesday.",
      "\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China and the question will be around exceptions/exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations/factories/plants in the U.S.,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an April 2 research note.",
      "Automobiles",
      "In addition to Mr. Trump's previously announced 25% tariff on auto imports, which go into effect today, imported autos will also face the 10% universal tariffs. Some U.S.-made vehicles include parts imported from other countries, which will face new tariffs and increase the purchase price of those cars, experts said.",
      "Ultimately, American consumers could end up paying an additional $2,500 to $5,000 for the lowest-cost American cars, and up to $20,000 for some imported models, according to an April 2 estimate from Anderson Economic Group.",
      "Clothing and shoes",
      "The bulk of apparel and shoes sold in U.S. stores like Walmart and Target is manufactured outside the U.S., with China, Vietnam and Bangladesh among the biggest exporters.",
      "All three nations will face reciprocal tariffs from the Trump administration, at 34% for China, 46% for Vietnam and 37% for Bangladesh.",
      "Wine and spirits",
      "Italian and French wines and Scottish whisky are also likely to rise in price, as European Union imports will face a reciprocal tariff of 20% while United Kingdom-made products will face a 10% import duty.",
      "\"Tariffs on imported wines will create a ripple effect across the industry \u2014 impacting importers, distributors and consumers alike,\" Louis Amoroso, CEO of Full Glass Wine Co., told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Amoroso, whose company owns direct-to-consumer wine retailers, added, \"While it's better than 200%, a 20% tariff still compounds through the supply chain and could lead to a 40% or more cost increase for consumers.\"",
      "Furniture",
      "About 30% to 40% of furniture sold in the U.S. is manufactured in other countries, according to CNBC. Top exporters of furniture to the U.S. include China and Vietnam.",
      "Coffee and chocolate",
      "The U.S. imports about 80% of its coffee beans from Latin American countries such as Brazil and Colombia, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Both nations are included in Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs, with each facing rates of 10%.",
      "Chocolate is another major Latin American import, given that the U.S. climate is by and large unsuited to growing cocoa beans. Among the nations that export cocoa beans to the country are Cote d'Ivoire and Ecuador, according to the USDA. Those nations will face reciprocal tariffs of 21% and 10%, respectively.",
      "Swiss watches",

      "\"In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" the president said in a White House Rose Garden announcement. \"And for these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\"",
      "\"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating, and because we are being very kind, we're a kind people, very kind,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're not so kind when you're ripped off\u2026 We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.\"",

      "What are tariffs, exactly?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S.\u00a0The most common type of tariffs are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value\"), which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of a product. The 25% auto tariffs are these types of tariffs.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, and \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold.",
      "What do financial experts say about tariffs?",
      "Economists and taxpayer advocacy groups have their doubts, and are warning tariffs could upset economic growth and will almost surely contribute to higher prices for American consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices, after the president announced tariffs on foreign cars and parts.",
      "More than a dozen leaders at think tanks and taxpayer advocacy groups, including at the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday sent a joint letter to congressional leaders and the commerce and treasury secretaries, urging them to consider how tariffs on steel, lumber, energy, pharmaceutical and medical supplies and cars and car parts will increase prices.",
      "\"We encourage you to consider whether tariffs may, in many cases, undermine President Trump's broader long-term economic goals by increasing the cost of goods subject to tariffs,\" they wrote. \"We are especially concerned about tariffs on inputs needed by U.S. manufacturers that make it harder to compete with finished goods made abroad and tariffs that increase the price of necessities like food and housing.\"",
      "Alex Jacquez, who worked on the Biden White House National Economic Council, said that although it's hard to know the exact impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs without knowing all the details, CEOs are telling investors and shareholders they will be hiking prices.",

      "Colin Grabow, associate director at the libertarian Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, wrote in a USA Today op-ed that \"tariffs are a costly and inefficient tax usually borne by the importing country's customers.\"",
      "\"Americans may have voted for lower prices in November, but under the guise of tariff reciprocity, the Trump administration is set to deliver something very different,\" Grabow wrote.",
      "A reporter on Tuesday asked Leavitt if the president is thinking about seniors on fixed income who are stressed about the recent swings in the stock market, swings partly attributed to the president's tariff announcements. Stocks have struggled as Wall Street braces for the next round of tariffs.",
      "\"Well certainly, they are legitimate concerns and the president takes those concerns very seriously,\" Leavitt said. \"And he's addressing them every single day.

      "The first tariff will be a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S.",
      "The second tariff, reciprocal tariffs, will be applied to imports from 60 countries and are aimed at equalizing the trade imbalances between the U.S. and those nations. Mr. Trump said that reciprocal tariffs \"means they do it to us, and we do it to them.\"",
      "He added, \"It can't get any simpler than that.\"",
      "One example provided by Mr. Trump is that the U.S. charges a 2.5% tariff on automobile imports, while adding that the European Union charges a 10% tariff on American car exports to EU nations.",
      "\"Such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base,\" he added.",
      "What is a reciprocal tariff?",
      "At the moment, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges on German vehicle imports.",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would apply the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries place on American exports on a product-by-product basis. By charging countries only 50% of what they charge U.S. products, Mr. Trump said he is imposing \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump said that the reciprocal tariffs will also include calculations to cover non-monetary trade barriers, such as when nations devalue their currencies to help boost demand for their products from other nations.",
      "When do the tariffs go into effect?",
      "The baseline 10% tariff will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5, while the reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9.",
      "Why is Trump imposing these new tariffs?",
      "During his announcement, Mr. Trump said the goal was to revitalize the industrial and manufacturing base of the U.S., promising that doing so will \"make America wealthy again.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariffs will help convince foreign businesses to relocate their factories to the U.S. The president also promised that the tariffs would lead to lower prices for Americans, although most economists are projecting that Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to boost inflation and lead to higher costs for the typical U.S. household.",
      "For instance, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2014 an inflation measure closely tracked by the Federal Reserve \u2014 could rise 0.5 percentage points to 3.5% by year end, according to a March 30 Goldman Sachs report. The core PCE rose 2.8% in February on an annual basis, reflecting a slight increase from the prior month.",
      "That estimate is based on Mr. Trump's previously announced tariffs, including his 25% import duty on\u00a0auto imports, as well as Goldman's expectation for reciprocal tariffs that would average about 15%.",

    "story": [
      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump\u00a0announced on Wednesday \u2014 a planned import tax blitz he has referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his Wednesday news conference, touting such levies as a way to boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products.",
      "But some economists say that tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners could be hard to structure, while also roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses. Here's what to know about reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product-by-product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges for German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That would be administratively complex given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Other experts suggest the goal is less about driving companies to shift their production to the U.S. or generating federal revenue than about pressuring other nations to strike trade deals that the Trump administration is comfortable with.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-based tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs, the White House announced country-specific tariff rates calibrated to the their trade imbalance with the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said his administration will impose reciprocal tariffs at roughly half the rate of duties charged by other nations. The White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers.",
      "For example, the U.S. will match China's 67% rate with a 34% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "\"They will probably come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods,\" said Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration.",
      "That approach could result in the U.S. taxing other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",
      "Trump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\"\u00a0 a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Those nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.",
      "Simon MacAdam, deputy chief global economist with Capital Economics, thinks likely targets include leading U.S. trading partners such as China, the European Union and Vietnam. In 2024, the largest U.S. trade deficits around the globe \u2014 meaning countries from which the U.S. imports more than it exports \u2014 was with the following nations, according to federal data:",

      "For now, it remains unclear what reciprocal tariff rates the U.S. might charge, although UBS analysts note that the levies imposed during Mr. Trump's first term were smaller and mostly targeted China.",
      "More certain is that reciprocal tariffs would mean added costs for U.S. businesses, experts say, which in turn would likely raise consumer prices\u00a0as companies look to protect their profit margins.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on a business bringing a product into the country. When they receive it at a port of entry, whether it be an airport or seaport, they have to pay the duty to have it admitted into the country,\" Chris Barrett, a professor at Cornell SC Johnson School of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've just added a cost on for the business, and those costs get passed on, at least to some degree, to consumers.\"",
      "How much prices could rise remains unclear. Meanwhile, prices could fall if Mr. Trump later lowers or removes reciprocal tariffs following trade negotiations.",
      "But when there is no good substitute for a particular good, consumer costs are likely to rise more sharply.",
      "\"The more price insensitive they are, the more likely they are to shoulder the burden of the tax,\" Barrett said.",

      "The Trump administration is planning to impose a round of fresh tariffs on April 2, a day President Trump has dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" The announcement is viewed by economists as the culmination of his \"America First Trade Policy,\" an\u00a0executive order he signed on his first day in office aimed at revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump will announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, at an event in the White House Rose Garden, the White House said. He deems the levies necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement last week when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are still unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "On Sunday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that there are 15 countries \"that we have massive, massive trade deficits with,\" but that Mr. Trump will ultimately decided how many countries will be subject to new tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Hassett also promoted tariffs as an effective tool for reshoring manufacturing to the U.S., saying \"it's going to be a boom,\" referring to auto manufacturing in particular.",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",
      "\"Inflation was on trend to fall \u2014 now we expect it to rise,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "President Trump is considering announcing the creation of what he calls the \"External Revenue Service\" on Wednesday as the White House launches his new trade agenda and collects tariff revenues from around the globe, according to sources familiar with the planning.",
      "Mr. Trump is also aiming to again alter Washington's trade relationship with Beijing, and will likely charge tariffs on low-value merchandise shipped from China to individual U.S. consumers.",
      "Details of Mr. Trump's final decision were unclear as of Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Mr. Trump has considered attaching a fee of $25 on low-value packages from China, one of the sources told CBS News. White House spokespeople didn't answer requests for comment. It wasn't clear what levy the president chose.",
      "Currently, a U.S. loophole allows duty-free shipments of Chinese goods worth less than $800.",
      "It has enabled Chinese e-commerce companies such as Shein and Temu to skirt import fees. The practice has undercut other retailers, including American firms, that must pay those fees when buying product in bulk. The so-called de minimis exemption is limited to one shipment per person per day.",
      "The changes, if adopted, would put a pinch on the online shopping habits of American consumers seeking clothing, household products and other goods from China at ultra low prices.",
      "The president is scheduled to hold an event in the Rose Garden at 4 p.m. to herald his tariffs strategy.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously described his idea for the External Revenue Service \u2013 meant to be a play on the unpopular domestic tax collection agency \u2013 as an arm of government \"to collect tariffs, duties, and all revenue that come from foreign sources.\"",
      "In February, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump's goal was \"very simple.\" It was to \"abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay,\" he said on \"Jesse Watters Primetime\" on Fox News.",
      "The practicalities of fully replacing the income tax with tariff revenue, a drastic economic overhaul, would be complex. Abolishing the IRS would require an act of Congress.",
      "Collecting tariffs on goods at ports of entry is currently the responsibility of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Whether the new External Revenue Service would fully assume those duties is unclear, and its establishment could undercut Mr. Trump's promise of shrinking the federal bureaucracy.",
      "The staggering volume of packages from direct-to-consumer Chinese retailers shipped under the de minimis exemption have raised concerns about fentanyl, and other illicit drugs, and counterfeit goods slipping past U.S. screeners.",
      "The Trump administration targeted cheap products from Chinese retailers a couple months ago, but reversed course amid problems and confusion.",
      "Tariffs on the merchandise shipments that took effect on Feb. 4 were partially rolled back on Feb. 7 after packages piled up at ports of entry. The U.S. Postal Service temporarily paused all small-value deliveries from China and Taiwan as it tried to figure out how to collect the duties.",
      "The White House has invited steel and autoworkers to Wednesday's tariffs announcement, as well as most of Mr. Trump's cabinet, officials told CBS News.

      "The following is the transcript of the full interview with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, which aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 6, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Secretary General of NATO Mark Rutte in Brussels. Good morning to you, sir.",
      "NATO SECRETARY GENERAL MARK RUTTE: Good morning. Good to be on the program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you've been a busy man this week. And I know NATO is a defensive alliance, it's not a trade alliance. And you and Secretary Rubio have repeatedly said this trade war is not impacting NATO. But respectfully, how could this tension between allies not have any impact? And are you concerned at all that European countries will move towards other, perhaps cheaper, markets like China?",
      "RUTTE: I'm not saying it doesn't have an impact on individual allies, but it does not have an impact on the alliance. There, Marco Rubio and I are on the same page, because the alliance is focused on making sure we can fight the Russian threat. We can make sure that we can bring Ukraine, as much as possible, collectively under U.S. leadership, to a durable and lasting peace, and that is our laser focus of the last couple of days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: George Marshall \u2014 in Europe, you know, the man who was responsible for the Marshall Plan and helping to rebuild after World War Two, linked economic health to political stability and peace. Don't these tensions make your job a little bit harder?",
      "RUTTE: To be honest, I don't believe so. Yes, you're right, there are tensions between allies because of this- this tariff question, but this is not concerning the alliance as a whole, because there will be potentially impact on the economies, but not to an extent that it will impact our collective defense. That's my firm conviction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Because there is this request from the United States and a call you have made yourself to increase spending on defense. Right? So the next summit is now going to be held in June, and leaders there are expected to hike the military budget spending goal from 2% to 3%. The Trump administration wants it all the way up to spending about 5% on a country's own defense. So you're asking for that. At the same time the United States is repairing its relationship with Russia. How do you convince members to spend more to counter the threat from Russia, at a time when the U.S. is going closer to it, and the U.S. is putting economic pressure on Europe?",
      "RUTTE: Well, first on the U.S. Russia question. What Trump has done since he came into office is break the deadlock when it comes to this terrible war in Ukraine, because we've got to stop the killing, we've got to stop the fighting, and I commend him for that. And- and I must say, allies here in the last couple of days meeting with Foreign Ministers are fully supporting the U.S. effort to bring this war to a fair and durable and lasting end. And we'll see \u2014 we have to see how far we can get.",
      "But I mean, the fact that day at night, the American administration is working on that is- is important. And then when it comes to defense spending the last couple of months here in the European side of NATO, it is staggering the amount of billions coming in. It- it- you have to compare this to the days of the Cold War, when you look at the overall defense spending now being ramped up in Europe- and we have to continue doing this, because, as I said in December, if we would stick to the old 2% we cannot defend ourselves here in three to five years. But with the billions \u2014 literally hundreds of billions coming in now from the Europeans, from \u2014 from \u2014 for example, Germany, half a trillion, and so many other European allies. It's really impressive, and \u2014 and that will help us to one, have a stronger NATO, because we spend more and we produce more.",
      "But secondly, also in NATO, which is fair because- and this is to President Trump's point, it means that we have more equality in terms of what you're spending on defense, and what we are spending here on the European side of NATO on defense. And we need that to become more lethal as an organization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at the same time that President Trump is calling for a peace deal in Ukraine, there is this parallel, separate effort to repair America's relationship with Russia. Reopening diplomatic facilities is being discussed. Just this week Kirill Dmitriev, an ally of President Putin who's under sanctions, was here in Washington meeting with Steve Witkoff, as you know. He said in television interviews, the U.S. and Russia could work together on counterterrorism, in the Arctic and develop rare earths in Russia together. So doesn't the U.S. getting closer to Russia undercut your efforts to counter Russia?",
      "RUTTE: Well, I'm not sure I completely would share your assessment on what the U.S. and Russia are doing at the moment. Of course, I'm not in the room when all these talks take place, but what I'm seeing from a distance and hearing from my American colleagues and- including the President, whom I visited a couple of weeks ago in a very successful meeting we had in the Oval Office and then during lunch. There is this effort to bring this war to an end. And as part of that effort, the U.S. is really trying to- to- and- and at this moment, as we speak, this is Friday. Maybe this has changed on Sunday when you air this, but on Friday, the ball clearly is in the court of the Russians. They are not moving fast enough, is my impression, including the impression I'm getting from my American interlocutors, that- that Russia really has to do more to bring this war to an end.",
      "The Ukrainians are really close to the American position. And we have seen- we have to see how far the Americans can get this. But I am completely supporting that effort, because this war of protection- protection, it was unsustainable in the long term, so many people dying, so much of the Ukrainian infrastructure being damaged, cities being destroyed. This got to end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, you just mentioned Secretary Rubio, who, on Friday, said the Trump administration wanted a complete ceasefire in Ukraine, but the Russians would only agree to a partial one. The U.S. took it because he said, quote, \"it's better than nothing.\" Are you concerned that Russia is dictating terms?",
      "RUTTE:\u00a0 No, I'm not, because I spoke with Marco Rubio, I'm in regular contact with the other members of the American administration. I think you guys are really trying, step-by-step, to get to a situation where this war can end. But of course, the Russia- Russians also have to dance the tango, and at this moment they don't seem to do so, and then it will be difficult. But, the fact that you guys are trying, that the American administration is all the power you can project- project on the world stage. You are trying this because we know that- that the front line was moving in the wrong direction. We know that this war was moving in the wrong direction. This was- this was not going to end well, and already so many people were- were dying, so I really commend your American efforts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Is it your assessment, is it NATO's assessment that Vladimir Putin is not considering ending his invasion of Ukraine?",
      "RUTTE: Well, we don't know. I think this is the test now, and we have to see \u2014",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- What happens if he's not? Do you know what \u2014",
      "RUTTE: \u2014 what his reaction will be to the American proposals.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, what's the consequence? Do you know?",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "RUTTE: So it's difficult for me to assess, but clearly we have to take this step by step. And until January this year, nothing happened when it came to bringing this war to an end. When Trump came in- President Trump came in after his inauguration, he started this process. And- and it- it might take longer than we would want to, but the fact that he tries is therefore also testing the Russians whether they are serious in this. We have to see over the coming weeks how far he can get it, and I'm supporting it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that. General Cavoli, who you know well as the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, the U.S. generals here in Washington testifying this week. He said Russia intends to diminish U.S. leadership and influence. It is actively conducting a destabilization campaign within Europe right now to create strategic dilemmas for the U.S. What is happening to NATO members here, and is Russia succeeding in this destabilization campaign?",
      "RUTTE: Chris Cavoli is the supreme allied commander. He is- he is absolutely right. What we are seeing in Europe, but also in the U.S., but let me speak for the European side of NATO, is that the Russians through cyberattacks, assassination attempts, jamming commercial airplanes in the Baltic area, cyberattacks on the national health service in the United Kingdom, cutting critical undersea infrastructure between Baltic countries and Finland and in other parts of the Baltic, in the Baltic Sea. They are conducting this campaign. The good news is that as NATO, as collective, we are much, much better, not only at assessing what is happening, but also making sure that we prevent the next steps in this campaign from happening. And the Russians hate us for that, and we have to do this so Cavoli is completely right here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that destabilization campaign has not halted or paused as these attempts to broker peace have been underway?",
      "RUTTE: Well, I mean, this whole destabilization campaign is going on for years now and I have no day-to-day assessment, whether it is on a scale from 1 to 10 at number 9, or number 3. But the reports we are getting is that the Russians still very active. We are still worried about, for example, the critical undersea infrastructure. But thanks to Chris Cavoli and in his role as Supreme Allied Commander, we have, in less than 10 days, brought together a big endeavor by European NATO allies in the- in the Baltic Sea to really make it very difficult for the Russians to continue doing this. And again, they- they hate us for this, and I love that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are roughly about 90,000 or more U.S. troops stationed in Europe right now. Secretary Hegseth said Europe should not assume that presence is going to last forever. I know you say that the U.S. is committed to NATO, but do you have any sense of how fast or significant this kind of drawdown that's being mentioned by Hegseth could be, and is there a NATO backup plan?",
      "RUTTE: There are no concrete plans for the drawdown. What we know, and Pete Hegseth was very clear on this, is that this U.S. administration- but by the way, this is U.S. policy since 2010 to pivot more towards Asia, towards the Indo-Pacific. And the agreement we have is that we will do whatever is necessary in a no surprises way. So if it is necessary to draw down or to pivot more towards Asia, to do it in a way that we can really compensate for that, take time, do it step by step, because that is important, because then this concerns the overall defense and the terms of NATO territory.",
      "And at the same time, I completely acknowledge the fact that U.S. has, the United States, has more theaters to attend to, not only the Euro-Atlantic, but also the Indo-Pacific. And by the way, also, thanks to President Trump and his position on this, as NATO, we will be more and more active in the Indo-Pacific with our partners. I will visit Japan next week to have my meetings there with the senior leadership to see how we can intensify that strong relationship we already have with the Indo-Pacific.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about nuclear deterrence. The US and UK are declared nuclear powers, and they give, by extension, NATO some protection. The leaders of Germany, of Poland and France have recently said things about expanding a nuclear umbrella because they are concerned that America isn't going to be as committed to their defense. Have you had any conversations about an alternative to the US nuclear umbrella, or bringing France's arsenal into it?",
      "RUTTE:\u00a0 No, I didn't. And \u2014 and Marco Rubio this week basically repeated what President Trump has said three times now on television: that- that the US is completely committed to NATO, is completely committed to Article Five. That includes the US being the ultimate guarantor, through the nuclear deterrent, for NATO territory, including, and particularly of course, the European part of NATO \u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --So the French are wrong when they raise that?",
      "RUTTE: --And what I'm urging my European colleagues to do is to put on the television and sometimes listen to the senior American leadership when it comes to NATO, instead of worrying constantly about, 'Is- is the US still committed to NATO?' The answer is yes, it has been consistently coming out of the American system over the last three months. Including the expectation that on the European side of NATO and the Canadian side, we will continue ramping up defense spending, because that is only fair, and we are doing it. And that's the good news.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That's not my assessment. That was the leaders of France, Poland, and Germany, sir, as you know. You've raised concern that China is building towards 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030. Is that a direct threat to NATO?",
      "RUTTE: It is. It is a direct threat to the stability in the whole world, including NATO territory, absolutely. They have now more navy ships sailing than the United States. We have a problem, the United States part of NATO, the Canadian part of NATO, European part of NATO, that we are not producing enough defense industrial products. We are producing in a full year in ammunition what Russia is producing in three months. Russia has only 5% of NATO economy, compared. So we are 20 times bigger, the overall NATO economy, than Russia, and Russia is producing four times more in ammunition than the whole of NATO is producing in a year. That's- that's totally crazy, and that's why the President and I discussed, and the other senior leaders in the U.S. and I discussed, also with European allies, that we have not only to ramp up spending, but also the defense industrial production. That includes cutting the red tape, both in the U.S. and here in Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to quickly clarify, China's nuclear arsenal is a direct threat to NATO?",
      "RUTTE: Well, it- it's there not to be used against China. So it is there as a deterrence or whatever the goal is. But I would say more generally, let's not be naive about China. The build up of their armed forces is taking place at a pace which is incredible. And when we talk about Ukraine, and bringing Ukraine to a durable end and a peace, a durable peace in the end, let's not forget that Russia is working with North Korea and China and Iran. And that in the end, there is an audience of one watching what comes out of this. And that is the first Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping. And he will assess, when there is a deal on Ukraine, who comes out on top: is it the West, or is it Russia? And if it is Russia, he would get his thoughts going about his territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific. And we know he has them. Take Taiwan, etc. So there are big risks involved, and that's why we have to bring Ukraine to a peace which is lasting, and that Putin will never try this again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary General, thank you for your time.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge did not have the authority to order the Trump administration to broker the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported\u00a0from the U.S. to a notorious El Salvador prison, government attorneys argued Saturday as they urged an appeals court to suspend the ruling.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis on Friday ordered the administration to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Kilmar Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. by late Monday night. Justice Department lawyers asked the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to immediately pause the judge's order.",
      "\"A judicial order that forces the Executive to engage with a foreign power in a certain way, let alone compel a certain action by a foreign sovereign, is constitutionally intolerable,\" they wrote.",
      "The appeals court asked Abrego Garcia's lawyers to respond to the government's filing by Sunday afternoon.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran national, was arrested in Maryland and deported last month despite an immigration judge's 2019 ruling that shielded him from deportation to El Salvador, where he faced likely persecution by local gangs.",
      "His mistaken deportation, described by the White House as an \"administrative error,\" has outraged many and raised concerns about expelling noncitizens who were granted permission to be in the U.S.",
      "Dozens of supporters gathered at the Greenbelt, Maryland, federal courthouse for Friday's hearing. A cheer erupted in the courtroom when Xinis ruled in favor of Abrego Garcia, whose wife, a U.S. citizen, was in attendance.",
      "Xinis, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said there was no legal basis for Abrego Garcia's detention and no legal justification for his removal to El Salvador, where he has been held in a prison that observers say is rife with human rights abuses.",
      "In her full opinion released early Sunday, Xinis wrote of her decision to order Abrego Garcia returned that having \"confessed grievous error, the Defendants now argue that this Court lacks the power to hear this case, and they lack the power to order Abrego Garcia's return.\" She added that the government's arguments \"fail as a matter of law.\"",
      "\"Further, to avoid clear irreparable harm, and because equity and justice compels it, the Court grants the narrowest, daresay only, relief warranted: to order that Defendants return Abrego Garcia to the United States,\" Xinis continued.",
      "During Friday's hearing, Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni conceded to Xinis that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed from the U.S. or sent to El Salvador. Reuveni could not tell the judge upon what authority he was arrested in Maryland.",
      "\"I'm also frustrated that I have no answers for you for a lot of these questions,\" he said.",
      "Reuveni's name was not on Saturday's court filing. A department spokesperson confirmed that he was placed on leave.",
      "\"At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said the government has done nothing to get his client back, even after admitting its errors.",
      "\"Plenty of tweets. Plenty of White House press conferences. But no actual steps taken with the government of El Salvador to make it right,\" he told the judge on Friday.",
      "The White House has cast Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 gang member and doubled down on that claim after Friday's hearing. Abrego Garcia's attorneys have countered that there is no evidence he was in MS-13.",
      "Abrego Garcia had a permit from DHS to legally work in the U.S., his attorney said. He served as a sheet metal apprentice and was pursuing his journeyman license.",
      "Abreho Garcia fled El Salvador around 2011 because he and his family were facing threats by local gangs. In 2019, a U.S. immigration judge granted him protection from deportation to El Salvador.",
      "Government lawyers say they have no control over Abrego Garcia and no authority to arrange for his return - \"any more than they would have the power to follow a court order commanding them to 'effectuate' the end of the war in Ukraine, or a return of the hostages from Gaza.\"",
      "\"It is an injunction to force a foreign sovereign to send back a foreign terrorist within three days' time. That is no way to run a government. And it has no basis in American law,\" they wrote.",

      "\"The Prime Minister appreciates the personal and warm relationship with President Trump, and thanks him for inviting him to be the first leader to meet with him after the imposition of global tariffs, just as he was the first leader to meet with him after entering the White House,\" the statement read.",

      "A military statement Saturday said troops with the 36th Division had been deployed in the corridor. It was not immediately clear how many had deployed or where exactly the corridor was located. Morag is the name of a Jewish settlement that once stood between Rafah and Khan Younis, and Netanyahu suggested it would run between the cities.",
      "Maps published by Israeli media showed the new corridor running the width of the narrow coastal strip from east to west.",
      "Netanyahu said it would be \"a second Philadelphi corridor,\" referring to the Gaza side of the border with Egypt further south, which has been under Israeli control since last May.",
      "Israel has also reasserted control over the Netzarim corridor that cuts off the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, from the rest of the strip. The Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors run from the Israeli border to the Mediterranean Sea.",

It warned that half of the living captives were in areas where the Israeli army had ordered evacuations.",
      "\"Half of the living Israeli (hostages) are located in areas that the Israeli occupation army has requested to be evacuated in recent days,\" Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, said in a statement, AFP reported. \"We have decided not to transfer these (hostages)... but (this situation) is highly dangerous to their lives.\"",
      "Hamas says it will only release the remaining 59 hostages \u2014 24 of whom are believed to be alive \u2014 in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli pullout from Gaza. The group has rejected demands that it lay down its arms or leave the territory.",
      "Israel has issued sweeping evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza ahead of expected expansions in its ground operations. The U.N. humanitarian office said around 280,000 Palestinians have been displaced since Israel abruptly ended a ceasefire with Hamas last month that had been brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.",
      "To pressure Hamas, Israel has imposed\u00a0a monthlong blockade\u00a0on food, fuel and humanitarian aid that has left civilians facing acute shortages as supplies dwindle \u2014 a tactic that rights groups say is a war crime. Israel said earlier this week that enough food had entered Gaza during a six-week truce to sustain the territory's roughly 2 million Palestinians for a long time.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages, most of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals. Israel rescued eight living hostages and has recovered dozens of bodies.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Republicans adopted a budget resolution on Saturday after an all-night voting marathon, putting Congress one step closer to enacting President Trump's agenda.",
      "Senate Republicans unveiled a new 70-page budget blueprint Wednesday that lays out a path toward implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities. The resolution aims to make tax cuts that were enacted during Mr. Trump's first term permanent while also authorizing $1.5 trillion in additional tax cuts and raising the debt ceiling by as much as $5 trillion.",
      "The Senate cleared a procedural hurdle Thursday with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky as the only Republican defection, setting it up for final approval this weekend after senators exhausted all amendment votes during what's known as a \"vote-a-rama.\"",
      "During the vote-a-rama, Democrats offered amendments that forced the majority party to cast vote after vote through the night on highly charged political issues, including Medicaid, Social Security and tariffs. The Senate adopted the resolution in a 51-48 vote, teeing it up for a vote in the House as soon as next week. Paul and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine were the only two Republicans who voted against it.",
      "The Republican blueprint is just the first step in the complicated reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance legislation in the Senate. Taking this route allows Republicans to pass the bill without help from Democrats. Both chambers must adopt identical budget resolutions that direct committees to submit their proposed spending plans before passing a bill meeting Mr. Trump's priorities. The entire process is expected to take months.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 ranking GOP senator, said voters gave Republicans a mission in November, and the Senate budget plan delivers.",
      "\"It fulfills our promises to secure the border, to rebuild our economy and to restore peace through strength,\" Barrasso said, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement Saturday that Congress was taking \"smart action to strengthen America's economy and repeal wasteful government spending.\"",
      "\"By advancing this budget resolution, the Senate sends a strong signal to every small business and every working family: President Trump's economic agenda will provide long-term tax certainty,\" he said. \"I look forward to working with House leadership to finish this crucial first step and unlock legislation that strengthens our economic and fiscal foundations.\"",
      "The compromise resolution comes after Republicans in the House and Senate forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year, before coming together on the path forward. Still, differences exist over where and how to make spending cuts, as leaders have opted to push some of the lingering disagreements down the line.",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just a few billion dollars, while it calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years in the House. The Senate is expected to find far more than the floor outlined in the resolution, but the figures are aimed at giving them flexibility moving forward.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune defended the resolution on Thursday as laying the groundwork for \"transformational investment\" in border security, national defense and the energy sector.",
      "The South Dakota Republican criticized Democrats, whom he said are \"losing their minds\" over the measure, for claiming the tax relief is \"about handouts to billionaires.\" He said Democrats' \"latest hysteria\" centers on an accounting tactic known as a \"current policy baseline,\" which makes it appear as if making the tax cuts permanent costs nothing.",
      "\"Using the current policy baseline is not some bizarre new gimmick,\" Thune said, adding that \"Democrats' sudden concern for saving money and protecting the character of the Senate is touching.\"",
      "But Congress usually uses a \"current law baseline\" for budget measures, as required under the 1974 Budget Control Act. This takes into account the expiration of spending provisions. So, the current policy would treat the extension of the Trump tax cuts, which are expiring this year, as a policy that will continue indefinitely and won't cost any new taxpayer dollars. However, the tax cuts were passed in accordance with a current law baseline, which set an expiration date. So extending the cuts would mean incurring new costs, in this case, about $4.5 trillion over the next decade.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Thursday that \"Republicans, in essence, want to pretend like their trillion dollar tax cuts are free \u2014 like magic.\"",
      "\"Middle school math students would tell you this is ridiculous,\" Schumer said.",

      "Thursday's lawsuit is the fourth against the executive order issued just a week ago. It seeks to block key aspects of it, including new requirements that people provide documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and a demand that all mail ballots be received by Election Day.",
      "\"The President has no power to do any of this,\" the state attorneys general wrote in court documents. \"The Elections EO is unconstitutional, antidemocratic, and un-American.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields responded to the lawsuit Friday, calling the proof-of-citizenship requirements \"common sense\" and objections from Democrats \"insane.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration is standing up for free, fair, and honest elections and asking this basic question is essential to our Constitutional Republic,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Trump's order said the U.S. has failed \"to enforce basic and necessary election protection.\" Election officials have said recent elections have been among the most secure in U.S. history. There has been no indication of any widespread fraud, including when Trump, a Republican, lost to Joe Biden, a Democrat, in 2020.",
      "The order is the culmination of Trump's longstanding complaints about how U.S. elections are run. After his first win in 2016, Trump falsely claimed his popular vote total would have been much higher if not for \"millions of people who voted illegally.\" In 2020, Trump blamed a \"rigged\" election for his loss and falsely claimed widespread voter fraud and manipulation of voting machines.",
      "Trump has argued his order secures the vote against illegal voting by noncitizens, though multiple studies and investigations in the states have shown that it's rare.",
      "The order has received praise from the top election officials in some Republican states who say it could inhibit instances of voter fraud and will give them access to federal data to better maintain their voter rolls.",
      "The order also requires states to exclude any mail-in or absentee ballots received after Election Day, and it puts states' federal funding at risk if election officials don't comply. Some states count ballots as long as they are postmarked by Election Day or allow voters to correct minor errors on their ballots.",
      "Forcing states to change, the suit says, would violate the broad authority the Constitution gives states to set their own election rules. It says they decide the \"times, places and manner\" of how elections are run.",
      "Congress has the power to \"make or alter\" election regulations, at least for federal office, but the Constitution doesn't mention any presidential authority over election administration.",
      "Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel says the order is unconstitutional and disrupts elections.",
      "\"The President has no authority to direct or control our state voting laws, many of which are enshrined in our state Constitution,\" she said. \"The White House cannot be permitted to undermine the will and the rights of Michiganders, or keep us from legally casting our ballots under state election laws.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James echoed Nessel's views.",
      "\"We are a democracy \u2014 not a monarchy \u2014 and this executive order is an authoritarian power grab,\" said New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Trump's executive order was an attempt to impose \"sweeping voting restrictions\" across the country and disenfranchise voters.",
      "The attorney general and secretary of state in Nevada, a presidential battleground, defended their state's elections as fair, secure and transparent, and they objected to the president's attempt to interfere in how they are run. Attorney General Aaron Ford praised Nevada's automatic systems for registering voters and distributing mail ballots.",
      "\"While this order is on its face unconstitutional and illegal, it is also unnecessary,\" he said.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts by the Democratic attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.",
      "Other lawsuits filed over the order argue it could disenfranchise voters because millions of eligible voting-age Americans do not have the proper documents readily available. People are already required to attest to being citizens, under penalty of perjury, in order to vote.",

      "The Trump administration on Friday said it accidentally told some Ukrainians refugees they needed to leave the U.S. immediately because their legal status was being revoked, telling CBS News the message was sent by mistake.",
      "Some Ukrainians who had entered the U.S. under the Biden administration following Russia's invasion of their homeland received emails this week telling them that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security would be terminating their legal protections, according to advocates and a notice obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"DHS is now exercising its discretion to terminate your parole,\" the April 3 notice said, referring to the temporary legal status that the Biden administration granted to hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians. \"Unless it expires sooner, your parole will terminate 7 days from the date of this notice.\"",
      "The Biden administration welcomed roughly 240,000 Ukrainians under a policy known as Uniting for Ukraine, or U4U, that allowed Americans to sponsor Ukrainians displaced by Russia's invasion. More than 20,000 Ukrainians who flew to Mexico at the start of the war were also allowed into the U.S. under the parole authority, which allows officials to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to migrants on humanitarian grounds.",
      "If recipients failed to leave the U.S., the message read, they would \"be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States,\" unless they have received another immigration status.",
      "The notice also said recipients would lose their work permits once their parole status was revoked, and encouraged them to sign up for self-deportation using a government smartphone app known as CBP Home that the Trump administration recently repurposed.",
      "\"Again, DHS is terminating your parole. Do not attempt to remain in the United States \u2014 the federal government will find you,\" the notice warned. \"Please depart the United States immediately.\"",
      "But when CBS News asked representatives for DHS about the notice, they said it had been sent by accident.",
      "\"A message was sent in error to some Ukrainians under the U4U program,\" DHS said in a statement to CBS News Friday. \"The U4U parole program has not been terminated.\"",
      "The agency also took the step of retracting the email\u00a0Friday, writing to recipients in a second email: \"(Y)ou may have received an email notification titled 'Notice of Termination of Parole.'

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's sweeping cuts to the federal bureaucracy have included slashing a little-known government agency that channels grant money to America's libraries \u2014 a potentially crippling interruption to a funding lifeline for libraries around the country.",
      "One staff member at the Institute of Museum and Library Services sent grant coordinators a chilling email, obtained by CBS News, warning the agency would \"not be able to work or respond to your emails\" and that there was no \"information about future timelines related to this action.\"",
      "\"You call and the phone just keeps ringing, you know, there's nobody home,\" Mandy Knapp, the Ohio state librarian and executive director, said in an interview with CBS News.",
      "On March 20, teams from DOGE \u2014 the budget-cutting army led by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 descended on the Institute, a tiny federal department that was created by Congress in 1996 to oversee grants for museums and libraries around the nation. Late Wednesday night, organizations that receive Institute funding \"began receiving notification that their grants were being terminated, effective immediately,\" according to a local branch of the American Federation of Government Employees union.",
      "Wednesday night, word came that more than a dozen Institute grants were terminated \u2014 \"seemingly at random,\" the union said. Three states, California, Connecticut and Washington, received the first termination notices for their state library grants, according to a statement from the union.",
      "The notification could not have come at a worse time, library officials told CBS News. Washington's Deputy Secretary of State Randy Bolerjack says that the funding they received through the program helped support 32 positions at the Washington State Library, which have statewide impact and benefit public, tribal, K-12, and community college libraries.",
      "The Institute has previously cited its \"Grants to States\" program as the largest source of federal funding support for library services in the U.S. With over $160 million allocated to the program annually. The grants are formulated based on population and give state libraries complete oversight as to how funding is allocated to their local branches. In states like Ohio and South Carolina, officials told CBS News that this funding has been critical to keeping libraries in rural areas on par with those in larger cities.",
      "Breanne Smith, associate deputy director at South Carolina's state library, told us that public libraries in the state saw over 10 million visits last year alone. She says in rural communities especially, libraries are more than just a place to check out books.",
      "\"People go to their library for not even just the library services, they just go there for wifi, to use a computer. Libraries are really a community anchor,\" Smith said.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS, notice of the cuts to Washington's state library came from the Institute's acting director, Keith Sonderling, who is a deputy director at the Labor Department. Union officials said they were told that the Trump administration cuts were made because they were not aligned with the Institute's priorities. The deputy director at the South Carolina state library, Chris Yates, says he finds their rationale \"puzzling.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Labor Department for comment, but has not received a reply.",
      "Yates also expressed that the sporadic cuts have left state library staff in a state of uncertainty. The funds South Carolina receives support public libraries in all 43 counties, which serve over 5.4 million residents.",
      "\"Everyone, I think, is just in a holding pattern to see if they're gonna receive a letter or not.\", Yates told CBS News.",
      "Knapp says their funding does more than support libraries \u2014 it also funds summer reading programs, special access to materials for those with visual impairments, and offers access to state-of-the-art technology and the internet in rural communities. Their \"vital\" summer reading program has already been put on pause, Knapp said.",
      "In a letter sent to the White House yesterday, 127 Democratic members of Congress urged the administration to reconsider its decision to shutter the agency. \"Eliminating the [the Institute] would not only jeopardize these essential services but also dismiss the everyday needs of millions of Americans who rely on libraries and museums for learning, job opportunities, and community engagement,\" the letter says.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, told CBS News that the cuts will only undermine Americans' access to library resources, which he considers vital to bringing communities together.",
      "\"Trump's plan to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services would barely make a dent in the federal budget, but it would be devastating for communities across the country,\" Murphy said.",
      "In addition to congressional support, four major publishing houses have also sent a letter to Congress outlining concerns, saying, \"libraries are essential community hubs that provide free access to these valuable tools and resources. Defunding libraries would result in mass closures and the destruction of a system that today benefits millions of Americans.\"",

He was first nominated to the post by former President Joe Biden in May 2023, but his Senate confirmation was delayed until December 2023 because of Republican Sen.

      "Bondi said the ruling \"vindicates what the Department of Justice has been arguing for months: local district judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of taxpayer dollars, force the government to pay out billions, or unilaterally halt President Trump's policy agenda.\"",
      "The legal battle over the administration's decision to cut off the grants is the latest challenging President Trump's second-term policies to reach the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority. The Trump administration has sought to cut off federal assistance funding and foreign aid, but has so far been rebuffed by the courts.",
      "There are three other requests for relief from the Justice Department that are still awaiting action from the Supreme Court, though more emergency appeals are expected to reach the justices as the president faces a slew of lawsuits targeting his second-term agenda.",
      "At issue in this dispute over Education Department funds is up to $65 million in grants awarded through the Teacher Quality Partnership program and the Supporting Effective Educator Development program, which support teacher recruitment and training.",
      "In early February, the acting secretary of education directed an internal review of the department's grant awards to ensure they did not fund programs with DEI practices, which the Trump administration has claimed are discriminatory.",
      "The Education Department ultimately decided 104 grants should be terminated because they did not align with its policy objectives, according to the Justice Department. Five grants were left in place, the department said.",
      "Following the grant cancellations, a group of eight states sued the Trump administration and asked a federal district court to issue temporary relief while the case moved forward. The states \u2014 California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin \u2014 said organizations within their states received the grants and argued the terminations violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "U.S. District Judge Myong Joun agreed to grant a temporary restraining order, in place until April 7, that required the government to reinstate the grants to recipients in the eight states. The court also temporarily blocked the government from reinstating the terminations, or cancelling any other awards for organizations in the states.",
      "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to pause that order while proceedings continue, which it declined to do. The Justice Department then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "In filings with the justices, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the district court's order is one of several that raise the question of whether a district court judge can force the government to pay out millions in taxpayer dollars.",
      "\"Unless and until this court addresses that question, federal district courts will continue exceeding their jurisdiction by ordering the executive branch to restore lawfully terminated grants across the government, keep paying for programs that the executive branch views as inconsistent with the interests of the United States, and send out the door taxpayer money that may never be clawed back,\" she wrote.",
      "Harris urged the Supreme Court to \"put a swift end to federal district courts' unconstitutional reign as self-appointed managers of executive branch funding and grant-disbursement decisions.\"",
      "In a separate case, the high court rejected an earlier bid from the Trump administration to pause an order that required it to pay out an estimated $2 billion in foreign-aid funding to groups that received money from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, lawyers for the states argued that the issue for the Justice Department is with other cases elsewhere, where courts are dealing with a slew of legal disputes arising out of Mr. Trump's executive actions.",
      "\"Those concerns are properly litigated in the context of those other cases,\" the states said in a filing. \"They provide no basis for this court to grant emergency relief here, where the district court appropriately granted a narrow and time-limited restraining order to preserve the status quo while it adjudicates the preliminary-injunction motion that was argued earlier today.\"",
      "Lawyers for the states said that the grant recipients are providing a pipeline of qualified teachers for local schools within their states, and warned that if the awards could be cancelled, programs that they fund will have to be scaled back or shut down entirely.",
      "\"Any harm that defendants might face from the temporary restraining order in the few days remaining before that order expires is far outweighed by the immediate harm the states will suffer if the order were stayed or vacated,\" they said.",

    "summary": "A deal to sell the widely popular platform remains a work in progress.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Friday said he would sign another executive order to delay enforcement of a law that effectively bans TikTok, amid talks about a possible deal to sell the widely popular platform.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0signed an executive order on his first day directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days. The order instructed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against \"any entity for any noncompliance.\" The executive order expires Saturday, April 5.",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday he wouldn't enforce the law for at least another 75 days.",
      "\"My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed,\" the president wrote. \"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark.' We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.\"",
      "A deal had been reached Wednesday between investors, TikTok's Beijing-based parent company ByteDance and the U.S. government that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, according to a source familiar with the plans. The deal allowed ByteDance to keep a minority stake, and Mr. Trump planned to sign an order approving the deal and allowing for a 120-day closing period.",
      "But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House on Thursday that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, ByteDance, originally had until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services.",
      "TikTok\u00a0briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action.",
      "Apple and Google did not\u00a0restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores for nearly a month after Mr. Trump issued the first directive.",
      "Even though Mr. Trump has declined to enforce the ban, the law is still on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. But the law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok in the event of a sale.",
      "When TikTok challenged the law last year, it argued that it never had a choice between divestment or a ban because a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\" The Chinese government previously vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user.",
      "In a statement after Mr. Trump's announcement Friday, a ByteDance spokesperson acknowledged the company has been in discussions with the U.S. government about \"a potential solution.\"",
      "\"An agreement has not been executed. There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested last month he could ease tariffs on the Chinese if they approved the deal.",
      "\"Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,\" the president said on March 27. \"Every point in tariffs is worth more than TikTok.\"",
      "But on Wednesday he announced he would impose a 34% additional tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S.",
      "Lawmakers, however, are likely to be dissatisfied if any deal does not fully sever ties between ByteDance and TikTok.",
      "\"If ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal \u2014 plain and simple,\" Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China Committee, said last month.",
      "He said a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while using ByteDance's algorithm runs afoul of the law because ByteDance would still have access to user data.",
      "\"This setup reeks of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014 in 2023, through the failed Project Texas, ByteDance tried to create the illusion of better data privacy by storing Americans' data on U.S. servers, all while ByteDance kept its grip on the platform. On the surface, shifting data storage to the United States might have seemed like a reasonable fix, but it ignored the real issue: ByteDance's control over TikTok,\" Moolenaar\u00a0wrote in an opinion piece in the National Review last month.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. But the Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Moolenaar and Republican members of the China committee said in a statement Friday that they \"stand firm\" in their position.",
      "\"Any resolution must ensure that U.S. law is followed, and that the Chinese Communist Party does not have access to American user data or the ability to manipulate the content consumed by Americans,\" they said. \"We remain committed to enforcing the framework established by Congress to safeguard the American people.\"",
      "During a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last year, then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who's now secretary of state, explained that U.S. officials viewed TikTok as a national security threat because the algorithm that powers the platform is controlled by a China-based company. The Chinese government, he said, could force TikTok to give it access to the data it collects on tens of millions of Americans or use it to push propaganda to them.",
      "\"TikTok does not work without that algorithm, and that algorithm is controlled by a company that's controlled by the Chinese Communist Party under the law of China,\" Rubio said.",
      "Three Democratic senators\u00a0wrote to Mr. Trump in March asking him to work with Congress to find a long-term solution to TikTok's survival. The senators \u2014 Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Cory Booker of New Jersey \u2014 said they opposed a TikTok ban, but called it \"unacceptable and unworkable\" for the Trump administration \"to continue ignoring the requirements in the law.\"",
      "TikTok challenged the law in court, but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court days before it took effect. The Supreme Court's decision said the divest-or-ban law does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",

      "\"There are 11 factories in the country, most of which export goods to the U.S. and provide employment to 12,000 workers,\" Shelile said. \"Goods currently in production will be affected by these tariffs and will not be exported to the U.S.\"",
      "He said he'd asked factories to continue operating \"while we work on solutions,\" and added that the U.S. action showed his country needed to \"diversify\" its trade relationships, which he said it had already started exploring.",
      "\"We cannot rely solely on the U.S.,\" he said. \"While this transition will take time, the process is already underway.\"",
      "To determine the rates of its new tariffs, the White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers. Economists have questioned the methodology, and many\u00a0foreign governments have complained\u00a0the levies are unfair and misrepresent their trade imbalances with the U.S.",

      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations will face only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries will be charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports will face the baseline rate of 10%, while China will face a 34% tariff.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his\u00a0Wednesday remarks.",
      "Asian nations will face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic. On top of China's 34% reciprocal tariff, imports from that nation will also face previously announced 20% tariffs, bringing that nation's total rate to more than 60%, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",

      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries likely to retaliate against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",

      "Judge Dale Ho on Wednesday agreed to the\u00a0U.S. Department of Justice's request to drop charges\u00a0against Adams. The judge dismissed the case with prejudice, which means the charges cannot be brought again at a later time.",

A\u00a057-page indictment\u00a0accused him of receiving undisclosed gifts -- including luxury travel -- worth more than $100,000 in return for political favors. He allegedly solicited illegal campaign donations from wealthy foreigners and corporations, including a Turkish government official.",
      "In arguing for the case to be dismissed, DOJ prosecutors said it would have interfered with Adams' 2025 mayoral campaign and hinder his ability to cooperate with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

      "Amazon has told the White House it is interested in buying TikTok ahead of a key deadline by which its parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell the popular social media app or face a ban in the U.S., CBS News has learned, according to two people familiar with discussions.",
      "Amazon has submitted a bid for the app, the\u00a0New York Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter. Another plan under consideration is for a new entity backed by U.S. companies like BlackRock and Oracle to lease TikTok's algorithm from ByteDance, according to a source familiar with the situation.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the New York Times reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",
      "The U.S. government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because its vast trove of customer data, including browsing patterns, locations and biometric information, could end up in the hands of the Chinese authorities.",
      "Ahead of the initial divestiture deadline, ByteDance earlier this year briefly shut down TikTok in the U.S. Mr. Trump quickly paused the ban and the service was restored.",
      "The ban does not target TikTok's U.S. users. But the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed into law in 2024 under former President Biden, would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores and web-hosting services to distribute or service TikTok.",

      "A federal judge in Boston considered Thursday a case involving a Tufts University Ph.D. student taken into custody in Massachusetts and moved by Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities to Louisiana last week.",
      "The government claimed in a filing Tuesday that Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student and Fulbright Scholar, had already been removed from Massachusetts before a judge issued an order for her to stay in the state, which prosecutors said strips the district court in Massachusetts of jurisdiction to hear the case.",
      "The Justice Department said in its filing that Ozturk had already been transferred to an ICE detention center in Basile, Louisiana.",
      "Attorneys for Ozturk had filed a habeas petition to block her removal from Massachusetts, as well as from the United States, and U.S. District Judge Denise Casper issued a new order several days after Ozturk was detained barring her removal from the U.S. to allow her to resolve the jurisdictional questions.",
      "Casper probed Ozturk's lawyers and the Justice Department about whether the habeas petition was filed in the appropriate venue, the court in Massachusetts, or whether the case should be transferred to Louisiana, where Ozturk is now being held. The student's lawyers are seeking an order that requires immigration officials to return Ozturk to Massachusetts and immediately release her while proceedings continue.",
      "She did not issue a decision on whether Ozturk's case should be moved, instead saying she was \"inclined to wrestle\" with the question.",
      "An attorney for the student argued that her whereabouts remained unknown to her lawyers in the hours after her arrest, and said not even the government's lawyers knew where she was, a situation Ozturk's attorney said it \"quite unusual.\"",
      "She accused immigration officials of ignoring the initial order preventing Ozturk's immediate removal out of Massachusetts and for failing to disclose her location to her lawyers.",
      "\"Here, we have a situation where it's the government that is forum shopping, that is whisking away a petitioner to its forum of choice and doing everything in its power to ensure that a habeas petition cannot be filed,\" the lawyer said.",
      "An acting Homeland Security Department official filed a sworn statement saying Ozturk was arrested on March 25 in Somerville, Massachusetts, where Tufts is located, and then moved to Lebanon, New Hampshire, then to St. Albans, Vermont, overnight. She was again moved at 4 a.m. on March 26 to Burlington, Vermont, before she was finally transferred to the ICE detention center in Basile. The court's order blocking her removal from Massachusetts was issued while Ozturk was in Vermont, and Ozturk's lawyers said her case could also be transferred there.",
      "A Justice Department lawyer sought to draw a distinction between Ozturk's lawyers not knowing where their client was, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement not being forthcoming about her location. He asked the court to dismiss Ozturk's petition outright or remove the case to Louisiana.",
      "\"ICE was still in the process of transferring her through Vermont at the time that the petition was filed,\" he said.",
      "The Justice Department said the decision to move Ozturk to Louisiana was made before she was taken into custody because there is no detention center in Massachusetts for a female detainee.",
      "Ozturk, who's in the U.S. on a student visa, was detained on her way to a Ramadan Iftar dinner on March 25. Surveillance footage showed six plainclothes ICE agents who appeared to be wearing masks stopping Ozturk on the street and taking her into custody.",
      "She's one of several students at American universities whose visas were revoked after they expressed support for Palestinians during the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Ozturk's attorneys argue her detention violates her constitutional rights to free speech and due process, and have asked for her immediate return to Massachusetts and for her to be freed from government custody.",
      "On Wednesday, Tufts president Sunil Kumar submitted a declaration defending Ozturk and supporting her motion regarding her release and return to Massachusetts. Kumar said the university \"has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention.\"",
      "He said that on March 26, the university received a notice stating that Ozturk was a \"'non-immigrant status violator'\" and citing the Immigration and Naturalization Act, it said \"the United States believed that her presence in the country would result in 'potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.'\"",
      "Ozturk was one of four students at Tufts University who co-authored an op-ed in the Tufts Daily college paper in March 2024 urging the university to \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\" and \"divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.\" There is no mention of Hamas in the article. Kumar said the op-ed was consistent with the university's free speech policies and there were \"opinions that were shared just as strongly\" on other sides of the issue.",
      "\"The University has no further information suggesting that she has acted in a manner that would constitute a violation of the University's understanding of the Immigration and Naturalization Act,\" Kumar wrote. He asked that Ozturk \"receive the due process rights to which she is entitled,\" so she can return to Tufts to finish her studies and her degree.",
      "At the time of Ozturk's detention, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Ozturk \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas,\" but did not provide details about her alleged activities. The government's filing Tuesday also contained no details about alleged ties to Hamas.",
      "The Justice Department's argument regarding jurisdiction \u2014 that the habeas petition arguments should be held where the person is being detained \u2014 has been used by the government in other court cases involving the Trump administration's deportation efforts, including in the case of former Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil and in the cases of five Venezuelan men who sued to block their deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.",

Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat who serves as the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Wednesday in response to the new tariffs that he plans to introduce a resolution to force a vote on \"ending the made up national emergency Trump is using to justify these taxes,\" effectively blocking them.",
      "\"Republicans can't keep ducking this \u2014 it's time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,\" Meeks said in a post on X.",
      "The move would force a vote on the House floor within 15 days. And as the GOP wrestles with how to respond to the tariffs, a Democratic committee aide told CBS News they're looking to make the effort to pass Meeks' resolution a bipartisan one. But the resolution would ultimately require the president's signature or a veto-proof majority, making it a gambit unlikely to succeed.",
      "The efforts come after the Senate approved a resolution Wednesday aimed at blocking the president's Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked their party leader to support the measure. The bill would have to be approved by the House, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged Speaker Mike Johnson to call the House back into session to take up the measure on Thursday, saying, \"Donald Trump is using tariffs in the dumbest way imaginable.\"",
      "But after House Republicans last month included in a\u00a0bill to keep the government funded\u00a0a provision that widely blocks members from forcing a vote on the Canada and Mexico tariffs amid a similar push by Meeks, it appears unlikely that the resolution would receive a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "Whether any of the moves can make it through both chambers and have an impact on the tariffs or trade situation more broadly remains to be seen. The legislative efforts to counter the tariffs come as congressional Republicans have appeared to struggle with how to respond, though few have appeared willing to strongly rebuke the move so far.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Thursday that he's concerned about the markets following the tariffs announcement. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who was among the four Republicans who voted with Democrats to block the tariffs on Wednesday, told reporters, \"There is more pro-trade sentiment in the Republican caucus than was evidenced by the vote yesterday,\" adding that he expects after the market response Thursday, \"A lot of people are going to be reconsidering the wisdom of this.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Thursday morning that he was waiting to see how things shake out, noting that the market response was \"not unexpected.\"",
      "\"It's a big policy change, bold policy change, and I think it's going to take some time to determine what the ultimate impacts are going to be,\" Thune said. \"Right now, we're all kind of waiting and seeing and seeing how the administration reacts and what the ultimate permanent policy might look like.\"",

      "Three-and-a-half days after launch Monday from the Kennedy Space Center \u2014 and after 55 passes above the North and South Poles \u2014 the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" fired its braking rockets at 11:26 a.m. EDT and slammed back into the discernible atmosphere about 25 minutes later.",
      "Enduring heat shield temperatures up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, the spacecraft rapidly slowed down, deployed four big red-and-white parachutes and settled to an on-target 16-mph splashdown at 12:19 p.m.",
      "SpaceX crews deployed nearby rushed to the gently bobbing capsule and rigged it for a lift onto the company's recovery ship Shannon.",
      "In the first test of its kind, the crew exited the craft on their own, demonstrating the ability to get out of a Crew Dragon without help from recovery crews.",
      "Unlike crews returning from long-duration flights to the International Space Station who are carried out of their capsules, mission commander Chun Wang and his three companions were able to lift emergency gear up and out of the hatch before climbing out themselves.",
      "While they moved a bit gingerly after three-and-a-half days in weightlessness, Chun, Norwegian cinematographer Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, a German robotics specialist, and Australian polar guide Eric Philips were all smiles as they greeted support personnel and were escorted into the recovery ship for initial medical checks.",
      "Chun is a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, most recently in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean where he first met his crewmates, all veterans of polar expeditions.",
      "\"We ... all met on Svalbard, and we love the ice,\" Chun posted on X during the flight. \"The mission was planned when I lived there, and we fly polar because, in an ISS-like orbit, we are unable to see where we live. From this perspective, the mission has perfectly achieved its goal.\"",
      "Chun said before launch he planned to be on the lookout for Antarctic research stations, but Mikkelsen said during the flight that \"unlike previously anticipated, from 460 km above, it is only pure white, no human activity is visible.\"",
      "Neither Chun nor his crewmates are licensed pilots. While Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "But the Crew Dragon is highly automated and can be controlled from the ground when necessary. SpaceX viewed the Fram2 flight as a stepping stone toward opening the door for more non-professionals to fly to orbit.",
      "Chun, an avid world traveler and polar visitor, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter Resilience for the trip to polar orbit, SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "The mission was named Fram2 in honor of a 19th century sailing ship \u2014 Fram, or \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic explorers to the poles. A small piece of the original ship's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun said before launch. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023. ... Fram2 isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "The crew planned to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew was equipped  with multiple laptops and tablets, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray  generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the  human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration  missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Throughout the flight, the crew posted spectacular videos, including a timelapse view of Earth below as the Crew Dragon sailed over Antarctica all the way to the North Pole, making the trip from one pole to the other every 46 minutes.",
      "\"Proud to be able to bring to space some incredible cameras and lenses capturing the first images of the Arctic and Antarctic shot by humans from space,\" Mikkelsen posted on X. \"These videos are BIG in file size and we look forwards to sharing them with you post-mission splashdown.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 12:46:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

      "Lighting up the night sky, the Falcon 9 initially climbed straight up and then arced over onto a due south trajectory along Florida's east coast before soaring out over the Gulf on a course carrying it above Cuba and Panama toward a polar orbit.",
      "After dropping off the first stage for a successful droneship landing, the rocket's upper stage shut down 10 minutes after liftoff and the Crew Dragon was released to fly on its own. It is expected to fly over the North and South Poles 55 times between Monday night and splashdown Friday in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "\"On behalf of the SpaceX team, we're honored to deliver you safely to your polar orbit,\" radioed Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's former director of space operations and now a senior manager at SpaceX. \"Enjoy the views of the poles, send us some pictures.

      "Chun named the mission after the 19th century sailing ship Fram \u2014 \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic pioneers to the polar regions in the 1800s. A small piece of Fram's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"Pretty wild to see the Fram adventurers sailing to the poles once again, over 130 years from (the original ship's) christening,\" SpaceX's launch director radioed the crew. \"This time, though, with Starlink. Cheers.\"",
      "A veteran world traveler, Chun offered the Crew Dragon's three other seats to a trio of explorers he met during a recent polar trip. Jannicke Mikkelsen, a Norwegian cinematographer, is the designated vehicle commander, joined by German roboticist Rabea Rogge as the mission pilot.",
      "The fourth member of the crew is Australian Eric Philips, a professional polar tour guide, adventurer and veteran of some 30 trips to the North and South poles. He is serving as the crew's medical officer.",
      "Some might view the crew as seasoned adventurers and now, space tourists. In an interview with CBS News, Mikkelsen made it clear the crew is well qualified, but she said \"space tourists\" doesn't reflect the extensive training required by SpaceX.",
      "\"I wish it was tourism,\" she said. \"But our education has lasted well over a year, so I have never studied so hard for a three-and-a-half-day expedition in my life.\"",
      "History of private space flights",
      "Chun said he was inspired to book the mission by the example set by entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, the billionaire who chartered SpaceX's first two fully commercial missions, and fellow billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, who flew to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "\"I owe my inspiration to Jared,\" Chun posted on X. \"If it weren't for @yousuckMZ and @rookisaacman taking the first step, I would have never had the courage to book an entire spaceship and bring along three people I had only met once before. I also copied many good practices from his previous missions \u2014 hope he doesn't mind.\"",
      "Isaacman, who owns and flies a Russian fighter jet, is the Trump administration's nominee to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "Unlike Isaacman, no one on the Fram2 mission is a licensed pilot. While Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one crew member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "SpaceX says Fram2 will help refine training procedures aimed at opening up spaceflight to more and more non-professionals.",
      "\"As a roboticist, I'm so hyped about Dragon being an autonomous vehicle which really, I think, shows you how much times are changing in the space sector,\" Rogge said. \"We are really at a crucial point in time where the spacecraft does so many of the tasks itself.",
      "\"I think that really spearheads the accessibility to space, right? Because the dream is (to) have many people in space if we want to live and work there as a civilization.\"",
      "She added, \"right now I think the stereotype of an astronaut is that, you know, super, super, super human, medically perfect. But we should really flip this question and be like, OK, how do we design living and working in space for everyone?\"",
      "Plans for orbiting around the poles",
      "The crew plans to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew is equipped with four iPad Minis, two iPhone Pro Max cellphones, three laptop computers, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Also on board: a Starlink laser terminal mounted in the Crew Dragon's lower trunk section that will give the crew, in theory, data relay speeds of up to 100 gigabytes per second or better.",
      "To reach the planned orbit around the poles, one tilted 90 degrees to Earth's equator, the flight plan called for the Falcon 9 to follow a due-south trajectory carrying the crew above southern Florida, Cuba and Panama on the way to space. The 273-mile-high orbit will allow 55 passes above the poles between launch and splashdown.",
      "Jon Edwards, a SpaceX vice president who oversee Falcon 9 flight operations, said the Crew Dragon's flight software was modified to ensure the vehicle passes safely over populated areas, guiding the rocket as needed to keep the capsule or other components well away from any populated areas in an emergency.",
      "\"We're going to fly out of 39A in Florida and go pretty much straight south,\" Edwards said. \"In fact, the flight path is going to go over Florida. If you were in Miami and you looked straight up, you know, at the right time. would see the rocket and the crew flying right overhead.",
      "\"What we call the instantaneous impact points, which is where, if we cut power, it would land, that will stay offshore, so it's totally safe to do this. But it will be flying over Florida and over Cuba and Panama and just to the west of Peru and Ecuador.\"",
      "NASA and the U.S. Space Force routinely launch military satellites and science probes into polar orbits from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, where rockets can fly due south over the Pacific Ocean without passing over populated areas.",
      "But the maximum inclination for orbital payloads launched from the East Coast has traditionally been limited to avoid flying over areas where debris from a catastrophic failure might fall. In recent years, SpaceX has launched satellites into polar or near-polar orbits from Cape Canaveral, but no piloted flights.",
      "While NASA and the Air Force once planned to launch space shuttles into polar orbit from Vandenberg, the military space program changed priorities in the wake of the 1986 Challenge disaster and those plans were shelved six months before the initial flight.",
      "The polar orbit will provide spectacular views for the Fram2 crew that Mikkelsen plans to document, from the ice caps to shimmering auroras. The public is invited to share the experience, photographing auroras at the same time Fram2 is capturing the view from space.",
      "\"We have reached out to 2.2 million auroral citizen scientists,\" she said. \"And anyone can join, where you go outside if there is aurora where you live and you note where you live and you ... take a photo of the aurora at the same time as we and Fram2 fly over.",
      "\"Local observatories are also activating their instruments so that we get this incredible data bank during our mission of the aurora from Earth and from space at the same time so we can understand ... what the phenomena can bring to humankind and specifically to satellite technology.\"",

      "While they moved a bit gingerly after three-and-a-half days in weightlessness, Chun, Norwegian cinematographer Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, a German robotics specialist, and Australian polar guide Eric Philips were all smiles as they greeted support personnel and were escorted into the recovery ship for initial medical checks.",
      "Chun is a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, most recently in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean where he first met his crewmates, all veterans of polar expeditions.",
      "\"We ... all met on Svalbard, and we love the ice,\" Chun posted on X during the flight. \"The mission was planned when I lived there, and we fly polar because, in an ISS-like orbit, we are unable to see where we live. From this perspective, the mission has perfectly achieved its goal.\"",
      "Chun said before launch he planned to be on the lookout for Antarctic research stations, but Mikkelsen said during the flight that \"unlike previously anticipated, from 460 km above, it is only pure white, no human activity is visible.\"",
      "Neither Chun nor his crewmates are licensed pilots. While Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "But the Crew Dragon is highly automated and can be controlled from the ground when necessary. SpaceX viewed the Fram2 flight as a stepping stone toward opening the door for more non-professionals to fly to orbit.",
      "Chun, an avid world traveler and polar visitor, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter Resilience for the trip to polar orbit, SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "The mission was named Fram2 in honor of a 19th century sailing ship \u2014 Fram, or \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic explorers to the poles. A small piece of the original ship's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun said before launch. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023. ... Fram2 isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "The crew planned to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew was equipped  with multiple laptops and tablets, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray  generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the  human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration  missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Throughout the flight, the crew posted spectacular videos, including a timelapse view of Earth below as the Crew Dragon sailed over Antarctica all the way to the North Pole, making the trip from one pole to the other every 46 minutes.",
      "\"Proud to be able to bring to space some incredible cameras and lenses capturing the first images of the Arctic and Antarctic shot by humans from space,\" Mikkelsen posted on X. \"These videos are BIG in file size and we look forwards to sharing them with you post-mission splashdown.\"",
      "Another video showed the entire state of Florida and the southeastern United States. Zooming in on the Kennedy Space Center, Chun marveled \"there's our launch pad. Oh my God!\"",

      "After dropping off the first stage for a successful droneship landing, the rocket's upper stage shut down 10 minutes after liftoff and the Crew Dragon was released to fly on its own. It is expected to fly over the North and South Poles 55 times between Monday night and splashdown Friday in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "\"On behalf of the SpaceX team, we're honored to deliver you safely to your polar orbit,\" radioed Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's former director of space operations and now a senior manager at SpaceX. \"Enjoy the views of the poles, send us some pictures. Our hearts and our minds will be flying with you ... Have a great flight.\"",
      "Who are the private adventurers on the Fram2 mission?",
      "Chun Wang, a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" for a trip in polar orbit. The deal marks SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",

      "Chun named the mission after the 19th century sailing ship Fram \u2014 \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic pioneers to the polar regions in the 1800s. A small piece of Fram's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"Pretty wild to see the Fram adventurers sailing to the poles once again, over 130 years from (the original ship's) christening,\" SpaceX's launch director radioed the crew. \"This time, though, with Starlink. Cheers.\"",
      "A veteran world traveler, Chun offered the Crew Dragon's three other seats to a trio of explorers he met during a recent polar trip. Jannicke Mikkelsen, a Norwegian cinematographer, is the designated vehicle commander, joined by German roboticist Rabea Rogge as the mission pilot.",
      "The fourth member of the crew is Australian Eric Philips, a professional polar tour guide, adventurer and veteran of some 30 trips to the North and South poles. He is serving as the crew's medical officer.",
      "Some might view the crew as seasoned adventurers and now, space tourists. In an interview with CBS News, Mikkelsen made it clear the crew is well qualified, but she said \"space tourists\" doesn't reflect the extensive training required by SpaceX.",
      "\"I wish it was tourism,\" she said. \"But our education has lasted well over a year, so I have never studied so hard for a three-and-a-half-day expedition in my life.\"",
      "History of private space flights",
      "Chun said he was inspired to book the mission by the example set by entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, the billionaire who chartered SpaceX's first two fully commercial missions, and fellow billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, who flew to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "\"I owe my inspiration to Jared,\" Chun posted on X. \"If it weren't for @yousuckMZ and @rookisaacman taking the first step, I would have never had the courage to book an entire spaceship and bring along three people I had only met once before. I also copied many good practices from his previous missions \u2014 hope he doesn't mind.\"",
      "Isaacman, who owns and flies a Russian fighter jet, is the Trump administration's nominee to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "Unlike Isaacman, no one on the Fram2 mission is a licensed pilot. While Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one crew member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "SpaceX says Fram2 will help refine training procedures aimed at opening up spaceflight to more and more non-professionals.",
      "\"As a roboticist, I'm so hyped about Dragon being an autonomous vehicle which really, I think, shows you how much times are changing in the space sector,\" Rogge said. \"We are really at a crucial point in time where the spacecraft does so many of the tasks itself.",
      "\"I think that really spearheads the accessibility to space, right? Because the dream is (to) have many people in space if we want to live and work there as a civilization.\"",
      "She added, \"right now I think the stereotype of an astronaut is that, you know, super, super, super human, medically perfect. But we should really flip this question and be like, OK, how do we design living and working in space for everyone?\"",
      "Plans for orbiting around the poles",
      "The crew plans to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew is equipped with four iPad Minis, two iPhone Pro Max cellphones, three laptop computers, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Also on board: a Starlink laser terminal mounted in the Crew Dragon's lower trunk section that will give the crew, in theory, data relay speeds of up to 100 gigabytes per second or better.",
      "To reach the planned orbit around the poles, one tilted 90 degrees to Earth's equator, the flight plan called for the Falcon 9 to follow a due-south trajectory carrying the crew above southern Florida, Cuba and Panama on the way to space. The 273-mile-high orbit will allow 55 passes above the poles between launch and splashdown.",
      "Jon Edwards, a SpaceX vice president who oversee Falcon 9 flight operations, said the Crew Dragon's flight software was modified to ensure the vehicle passes safely over populated areas, guiding the rocket as needed to keep the capsule or other components well away from any populated areas in an emergency.",
      "\"We're going to fly out of 39A in Florida and go pretty much straight south,\" Edwards said. \"In fact, the flight path is going to go over Florida. If you were in Miami and you looked straight up, you know, at the right time. would see the rocket and the crew flying right overhead.",
      "\"What we call the instantaneous impact points, which is where, if we cut power, it would land, that will stay offshore, so it's totally safe to do this. But it will be flying over Florida and over Cuba and Panama and just to the west of Peru and Ecuador.\"",
      "NASA and the U.S. Space Force routinely launch military satellites and science probes into polar orbits from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, where rockets can fly due south over the Pacific Ocean without passing over populated areas.",
      "But the maximum inclination for orbital payloads launched from the East Coast has traditionally been limited to avoid flying over areas where debris from a catastrophic failure might fall. In recent years, SpaceX has launched satellites into polar or near-polar orbits from Cape Canaveral, but no piloted flights.",
      "While NASA and the Air Force once planned to launch space shuttles into polar orbit from Vandenberg, the military space program changed priorities in the wake of the 1986 Challenge disaster and those plans were shelved six months before the initial flight.",
      "The polar orbit will provide spectacular views for the Fram2 crew that Mikkelsen plans to document, from the ice caps to shimmering auroras. The public is invited to share the experience, photographing auroras at the same time Fram2 is capturing the view from space.",
      "\"We have reached out to 2.2 million auroral citizen scientists,\" she said. \"And anyone can join, where you go outside if there is aurora where you live and you note where you live and you ... take a photo of the aurora at the same time as we and Fram2 fly over.",
      "\"Local observatories are also activating their instruments so that we get this incredible data bank during our mission of the aurora from Earth and from space at the same time so we can understand ... what the phenomena can bring to humankind and specifically to satellite technology.\"",

    "summary": "NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who were stuck in space for more than nine months, took questions after returning to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, speaking out at a news conference for the first time since returning to Earth after an extended 286-day stay in space, said Monday they did not blame Boeing for the spacecraft problems that effectively stranded them aboard the International Space Station.",
      "In fact, asked if he would fly again aboard the Starliner, Wilmore said, \"Yes, because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work. Boeing is completely committed. NASA is completely committed, and with that, I'd get on in a heartbeat.\"",
      "Added Williams: \"I would agree. The spacecraft is really capable. There were a couple things that need to be fixed ... and folks are actively working on that, but it is a great spacecraft, and it has a lot of capability that other spacecraft don't have. To see that thing successful and to be part of that program is an honor.\"",
      "Asked if he blamed Boeing for the propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems that ultimately led NASA to bring the Starliner down without its crew, extending their stay aboard the space station from eight days to more than nine-and-a-half months, Wilmore said, \"That is a question that I cannot answer in a couple of comments. But I'll start with me.\"",
      "\"There were questions that I, as the commander of the spacecraft, that I should have asked, and I did not. At the time, I didn't know I needed to. And maybe you could call that hindsight, but I'll start and point the finger and I'll blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide.",
      "\"So blame, I don't like that term, but certainly there's responsibility throughout all the programs and certainly you can start with me. Responsibility with Boeing? Yes. Responsibility with NASA? Yes. All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.\"",
      "Their repeatedly extended mission generated enormous attention in the wake of problems with Starliner, NASA's decision three months after launch to keep them in orbit until this year, and comments from President Trump claiming the astronauts had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "Williams denied feeling \"abandoned\" or \"stuck\" during an interview with CBS News in February, saying she was \"honored ... to be here and a part of the team\" doing \"world-class science.\" They said much of the same Monday. But they avoided answering questions about the political aspects of the mission.",
      "Wilmore and Williams returned to Earth on March 18, accompanied by two outgoing station fliers who were wrapping up their own six-month stay aboard the lab. The Starliner astronauts, like all returning station fliers, began physical therapy back at the Johnson Space Center to help them readjust to gravity.",
      "They both looked fit and were in obviously good spirits talking with reporters Monday. In fact, Williams said she went for a 3-mile run on Sunday.",
      "How long were the astronauts stuck in space?",
      "By the time they splashed down off Florida's Gulf Coast, Wilmore and Williams had spent 286 days in space.",
      "While the extended mission was much longer than originally planned, it ranks sixth on the list of longest flights by U.S. astronauts.",
      "The record is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, whose planned six-month stay aboard the space station was extended to just over a full year \u2014 371 days \u2014 because of coolant leaks in the Russian Soyuz that carried him to orbit. He came back to Earth aboard a replacement Soyuz in September 2023.",
      "Even though his record remains unbroken, problems with the Boeing Starliner that carried Wilmore and Williams to space triggered extensive coverage in the United States that far exceeded the coverage of Rubio's even longer mission.",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck in space so long?",
      "Three years after the space shuttle's retirement in 2011, NASA awarded multibillion-dollar contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build ferry ships to carry astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX has now launched 11 piloted Crew Dragon flights for NASA and five purely commercial missions. A sixth commercial launch is currently scheduled for Monday night.",
      "But Boeing ran into multiple problems with its Starliner that required two unpiloted test flights before Wilmore, who is 62, and Williams, 59, both former military test pilots, were finally cleared to launch last June 5 on the spacecraft's first piloted mission after engineers decided a small helium leak in the ship's propulsion pressurization system would not get worse.",
      "The astronauts successfully docked with the space station the next day, but the Starliner experienced additional helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "While the flight originally was expected to last about eight days, NASA and Boeing carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine what caused the problems and whether the spacecraft could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could, in fact, safely come home in the Starliner.",
      "But NASA managers eventually ruled out that option and decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride home aboard a Crew Dragon. That spacecraft was launched last September with just two crew members on board, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth earlier in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",
      "Wilmore, Williams, Crew 9 Dragon commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov originally planned to return to Earth in February. But the Crew 10 Dragon needed to carry their replacements to the station ran into problems of its own and the flight was delayed to the end of March.",
      "Those problems, and the threat of additional delays, prompted NASA to switch the Crew 10 fliers to a different Crew Dragon, eventually moving its launch up to March 12, paving the way for Crew 9 to head home.",

Another plan under consideration is for a new entity backed by U.S. companies like BlackRock and Oracle to lease TikTok's algorithm from ByteDance, according to a source familiar with the situation.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the New York Times reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 06 Apr 2025 10:00:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Stocks continued to tumble in the U.S. Friday as financial markets suffered their biggest two-day drop since 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Financial markets landed with a thud Friday as stocks tumbled for a second straight day on concerns about the economic fallout from new U.S. tariffs and the prospects of a global trade war.",
      "President Trump's announcement of steep tariffs on Wednesday shocked investors and sent economists scurrying to revise downward their forecasts for U.S. economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also warned that the levies \u2014 which include a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nearly 90 countries \u2014 are likely to dent the economy.",
      "\"While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,\" Powell\u00a0said in a speech Friday in Arlington, Virginia. \"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\"",
      "The S&P 500 fell 322 points, or nearly 6%, to close at 5,074 \u2014 the largest one-day slump in the broad-based index since March 16, 2020, when it lost 12%. Today's plunge erased $2.7 trillion in market value from the index. The decline wipes out more than a year of stock market gains, taking the S&P 500 back to its levels in February 2024.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2,231 points, or 5.5%, and is down 14% since peaking in February. The Nasdaq Composite slid 963 points, or 5.8%. That means the the tech-heavy index is now in a bear market, or when stocks drop at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "Tech stocks have flailed this week because of concerns that American tariffs on China \u2014 along with countermeasures from Beijing \u2014 will hurt the high-tech sector, which has been key to driving corporate profits.",
      "\"The economic pain that will be brought by these tariffs [is] hard to describe and can essentially take the U.S. tech industry back a decade in the process while China steamrolls ahead,\" Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a report.",
      "Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, told clients that the U.S. could tip into a recession later this year unless the U.S. moves to ease tariffs.",
      "\"In the near term, we believe the effective tariff rates could be higher still, and without President Trump taking active steps to reduce tariffs over the next three to six months, we are likely to enter a downside scenario, including a meaningful U.S. recession and lower equity markets,\" he said in a research note.",
      "The free-fall amounts to the biggest two-day drop for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since March 2020, when the pandemic began, and has wiped out trillions of dollars in investor wealth.",
      "Drops of this magnitude aren't unheard of on Wall Street, but they're rare. Over the last 25 years, the S&P 500 has fallen 4% in a single day 38 times, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for brokerage firm LPL Financial.",
      "Overseas markets also slid Friday. In overnight trading in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dropped 2.8%, while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%. In European trading, Germany's DAX lost 2%, France's CAC 40 in Paris dipped 1.6% and Britain's FTSE 100 shed 1.7%.",
      "U.S. growth downgraded",
      "Economists have downgraded their outlook for U.S. economic growth this year as Mr. Trump piles tariffs on a growing list of countries, warning that the levies are likely to boost inflation. That could reduce consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, as well as crimp business investment.",
      "Import taxes are largely borne by businesses, which typically pass on part or much of those added costs to consumers. As a result, Americans could face higher prices for electronics, household appliances, cars, clothing, furniture, and food such as coffee and chocolate, according to economists.",
      "\"Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,\" Powell said\u00a0Friday.",
      "According to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research firm, the Trump administration's tariffs could cost U.S. households more than $1,900 this year.",
      "David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, thinks U.S. trade officials will eventually lower tariff rates as they negotiate with their counterparts abroad. But that process is likely to take time, and the investment bank doesn't expect a speedy reversal in U.S. tariffs. As a result, UBS economists have lowered their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to less than 1%.",
      "China strikes back",
      "Investors are also nervously watching as the barrage of U.S. tariffs prompts retaliation from key trading partners. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014 materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose trade sanctions on 27 additional U.S. companies.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "In more upbeat news for financial markets, U.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in March, far exceeding analyst forecasts. The nation's unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, versus 4.1% in February.",
      "Yet while job growth was robust last month, experts say the government's latest hiring numbers don't reflect the impact of the Trump administration's trade policies on the economy.",
      "\"For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,\" Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, said of this week's downdraft in stocks.",

      "The Gators (35-4) got this far only after Clayton rallied them twice in this tournament. He scored 13 of his 23 points in the final eight minutes in a 77-75 win in the second round that ended UConn's pursuit of a third national title in a row, then had two late 3s last Sunday when they came from nine points down with less than three minutes left to beat Texas Tech.",
      "\"I'm just used to seeing him put the ball in the basket, I guess,\" Gators coach Todd Golden said. \"But he's done what he's done all year for us. In big moments, stepped up, hit huge shots, settled our team down and made winning plays when we needed it the most.\"",
      "Clayton had a driving layup with 2:24 left in the national semifinal, on the possession right after Australian big man Alex Condon drew a charge against Johni Broome, the other All-America player in the game \u2014 and who was dealing with an injured right elbow.",
      "The first SEC matchup in a Final Four ended with Clayton chasing down a loose rebound and tipping it back inbounds to keep the clock running out on the win. When he started to walk back on the court, teammate Alijah Martin was standing watching him at the end line nodding with a smile to greet him.",
      "\"We're just all together, on the court and off the court,\" Clayton said.",
      "After a record 14 SEC teams made this NCAA Tournament, seven got to the Sweet 16 before the league made up half the Elite Eight and then this Final Four filled with No. 1 seeds.",
      "Florida will have the chance Monday night to win the SEC's first title since Kentucky in 2012, the only one since the Gators won in back-to-back seasons. They take an 11-game winning streak into the title championship game in the Alamodome against Houston, who pulled off a stunning comeback win over Duke.",
      "Martin, who played in the Final Four with FAU two years ago, added 17 points for the Gators. Thomas Haugh had 12.",
      "The Tigers, in their second Final Four with Pearl, were the top overall seed and had an eight-point halftime lead.",
      "\"Auburn had us on our heels in the first half but we came out with a great start and we didn't look back,\" said the 39-year-old Golden, who joined Pearl's first staff at Auburn in 2014.",
      "Florida opened the second half with a 13-3 run, with Clayton capping that with a layup after Rueben Chinyelu's steal. That put the Gators up 51-49 with 15 1/2 minutes left.",
      "After eight lead changes and six ties in the first 11:02 of the game, Auburn stretched out to as much as a nine-point lead before halftime, and led until Florida ended its big spurt with 11 consecutive points. There were 15 lead changes and 10 ties.",
      "Chad Baker-Mazara, with his left hand partially wrapped because of a thumb issue, led Auburn with 18 points, including four 3-pointers. Broome finished with 15 points on 6-of-14 shooting and had seven rebounds \u2014 he had only three points after halftime in the Tigers' second loss to Florida this season.",
      "Broome was hunched over even before the final buzzer, and then was surrounded by cameras to capture his reaction. He eventually stood up to shake hands, then walked off the court with his eyes red from crying \u2014 pulling up his jersey to wipe his face as cameras continued to follow his exit.",
      "Baker-Mazara and Broome both were injured in the win over Michigan State last Sunday that sent the Tigers to the Final Four. Broome's right elbow bent awkwardly during a hard fall in the second half, and in the Final Four he wore some kind of brace on his arm covered by a sleeve.",
      "\"My elbow felt fine going into the game. Obviously here and there it bothered me a little bit. But, I mean, nothing that I couldn't play with,\" Broome said. \"I feel like we got the looks that we wanted to get. I wasn't able to capitalize and finish them.\"",

    "story": [
      "Democratic officials in 19 states, including Michigan, filed a lawsuit against President Trump's attempt to reshape elections across the U.S., calling it an unconstitutional invasion of states' clear authority to run their own elections.",
      "Thursday's lawsuit is the fourth against the executive order issued just a week ago. It seeks to block key aspects of it, including new requirements that people provide documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and a demand that all mail ballots be received by Election Day.",
      "\"The President has no power to do any of this,\" the state attorneys general wrote in court documents. \"The Elections EO is unconstitutional, antidemocratic, and un-American.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields responded to the lawsuit Friday, calling the proof-of-citizenship requirements \"common sense\" and objections from Democrats \"insane.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration is standing up for free, fair, and honest elections and asking this basic question is essential to our Constitutional Republic,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Trump's order said the U.S. has failed \"to enforce basic and necessary election protection.\" Election officials have said recent elections have been among the most secure in U.S. history. There has been no indication of any widespread fraud, including when Trump, a Republican, lost to Joe Biden, a Democrat, in 2020.",
      "The order is the culmination of Trump's longstanding complaints about how U.S. elections are run. After his first win in 2016, Trump falsely claimed his popular vote total would have been much higher if not for \"millions of people who voted illegally.\" In 2020, Trump blamed a \"rigged\" election for his loss and falsely claimed widespread voter fraud and manipulation of voting machines.",
      "Trump has argued his order secures the vote against illegal voting by noncitizens, though multiple studies and investigations in the states have shown that it's rare.",
      "The order has received praise from the top election officials in some Republican states who say it could inhibit instances of voter fraud and will give them access to federal data to better maintain their voter rolls.",
      "The order also requires states to exclude any mail-in or absentee ballots received after Election Day, and it puts states' federal funding at risk if election officials don't comply. Some states count ballots as long as they are postmarked by Election Day or allow voters to correct minor errors on their ballots.",
      "Forcing states to change, the suit says, would violate the broad authority the Constitution gives states to set their own election rules. It says they decide the \"times, places and manner\" of how elections are run.",
      "Congress has the power to \"make or alter\" election regulations, at least for federal office, but the Constitution doesn't mention any presidential authority over election administration.",
      "Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel says the order is unconstitutional and disrupts elections.",
      "\"The President has no authority to direct or control our state voting laws, many of which are enshrined in our state Constitution,\" she said. \"The White House cannot be permitted to undermine the will and the rights of Michiganders, or keep us from legally casting our ballots under state election laws.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James echoed Nessel's views.",
      "\"We are a democracy \u2014 not a monarchy \u2014 and this executive order is an authoritarian power grab,\" said New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Trump's executive order was an attempt to impose \"sweeping voting restrictions\" across the country and disenfranchise voters.",
      "The attorney general and secretary of state in Nevada, a presidential battleground, defended their state's elections as fair, secure and transparent, and they objected to the president's attempt to interfere in how they are run. Attorney General Aaron Ford praised Nevada's automatic systems for registering voters and distributing mail ballots.",
      "\"While this order is on its face unconstitutional and illegal, it is also unnecessary,\" he said.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts by the Democratic attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.",
      "Other lawsuits filed over the order argue it could disenfranchise voters because millions of eligible voting-age Americans do not have the proper documents readily available. People are already required to attest to being citizens, under penalty of perjury, in order to vote.",
      "Under the order, documents acceptable to prove citizenship would be a U.S. passport, a REAL ID-compliant driver's license that \"indicates the applicant is a citizen,\" and a valid photo ID as long as it is presented with proof of citizenship.",
      "David Becker, the CEO of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, characterized the order as a \"federal takeover of the constitutional authority of local and state governments to run elections.\"",
      "Becker is a CBS News election law contributor.",
      "Democrats argue that millions of Americans do not have easy access to their birth certificates, about half don't have a U.S. passport, and married women would need multiple documents if they had changed their name. That was a complication for some women during recent town elections in New Hampshire, the first ones held under a new state law requiring proof of citizenship to register.",

      "Alex Ovechkin tied Wayne Gretzky's NHL record by scoring the 893rd and 894th of his career, the second being the game winner, as the Washington Capitals rallied to beat the Chicago Blackhawks 5-3 on Friday night.",
      "Ovechkin scored his second goal on a power play with 13:46 left in the third period. And he did so with Gretzky in attendance for the first time during this chase.",
      "Gretzky should be there Sunday at the New York Islanders when Ovechkin has his next chance to make hockey history.",
      "Earlier in the night, he got his 893rd to move one away from tying and two from breaking Gretzky's mark that long seemed unapproachable. The 39-year-old Russian superstar is now one away from breaking it with six games left to play this season.",
      "On his first of the night, Ovechkin beat Spencer Knight 3:52 in, taking a pass from Dylan Strome behind the net and banking the puck off the far post and the goaltender's back and in.",
      "After a few seconds, Ovechkin's personal goal song, \"Shake, Rattle & Roll\" by Big Joe Turner started blaring from arena speakers as mascot Slapshot flipped the counter in one corner from 892 to 893. Fans chanted, \"Ovi! Ovi!\" before and after play resumed.",
      "Scoring in a fourth consecutive game, Ovechkin reached 40 goals for a 14th time in 20 seasons, which is the most in league history. With his second, he is at 41.",
      "And while Ovechkin has tied Gretzky's goals mark, no one will likely touch Gretzky's record of 1,963 assists and 2,857 total points. If Gretzky had never scored a single goal in his entire career, he would still be the NHL all-time leader in points since goals and assists both count as one point in hockey.",

      "It's a number that was seemingly untouchable. Gretzky, considered arguably the greatest hockey player of all time, set the mark with the New York Rangers in 1999 in his 20th and final season.",
      "The 39-year-old Ovechkin has until the Capitals' final regular-season game on April 17 to break it or wait for next year. He reached 894 by scoring two goals against the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday, April 4, with Gretzky in attendance at D.C.'s Capital One Arena   looking on.",
      "\"It's just a matter of time, whether it's late this year, early next year, whenever,\" Gretzky told NHL.com last September about Ovechkin breaking the mark. \"I mean, he's a great player. He's a great goal scorer.\"",
      "Gretzky also holds the record for most career goals in the regular season and playoffs combined, with 1,016. Ovechkin sits in second place as well in that category, about 50 goals back.",
      "Gretzky won four Stanley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers, and also played for the Los Angeles Kings, St. Louis Blues and New York Rangers. By contrast, Ovechkin has spent his entire pro career in Washington, D.C. A colorful personality off the ice, the Moscow native once portrayed a Russian spy in an ESPN commercial and swam in a public fountain with teammates to celebrate winning the Stanley Cup. Ovechkin, who led the Capitals to their first championship in 2018, already holds several NHL career records, including the most power play goals, most goalies scored upon and most goals with one team.",
      "Here are some of the most famous records in American sports.",
      "Wayne Gretzky's NHL assists and points record: 1,963 and 2,857",
      "While Ovechkin has tied Gretzky's holy grail of goals, no one will likely touch Gretzky's record of 1,963 assists and 2,857 total points.",
      "To put that in perspective: If Gretzky had never scored a single goal in his entire career, he would still be the NHL all-time leader in points since goals and assists both count as one point in hockey. By comparison, the No. 2 all-time points leader is Jaromir Jagr, who tallied 766 goals and 1,155 assists during his career for a total of 1,921 points \u2014 or nearly 1,000 points shy of Gretzky.",
      "Wilt Chamberlain with the most points in an NBA game: 100",
      "On March 2, 1962, the late Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points for the then-Philadelphia Warriors (now the Golden State Warriors) in a win over the New York Knicks. Chamberlain, one of NBA's greatest centers, went 28 of 32 from the stripe despite being a career 50% free throw shooter.",
      "It's a record that has never been threatened. The late Kobe Bryant came the closest when he scored 81 points for the Los Angeles Lakers in a game against the Toronto Raptors in 2006.",
      "Chamberlain was utterly dominant in his era. There have only been 15 70-plus point games in NBA history, and Chamberlain has six of them.",
      "Cal Ripken Jr. with the most consecutive MLB games played: 2,632",
      "For 17 seasons, Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. did not miss a single game. From May 1982 until September 1998, Ripken was an iron man, playing a stunning 2,632 consecutive games.",
      "On Sept. 6, 1995, Ripken broke New York Yankees legendary first baseman Lou Gehrig's then 59-year-old record of 2,130 straight games set in 1939, one that was believed to be unbreakable. For good measure, Ripken went on to play another 502 straight games after surpassing Gehrig.",
      "His streak came to an end on Sept. 20, 1998, when he voluntarily chose to sit out Baltimore's final home game of the season against the Yankees.",
      "Caitlin Clark as the all-time leading scorer in NCAA Division I basketball: 3,951 points",
      "In her final season at Iowa, Caitlin Clark became a household name, completely upending the basketball world. Her games became must-see TV, drawing in millions of new fans, and her rivalry with Angel Reese prompted Lakers legend Magic Johnson to compare it to his own with the great Larry Bird.",
      "And while Clark set numerous records over her college career, one stands head and shoulders above them all. On March 3, 2024, against Ohio State, the sharp-shooting guard passed the late \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich to become the NCAA Division I career scoring leader. His mark of 3,667 points set in 1970 with LSU had stood for 54 years.",
      "Clark ultimately finished her college career with 3,951 points \u2014 no currently active players are close to Clark's mark. Over 139 games for Iowa, she averaged 28.4 points per game, also a women's Division I record.",
      "And she's not nearly done. The 23-year-old was the No. 1 overall pick by the Indiana Fever in the 2024 WNBA draft, and as a rookie, she set the WNBA's single-season assists record with 337.",

      "Golfing legend Jack Nicklaus won an astounding 18 majors between 1962 and 1986. That included six Masters, five PGA Championships, four U.S. Opens and three British Opens.",
      "If that wasn't enough, Nicklaus was a runner-up in another 19 majors, also a record, according to the PGA Tour.",
      "When Tiger Woods came blazing onto the scene in the mid-1990s, Nicklaus' majors record appeared to be at risk. But Woods \u2014 whose career was derailed by injuries and tumult in his personal life \u2014 sits three back from Nicklaus at 15.",
      "While Nicklaus holds the record for most majors, Woods and Sam Snead are tied for the record for most PGA tour wins with 82. Nicklaus is in second with 73.",
      "The 1972 Miami Dolphins with the NFL's only undefeated season",
      "To say legendary head coach Don Shula and his 1972 Miami Dolphins steamrolled through the rest of the NFL is an understatement. That team, which produced eight Hall of Famers, went a stellar 14-0 in the regular season and had the league's No. 1 ranked offense and defense.",
      "The Dolphins then tore through their playoff competition, defeating Washington 14-7 in Super Bowl VII to cap their perfect 17-0 season.",
      "That record was put in serious jeopardy in 2007 by Bill Belichick's New England Patriots. Spurred by historic seasons from quarterback Tom Brady and wide receiver Randy Moss, the Pats went 16-0 in the regular season and reached Super Bowl XLII, where they were heavily favored against the New York Giants.",
      "But that only set the stage for one of the greatest upsets in NFL history. Late in the fourth quarter and trailing 14-10, Giants quarterback Eli Manning and wide receiver David Tyree connected on the \"helmet catch,\" one of the greatest plays in NFL history. The play set up a Plaxico Burress game-winning touchdown, denying the Pats their perfect season.",
      "Every NFL season, when the last undefeated team loses, the remaining living members of the 1972 Dolphins team will pop champagne to celebrate.",
      "The Los Angeles Lakers with the NBA's longest winning streak: 33 games",
      "With a roster featuring the likes of legendary Hall of Famers Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor and Gail Goodrich, the Lakers ripped off 33 straight regular-season wins from Nov. 5, 1971, until Jan. 7, 1972, a record that still stands more than a half-century later.",
      "That Lakers team finished the regular season with 69 wins \u2014 also a record which stood for over 24 years until Michael Jordan's 1996 Chicago Bulls broke it by going 72-10 \u2014 and delivered the Lakers their first title since they had relocated from Minneapolis to Los Angeles in 1960.",
      "The only group to come close to breaking the 33-game winning streak was LeBron James' Miami Heat in 2013, who won 27 straight games from Feb. 3, 2013, to March 25, 2013. That Heat team, with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, also won the NBA title that year.",
      "A few years later, Steph Curry's Golden State Warriors won 28 straight regular season games, but divided over two seasons. They won four games to close the 2014-15 season, and then another 24 straight to open the 2015-16 season.",
      "Joe DiMaggio with MLB's longest hitting streak: 56 games",
      "Baseball is a sport defined by statistics and dominated by numbers, and few numbers are more revered than New York Yankees centerfielder Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak in 1941.",
      "Beginning on May 15, 1941, DiMaggio recorded a hit in 56 straight games, spanning over two months. Over the course of the streak he batted .408, had 15 home runs and drove in 55 runs.",
      "On July 17, 1941, against the Cleveland Indians, shortstop Lou Boudreau fielded a groundball and recorded the out that ended DiMaggio's streak.",
      "In the more than 70 years since, no player has come close to DiMaggio's record. In 1978, the late Pete Rose had a 44-game hitting streak, and in 1987, Milwaukee Brewers infielder Paul Molitor achieved a 39-game streak.",
      "Eric Dickerson's NFL single-season rushing record: 2,105 yards",
      "In 1984, in just his second season in the league, Los Angeles Rams running back Eric Dickerson rumbled to an NFL regular-season rushing record of 2,105 yards, a mark that has remarkably stood for more than 40 years.",
      "Over the course of the 16-game season, the Hall of Famer averaged 131 yards per game and had twelve 100-yard games.",
      "Seven running backs have since recorded 2,000-yard seasons. In 2012, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson came within nine yards of breaking Dickerson's record, falling just short with 2,097 yards.",
      "The NFL increased the regular season from 16 to 17 games in 2021, making it more likely Dickerson's mark could someday fall.",
      "This past January, Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley went into the team's final regular-season game sitting on 2,005 rushing yards and a chance to break Dickerson's record. However, Eagles head coach Nick Siriani chose to rest Barkley in preparation for the playoffs. A move that paid off when the Eagles won the Super Bowl about five weeks later.",
      "UConn with the longest winning streak in college basketball: 111 games",
      "Arguably, no team has eclipsed a sport quite like UConn has eclipsed women's college basketball this century.",
      "From 2000 to 2016, UConn under head coach Geno Auriemma won 10 of his 11 NCAA titles with the university. And beginning in 2000, UConn played in 21 of a possible 26 Final Fours.",
      "But it is the 111-game winning streak that began in November 2014 and was broken in March 2017 that is most staggering.",
      "During the two-and-a-half year winning streak, UConn won four consecutive NCAA titles.",
      "The 111-game streak, the longest in college basketball history, ended in dramatic fashion in the Final Four on March 31, 2017, when Mississippi State's Morgan William hit a buzzer-beater in overtime to shock UConn 66-64. Mississippi State went on to lose in the championship game to South Carolina.",
      "And even with the loss to Mississippi State, UConn also had a 126-game regular season streak that started in November 2014 and lasted more than four years through January 2019.",
      "UConn's dominance under Auriemma has drawn comparisons to the UCLA men's basketball team under John Wooden, which won 10 titles in 12 seasons between 1964 and 1975. During that era, UCLA had an 88-game winning streak of its own from 1971 to 1974.",

      "\"DHS is now exercising its discretion to terminate your parole,\" the April 3 notice said, referring to the temporary legal status that the Biden administration granted to hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians. \"Unless it expires sooner, your parole will terminate 7 days from the date of this notice.\"",
      "The Biden administration welcomed roughly 240,000 Ukrainians under a policy known as Uniting for Ukraine, or U4U, that allowed Americans to sponsor Ukrainians displaced by Russia's invasion. More than 20,000 Ukrainians who flew to Mexico at the start of the war were also allowed into the U.S. under the parole authority, which allows officials to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to migrants on humanitarian grounds.",
      "If recipients failed to leave the U.S., the message read, they would \"be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States,\" unless they have received another immigration status.",
      "The notice also said recipients would lose their work permits once their parole status was revoked, and encouraged them to sign up for self-deportation using a government smartphone app known as CBP Home that the Trump administration recently repurposed.",
      "\"Again, DHS is terminating your parole. Do not attempt to remain in the United States \u2014 the federal government will find you,\" the notice warned. \"Please depart the United States immediately.\"",

      "As part of its sweeping crackdown on illegal and legal immigration, the Trump administration has moved to dismantle Biden administration immigration programs that relied on the parole authority.",
      "It has discontinued a sponsorship initiative for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, and warned the more than half-a-million migrants who came to the U.S. under the policy that they would face arrest and deportation if they did not self-deport by April 24.",

      "The Trump administration's sweeping cuts to the federal bureaucracy have included slashing a little-known government agency that channels grant money to America's libraries \u2014 a potentially crippling interruption to a funding lifeline for libraries around the country.",
      "One staff member at the Institute of Museum and Library Services sent grant coordinators a chilling email, obtained by CBS News, warning the agency would \"not be able to work or respond to your emails\" and that there was no \"information about future timelines related to this action.\"",
      "\"You call and the phone just keeps ringing, you know, there's nobody home,\" Mandy Knapp, the Ohio state librarian and executive director, said in an interview with CBS News.",
      "On March 20, teams from DOGE \u2014 the budget-cutting army led by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 descended on the Institute, a tiny federal department that was created by Congress in 1996 to oversee grants for museums and libraries around the nation. Late Wednesday night, organizations that receive Institute funding \"began receiving notification that their grants were being terminated, effective immediately,\" according to a local branch of the American Federation of Government Employees union.",
      "Wednesday night, word came that more than a dozen Institute grants were terminated \u2014 \"seemingly at random,\" the union said. Three states, California, Connecticut and Washington, received the first termination notices for their state library grants, according to a statement from the union.",
      "The notification could not have come at a worse time, library officials told CBS News. Washington's Deputy Secretary of State Randy Bolerjack says that the funding they received through the program helped support 32 positions at the Washington State Library, which have statewide impact and benefit public, tribal, K-12, and community college libraries.",
      "The Institute has previously cited its \"Grants to States\" program as the largest source of federal funding support for library services in the U.S. With over $160 million allocated to the program annually. The grants are formulated based on population and give state libraries complete oversight as to how funding is allocated to their local branches. In states like Ohio and South Carolina, officials told CBS News that this funding has been critical to keeping libraries in rural areas on par with those in larger cities.",
      "Breanne Smith, associate deputy director at South Carolina's state library, told us that public libraries in the state saw over 10 million visits last year alone. She says in rural communities especially, libraries are more than just a place to check out books.",
      "\"People go to their library for not even just the library services, they just go there for wifi, to use a computer. Libraries are really a community anchor,\" Smith said.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS, notice of the cuts to Washington's state library came from the Institute's acting director, Keith Sonderling, who is a deputy director at the Labor Department. Union officials said they were told that the Trump administration cuts were made because they were not aligned with the Institute's priorities. The deputy director at the South Carolina state library, Chris Yates, says he finds their rationale \"puzzling.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Labor Department for comment, but has not received a reply.",
      "Yates also expressed that the sporadic cuts have left state library staff in a state of uncertainty. The funds South Carolina receives support public libraries in all 43 counties, which serve over 5.4 million residents.",
      "\"Everyone, I think, is just in a holding pattern to see if they're gonna receive a letter or not.\", Yates told CBS News.",
      "Knapp says their funding does more than support libraries \u2014 it also funds summer reading programs, special access to materials for those with visual impairments, and offers access to state-of-the-art technology and the internet in rural communities. Their \"vital\" summer reading program has already been put on pause, Knapp said.",
      "In a letter sent to the White House yesterday, 127 Democratic members of Congress urged the administration to reconsider its decision to shutter the agency. \"Eliminating the [the Institute] would not only jeopardize these essential services but also dismiss the everyday needs of millions of Americans who rely on libraries and museums for learning, job opportunities, and community engagement,\" the letter says.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, told CBS News that the cuts will only undermine Americans' access to library resources, which he considers vital to bringing communities together.",
      "\"Trump's plan to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services would barely make a dent in the federal budget, but it would be devastating for communities across the country,\" Murphy said.",
      "In addition to congressional support, four major publishing houses have also sent a letter to Congress outlining concerns, saying, \"libraries are essential community hubs that provide free access to these valuable tools and resources. Defunding libraries would result in mass closures and the destruction of a system that today benefits millions of Americans.\"",

      "Haugh had been NSA director for just over a year. He was first nominated to the post by former President Joe Biden in May 2023, but his Senate confirmation was delayed until December 2023 because of Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville's months-long hold on military nominations protesting a Pentagon policy on reimbursing travel expenses for service members who seek reproductive health care.",

      "The high court split 5-4 in granting a request from the Justice Department to pause a federal district court order that required the Department of Education to reinstate the grants that had been awarded to universities and nonprofit organizations in eight states. The court said in an unsigned opinion that its stay will remain in place while legal proceedings move forward.",
      "\"Respondents have represented in this litigation that they have the financial wherewithal to keep their programs running. So, if respondents ultimately prevail, they can recover any wrongfully withheld funds through suit in an appropriate forum,\" the court said. \"And if respondents instead decline to keep the programs operating, then any ensuing irreparable harm would be of their own making.\"",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts joined with the three liberal justices in dissent.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan called the court's move a \"mistake,\" and said the Trump administration did not defend the legality of canceling the education grants at issue in the case. In a dissent joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said it is \"beyond puzzling\" that a majority of the court viewed the Justice Department's request for intervention as an emergency.",
      "\"The harms that will result from permitting the department to reinstate these terminations are directly contrary to Congress's goals in enacting the TQP and SEED programs and in entrusting the department with their implementation,\" Jackson wrote. \"It boggles the mind to equate the devastation wrought from such abrupt funding withdrawals with the mere risk that some grantees might seek to draw down previously promised funds that the department wants to yank away from them.\"",
      "Jackson called the court's decision to grant the Trump administration relief \"unprincipled and unfortunate,\" as well as \"entirely unwarranted.\"",
      "In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi called the ruling \"a significant victory for President Trump and the rule of law.\"",
      "Bondi said the ruling \"vindicates what the Department of Justice has been arguing for months: local district judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of taxpayer dollars, force the government to pay out billions, or unilaterally halt President Trump's policy agenda.\"",
      "The legal battle over the administration's decision to cut off the grants is the latest challenging President Trump's second-term policies to reach the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority. The Trump administration has sought to cut off federal assistance funding and foreign aid, but has so far been rebuffed by the courts.",

      "At issue in this dispute over Education Department funds is up to $65 million in grants awarded through the Teacher Quality Partnership program and the Supporting Effective Educator Development program, which support teacher recruitment and training.",
      "In early February, the acting secretary of education directed an internal review of the department's grant awards to ensure they did not fund programs with DEI practices, which the Trump administration has claimed are discriminatory.",
      "The Education Department ultimately decided 104 grants should be terminated because they did not align with its policy objectives, according to the Justice Department. Five grants were left in place, the department said.",
      "Following the grant cancellations, a group of eight states sued the Trump administration and asked a federal district court to issue temporary relief while the case moved forward. The states \u2014 California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin \u2014 said organizations within their states received the grants and argued the terminations violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "U.S. District Judge Myong Joun agreed to grant a temporary restraining order, in place until April 7, that required the government to reinstate the grants to recipients in the eight states. The court also temporarily blocked the government from reinstating the terminations, or cancelling any other awards for organizations in the states.",
      "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to pause that order while proceedings continue, which it declined to do. The Justice Department then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "In filings with the justices, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the district court's order is one of several that raise the question of whether a district court judge can force the government to pay out millions in taxpayer dollars.",
      "\"Unless and until this court addresses that question, federal district courts will continue exceeding their jurisdiction by ordering the executive branch to restore lawfully terminated grants across the government, keep paying for programs that the executive branch views as inconsistent with the interests of the United States, and send out the door taxpayer money that may never be clawed back,\" she wrote.",
      "Harris urged the Supreme Court to \"put a swift end to federal district courts' unconstitutional reign as self-appointed managers of executive branch funding and grant-disbursement decisions.\"",
      "In a separate case, the high court rejected an earlier bid from the Trump administration to pause an order that required it to pay out an estimated $2 billion in foreign-aid funding to groups that received money from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, lawyers for the states argued that the issue for the Justice Department is with other cases elsewhere, where courts are dealing with a slew of legal disputes arising out of Mr. Trump's executive actions.",
      "\"Those concerns are properly litigated in the context of those other cases,\" the states said in a filing. \"They provide no basis for this court to grant emergency relief here, where the district court appropriately granted a narrow and time-limited restraining order to preserve the status quo while it adjudicates the preliminary-injunction motion that was argued earlier today.\"",
      "Lawyers for the states said that the grant recipients are providing a pipeline of qualified teachers for local schools within their states, and warned that if the awards could be cancelled, programs that they fund will have to be scaled back or shut down entirely.",

      "The Trump administration's expansive new tariffs will likely lead to higher inflation and slower growth, and the Federal Reserve will focus on keeping price increases temporary, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday.",

China on Friday said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, the day after Mr. Trump's new tariffs go into effect.",
      "In written remarks delivered in Arlington, Virginia, Powell said that the tariffs and their impacts on the economy and inflation are \"significantly larger than expected.\" He also said that the import taxes are \"highly likely\" to lead to \"at least a temporary rise in inflation,\" but added that \"it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent.\"",
      "\"Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,\" Powell said. \"Our obligation is to ... make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,\" he added.",
      "Powell's focus on inflation suggests that the Fed will likely keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at about 4.3% in the coming months. That is likely to disappoint Wall Street investors, who now expect five interest rate cuts this year, a number that has increased since President Donald Trump announced the tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Trump on Friday, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, urged Powell to cut rates, writing that now would be the \"PERFECT time\" to do it. The president went on to criticize the Fed chair as \"always 'late,'\" adding that \"he could now change his image, and quickly.\"",
      "Economists forecast that the tariffs will weaken the economy, possibly threaten hiring, and push up prices. In that scenario, the Fed could cut rates to bolster the economy, or it could keep rates unchanged \u2014 or even hike them \u2014 to combat inflation. Powell's comments suggest the Fed will mostly focus on inflation.",
      "\"At the Fed, we are squarely focused on achieving the dual-mandate goals Congress has given us of maximum employment and stable prices,\" said Powell. \"While uncertainty is high and downside risks have risen, the economy is still in a good place. The incoming data show solid growth, a labor market in balance, and inflation running much closer to, but still above, our 2% objective.\"",
      "Tricky combination",
      "Weaker growth and higher prices are a tricky combination for the Fed. Typically the central bank would reduce its key interest rate to lower borrowing costs and spur the economy in the event of slower growth, while it would raise rates \u2014 or keep them elevated \u2014 to slow spending and combat inflation.",
      "\"We are closely watching this tension between the hard and soft data,\" said Powell. \"As the new policies and their likely economic effects become clearer, we will have a better sense of their implications for the economy and for monetary policy.\"",
      "Some positive news arrived Friday when the government reported that hiring accelerated in March, with\u00a0228,000 jobs added, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, from 4.1%.",
      "Yet those figures measure hiring in mid-March, before the scope of the duties became clear. The tariffs have also raised uncertainty about how the economy will fare in the coming months, which could limit businesses' willingess to invest and hire.",
      "\"The Fed is in a tough spot with inflation set to accelerate and the economy poised to slow,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide.",

    "story": [
      "A wealthy bitcoin entrepreneur and three fellow adventurers plunged back to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Friday, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California to close out the first crewed flight around Earth's poles.",
      "Three-and-a-half days after launch Monday from the Kennedy Space Center \u2014 and after 55 passes above the North and South Poles \u2014 the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" fired its braking rockets at 11:26 a.m. EDT and slammed back into the discernible atmosphere about 25 minutes later.",
      "Enduring heat shield temperatures up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, the spacecraft rapidly slowed down, deployed four big red-and-white parachutes and settled to an on-target 16-mph splashdown at 12:19 p.m.",
      "SpaceX crews deployed nearby rushed to the gently bobbing capsule and rigged it for a lift onto the company's recovery ship Shannon.",
      "In the first test of its kind, the crew exited the craft on their own, demonstrating the ability to get out of a Crew Dragon without help from recovery crews.",
      "Unlike crews returning from long-duration flights to the International Space Station who are carried out of their capsules, mission commander Chun Wang and his three companions were able to lift emergency gear up and out of the hatch before climbing out themselves.",
      "While they moved a bit gingerly after three-and-a-half days in weightlessness, Chun, Norwegian cinematographer Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, a German robotics specialist, and Australian polar guide Eric Philips were all smiles as they greeted support personnel and were escorted into the recovery ship for initial medical checks.",
      "Chun is a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, most recently in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean where he first met his crewmates, all veterans of polar expeditions.",
      "\"We ... all met on Svalbard, and we love the ice,\" Chun posted on X during the flight. \"The mission was planned when I lived there, and we fly polar because, in an ISS-like orbit, we are unable to see where we live. From this perspective, the mission has perfectly achieved its goal.\"",
      "Chun said before launch he planned to be on the lookout for Antarctic research stations, but Mikkelsen said during the flight that \"unlike previously anticipated, from 460 km above, it is only pure white, no human activity is visible.\"",
      "Neither Chun nor his crewmates are licensed pilots. While Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "But the Crew Dragon is highly automated and can be controlled from the ground when necessary. SpaceX viewed the Fram2 flight as a stepping stone toward opening the door for more non-professionals to fly to orbit.",
      "Chun, an avid world traveler and polar visitor, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter Resilience for the trip to polar orbit, SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "The mission was named Fram2 in honor of a 19th century sailing ship \u2014 Fram, or \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic explorers to the poles. A small piece of the original ship's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun said before launch. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023. ... Fram2 isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "The crew planned to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew was equipped  with multiple laptops and tablets, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray  generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the  human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration  missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Throughout the flight, the crew posted spectacular videos, including a timelapse view of Earth below as the Crew Dragon sailed over Antarctica all the way to the North Pole, making the trip from one pole to the other every 46 minutes.",
      "\"Proud to be able to bring to space some incredible cameras and lenses capturing the first images of the Arctic and Antarctic shot by humans from space,\" Mikkelsen posted on X. \"These videos are BIG in file size and we look forwards to sharing them with you post-mission splashdown.\"",
      "Another video showed the entire state of Florida and the southeastern United States. Zooming in on the Kennedy Space Center, Chun marveled \"there's our launch pad. Oh my God!\"",

      "Just over three months into 2025, the United States has recorded the most measles cases in a single year since a 2019 wave, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. The majority of the infections have been reported in an outbreak in West Texas that has led to\u00a0the death of a child. The number of cases in Texas alone has grown to\u00a0more than 480 and continues to rise. Nationwide, cases have surpassed 600, with infections confirmed in 21 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in a number of other states around the country as well.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Fridays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)",
      "The Texas outbreak is primarily affecting\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019 when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "The highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 12:41:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists say that President Trump's wide-ranging new tariffs raise the risk of a recession or stagflation.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is promising that his April 2 \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0volley of tariffs will \"make America wealthy again\" by repatriating manufacturing jobs and reviving demand for American-made products. But many economists are taking a different view, warning that the tariffs could lead to more dire economic scenarios, including a recession or stagflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has said the two new tariffs he unveiled Wednesday \u2014 a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and so-called\u00a0reciprocal tariffs\u00a0applied to imports from about 90 nations \u2014 will revitalize American manufacturing, create jobs and generate federal revenue.",
      "But economists are ringing alarm bells as they digest the impact of the wide-ranging tariffs, which they forecast will accelerate inflation and dampen U.S. economic growth. That's because Mr. Trump's tariffs will be paid by U.S. businesses that import goods and materials from other countries, and they are likely to pass on some or all of those costs to consumers through higher prices.",
      "As a result, experts say, inflation is likely to reignite, which could cause some U.S. households to back on spending. Because consumer spending accounts for about 70 cents of every $1 in GDP, economic growth could slow.",
      "Together, those outcomes could create \"stagflation,\" a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that describes periods when economic growth falters even as prices remain painfully high.",
      "The risks of recession\u00a0\u2014 a downturn that includes at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the nation's gross domestic product \u2014 are also rising due to Mr. Trump's latest tariffs, according to new estimates from several Wall Street economists.",
      "If the fresh U.S. tariffs spur retaliatory measures from other nations, \"serious recessions\" could emerge both in the U.S. and globally, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. A U.S. recession would likely reduce GDP by 2% and boost unemployment next year to 7.5%, up from its current rate of 4.1%, he estimated.",
      "On Friday, China announced it would implement a 34% retaliatory tariff on U.S. imports beginning April 10, a day after Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs are slated to go into effect.",
      "Still, for now that scenario remains unlikely, with Zandi assigning it a 15% probability. If the Trump administration drops some tariffs and offers exemptions for some products or nations, a recession would be more mild, with unemployment topping out at 5.5%, he added. Zandi said he is giving a 35% probability to this outcome.",
      "To be sure, while many economists are raising the likelihood of a recession, they also say the economy remains relatively strong, with low unemployment and steady growth. Much depends on whether the Trump administration sticks with its tariffs or eases up on some policies.",
      "Brace for higher inflation",
      "More certain is that Mr. Trump's tariffs will boost inflation, noted Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. Consumer prices could accelerate by 1 percentage point by year-end, he added, which would boost the inflation rate close to 4% from its current level.",
      "That could prove painful for many Americans, including for supporters of Mr. Trump who backed his candidacy because of his promises to \"end the inflation nightmare\" of the post-pandemic years. According to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll,\u00a0 most Americans said the president has focused too much on\u00a0tariffs, which they fear could end up raising prices, and not enough on lowering consumer costs.",
      "A hike in inflation from Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs could add $1,000 in annual costs for low-income households, Daco estimated. Products ranging from Apple's iPhones, which are largely manufactured in China, to clothing made in Vietnam could spike in price due to the reciprocal tariffs, with those nations facing rates of 34% and 46%, respectively.",
      "However, other estimates predict a bigger hit to Americans' budgets, with the Yale Budget Lab forecasting that the April 2 tariffs will cost a typical household about $2,148.",
      "\"With the most significant tariff increases targeting countries central to the U.S. supply chain for consumer goods \u2014 China, Vietnam, Taiwan and Cambodia \u2014 households should expect higher prices across a wide range of everyday items,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.",
      "Here's what other top economists are predicting",
      "Oxford Economics: \"[T]he announced tariffs will significantly raise the effective U.S. tariff rate to slightly less than 30%, matching levels not seen since the 1930s ....

      "Capital Economics: \"[W]e see U.S. GDP growth slowing to around 1.5% annualized, but the risks are to the downside and we would put the odds of a recession at about 30%. U.S. CPI inflation now looks set to jump to around 4.5% later this year.\" \u2014Its global economics team",
      "Deutsche Bank: \"[T]hese actions could potentially shave 1 - 1.5 [percentage points] from growth this year and add a broadly similar amount to core PCE inflation .... Recession risks will likely rise materially if these tariffs are sustained.\" \u2014Economics team",
      "Morningstar: \"The tariff hikes announced April 2, if maintained, represent a self-inflicted economic catastrophe for the U.S. .... We haven't yet published a full update, but we'll likely be reducing our U.S. real GDP growth forecast for 2025 and 2026.

      "This would be their second meeting of Mr. Trump's second term. The two last met in Washington, D.C. in February, when Mr. Trump unveiled his plan for the U.S. to \"take over Gaza\" and turn it into \"the Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "The meeting by the two leaders comes amid a stepped-up offensive in Gaza that the Israeli military said is aimed at putting pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages and, eventually, expel the militant group.",
      "Israel announces new corridors",
      "Meanwhile, Israel says it has deployed troops to a newly established security corridor across Southern Gaza. Netanyahu announced the new Morag Corridor on Saturday and suggested it would cut off the southern city of Rafah, which Israel has ordered evacuated, from the rest of Gaza.",
      "A military statement Saturday said troops with the 36th Division had been deployed in the corridor. It was not immediately clear how many had deployed or where exactly the corridor was located. Morag is the name of a Jewish settlement that once stood between Rafah and Khan Younis, and Netanyahu suggested it would run between the cities.",
      "Maps published by Israeli media showed the new corridor running the width of the narrow coastal strip from east to west.",
      "Netanyahu said it would be \"a second Philadelphi corridor,\" referring to the Gaza side of the border with Egypt further south, which has been under Israeli control since last May.",
      "Israel has also reasserted control over the Netzarim corridor that cuts off the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, from the rest of the strip. The Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors run from the Israeli border to the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "Hamas says situation is \"highly dangerous\" for hostages",
      "Hamas, which had long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S. even before it carried out the brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked\u00a0the war in Gaza, said Friday that Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza was creating a \"highly dangerous\" situation for the hostages still held there. It warned that half of the living captives were in areas where the Israeli army had ordered evacuations.",
      "\"Half of the living Israeli (hostages) are located in areas that the Israeli occupation army has requested to be evacuated in recent days,\" Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, said in a statement, AFP reported. \"We have decided not to transfer these (hostages)... but (this situation) is highly dangerous to their lives.\"",
      "Hamas says it will only release the remaining 59 hostages \u2014 24 of whom are believed to be alive \u2014 in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli pullout from Gaza. The group has rejected demands that it lay down its arms or leave the territory.",
      "Israel has issued sweeping evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza ahead of expected expansions in its ground operations. The U.N. humanitarian office said around 280,000 Palestinians have been displaced since Israel abruptly ended a ceasefire with Hamas last month that had been brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.",
      "To pressure Hamas, Israel has imposed\u00a0a monthlong blockade\u00a0on food, fuel and humanitarian aid that has left civilians facing acute shortages as supplies dwindle \u2014 a tactic that rights groups say is a war crime. Israel said earlier this week that enough food had entered Gaza during a six-week truce to sustain the territory's roughly 2 million Palestinians for a long time.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages, most of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals. Israel rescued eight living hostages and has recovered dozens of bodies.",
      "More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as part of Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't say whether those killed are civilians or combatants.

      "Deir al Balah, Gaza Strip \u2014\u00a0Israeli airstrikes killed at least 100 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, including 31 or more who were sheltering at a school, according to medics in the Hamas-ruled enclave, in a stepped-up offensive that Israel's military says is intended to pressure Hamas to free hostages and eventually expel the militant group. The bodies of 14 children and five women were recovered from the school in the Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City, and the death toll could rise because some of the 70 wounded sustained critical injuries, said Health Ministry spokesman Zaher al-Wahidi.",
      "The Civil Defense rescue agency in Gaza said Friday that at least 31 people were killed in the strike on the school, with around 100 others injured.  More than 30 other Gaza residents were killed in strikes on homes in the nearby neighborhood of Shijaiyah, al-Wahidi said, citing records at Ahli Hospital.",
      "The Israeli military said it struck a \"Hamas command and control center\" in the Gaza City area, and that it took steps to lessen harm to civilians. Israel gave the same reason \u2014 striking Hamas militants in a \"command and control center\" \u2014 for attacking a United Nations building used as a shelter a day earlier, killing at least 17 people.",
      "Hamas, which had long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S. even before it carried out the brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, called the strike on the school a \"heinous massacre\" of innocent civilians.",
      "Israel has long accused Hamas of hiding weapons and fighters in and around civilian infrastructure, but the Israel Defense Forces provided no immediate evidence to back up its claim that Hamas commanders were present in the Gaza school or the U.N. building it bombed this week.",
      "The strikes came as Israel's military ordered more residents in parts of northern Gaza to evacuate west and south to shelters, warning that it planned to \"work with extreme force in your area.\" A number of the Palestinians fleeing the targeted areas did so on foot, with some carrying their belongings on their backs and others using donkey carts.",
      "\"My wife and I have been walking for three hours covering only one kilometer,\" said Mohammad Ermana, 72. The couple, clasping hands, each walked with a cane. \"I'm searching for shelters every hour now, not every day,\" he said.",
      "Israel has issued sweeping evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza ahead of expected expansions in its ground operations. The U.N. humanitarian office said around 280,000 Palestinians have been displaced since Israel abruptly ended a ceasefire with Hamas last month that had been brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.",
      "The fresh evacuation orders came a day after senior government officials said Israel would seize large parts of the Palestinian territory and establish a new security corridor across it. Israel has imposed a monthlong blockade on food, fuel and humanitarian aid on Gaza that has left civilians facing acute shortages as supplies dwindle \u2014 a tactic that rights groups say is a war crime. Israel says it is intended to pressure Hamas to release hostages and disarm.",

The group has rejected demands that it lay down its arms or leave the territory.",
      "Overnight strikes by Israel killed at least 55 people in the Gaza Strip, hospital officials said Thursday.",
      "In the southern city of Khan Younis, officials said the bodies of 14 people had been taken to Nasser Hospital \u2013 nine of them from the same family. The dead included five children and four women. The bodies of another 19 people, including five children aged between 1 and 7 years and a pregnant woman, were taken to the European hospital near Khan Younis, hospital officials said. In Gaza City, 21 bodies were taken to Ahli hospital, including those of seven children.",
      "Later in the day, strikes killed four more people in Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital, and another two people were killed in central Gaza and taken to Al Aqsa Hospital.",
      "The attacks came as the Israeli military promised an independent investigation of a March 23 operation in which its forces opened fire on ambulances in southern Gaza. U.N. officials say 15 Palestinian medics and emergency responders were killed, and their bodies and ambulances were buried by Israeli soldiers in a mass grave.",
      "The military initially said the ambulances were operating suspiciously and that nine militants were killed. The military said the probe would be led by an expert fact-finding body \"responsible for examining exceptional incidents\" during the war. Rights groups say such Israeli investigations are often lacking and that soldiers are rarely punished.",
      "The head of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, Younes Al-Khatib, said Thursday he believed some of the medics were still alive when they were overtaken by Israeli forces. The organization's radio dispatchers heard a conversation in Hebrew between medics and Israeli soldiers after the ambulances had come under fire, Al-Khatib told members of the U.N. Security Council.",
      "Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, told the U.N. Security Council he was turning over a video he obtained, allegedly showing the moments leading up to the Israeli killing of 15 humanitarian workers in Gaza.",
      "Mansour said the video shows that the aid workers, including eight members of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, were traveling in emergency vehicles with the lights on at night to deconflict with Israeli Defense Forces. But, Mansour said, the video \"found on the body of one of the martyrs,\" shows that the Israeli army ambushed the vehicle despite the emergency lights.",
      "Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 50,600 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't say whether those killed are civilians or combatants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. In an update on Friday, the ministry said 1,249 people had been killed in Gaza since March 18, when Israel resumed strikes, ending a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory.",

    "summary": "As world leaders wrung their hands over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff announcements, Argentine president Javier Milei was feted at Mar-a-Lago.",
    "story": [
      "Europe vowed retaliation. China plotted tariffs of its own. Mexico scrambled to blunt the blow. But while the world's leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports, Argentina's right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "As part of his enthusiastic outreach to Mr. Trump, Argentine President Javier Milei flew from one of the planet's southernmost nations all the way to Palm Beach for 24 hours to receive an award honoring his libertarian agenda and, he'd hoped, to chat with Mr. Trump, who was also scheduled to attend the right-wing \"American Patriot\" gala.",
      "\"Make Argentina Great Again!\" Milei bellowed from the ballroom stage at at Mar-a-Lago late Thursday.",
      "It would have been the fourth face-to-face meeting between the leaders since Mr. Trump's election victory last November as President Milei, who has imposed a sweeping austerity program to fix Argentina's long troubled economy, offers himself as one of Mr. Trump's strongest allies in the global culture war against the \"woke\" left.",
      "Whether Milei's staunch alliance with Mr. Trump can actually help crisis-stricken Argentina remains to be seen, analysts say.",
      "\"He has a special relationship with Trump that has been good for him politically, but he needs to translate that into being good for the country economically,\" said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, director for the Americas at New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \"He hasn't managed to do that yet.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Milei pulled Argentina out of the World Health Organization after the U.S. announced its own exit.",
      "He threatened to quit the Paris climate accord after Mr. Trump did. He outlawed gender change treatments for minors after Mr. Trump banned transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. He even promoted a cryptocurrency token echoing the $Trump memecoin \u2014 at great political cost. In Milei's case, the cryptocoin Libra collapsed and left investors holding the bag, to the tune of $250 million. He later admitted that he posted about the coin without properly vetting the details.",
      "Milei has also slashed government spending, similarly to what Mr. Trump and Elon Musk have done with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has reduced government spending in Argentina by over 30% since taking office in 2023 by eliminating about a dozen government agencies, laying off 10% of the federal workforce and freezing state wages and pensions. While the cuts have lowered the country's hyperinflation, they have pushed up unemployment and poverty rates. Weekly protests have been held criticizing the cuts.",
      "The cuts were something Milei promised while running for office, even wielding a chainsaw during his campaign. He then gifted Musk\u00a0a giant chainsaw modeled\u00a0after the power tool. Musk waved the chainsaw during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "Railing against socialism and feminism at speaking events all over the world \u2014 including at CPAC \u2014 Milei has fashioned himself into something of a MAGA celebrity.",
      "Argentinian government reacts to Trump tariffs",
      "While U.S. partners and rivals alike were criticizing Mr. Trump's tariffs, a tux-clad Milei was holding forth beside a painting of Mr. Trump's pumped fist, reveling in the opportunity to prove himself a dogged champion of the American president.",
      "\"As you can see, we conduct policy with actions, not mere words, and on that we agree with President Donald Trump,\" Milei told the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, drawing cheers at the mention of the American president's name as he spoke in Spanish.",
      "In Buenos Aires, Milei's government sought to reconcile Mr. Trump's major round of tariffs with its own radical libertarian ideology and fervent support for free trade.",
      "\"We do not believe this is an attack on free trade, quite the opposite,\" Milei's spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said of Mr. Trump's announcement. \"I don't see why there should be so much concern about this.\"",
      "For all the leaders' mutual flattery, Argentina was slapped with a 10% minimum tariff. But officials framed it as uniquely preferential treatment. The front page of Argentina's largest-circulation daily, Clar\u00edn, declared: \"Trump raises the tax on our products less than on other countries.\"",
      "In Washington, Argentine Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein on Thursday held what he described as \"highly productive\" meetings with top U.S. trade negotiator Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, releasing rosy statements promising that Argentina was on its way to negotiating a free-trade agreement with the U.S.",
      "Milei praised progress toward the free deal in his Mar-a-Lago speech. But far more important to the Argentine leader is a hoped-for $20 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The badly needed cash would help Milei keep his ambitious economic reforms on track as pressure mounts on the country's sparse foreign currency reserves.",
      "Milei has already used executive powers to remove the need for Congress to approve a new IMF program. But the loan hasn't cleared the finish line, with negotiators still haggling over how much cash Argentina, a serial defaulter that owes some $44 billion to the fund, will be allowed to access up-front.",
      "It was against this backdrop on Wednesday that Milei, accompanied by his economy minister, hopped on the plane to the U.S., the fund's biggest stakeholder. He told journalists he expected \"an informal meeting\" with Mr. Trump, who was instrumental during his first term in helping Argentina secure a major $56 billion loan from the fund in 2018.",
      "But on Friday, Milei's much-anticipated photo-op with Mr. Trump was nowhere to be found in his publicist's slick montage of the Argentine president snapping selfies with fans on Mar-a-Lago's red carpet.",
      "The president's office said nothing about his meeting \u2014 or, non-meeting \u2014 with Mr. Trump, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach very late Thursday evening after attending an event with professional golfers at one of his golf courses near Miami. The White House didn't say whether he and Milei met.",
      "Major Argentine newspapers cited anonymous officials saying the leaders never met, drawing instant scorn from his political enemies.",
      "\"When I woke up, I thought I'd find on TV the photo-op with your 'friend' Trump that you went looking for,\" left-wing former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner wrote on social media. \"What a way to mess around and spend money on nothing.\"",

      "An African giant pouched rat is being honored in the record books after detecting more than 100 landmines and other undetonated explosives in Cambodia, Belgian non-profit APOPO announced Friday.",
      "The rat, named Ronin, was named APOPO's most successful Mine Detection Rat. He also was acknowledged by the Guinness World Records.",
      "Since August 2021, Ronin has detected 109 landmines and 15 items of unexploded ordnance, APOPO said. The record-smashing rodent is expected to do another two years or more of detection work, the non-profit said.",
      "\"Ronin's achievements are a testament to the incredible potential of positive reinforcement training. He's not just an asset; he's a valued partner and colleague,\" said Phanny, Ronin's handler, in a news release from APOPO.",
      "The previous record was held by the African giant pouched rat Magawa, who detected 71 landmines and 38 pieces of unexploded ordnance over the course of five years.",
      "APOPO has been training mine-detecting rats for over 25 years. Ronin underwent clicker training, where the rat learns to associate the sound of a click with a treat, to motivate him to learn how to smell explosives. He was also trained to work systemically within a grid pattern and to indicate landmines by scratching at the ground. Ronin and rats like him work for about 30 minutes a day, APOPO said. When they reach a certain age, they are moved to a retirement community and remain under APOPO's care. Magawa, the previous record-holder, was retired in 2021 and died in 2022.",
      "Undetonated landmines and ordnance are a huge problem in Cambodia. Decades of conflict have left up to six million unexploded munitions in the country's soil, according to the Landmine Monitor's 2024 report. Since 1979, those buried bombs have caused about 20,000 deaths and 45,000 injuries, the Landmine Monitor reported. Demining efforts have been underway for decades, including the work done by Ronin and other APOPO rats. In 2023, there were only 32 reported casualties involving landmines in Cambodia, according to the Landmine Monitor. The site does not distinguish between injuries and deaths when referring to casualties.",
      "The APOPO's efforts are not limited to Cambodia. The non-profit estimates that about 110 million landmines are buried across 60 countries. In 2023, 1,431 deaths were connected to these landmines. The agency said it continues to work to remove landmines and unexploded ordnance from the world.",
      "\"When we launched APOPO, the common view was that it would take around 500 years to clear all landmines from the Earth's surface,\" said Christine Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \"25 years later, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and if the international community fully supports the collaboration of all demining operators, we could clear the remaining minefields in our lifetime.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs included a whopping 50% levy on the small, impoverished nation's imports, and the Lesotho government quickly said it would send a delegation to Washington.",
      "\"We need to urgently travel to the U.S. to engage with its executives and plead our case,\" Trade Minister Mokhethi Shelile told reporters Thursday. \"My biggest concern was the immediate closure of factories and job losses.\"",
      "Lesotho's annual gross domestic product of $2 billion is highly reliant on exports, mostly of textiles, including jeans.",
      "\"There are 11 factories in the country, most of which export goods to the U.S. and provide employment to 12,000 workers,\" Shelile said. \"Goods currently in production will be affected by these tariffs and will not be exported to the U.S.\"",
      "He said he'd asked factories to continue operating \"while we work on solutions,\" and added that the U.S. action showed his country needed to \"diversify\" its trade relationships, which he said it had already started exploring.",
      "\"We cannot rely solely on the U.S.,\" he said. \"While this transition will take time, the process is already underway.\"",
      "To determine the rates of its new tariffs, the White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers. Economists have questioned the methodology, and many\u00a0foreign governments have complained\u00a0the levies are unfair and misrepresent their trade imbalances with the U.S.",

      "The economy has been heavily reliant on textile exports bound for the United States through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade deal, which provides duty-free access to the U.S. market for some African products. The Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on African nations has raised questions over how likely the White House is to renew the AGOA pact when it expires in September.",

      "In September 2023, those British media outlets published claims by four women\u00a0who said they were sexually assaulted or raped by Brand between 2006 and 2013, at the height of his fame.",
      "\"The women who have made reports continue to receive support from specially trained officers. The Met's investigation remains open and detectives ask anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information, to come forward and speak with police,\" Metropolitan Police detective superintendent Andy Furphy said in a statement Friday.",

      "In the video, which appeared to have been recorded outside of the U.K., Brand alluded to his adoption of Christianity, saying he accepted that \"I was a fool, before I lived in the light of the lord.\"",

    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

Economists have questioned the methodology, and many foreign governments have complained the levies are unfair and misrepresent their trade imbalances with the U.S.",

      "The unanimous verdict capped a dramatic fall for Yoon, a former star prosecutor who went from political novice to president in 2022, just a year after he entered politics.",
      "In a nationally televised verdict, the court's acting chief Moon Hyung-bae said the eight-member bench upheld Yoon's impeachment because his martial law decree seriously violated the constitution and other laws.",
      "\"The defendant not only declared martial law, but also violated the constitution and laws by mobilizing military and police forces to obstruct the exercise of legislative authority,\" Moon said. \"Ultimately, the declaration of martial law in this case violated the substantive requirements for emergency martial law.\"",

There have been fears he would incite efforts to resist his removal, since he earlier vowed to fight to the end.",

In January, Yoon was separately arrested and indicted by prosecutors on alleged rebellion in connection with his decree, a charge that carries the death penalty or a life sentence if convicted.",
      "Under Yoon's decree, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, hundreds of soldiers were dispatched to the assembly, election offices and other sites. Special operations soldiers smashed windows at the National Assembly and scuffled with citizens gathered to protest, shocking South Koreans and evoking traumatic memories of military rule.",

Yoon says the troops were deployed to the assembly simply to maintain order.",
      "Yoon, 64, a conservative, was impeached by the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly on Dec. 14. The assembly accused him of violating the constitution and other laws by suppressing assembly activities, attempting to detain politicians, and undermining peace across the country.",
      "In his final testimony at the Constitutional Court hearing, Yoon said his decree was a desperate attempt to draw public support of his fight against the \"wickedness\" of the Democratic Party, which had obstructed his agenda, impeached top officials and slashed the government's budget bill.

A public image as strong-minded and uncompromising helped him defeat Lee in the close-fought 2022 presidential election.

      "Indian police said on Thursday they had arrested a U.S. tourist who sneaked onto a highly restricted island carrying a coconut and a can of Diet Coke to a tribe untouched by the modern world.

    "published": "Thu, 03 Apr 2025 11:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "America's global trading partners are bristling at President Trump's tariff tactics, but many also stress a desire to strike new deals with the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "In a move that could upend American foreign relations across the globe, President Trump announced Wednesday that he is imposing what he calls \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. engages with in trade. From April 5, all imports to the U.S. will be subject to a baseline tariff of 10%. Then, beginning April 9, about 90 countries that the Trump administration says currently impose unfair barriers on imported U.S. goods will be hit by additional \"reciprocal\" taxes.",
      "Some of the Asian nations from which the U.S. has long imported vast quantities of consumer goods will be subjected to the highest tariffs, including a 34% blanket levy on imports from China, which quickly vowed to impose unspecified \"countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests.\"",
      "A number of nations, including Britain, Brazil and Egypt, were hit with the lowest, base-rate 10% tariffs.",
      "Economists have warned that across-the-board tariffs could impact lower-income Americans' finances the most and increase the likelihood of a recession.",
      "The response from other world leaders to Mr. Trump's announcement has almost universally included critique \u2014 or outright condemnation \u2014 of the American leader's overt pressure tactics, but it has also shown a recognition of the importance other countries place on trade relations with the world's largest economy.",
      "Below is a look at the criticism \u2014 and the desire to salvage economic relations with Washington \u2014 emanating from capital cities across the globe.",
      "China",
      "A White House official told CBS News that the tariffs announced Wednesday by Mr. Trump will be additive, meaning the 34% \"retaliatory tariffs\" will be on top of 20% levies imposed by Washington earlier this year.",
      "\"China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement. \"There are no winners in trade wars, and there is no way out for protectionism. China urges the U.S. to immediately lift unilateral tariffs and properly resolve differences with its trading partners through dialogue on an equal footing.\"",
      "\"Protectionism has no exit ramp,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Thursday, urging Washington to drop the new taxes on Chinese imports. \"What the U.S. needs to do now is correct its wrong practices and resolve economic and trade differences with other countries \u2014 including China \u2014 through fair, respectful and reciprocal consultations.\"",
      "Beijing did not indicate what countermeasures it might take but in separate remarks, Ministry of Commerce spokesman He Yadong said \"the trade and economic departments of China and the United States have been maintaining communication,\" and he added that Asia's largest economy remained \"willing to engage with the United States on important issues in bilateral trade.\"",
      "The European Union",
      "Overall, the 27-nation European Union bloc is one of the United States' biggest trade partners and, as a collective entity, has come under some of Mr. Trump's most vociferous criticism for what he considers an unfair imbalance in economic relations.",
      "The EU will be hit next week with a blanket 20% \"reciprocal tariff\" on its exports to the U.S., Mr. Trump announced Wednesday.",
      "\"I know that many of you feel let down by our oldest ally,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a video statement. While she was unequivocal in predicting that Mr. Trump's tactics would negatively impact the entire world, she signaled that the EU would at least wait to see if a new trade deal can be reached before imposing additional retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "\"President Trump's announcement of universal tariffs on the whole world, including the EU, is a major blow to the world economy,\" she said. \"Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism. The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe.\"",
      "Von der Leyen said the EU was \"already finalizing a first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel, and we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail.\"",
      "The reaction to Mr. Trump's announcement from individual EU member states was, in some cases, more pointed.",
      "In Germany, the bloc's biggest single largest economy and a major exporter of vehicles to the U.S., in particular, Economy Minister Robert Habeck predicted a U-turn by the American president \u2014 if the EU is able to maintain a united front and push back against the tariffs with measures of its own.",
      "\"That is what I see, that Donald Trump buckles under pressure, corrects his announcements under pressure, but the logical consequence is that he must also feel the pressure, and this pressure must now be exerted from Germany, from Europe,\" Habeck said, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Germany's leader, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, called Mr. Trump's tariffs \"fundamentally wrong\" and \"an attack on a trade system that has created prosperity all round the world \u2014 itself an American achievement.\"",
      "\"The EU has the strongest internal market in the world with 450 million consumers, which gives us the strength to hold talks with the U.S. government to avert a trade war,\" he said. \"We want cooperation, not confrontation, and will defend our interests. Europe will respond united, strong and proportionately to this decision.\"",
      "Giorgia Meloni, Italy's right-wing prime minister and a Trump ally who visited him at Mar-a-Lago in January, called the 20% tariff on EU imports \"wrong\" and a move \"that does not suit any party.\"",
      "\"We will do everything we can to work a deal with the United States, aiming to prevent a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global actors,\" Meloni said. \"In any case, as always, we will act in the interests of Italy and its economy, even by comparing ourselves with other European partners.\"",
      "Ireland's Prime Minister Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, in a post on social media, called the U.S. tariffs on the EU \"deeply regrettable,\" adding: \"I strongly believe that tariffs benefit no one. My priority, and that of the government, is to protect Irish jobs and the Irish economy.\"",
      "The United Kingdom",
      "The U.K. pulled out of the EU almost a decade ago, and while the advantages and disadvantages of that \"Brexit\" remain hotly debated, it will see the U.K. dodge the higher 20% tariffs imposed on its European neighbors. But even the baseline 10% levy announced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday was met with disappointment in London and with a clear desire to keep the storied \"special relationship\" on track.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer huddled early Thursday with the top executives from some of Britain's biggest businesses, eager to voice his support for their enterprises and also to draw on their economic acumen as he pushes for a new trade deal with the U.S., with the hope of getting all tariffs lifted.",
      "\"Clearly, there will be an economic impact from the decisions the U.S. has taken both here and globally,\" Starmer told the business leaders. \"But I want to be crystal clear: We are prepared.",
      "\"Nobody wins in a trade war. That is not in our national interest, and we have a fair and balanced trade relationship with the U.S.,\" Starmer argued, adding that \"negotiations on an economic prosperity deal \u2014 one that strengthens our existing trading relationship [with the U.S.] \u2014 they continue, and we will fight for the best deal for Britain.\"",
      "\"Today marks a new stage in our preparations,\" said Starmer. \"We have a range of levers at our disposal, and we will continue our work with businesses across the country to understand their assessment of these options. As I say, our intention remains to secure a deal. But nothing is off the table.\"",
      "Japan",
      "\"We had been requesting that the U.S. government review its unilateral tariff measures at various levels and we are extremely disappointed and regret that such measures have been implemented nonetheless,\" Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Thursday as his nation woke up to the news of a new 24% levy being imposed by the White House \u2014 which was taking a toll on the Nikkei stock market.",
      "\"We will continue to strongly urge the U.S. to review its measures,\" Ishiba said, according to Reuters.",
      "Japanese Trade Minister Yoji Muto, asked if Tokyo would retaliate with its own new trade barriers to U.S. imports, said the government would \"need to decide what is best for Japan, and most effective, in a careful but bold and speedy manner.\"",
      "Brazil",
      "\"The Brazilian government is evaluating all possible actions to ensure reciprocity in bilateral trade, including resorting to the World Trade Organization, in defense of legitimate national interests,\" the Brazilian government said in a statement Thursday, according to Reuters.",
      "The statement came just after Brazil's Congress approved a bill that would give President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva a legal framework to respond to international tariffs, including with countermeasures such as retaliatory tariffs.",
      "The government statement said Brazil remained open to negotiations with the U.S., and it rejected the White House's characterization of the 10% levy as \"reciprocal,\" saying that assessment does not \"reflect reality.\"",
      "Lula said previously that Mr. Trump's decision to impose tariffs on America's trading partners risked damaging the U.S. economy, and he said Brazil would lodge a formal complaint with the WTO over a separate levy on Brazilian steel exports.",
      "\"It will raise the prices of goods and could lead to [U.S.] inflation that he hasn't yet realized,\" Lula said, according to Reuters. \"Protectionism doesn't help any country in the world.\"",
      "Vietnam",
      "Vietnam was among the nations hardest hit by Mr. Trump's tariff salvo on Wednesday, with the U.S. leader announcing 46% tariffs on exports from the Asian manufacturing hub. Its exports to the U.S. have flourished for years under the so-called China+1 strategy, which has seen Chinese manufacturers get around existing U.S. tariffs on their country by moving some production to other, less-heavily tariffed nations in the region.",
      "Vietnamese officials did not immediately signal any plan to impose retaliatory measures.",
      "As the nation's benchmark stock index appeared on course for its biggest single-day drop in four years and its currency hit an all-time low, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh declared a new task force dedicated to addressing the rapidly changing economic situation after holding a cabinet meeting early Thursday.",
      "Cambodia",
      "The French news agency AFP spoke Thursday with Penn Sovicheat, a spokesman for Cambodia's commerce ministry, who blasted the Trump administration's imposition of a 49% levy on the country's exports as \"not reasonable.\"",
      "The White House says Cambodia is among the nations, like Vietnam and Laos, that have developed their own economies by inviting Chinese investment under the China+1 strategy, enabling Chinese manufacturers to skirt existing U.S. trade barriers. According to Sovicheat, Cambodia exported about $10 billion worth of goods to the U.S. in 2024, largely clothing.",
      "\"China has turned Cambodia into the most important transshipment hub that Communist China uses to evade our tariffs,\" a White House official told reporters this week.",
      "Sovicheat acknowledged that American imports to Cambodia, which he said amounted to around $264 million worth of goods last year, were taxed at an average of 29.4%, but the White House figures Mr. Trump unveiled Wednesday claim the Asian nation has tariffs and other trade barriers in place on U.S. goods amounting to 97%.",
      "\"The 49% tariffs is not a good image for Cambodian industry or our investment attraction,\" Sovicheat told AFP, adding that the government was hoping to negotiate a trade agreement with the Trump administration through existing entities such as the ASEAN trade bloc or the World Trade Organization.",
      "Cambodian Commerce Minister Cham Nimul said in remarks aired by state TV that U.S. consumers would feel the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs on his country before Cambodians, according to the AFP.",
      "\"The increase in tariffs means that the U.S. people who make the purchase orders of Cambodian products are the first people to be impacted, and next will be Cambodia and business people,\" she was quoted as saying.",
      "Australia",
      "Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Thursday that Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs were \"not unexpected, but let me be clear, they are totally unwarranted.\"",
      "\"This is not the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, who, in addition to his frustration, appeared perplexed by the fact that the White House tariffs singled out some of his country's tiny, far-flung territories, including a group of islands that are home to lots of penguins, but no people.",
      "Norfolk Island is an inhabited Australian territory, but only by about 2,000 people, and Albanese called it \"a bit strange\" that it had been singled out by the White House and hit with an even greater tariff of 29%, nearly three times higher than the Australian mainland.",
      "The uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands were subject to the same 10% levy as mainland Australia, meanwhile, despite them rarely seeing human footprints due to \"the extreme isolation\" and the \"persistently severe weather and sea conditions\" in the sub-Antarctic area.",

    "story": [
      "Life-sized statues of a man and a woman were discovered in a tomb in Pompeii, researchers said, thousands of years after a deadly volcano wiped out the ancient Roman city.",
      "Researchers say the nearly life-size figures shed new light on life and religion in Pompeii, which was destroyed when Mt. Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D.",
      "The discovery was made while researchers from the archaeological site and the University of Valencia worked on an excavation focused on the necropolis of Porta Sarno, which was just outside the city, according to a news release. The site served as a burial ground, and was discovered in the 1990s during railway construction. Since 1998, researchers have found evidence of over 50 cremation burials in the necropolis. The current excavation, called \"Investigating the Archaeology of Death in Pompeii,\" has been ongoing since July 2024.",
      "The statues were found in the southern half of the tomb, covered in pumice stone, according to a report by the researchers. The pumice stone indicated that this part of the tomb had been buried in earthquakes shortly before the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius.",
      "The figures are a funerary relief, the researchers said. The couple may have been married and appear to have been \"well-to-do,\" according to the researchers.",
      "\"The delicacy and detail of the sculpture is remarkable,\" the researchers wrote. \"We can appreciate the careful carving of the hands, fingers and nails. We can also see the detailed work on the folds of the clothing and the ornaments: rings, bracelets, necklace, etc.\"",
      "The woman's figure includes carved accessories that may indicate she was a priestess of Ceres, a Roman harvest and fertility goddess. Researchers said that it is likely only women from prominent families held this position. Priestesses wielded political power and had the highest social standing possible for Roman women. Statues of priestesses holding items associated with their positions are very rare in southern Italy, the researchers said.",
      "The man is wearing a toga indicating that he is a Roman citizen. Both are depicted wearing rings that may be wedding bands.",
      "Other relics, including ointment jars that may have held perfumed oil, a broken mirror and a coin depicting the sea god Neptune were also found in the tomb. These items may have been important in funerary rites, the researchers said.",
      "The statues may date back to the late Republican period, which ranged from 133 to 31 B.C., the researchers said.",
      "The statues have been transferred to another part of Pompeii for restoration work. They will be featured in an exhibition that focuses on womanhood in ancient Pompeii, which will open on April 16. The restoration will be carried out in front of exhibition visitors, the park said.",
      "Other major finds have been unearthed in Pompeii in recent months. In February, paintings depicting Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, were discovered. The images were painted on the walls of a large banquet room. In January, archaeologists excavated a large private bathhouse that included multiple rooms and a plunge pool.",

    "story": [
      "Miller Gardner, the youngest son of former New York Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, died on March 21 at the age of 14 while on vacation with his family in Costa Rica.",
      "Carbon monoxide poisoning was the cause of death, authorities in Costa Rica confirmed on April 2.\u00a0High levels of the toxic gas had been detected\u00a0in testing of the family's hotel room.",
      "Here is what we know about Miller Gardner's death.",
      "What happened to Miller Gardner?",
      "Miller Gardner's parents said in a statement that he died in his sleep after he and several other family members fell ill while vacationing. They did not elaborate on who else had gotten sick, what specific illness they were dealing with or what symptoms they had experienced.",
      "Where were the Gardners staying?",
      "The Gardners were vacationing at the Arenas Del Mar Beachfront & Rainforest Resort, which is along Costa Rica's Pacific coast, some 50 miles south of San Jos\u00e9.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by this loss, and our hearts go out to the family during this incredibly difficult time,\" the resort said in a statement on Tuesday, March 25. \"The factors that led to this tragic incident are unknown, and we are fully cooperating with authorities as they investigate. We remain committed to supporting our guests and staff, prioritizing their well-being and safety, while respecting the privacy of those affected.\"",
      "The resort also told CBS News that hotel staff responded to the incident according to protocol, saying: \"The hotel staff dispatched a medical team immediately, including a licensed doctor, which arrived to handle the emergency situation. Any medical attention to the family was done by medical professionals. Our staff did not administer any medical treatment.\"",
      "What are officials saying about the cause of death?",
      "Randall Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, director of the Judicial Investigation Agency, or OIJ, said on March 31 that investigators conducted testing in the hotel room where Gardner was staying and found high levels of carbon monoxide, which he said may have been caused by machinery in the room next door. The contamination they found led investigators to believe Gardner \"may have died from inhaling these highly dangerous gases,\" Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said.",
      "The cause of death was confirmed after Gardner was tested for carboxyhemoglobin, a compound generated when\u00a0carbon monoxide\u00a0binds to hemoglobin in the blood, according to Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. The test showed a carboxyhemoglobin saturation of 64%. Saturation is considered lethal when it exceeds 50%.",
      "The head of Costa Rica's judicial police also said that a \"layer\" was detected during the autopsy on Gardner's organs. That layer forms due to a high presence of carbon monoxide.",
      "Carbon monoxide\u00a0is an odorless gas produced by the burning of fossil fuels in equipment such as cars, furnaces, stoves, certain heaters and generators.\u00a0Symptoms\u00a0of carbon monoxide poisoning may include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and confusion.",
      "Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said the investigation was \"closely coordinated\" with the FBI.",
      "The hotel told CBS News in a statement on March 31 that it was \"diligently cooperating with the Costa Rican judicial authorities, who have taken over the investigation.\"",
      "\"We trust that the forensic process will objectively, clearly, and conclusively clarify the causes of this unfortunate incident,\" the hotel said.",
      "The OIJ director had said it was conducting three types of analyses, including a toxicology report, at its forensic science laboratories.",
      "Why did early reports say the cause was food poisoning or \"food intoxication\"?",
      "Asphyxiation was initially thought to be the cause of death, although that theory was ruled out after an autopsy performed by the Forensic Pathology Section. An initial statement had said: \"Preliminary reports indicate the cause of death is asphyxiation following possible food poisoning.\"",
      "Some news outlets quoted a local official who cited possible \"food intoxication,\" but there is no condition by that name, and it appears in this context to have meant the same thing as food poisoning.",
      "Following the reports of possible food poisoning, Hotel La Mariposa, located less than a mile from where the Gardners were staying, released a statement to address what it called \"misinformation circulating on social media.\"",
      "\"The Gardner family dined at our restaurant, Le Papillon, on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 18, 2025\u2014three days before Miller's tragic passing. Any claims suggesting a link between our restaurant and this heartbreaking event are entirely false and unfounded,\" the restaurant said. \"Any news, statements, or claims to the contrary do not reflect the reality of the situation. Furthermore, we do not have any additional information, as the Gardner family did not stay at our hotel.\" The hotel also extended its \"heartfelt condolences to the Gardner family.\"",
      "The Arenas Del Mar resort, where the Gardners were staying, said in a statement, \"The family did not eat at any of Arenas Del Mar's restaurants for lunch or dinner the previous day. Additionally, on March 14th, we had an inspection by the Health Ministry in which the hotel passed with a 98.5 out of 100.\"",

      "\"We are so thankful to all who have reached out to offer support and encouragement during this difficult time and we are confident our faith, family, and friends will help us navigate this unimaginable loss,\" their statement continued. \"Our prayers go out to Miller's teammates and friends, as well as to all other families who have lost a child far too soon as we share their grief.\"",
      "An\u00a0obituary\u00a0posted online described Miller Gardner as an Honor Roll student who played football and baseball and loved traveling with his family.",
      "\"The void Miller's passing leaves in the hearts of his family, friends, teammates, teachers, coaches and others will be felt for years,\" it said. \"Miller's time here with them was brief but his spirit will carry on forever through those who were impacted by the way he lived.\"",
      "What have the New York Yankees said?",
      "The New York Yankees, where Brett Gardner played for 14 years, released the following statement after news of Miller Gardner's death became public.",
      "\"Our hearts are heavy, and the Yankees family is filled with grief after learning of the passing of Miller Gardner. Words feel insignificant and insufficient in trying to describe such an unimaginable loss. It wasn't just Brett who literally grew up in this organization for more than 17 years \u2014 so did his wife, Jessica, and their two boys, Hunter and Miller.",
      "We grieve with Brett, Jessica, Hunter, and their community of family and friends in mourning the loss of Miller, who had a spark in his eyes, an outgoing and feisty personality, and a warm and loving nature.",

    "story": [
      "San Jose, Costa Rica \u2014 Carbon monoxide poisoning was the cause of death of the teenage son of former New York Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, authorities in Costa Rica confirmed Wednesday night. They had reported earlier this week that it was suspected, after high levels of the toxic gas were detected in testing of the family's hotel room.",
      "Randall Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, director of the Judicial Investigation Agency, or OIJ, said they tested the body of 14-year-old Miller Gardner for carboxyhemoglobin, a compound generated when carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin in the blood.",
      "When carboxyhemoglobin saturation exceeds 50%, it is considered lethal. In Gardner's case, the test showed a saturation of 64%.",
      "\"It's important to note that adjacent to this room is a dedicated machine room, where it's believed there may be some type of contamination toward these rooms,\" Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said.",

We trust that the forensic process will objectively, clearly, and conclusively clarify the causes of this unfortunate incident.\"",
      "Asphyxiation was initially thought to have caused his death, but after an autopsy was performed by the Forensic Pathology Section, that theory was ruled out.

Family members had reported feeling ill after dining at a nearby restaurant on the night of March 20 and received treatment from the hotel doctor.",

Finger pointing ensued among the band, concert producers and the venue.",
      "Oseguera is the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has been connected to a ranch authorities say was used to train cartel recruits and possibly dispose of bodies in Jalisco, where searchers found human bone fragments, heaps of clothing and shoes. The U.S. government has offered a\u00a0$15 million reward\u00a0for information leading to Oseguera's capture. In November, his son-in-law was\u00a0arrested in California\u00a0after U.S. officials say he faked his own death to \"live a life of luxury\" north of the border.",
      "The Jalisco cartel is among other criminal groups in Mexico that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "While the image was met by applause during the concert, Jalisco prosecutors quickly announced they were summoning the band to testify in an investigation into whether they were promoting violence, a crime which could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison. The state of Michoacan also announced an investigation into the Los Alegres del Barranco for projecting the same images during a concert in the city of Uruapan.",
      "Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus said that the state would ban musical performances that glorify violence, adding that violators would \"face monetary and criminal sanctions.\"",

      "Pavel Moreno, the band's accordion player and back-up singer, didn't respond to questions by fans asking if his visa had been revoked, simply thanking them for support and saying that \"everything is fine.\"",
      "The band was scheduled to play in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 4. While the event hasn't been publicly canceled, ticket sales websites read: \"No tickets available for now on our site\" for that date.",
      "\"You can't justify violence or criminal groups\"",
      "The dispute coincides with a larger cultural debate in Mexico as artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano usher in a global renaissance of Mexican regional music, by mixing classic ballads with trap music. In 2023, Peso Pluma beat Taylor Swift out as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "Many of the artists now topping the charts have come under fierce criticism because their lyrics often paint cartel leaders as Robin Hood-esque figures. Others say that the genre, known as \"narco corridos,\" expresses the harsh realities of many youths across Mexico.",
      "A number of Mexican states have banned public performances of the music in recent years, the most recent being the state of Nayarit in February. Some of the bans have come as famed artists have received death threats from cartels, forcing a number of them to cancel their performances.",
      "Others, including Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, have sought a less aggressive approach to addressing the genre. Sheinbaum, who has come out against censoring the music, has suggested instead that the Mexican government push forward initiatives that promote Mexican regional music with more socially acceptable lyrics.",
      "The Mexican leader did harden her language on the topic following the Los Alegres del Barranco concert. In her morning news briefing this week, Sheinbaum demanded an investigation into the concert, saying: \"You can't justify violence or criminal groups.\"",

      "The president, who signed an executive order to impose the tariffs, insisted the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of are \"over.\" The reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump said, will amount to roughly half the tariff rate those countries impose on U.S. exports, or less. Countries that will see tariffs higher than 10% include the European Union, China and Israel.",
      "Senior administration officials said the 10% worldwide tariffs take effect April 5 at 12:01 a.m., and the higher reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 a.m.",
      "\"In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" the president said in a White House Rose Garden announcement. \"And for these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\"",
      "\"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating, and because we are being very kind, we're a kind people, very kind,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're not so kind when you're ripped off\u2026 We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.\"",

      "Canada and Mexico are not subject to these tariffs for now, senior administration officials said, but tariffs the president has already imposed, citing fentanyl and migration issues, persist.",

      "\"It's our declaration of economic independence,\" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Trump labeled Wednesday \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "The president lamented that the U.S. imports phones and other electronics, as well as pharmaceuticals, saying that if there's a war, the U.S. would struggle. He said his moves Wednesday are also standing up for U.S. farmers and ranchers who have been \"brutalized\" by other countries, specifically blasting Canada.",

      "The president said he expects complaints from \"globalists,\" \"outsourcers,\" \"special interests,\" and \"fake news\" in the days ahead, but insisted those groups have been wrong about trade before.",
      "\"In the first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\"",
      "In the audience for the president's announcement were rank-and-file steelworkers and auto workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as most of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance.",
      "What new tariffs did Trump announce today?",
      "The president says his plan will place a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on all countries, with reciprocal tariffs on many trading partners that have their own tariffs placed on the U.S. The 25% tariffs the president previously announced on foreign cars and foreign auto parts are set to go into effect at midnight.",
      "A White House official said the reciprocal tariffs are additive, meaning they will be imposed in addition to any previous tariffs already in place, unless a specific good is exempt under Section 232 of the Tariffs Act, which carries a flat 25% rate on certain things like steel and aluminum.",

      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday that tariffs are one tool to get companies to bring jobs back to the U.S.",

      "What are tariffs, exactly?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S.\u00a0The most common type of tariffs are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value\"), which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of a product. The 25% auto tariffs are these types of tariffs.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, and \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold.",
      "What do financial experts say about tariffs?",
      "Economists and taxpayer advocacy groups have their doubts, and are warning tariffs could upset economic growth and will almost surely contribute to higher prices for American consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices, after the president announced tariffs on foreign cars and parts.",
      "More than a dozen leaders at think tanks and taxpayer advocacy groups, including at the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday sent a joint letter to congressional leaders and the commerce and treasury secretaries, urging them to consider how tariffs on steel, lumber, energy, pharmaceutical and medical supplies and cars and car parts will increase prices.",
      "\"We encourage you to consider whether tariffs may, in many cases, undermine President Trump's broader long-term economic goals by increasing the cost of goods subject to tariffs,\" they wrote. \"We are especially concerned about tariffs on inputs needed by U.S. manufacturers that make it harder to compete with finished goods made abroad and tariffs that increase the price of necessities like food and housing.\"",
      "Alex Jacquez, who worked on the Biden White House National Economic Council, said that although it's hard to know the exact impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs without knowing all the details, CEOs are telling investors and shareholders they will be hiking prices.",
      "\"What the major retailers and companies who may be affected by tariffs are planning to do and they're planning out in public here is pass these costs along to consumers as much as they possibly can,\" Jacquez, now the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "Colin Grabow, associate director at the libertarian Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, wrote in a USA Today op-ed that \"tariffs are a costly and inefficient tax usually borne by the importing country's customers.\"",
      "\"Americans may have voted for lower prices in November, but under the guise of tariff reciprocity, the Trump administration is set to deliver something very different,\" Grabow wrote.",
      "A reporter on Tuesday asked Leavitt if the president is thinking about seniors on fixed income who are stressed about the recent swings in the stock market, swings partly attributed to the president's tariff announcements. Stocks have struggled as Wall Street braces for the next round of tariffs.",
      "\"Well certainly, they are legitimate concerns and the president takes those concerns very seriously,\" Leavitt said. \"And he's addressing them every single day. And tomorrow's announcement is to protect future generations of the senior citizens you mentioned. It's for their kids and their grandkids, to ensure that there are jobs here in the United States of America for their children to live the American dream, just like they presumably did.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. citizen wife of a 29-year-old man who the Trump administration has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador said she fears for his safety in the infamous mega-prison where he's being held, maintaining that her husband is \"an amazing father\" and \"not a criminal.\"",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador on March 15 and imprisoned inside that country's maximum-security prison known as CECOT, as part of a series of U.S. deportation flights that have ignited a high-stakes legal battle in American courts.",
      "The Trump administration has acknowledged in federal court that his deportation was an \"administrative error,\" since an immigration judge in 2019 had granted him legal protection from being sent to El Salvador. But it has rejected requests to bring back Abrego Garcia, saying the U.S. no longer has custody over him. It is also accusing him of being part of MS-13, a transnational criminal gang. Abrego Garcia's lawyers have said in court documents that their client has no criminal record, a finding the government has not contested.",
      "During an exclusive interview with CBS News, Jennifer, Abrego Garcia's wife, said she confirmed her husband had been deported from the U.S. and imprisoned at the CECOT prison after identifying him in a photo posted by the Salvadoran government.",

      "Jennifer, who requested that her surname be withheld, said she was \"very scared\" about Abrego Garcia's transfer to CECOT because it houses some of El Salvador's most dangerous gang members. After all, she said, the reason a U.S. immigration judge in 2019 granted him a reprieve from deportation was because of concerns that he could be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador.",
      "\"I've seen news of that prison,\" she said. \"I know they take criminals there. And my husband's not a criminal.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. in 2011, when he was 16. According to court documents, he entered the country illegally, without being inspected by immigration officials.",

Abrego Garcia's attorneys said he went there looking for work. He remained in ICE detention for months, while an immigration judge reviewed his case.",
      "Court documents show an immigration judge initially denied Abrego Garcia's release on bond, partially due to information submitted by the government that it said tied him to MS-13. The judge's bond denial, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board, mentioned information from an informant who the government deemed to be credible.",
      "But Abrego Garcia was ultimately released from ICE custody after another immigration judge granted him \"withholding of removal,\" a legal classification that bars officials from deporting individuals who prove they are more likely than not to face persecution in their home country. In his order, the judge said Abrego Garcia could be targeted by gangs if sent to El Salvador.",
      "Jennifer said her husband attended regular check-ins with ICE after he was released. He became their family's main breadwinner, she added, and helped her raise their 5-year-old disabled son, as well as two children from a previous relationship. He worked five days a week as a sheet metal worker while also attending college classes, she said.",
      "On March 12, however, Abrego Garcia was again arrested by ICE. Jennifer said he was driving with their 5-year-old son with disabilities when he was stopped. She said she rushed to the location and was told by ICE officials that her husband's status had \"changed\" and that he would be fingerprinted and detained.",
      "Over the next few days, Jennifer said her husband was transferred to different immigration detention centers, including ones in Louisiana and Texas. During their last phone call, Jennifer said Abrego Garcia told her that he was going to be deported to El Salvador and imprisoned at CECOT.",
      "Jennifer said she couldn't believe it. She told her husband there was no reason for the U.S. to send him to a foreign prison. He said that if she didn't receive another call from him, it would be because he had been deported.",
      "\"He never called,\" Jennifer said. \"I waited and waited. He never made that call.\"",
      "Jennifer said she has not heard from her husband since that call and has not found a way to communicate with him. She's now suing the government as part of a lawsuit before the federal district court in Maryland that is demanding that the U.S. government take steps to bring Abrego Garcia back to the country.",
      "While it has conceded it mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia, the Trump administration has defended the merits of his deportation and has told the federal court in Maryland it opposes his return to the U.S.",
      "The Justice Department has argued\u00a0that federal courts lack the authority to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, since he's now being held by the Salvadoran government and no longer in U.S. custody. Even if they did have the power to order his return, the Justice Department said in a filing, there has been \"no showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States' request.\"",
      "Trump administration officials, including White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, have described Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 \"leader\" who is implicated in human trafficking. Officials have yet to disclose concrete evidence that supports those claims.",
      "Jennifer strongly refuted the White House's accusations, saying she would know if her husband was a gang member. Court documents indicate Abrego Garcia has traffic violations, but no criminal charges or convictions, in the U.S.",
      "\"He's not a criminal,\" Jennifer said. \"My husband is an amazing person. An amazing father.\"",

While not a researcher himself, he has taken a deep dive into scientific insights from experts and reflected on his own experiences.",
      "\"Longevity has always been a fascination for me,\" Savage told Fox News Digital\u00a0in an exclusive interview.\u00a0\"I mean, who doesn\u2019t want to know how to live better and maybe even longer? But the real question is what actually works?\"",

      "\"I had to admit I wasn\u2019t smoking for enjoyment,\" Savage said. \"I was just doing it out of habit. Once I realized that, it was easy to quit.\"",
      "Medtronic is investigating how science can extend our lives. Savage believes that lifestyle choices and community have been beneficial in his own life. (iStock)",

      "Beyond lifestyle choices, medical advancements are playing an increasingly critical role in extending both lifespan and \"healthspan,\" the years we live without serious disease.

The company\u2019s latest innovations include artificial intelligence-driven healthcare monitoring, robotic-assisted surgeries and advanced pacemakers, all aimed at improving long-term health outcomes. Savage also spoke about the psychological aspects of aging, emphasizing that mindset and community play a significant role in longevity.",

Today it seems more realistic, and I think it's entirely reasonable that, let's say, by 2040, we may all have a different cultural answer to that question.\"",

    "story": [
      "Health care took center stage during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 And in the five years since, the industry has experienced change and innovation.",
      "The field of medicine has undergone significant changes since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the biggest breakthrough right at our fingertips: telemedicine.\u00a0 While it may feel like a \"normal\" part of healthcare now, connected technology dominated how Americans saw doctors during the pandemic. \"Before the pandemic, virtual care was available, but it was not widely used. Now telemedicine is mainstream,\" says Dr. Michael Aziz, an Attending Physician at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital.",
      "According to one study, telemedicine encounters increased 766% in the first three months of the COVID outbreak. And while use of the 2-D technology has tapered off, Dr. Aziz, believes still plays a vital role in medical care, \"Especially for people in rural areas. Especially for young professionals. And it offers convenience. But we have so many barriers when it comes to telemedicine.... especially for senior citizens,\u2019 he explains, \"Also, the government has put some many roadblocks for patients to use that. One is the cost. There's a cost associated with that. It's not covered by many insurance.\"",
      "Experts say while telemedicine has been revolutionary, it's best suited for certain ailments, particularly psychiatric services.\u00a0 Dr. Chris Ivany, Psychiatrist and COO of Family Care Center, emphasizes, \"I think it's clear to say that the pandemic certainly had a immediate and negative effect on many Americans' mental health.\"",
      "A recent Gallup poll shows adults 18 to 49 reported a steep drop in their mental health since 2020, with many suffering from depression, anxiety, and isolation.\u00a0 This has led to an increase in Americans seeking help post-crisis.\u00a0 Dr. Ivany notes, \"The stigma to seeking mental health care is definitely decreased over the course of the past five or so years.... but also, in part to just a general recognition that mental health care is part of health care overall.\"\u00a0 Dr. Ivany points to two main reasons we're seeing a growth in mental health care, \"Part of what the pandemic has done is to raise the awareness of mental health issues, challenges across the American population in a way that really hadn't been done really in the past.... And I think the second is the field now is much more flexible in terms of how care can be delivered to people.\"",
      "Another challenge changing the landscape of the industry, a significant reduction in staffing. Dr. Aziz says, \"About 3000 healthcare professionals have died and about 100,000 have retired or changed career... Hospitals have a hard time not only hiring physicians and health care workers, but they have a hard time retaining them.\"",
      "While telemedicine has been a game changer, it\u2019s not the only major innovation to emerge from the pandemic. The production and rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, along with advancements in rapid testing and antigen tests, are also transformative innovations born out of the pandemic."

      "\"I\u2019m even more proud that VTA mobilized 360,000 voters to help overwhelmingly return President Trump to the White House because we know that after years of failed Democratic leadership, he is the champion our industry desperately needs,\" continued Abboud, who along with VTA, also attended the RNC Convention and moderated a fireside chat. \"The brazen attempts to distort our fight to save this industry are nothing more than coordinated attacks from competitors in the tobacco industry who are working with radical leftwingers like Letitia James and would stand to benefit financially from destroying American vape companies nationwide.\"",

      "What is doubleclickjacking?",
      "Doubleclickjacking is a new spin on an old hacking trick known as clickjacking. Normally, clickjacking works by hiding malicious buttons underneath real ones, so when you think you\u2019re clicking something harmless, you\u2019re actually giving permission for something dangerous. With doubleclickjacking, it takes things a step further. It\u2019s triggered when you double-click, allowing hackers to sneak in an extra, invisible command. Your first click might do something normal. The second click? That\u2019s where the damage happens.",

      "Click \"Allow\" on a hidden pop-up",
      "Share your location",
      "Approve a login, payment or even a crypto transaction",
      "What makes doubleclickjacking especially dangerous is that most websites weren\u2019t designed to defend against it. Traditional security features usually protect against a single click, but they often fail when a second click is involved. That small detail opens the door for attackers to bypass layers of protection.",
      "This trick doesn\u2019t just affect websites, either. It can also interfere with browser extensions like crypto wallets and VPNs, sometimes tricking users into approving actions or turning off protection without realizing it. On mobile devices, a simple double-tap can trigger the same effect. To make matters worse, this vulnerability is more widespread than you might expect. Many well-known websites haven\u2019t fixed it yet. All it takes is one quick double-click in the wrong place, and you could unknowingly give away access to sensitive parts of your device.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "How does doubleclickjacking work?",
      "Here\u2019s a simplified version of how the trick plays out. A malicious website quietly loads invisible elements behind or over visible ones, like an embedded frame, hidden button, or disguised pop-up. On your first click, the attacker uses that action to reposition those hidden elements so that your next click lands exactly where they want it. On your second click, you unknowingly interact with the hidden content. You might be clicking \"Allow\" on a browser permission, authorizing a login, or disabling a setting, without ever realizing it. Because modern browsers are lightning fast, this all happens in a split second. The entire setup and switch are virtually invisible to the user. From your perspective, it just feels like a normal double-click.",

      "Doubleclickjacking might be sneaky, but there are simple ways to keep yourself safer online. Here are some practical steps you can take right now:",
      "1. Be cautious about double-clicking on unfamiliar websites: It might sound obvious, but most of us click (and double-click) automatically. If a site prompts you to double-click anything, especially for a login, permission or download, ask yourself if it\u2019s really necessary. Hackers rely on you acting quickly without thinking.",
      "2. Keep your browser updated: Browsers like Chrome, Edge and Safari regularly release patches for these vulnerabilities. That means delaying updates could leave you exposed to tricks like doubleclickjacking. Turn on automatic updates if possible, or make sure to manually keep up with updates so you\u2019re always protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Browser-based tools and extensions can help block hidden or malicious scripts before they run, but they\u2019re not foolproof. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords for every account:\u00a0Don\u2019t reuse passwords. If one account gets compromised, hackers can use it to access your other accounts. A password manager helps you create and store strong passwords effortlessly. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Limit unnecessary permissions: Take control of your privacy by reviewing which websites have access to your camera, microphone, and location. Many sites request these permissions by default, even when they don\u2019t need them. Head into your browser\u2019s privacy settings and revoke access from any site you don\u2019t fully trust. For example, here's a guide on\u00a0how to navigate Google's privacy settings.",
      "6. Avoid sketchy sites and pop-ups: If a website looks outdated, spammy or aggressively pushes you to click something, get out of there. Avoid downloading random files, and don\u2019t trust pop-ups that claim you\u2019ve won something, need to \"fix\" your device or \"verify\" your login info.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Doubleclickjacking is a clever new spin on a classic hacking trick that allows cybercriminals to take control over your device or account, just from a simple double-click. Because this kind of attack is nearly invisible and works on popular browsers, it\u2019s important to stay alert. Always be cautious when interacting with unfamiliar websites, especially if you're being asked to double-click. Keeping your browser updated and limiting unnecessary permissions can go a long way in reducing your risk. Most importantly, having the right digital protection tools in place can help stop these types of threats before they ever reach you.",

      "Tom from Carol Stream, Illinois, reached out to us with this same problem: \"When I\u2019m out of town and my internet goes down, all of my \u2018internet of things\u2019 goes down too. Yes, I\u2019m supposed to turn off my router and turn it on again, but if I\u2019m not at home, is there anything I can do when I\u2019m out of town? Any help? It\u2019s very frustrating!\"",

      "How to reset your router remotely (the right way)",
      "Before we start, though, it's important to note that you will need administrator access to your router. Luckily, this is simple if it's your own home router. Unless you've changed the settings, your router uses the default username and password for its model, which you can find by a simple web search. However, leaving your router at default settings is a serious security risk. Make sure to change the default login and local IP address as soon as possible.",
      "If you're at home, you can use your local network IP (typically http://192.168.1.1) to log in to your router. This only works when your device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network. This is known as LAN (Local Area Network) access.",
      "If you're away from home (like at work or in a hotel), you won\u2019t be able to use 192.168.x.x to access your router. Instead, you\u2019d need to use your router\u2019s public IP address (also called WAN address). This requires setting up remote access in advance, usually by enabling remote management, Dynamic DNS or using a VPN. Be aware that this can open your network up to security vulnerabilities if not done carefully.",
      "Important: Allowing your router to be administered from the internet (WAN) is not recommended for most users due to the significant security risks. If you choose to do this, use strong, unique passwords, and consider VPN access instead.",
      "Use your ISP\u2019s app",
      "The safest and easiest method \u2014 if available \u2014 is to use your internet service provider\u2019s app. Most of the major ISPs in North America now allow you to reset your networking equipment remotely via a smartphone app, making it even easier to reset your router. This assumes you are using their router and not one you purchased for yourself. If you use a third-party router, you'll need to follow the steps above to reset it. Using an ISP app avoids opening your home network to the internet directly and usually includes built-in security protections.",

      "A smart plug lets you power cycle your router from anywhere by turning the plug off and on using a mobile app. This is a much safer option than enabling remote router access. It doesn't require exposing your router to the internet.",
      "Smart plugs come with smartphone apps that will allow you to set schedules and remotely turn and off and on plugs around your house, including the plug you plug your router into.",

For remote access, you'd need your router\u2019s public IP and advanced setup, which can be risky if not secured properly. The safest options are using your ISP\u2019s official app or a smart plug to power cycle the router remotely. If you do enable remote access, be sure to change default settings and use strong passwords to protect your network.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has more on the \"sophisticated penetration\" of several carriers on \"Special Report.\"",
      "If there\u2019s one thing that has become clear over the past year, it\u2019s that Apple devices are not as secure as the company wants you to believe.",
      "We\u2019re four months into 2025 and there have already been over 10 instances in which attackers specifically targeted Apple users, and these are just the incidents we know of.",
      "I\u2019ll admit no device is foolproof, but there seems to be a growing trend where bad actors prefer targeting Apple users over other platforms. In fact, security researchers have recently identified a new phishing campaign in which hackers, who previously focused on Windows, are now setting their sights on Apple IDs.",

      "A person working on an Apple laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0LayerX Labs have uncovered a new phishing campaign that specifically targets Mac users, marking a shift from its previous focus on Windows. The attackers initially lured Windows users with fake Microsoft security alerts designed to steal login credentials. However, after Microsoft, Chrome and Firefox implemented new security features to block these attacks, the hackers started redirecting their efforts toward Mac users instead.",
      "The new attack closely mirrors its predecessor but with key modifications. The phishing pages have been redesigned to resemble Apple\u2019s security warnings, making them appear legitimate to macOS users. The attack code has also been adjusted to specifically detect macOS and Safari users, ensuring that only Apple users see the fraudulent pages.",
      "Plus, despite shifting their focus, the attackers continue to host these phishing pages on Microsoft\u2019s Windows[.]net domain. Since this is a trusted Microsoft platform, it allows the phishing pages to evade detection by security tools that assess risk based on domain reputation.",

      "Instead of reaching the intended site, they land on a compromised domain parking page. From there, they are redirected through multiple websites before ultimately arriving at the phishing page, which presents a fake Apple security warning. Believing their Apple ID is at risk, victims are tricked into entering their credentials, unknowingly handing them over to the attackers.",

      "Phishing campaigns are increasingly targeting macOS users, but you\u2019re not defenseless. Here are four essential steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A reliable antivirus program is your first line of defense against phishing attempts and malicious websites. While Apple\u2019s built-in security features provide some protection, they aren\u2019t foolproof, especially against sophisticated phishing attacks that mimic legitimate Apple warnings. A robust antivirus solution can detect and block malicious sites before you even reach them, preventing you from accidentally entering your credentials on a fraudulent page. Additionally, advanced security software can identify suspicious redirects and alert you before you fall victim to typosquatting traps.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Keep your software up to date:\u00a0Regular\u00a0updates to macOS and your applications aren\u2019t just about new features. They\u2019re critical patches that fix security vulnerabilities. Attackers are quick to exploit any weakness, so ensuring your operating system and all installed software are current minimizes the risk of a breach. Enable automatic updates where possible so you\u2019re always protected by the latest security enhancements.",
      "3. Regularly monitor your Apple ID activity: Even with strong security measures in place, it\u2019s important to keep an eye on your Apple ID account for any signs of unauthorized access. Apple allows users to review their account activity, including devices logged into the account and recent changes. Regularly check your Apple ID settings to ensure that only trusted devices are connected and that no suspicious activity has occurred. If you notice anything unusual, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, immediately change your password and remove unauthorized devices. This proactive approach can help you catch potential breaches early and minimize damage.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Strong, unique passwords for every account are essential, but they\u2019re even more effective when combined with\u00a0two-factor authentication. Even if attackers manage to steal your credentials through a phishing attack,\u00a02FA adds an extra barrier that makes unauthorized access significantly harder. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use a recovery key for enhanced security: Apple offers an optional feature called a recovery key, which is a 28-character code that provides an extra layer of security for your Apple ID. When you enable a recovery key, Apple disables its standard account recovery process, meaning you\u2019ll need this key, along with access to a trusted device or phone number, to reset your password or regain access to your account. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to take control of your account.",
      "To set up a recovery key, go to\u00a0Settings > [Your Name] > Sign-in & Security > Recovery Key on your iPhone, iPad or Mac. Follow the prompts to generate and confirm your recovery key. Be sure to write it down and store it in a secure location, such as a safe or with a trusted family member. Keep in mind that losing both your recovery key and access to trusted devices can permanently lock you out of your account. However, if used responsibly, this feature gives you greater control over your account\u2019s security.",
      "6. Enable biometric authentication: Apple devices offer advanced\u00a0biometric authentication options like Face ID and Touch ID, which provide an extra layer of security. These features make it significantly harder for attackers to gain access to your device or sensitive accounts, even if they manage to steal your credentials. Enable biometric authentication wherever possible, especially for apps and services that store personal or financial information. Since biometric data is unique to you, it adds a level of protection that passwords alone cannot provide.",
      "7. Practice safe browsing:\u00a0Many attacks rely on simple user mistakes, such as mistyping a URL or clicking on suspicious links. Always verify that you\u2019re visiting legitimate websites before entering any personal information. Be skeptical of unexpected security alerts, even if they mimic Apple\u2019s design. Learning to identify the subtle signs of phishing, like unusual URL structures or generic greetings, can help you avoid falling for these scams.",
      "HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Apple has long sold the idea that its ecosystem is inherently safer than the alternatives, but that claim is starting to wear thin. The reality is that attackers are no longer ignoring Mac users, they\u2019re actively targeting them, and Apple\u2019s response has been anything but proactive. While Microsoft, Google and others roll out new security measures to counter evolving threats, Apple remains slow to adapt, relying on outdated assumptions about its platform\u2019s safety.",

However, no proof is provided, and investigations have found no signs of actual ransomware intrusions in affected organizations.

      "1. Install strong antivirus software and regularly update software:\u00a0The first line of defense against ransomware is ensuring that your systems are equipped with the latest security tools. Keep all software and devices\u00a0up to date to avoid vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. Install firewalls,\u00a0strong antivirus software and intrusion detection systems to block malicious activities before they can cause harm. Regularly patch operating systems and applications to stay ahead of cybercriminals. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Implement strong password policies and use a password manager: Ensure all passwords are unique, at least 15 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Also, consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely. This reduces the risk of password reuse and weak passwords, which are common entry points for ransomware attacks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "3. Educate and train employees on cybersecurity awareness:\u00a0Many ransomware attacks start with phishing emails or social engineering tactics. As seen in the scam targeting executives, attackers often use fear-based tactics to manipulate victims into acting quickly. Train your employees, particularly high-level executives, to recognize suspicious emails, fraudulent requests and phishing attempts.",
      "4. Backup data and maintain a secure recovery plan:\u00a0Data backups are a critical safeguard against ransomware. Regularly back up critical data to secure, offline locations that ransomware cannot access. Testing your recovery plans frequently ensures that if an attack does occur, you can recover quickly with minimal impact on operations. In addition, consider using a cloud service with encryption to ensure that even if an attack happens, the backup remains safe.",
      "5.\u00a0Utilize two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Two-factor authentication is an essential security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to sensitive systems and data. With 2FA, even if attackers manage to obtain login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access critical systems without the second factor of authentication, whether it\u2019s a code sent to a phone or biometric verification.",
      "6. Verify threats before taking action:\u00a0If you receive a ransom demand (digital or physical), investigate its legitimacy. Scams often lack proof of data breaches or network compromise. Consult cybersecurity experts or law enforcement before responding.",
      "7. Report suspicious activity: Notify law enforcement or organizations like the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center if you encounter scams or ransomware threats. Reporting helps authorities track and mitigate these activities.",
      "FBI WARNS OF DANGEROUS NEW \u2018SMISHING\u2019 SCAM TARGETING YOUR PHONE",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Healthcare is seriously lagging when it comes to cybersecurity. It's crazy that so many health institutions don\u2019t have a CISO or a dedicated security team. Instead, the IT department, which isn\u2019t always trained in cybersecurity, gets stuck trying to handle it all. With so much sensitive data at risk, it\u2019s shocking that so many healthcare organizations still treat cybersecurity as an afterthought.",
      "Cyberattacks are only going to get worse, and unless the industry steps up its game, it\u2019s just a matter of time before more hospitals, clinics and health systems get hit. It\u2019s time to take security seriously.",

      "Google Chrome is the most popular browser in the world, and it is used by billions of people. However, its widespread usage also makes it a prime target for bad actors who exploit various methods, such as malicious extensions, phishing links and fake websites. The latest attack involves hackers exploiting a browser vulnerability to conduct espionage. Google has acknowledged the security flaw and has released an update to fix it.",

      "About the attack",
      "Cybersecurity researchers at Kaspersky recently discovered a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in Google Chrome. The attack was triggered when victims unknowingly clicked on a phishing link in an email, launching a malicious site in their browser. Shockingly, no further action was required. Simply opening the link was enough to infect the system.",
      "According to\u00a0Kaspersky\u2019s report, the malware was based on a zero-day vulnerability, later identified as CVE-2025-2783. Researchers say they analyzed the exploit, reverse-engineered its logic and uncovered that it allowed attackers to bypass Chrome\u2019s built-in security features as if they didn\u2019t exist.",
      "The vulnerability exploited Chrome's inter-process communication framework, known as Mojo, which is crucial for the browser's functionality. This allowed the attackers to execute malicious code across different processes within Chrome, effectively bypassing its security measures.",
      "\"We have discovered and reported dozens of zero-day exploits actively used in attacks, but this particular exploit is certainly one of the most interesting we\u2019ve encountered,\" Kaspersky noted.",

      "3 additional ways to protect your privacy",
      "While updating Chrome should fix the vulnerability, below are some security tips you can follow to further bolster your privacy and security.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers often gain access to devices by sending infected emails or documents or by tricking you into clicking a link that downloads malware. You can avoid all of this by installing strong antivirus software that will detect any potential threat before it can take over your device.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Many online accounts, including Google, offer two-factor authentication as an extra security measure.\u00a0Enabling 2FA ensures that even if a hacker obtains your password, they still need a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, to access your account. This simple step significantly reduces the chances of unauthorized access.",
      "3) Use a secure password manager:\u00a0A strong password is crucial, but remembering multiple complex passwords can be difficult. A password manager generates, stores and autofills strong passwords for your accounts, reducing the risk of password-related breaches. Avoid using the same password across different sites and always opt for long, unique passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This incident serves as yet another reminder that even the most secure systems are never truly invulnerable, especially when state-backed or highly skilled actors are in play. While Google\u2019s quick response is commendable, it also highlights the never-ending cat-and-mouse game between security teams and cybercriminals. If you are using Chrome, update it now.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Phishing attacks are everywhere, and most of us can spot the obvious ones. Even if someone falls for one and hands over their password, two-factor authentication (2FA) usually adds a crucial layer of protection. But a new phishing kit making the rounds can bypass 2FA entirely by using session hijacking and real-time credential interception.",
      "Known as Astaroth, this tool intercepts and manipulates traffic between your device and legitimate authentication services like Gmail, Yahoo and Microsoft. Since it grabs everything in real time, it completely bypasses 2FA and gives attackers full access to your account.",
      "Stay protected & informed! Get security alerts & expert tech tips \u2013 sign up for Kurt\u2019s The CyberGuy Report now.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Astaroth works",
      "Astaroth is a next-level phishing kit that takes scamming to a whole new level. Instead of using basic fake login pages like traditional phishing kits, it works as a middleman between your device and the real authentication service while silently grabbing everything needed to break in.",
      "The attack begins when you click on a phishing link and land on a malicious site that looks identical to the real one. Since the site has valid SSL certificates, there are no red flags, no security warnings and no sketchy pop-ups. When you enter your login details, including username, password, device info and IP address, Astaroth snatches them up before passing the request to the actual website.",
      "Two-factor authentication is not a problem for Astaroth. It intercepts one-time passwords the second they are entered, whether they come from an authenticator app, SMS or a push notification. The stolen codes are instantly sent to the attacker through a web panel or Telegram alert, so they can use them before they expire.",
      "The real kicker is that Astaroth also grabs session cookies, which are the small bits of data that keep users logged in after authentication. Attackers can inject these cookies into their own browsers, skipping the need for passwords or two-factor authentication altogether. Once they have the session, they are in with no extra steps required.",
      "An example of what the victim and attacker would see (SlashNext) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR MAC, PC, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS - CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Astaroth is shockingly advanced",
      "As reported by cybersecurity company\u00a0SlashNext, Astaroth stands out from other phishing kits because of its ability to intercept credentials in real time, automate attacks and resist takedown efforts. Traditional phishing depends on tricking victims into entering their credentials on fake login pages, but Astaroth removes that step entirely.",
      "Beyond its advanced capabilities, Astaroth comes with features that make it appealing to cybercriminals. It uses bulletproof hosting to stay online despite law enforcement efforts, receives frequent updates to bypass security patches and follows a structured payment model. For $2,000, buyers get six months of continuous upgrades. To build trust, the creators even let hackers test the phishing kit before purchasing.",
      "Astaroth is widely available through Telegram and underground cybercrime forums. The anonymity of these platforms makes it difficult for authorities to track distribution.",

      "4 ways to stay safe from Astaroth phishing attacks",
      "1) Avoid unknown links and use strong antivirus software: Remember that no matter how advanced the malware is, it still needs input from you. In most cases, an attacker will require you to click a link before they can steal your data. For example, for Astaroth to work, you have to click a link, visit a malicious website and enter your credentials. If you don\u2019t click the link, you stay clear of the malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS device.",
      "2) Double-check sites:\u00a0Always verify website addresses and use bookmarks for trusted sites. Instead of clicking on links in emails or messages, manually type the URL or use a trusted bookmark. This minimizes the risk of landing on a fraudulent page designed to mimic a legitimate website.",
      "3) Update your devices:\u00a0You might wonder how keeping your devices updated helps against malware like Astaroth. While it doesn\u2019t directly prevent an attack, it ensures the situation doesn\u2019t get worse.\u00a0Keeping your operating system and applications up to date with the latest security patches closes vulnerabilities that malware might exploit, making it harder for attackers to gain a foothold on your device.",
      "4) Avoid typing passwords:\u00a0Avoid entering passwords whenever possible to reduce the risk of credential theft. Instead, use authentication methods like passkeys, Google Sign-In or Apple Sign-In.",
      "A passkey is a feature that uses cryptographic key pairs to verify your identity, eliminating the need for traditional passwords. It allows you to sign in to apps and websites using the same process you use to unlock your device, such as biometrics, PIN or pattern.",
      "Google Sign-In is a feature that allows you to log in to third-party apps or websites using their Google Account credentials. It simplifies the sign-in process by eliminating the need to create and remember separate usernames and passwords for each service. You can sign in via a \"Sign in with Google\" button, a Google sign-in prompt or automatic sign-in if previously authorized.",
      "Apple Sign-In is a feature that enables you to privately sign in to participating third-party apps and websites using your Apple ID. It offers a fast, easy and more private way to authenticate without the need to create new accounts or remember additional passwords. To set up an account to \"Sign in with Apple,\" when a participating website or app asks you to set up or upgrade an account, do the following: Tap Sign in with Apple. Follow the onscreen instructions. Some apps (and websites) don\u2019t request your name and email address. In this case, you simply authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID (depending on your model), then start using the app.\u00a0Others may ask for your name and email address to set up a personalized account. When an app asks for this information, Sign in with Apple displays your name and the personal email address from your Apple Account for you to review.",
      "These methods rely on cryptographic keys or secure tokens, making it much harder for attackers to intercept your login information, even if they manage to trick you into visiting a malicious site.",
      "FBI WARNS OF DANGEROUS NEW \u2018SMISHING\u2019 SCAM TARGETING YOUR PHONE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Astaroth shows just how far phishing kits have come, taking things beyond the usual tricks and bypassing 2FA with ease. It\u2019s a reminder that no matter how secure we think our systems are, there\u2019s always a smarter attack waiting to exploit the gaps. Cybercriminals are adapting fast, and while traditional defenses may not cut it anymore, there are still steps you can take to fight back: use passwordless logins, stay updated and keep learning about these evolving threats.",

      "Imagine skipping the gridlock and soaring over the English countryside, arriving at your destination in a fraction of the time. What sounds like a scene from a futuristic movie is about to become a reality in the U.K., thanks to a partnership between Joby Aviation, a California-based company, and Virgin Atlantic. They're teaming up to introduce electric air taxis to the U.K., revolutionizing how people travel between airports and nearby cities. Let's take a closer look at this development that could foreshadow the future of transportation here in the U.S.",

      "Electric air taxi (Joby Aviation) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Joby's electric air taxi: A game changer for short flights",
      "Joby Aviation's innovative aircraft are at the heart of this transportation revolution. This electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft is designed for quick, efficient travel. The air taxi comfortably seats five, including the pilot, making it perfect for small groups or business travelers. It can reach impressive speeds of up to 200 mph, significantly reducing travel times. The aircraft features a range of 100 emissions-free miles on a single charge, which is a huge win for sustainability. Another key feature is its quiet operation, especially during takeoff and landing, making it much less disruptive than traditional helicopters.",

      "Virgin Atlantic joins the party",
      "Virgin Atlantic's involvement isn't just about adding its name to the project; it's a strategic move to enhance the entire customer experience. The airline will play a vital role in marketing the service to its customers, making it a seamless addition to their travel plans. Virgin Atlantic will also work closely with U.K. regulators to ensure the service meets all necessary safety standards. Furthermore, the airline will assist in developing the infrastructure needed for these air taxis to operate efficiently at major airports.",

      "If this takes off as planned, it could change the way people travel in the U.K., offering a glimpse of what might be possible stateside. Imagine drastically reducing travel times between airports and city centers, potentially saving hours on your journey. Booking a ride will be easy, likely through Virgin Atlantic's app and website, integrating air taxi travel into existing travel arrangements. While the initial pricing is expected to be comparable to premium ground ridesharing options, the time saved could be well worth the cost.",

Joby needs to obtain validation from the UK Civil Aviation Authority, ensuring the aircraft meets the highest safety standards. A network of convenient landing locations needs to be established in major cities to make the service truly accessible. The exact launch date for the U.K. service is still under wraps, but the anticipation is definitely building.",

      "Hamas has revised its casualty figures from the Gaza war, removing hundreds of names from its official list of war fatalities, and revealing that 72% of those killed were men aged 13 to 55 \u2013 a demographic largely composed of combatants. The updated figures contradict Hamas' earlier claims that most casualties were women and children.",
      "Salo Aizenberg, from the U.S.-based nonprofit HonestReporting, uncovered the changes through a detailed analysis of Hamas\u2019 casualty lists. The investigation revealed that 3,400 names, including over 1,080 children, were removed from the group\u2019s March 2025 report after being listed in 2024.",
      "Aizenberg pointed out that the original reports, published by the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health, were widely cited by major international organizations, including the United Nations and the International Criminal Court (ICC). \"These \u2018deaths\u2019 never happened.

This approach is essential to protect the integrity of investigations, and to ensure the safety and security of victims, witnesses, and all those with whom the Office interacts.\"",
      "David Adesnik, vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who has also been tracking the figures, reached a similar conclusion. According to his analysis, 72% of the fatalities fall within the male combat-age bracket of 13 to 55.",
      "\"Even at age 13, there's a major excess of male over female deaths, and the disparity grows with age,\" Adesnik told Fox News Digital. \"If you calculate from age 13 to 59, there\u2019s a little more than 15,000 excess men. That gives you an idea of how many are actually fighters.\"",

This trend continues throughout the age spectrum, suggesting a disproportionately high number of male combatant deaths.",
      "Adesnik also highlighted issues with how deaths were recorded. \"Significant numbers of names disappear from the list over time. It\u2019s like 2,000 names are removed and new ones added,\" he said.",
      "REPORT EXPOSES HAMAS TERRORIST CRIMES AGAINST FAMILIES DURING OCT 7 MASSACRE: 'KINOCIDE'",
      "He explained that Hamas maintains two lists: one for deaths confirmed by hospitals, and another for deaths reported by family members via an online form \u2013 often in cases where bodies couldn\u2019t be retrieved. \"Over time, officials realized many of these family-reported names were inaccurate or unverified, and started quietly removing them from the count \u2013 replacing one set of data with another to cover up their original manipulation,\" Adesnik said.",
      "The head of the statistics team at\u00a0Gaza\u2019s health ministry, Zaher Al Wahidi, told Sky News that names submitted via the form had been removed as a precautionary measure pending a judicial investigation into each one. \"We realized that a lot of people [submitted via the form] died a natural death,\" Wahidi said. Some families submitting false claims, Wahidi said, may have been motivated by the promise of government financial assistance.",
      "Adesnik referenced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s previous comments about Gaza war casualties. \"He said 30,000 dead \u2013 14,000 fighters, 16,000 civilians \u2013 while Hamas claimed 70% were women and children. This data gives us a clearer picture of the demographic breakdown and supports the IDF's claim that it is targeting combatants,\" he said.",
      "IDF forces are seen operating in Rafah, a city in the Gaza Strip. (IDF Spokesman's Office)",
      "The broader debate over casualty accuracy intensified after an Israeli strike on March 23 killed 15 humanitarian workers, including a paramedic, according to the United Nations and the Palestinian Red Crescent. The incident sparked outrage. However, the Israeli military stated that \"the aid workers were mistakenly identified as terrorists\".",

      "\"The IDF and ISA will continue to target and dismantle Hamas' infrastructure to mitigate the threat it poses to Israeli civilians,\" the military said.

      "Muslim groups and opposition parties have expressed concerns that the bill is politically motivated, and could marginalize Muslims by altering ownership rules and requiring waqf boards to validate property claims.",
      "India's parliament passed a controversial bill moved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist government to amend laws governing Muslim land endowments, while Muslim groups and opposition parties protested the move.",
      "The bill would add non-Muslims to boards that manage waqf land endowments and give the government a larger role in validating their land holdings. The government says the changes will help to fight corruption and mismanagement while promoting diversity, but critics fear that it will further undermine the rights of the country\u2019s Muslim minority and could be used to confiscate historic mosques and other property.",
      "The debate was heated in both houses of parliament. The Lower House debated it Wednesday through early Thursday, while in the Upper House, the fiery discussion lasted more than 16 hours into early Friday.",
      "The Congress-led opposition firmly opposed the proposal, calling it unconstitutional and discriminatory against Muslims. Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party lacks a majority in the Lower House, but its allies helped to pass the bill.",
      "MUSLIMS IN INDIA VOICE CONCERNS THAT NEW CITIZENSHIP LAW COULD FURTHER MARGINALIZE THEM",
      "In the Lower House, 288 members voted for the bill while 232 were against it. Similarly, 128 favored it and 95 voted against it in the Upper House. The bill will now be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent to become law.",

      "Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju introduced the bill to change a 1995 law that set rules for the foundations and set up state-level boards to administer them.",
      "Many Muslim groups, as well as the opposition parties, say the proposal is discriminatory, politically motivated and an attempt by Modi\u2019s ruling party to weaken minority rights.",
      "The bill was first introduced in parliament last year, and opposition leaders have said some of their subsequent proposals for it were ignored. The government has said opposition parties are using rumors to discredit them and block transparency in managing the endowments.",
      "What\u2019s a waqf?",
      "Waqfs are a traditional type of Islamic charitable foundation in which a donor permanently sets aside property \u2014 often but not always real estate \u2014 for religious or charitable purposes. Waqf properties cannot be sold or transferred.",
      "Waqfs in India control 872,000 properties that cover 405,000 hectares (1 million acres) of land, worth an estimated $14.22 billion. Some of these endowments date back centuries, and many are used for mosques, seminaries, graveyards and orphanages.",
      "Law would change who runs waqfs",
      "In India, waqf property is managed by semi-official boards, one for each state and federally run union territory. The law would require non-Muslims to be appointed to the boards.",
      "Currently, waqf boards are staffed by Muslims, like similar bodies that help administer other religious charities.",
      "During the parliamentary debate, Home Minister Amit Shah said non-Muslims would be included in waqf boards only for administration purposes and to help run the endowments smoothly. He added that they were not there to interfere in religious affairs.",
      "\"The (non-Muslim) members will monitor whether the administration is running as per law or not, and whether the donations are being used for what they were intended or not,\" he said.",
      "Muslim groups, like The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said such comments were against the fundamentals of Islamic endowments as such bodies necessarily need to be governed by Muslims only. The board said the bill was \"a blatant infringement on the constitutional rights of Muslim citizens\" and called on citizens to hit the streets against it.",
      "Mallikarjun Kharge, the Congress president, said, \"Why should waqf bodies allow non-Muslims as members when Hindu temple trusts don\u2019t allow people of other religions in their fold?\"",
      "One of the most controversial changes is to ownership rules, which could impact historical mosques, shrines, and graveyards, since many such properties lack formal documentation as they were donated without legal records decades, and even centuries, ago.",
      "Questions about title",
      "Other changes could impact mosques on land held in centuries-old waqfs.",
      "Radical Hindu groups have laid claim to several mosques around India, arguing they are built on the ruins of important Hindu temples. Many such cases are pending in courts.",
      "The law would require waqf boards to seek approval from a district level officer to confirm the waqfs\u2019 claims to property.",
      "Critics say that would undermine the board and could lead to Muslims being stripped of their land. It\u2019s not clear how often the boards would be asked to confirm such claims to land.",
      "\"The Waqf (Amendment) Bill is a weapon aimed at marginalizing Muslims and usurping their personal laws and property rights,\" Rahul Gandhi, the main opposition leader, wrote on social media platform X. He said the bill was an \"attack on the Constitution\" by the BJP and its allies \"aimed at Muslims today but sets a precedent to target other communities in the future.\"",
      "INDIA\u2019S RELIGIOUS DIVIDE CONTINUES TO WIDEN BETWEEN MUSLIM, HINDU COMMUNITY",
      "Fears among Muslims",
      "While many Muslims agree that waqfs suffer from corruption, encroachments and poor management, they also fear that the new law could give India\u2019s Hindu nationalist government far greater control over Muslim property, particularly at a time when attacks against minority communities have become more aggressive under Modi, with Muslims often targeted for everything from their food and clothing styles to inter-religious marriages.",
      "Last month, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said in its annual report that religious freedom conditions in India continued to deteriorate while Modi and his party \"propagated hateful rhetoric and disinformation against Muslims and other religious minorities\" during last year\u2019s election campaign.",
      "Modi\u2019s government says India is run on democratic principles of equality and no discrimination exists in the country.",
      "Muslims, who are 14% of India\u2019s 1.4 billion population, are the largest minority group in the Hindu-majority nation, but they are also the poorest, a 2013 government survey found.",

      "Ali Larijani, an advisor to the supreme leader, said in an interview that although Iran does not seek a nuclear weapon, Tehran will have no choice but to build a nuclear weapon if the U.S. or Israel strike Iran.",
      "The International Atomic Energy Agency reported in February that Iran has accelerated its nuclear program and has enriched uranium close to weapons-grade levels.",
      "Danielle Pletka, senior fellow in Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), told Fox News Digital that having additional military assets in the Middle East is sound policy given the threats that the U.S. and its allies face in the region.",
      "For Pletka, the question is, what is the Trump administration looking for?",
      "\"A deal in which the Iranians do not fully get rid of their nuclear weapons program? If so, the president sets the United States up for the risk that Barack Obama inflicted on our allies and ourselves \u2013 merely delaying the Iranian nuclear program to a later date,\" Pletka told Fox News Digital.",

      "Pletka said it is strange that President Trump seems to envision a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)-like deal, and that has prompted a lot of criticism on Capitol Hill.",
      "Trump originally withdrew from JCPOA, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, during his first term in 2018 and reapplied harsh economic sanctions. The Biden administration had initially looked at re-engaging with Iran on the nuclear issue upon taking office, but on-again-off-again talks went nowhere, complicated by Iran\u2019s domestic politics and its role in supporting its terror groups in the region.",
      "The other risk that the president runs, according to AEI\u2019s Pletka, is being perceived as a paper tiger.",
      "\"He threatened Hamas with bombing that he never delivered. Now he\u2019s threatening Iran with military action. But does he really mean it? Or is he just blowing hot air?\" she said.",

      "Pletka said, \"There is an enormous amount of uncertainty around the president\u2019s intentions, and that uncertainty is an opportunity for the Iranians to exploit.\"",
      "The Middle East Institute\u2019s Vatanka said he believed that Trump could claim a potential win he can sell at home and say he got a better deal than President Obama did with the JCPOA, if Iran were to agree to permanently keep its enrichment level to a low level, unlike the expiration dates included in the JCPOA."

      "Judges showed some frustration this week with how the Trump administration has been defending itself in court, with one saying it appeared to have used \"bad faith\" tactics, another accusing it of using \"disingenuous\" arguments and a third saying it was making \"inaccurate\" claims.",
      "One of the judges, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, suggested he might hold contempt proceedings to hold the government to account for failing to comply with his orders.",
      "In a separate but related case, a federal judge in Maryland on Friday ordered the government to return a deportee it acknowledged was accidentally sent to a\u00a0notorious megajail\u00a0in El Salvador.",
      "The week ended with a major win for the administration, when the Supreme Court allowed it to terminate\u00a0Education Department grants that a lower court had restored. It was the first time during President Donald Trump's second administration that the Supreme Court sided with him.",
      "Here's a look at some of the biggest legal developments of the week:",
      "'The government acted in bad faith'",
      "At a hearing Thursday, Boasberg demanded detailed answers about the administration's failure to comply with his order halting deportations under Trump's invocation of the rarely used Alien Enemies Act.",
      "He didn't get them.",
      "After Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Immigration Drew Ensign told him \"it is our position that the actions of the government complied\" with his two restraining orders barring alleged Venezuelan gang members from being flown out of the country on March 15, the judge let his frustration show.",
      "\"OK. So it seems to me that there is a fair likelihood that that is not correct, and in fact, that the government acted in bad faith throughout that day,\" Boasberg said.",
      "\"If you really believed everything you did that day was legal and could survive a court challenge, I can't believe you ever would have operated in the way you did,\" he added.",
      "He also referenced the deportation of a Maryland man who the administration acknowledged was mistakenly sent to El Salvador.",
      "\"So what you were willing to do by trying to do this as quickly as possible and avoid being enjoined by the court was to risk putting people on those planes who shouldn\u2019t have been on the planes in the first place,\" Boasberg said later in the hearing.",
      "The judge noted that Trump had signed the AEA on Friday, March 14, but didn't make it public until Saturday afternoon, when preparations to ship the deportees to a prison in El Salvador were already underway.",
      "He suggested the timing was intentional, so the deportees could be \"removed from the country before it was possible to challenge it legally.\"",
      "Ensign said, \"I don't have any information on that.\"",
      "The lawyers for the plaintiffs, who all deny that they're members of the gang, got wind of the executive order on March 14 and filed suit overnight to block the deportations. Boasberg ordered an emergency hearing for that Saturday afternoon.",
      "During that hearing, the judge ordered any deportations under the AEA to be temporarily halted, and directed that any flights that were underway be returned to the U.S. Ensign said at the time he was not aware of any, a position he reiterated Thursday.",
      "\u201cI had no knowledge from my client that was the case,\u201d Ensign said, and \u201cI made diligent efforts to obtain that information\u201d from the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department.",
      "It was later revealed that two such flights were in the air at the time. The government has refused to release details on the exact timing, labeling it a \"state secret.\" The Justice Department lawyers claimed the flights were out of U.S. airspace at the time, and therefore didn't have to return.",
      "Boasberg pressed Ensign on who made the decision not to turn the planes around. \"I don't know that,\" Ensign replied.",
      "\"I'm certainly interested in finding that out because as we proceed with potential contempt proceedings, that may become relevant,\" the judge said.",
      "He said he'll likely issue an order on whether there's\u00a0probable cause to find the government in contempt next week.",
      "At an unrelated news conference Friday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi was asked if she \"was involved in the decision to defy\" Boasberg's order.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think anyone defied an order by a judge. That\u2019s pending in court right now,\" she said.",
      "On Tuesday, the parties will be back before Boasberg for arguments on the heart of the issue in the case \u2014 whether the Trump administration should be enjoined indefinitely from deporting alleged Tren de Aragua members under the AEA.",
      "The administration has already appealed his current restraining order to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging it infringes on the president's powers.",
      "Judge rules in favor of Maryland man deported to El Salvador",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis on Friday ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is a legal resident of Maryland, to be returned to the U.S. by Monday after a Justice Department lawyer acknowledged he should not have been sent to El Salvador.",
      "An immigration judge had specifically barred Garcia, who the government alleges is an MS-13 gang member, from being sent to El Salvador back in 2019, finding it \"more likely than not that he would be persecuted\" there.",
      "Xinis asked Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni why the administration couldn't ask El Salvador to return Garcia. Reuveni said he'd asked his client the same thing, and, \u201cI have not yet received an answer that I find satisfactory.\u201d",
      "Reuveni also said he did not know why Garcia had been arrested, how it was determined he would be sent to El Salvador or any details about the administration's deal with the prison there.",
      "\u201cThe government made a choice here to produce no evidence,\u201d he said.",
      "'Disingenuous' arguments in a California case",
      "A federal judge in California on Monday issued an order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from ending\u00a0Temporary Protected Status\u00a0for over 350,000 Venezuelan nationals.",
      "U.S. District Judge Edward Chen said the plaintiffs in the case are likely to succeed with their claims that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's \"unprecedented\" decision to bring an early end to their TPS protections \u2014 which allow them to live and work in the U.S. \u2014 is \"unauthorized by law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus.\"",
      "Noem had directed the TPS protections, which had been scheduled to expire late next year, to be terminated on April 7.",
      "The administration is appealing Chen's decision and separately asked him to stay his own ruling, arguing in part that ending the protections doesn't mean they'll be deported.",
      "\"[T]hat is a disingenuous argument,\" Chen wrote Friday, rejecting the administration's request for a stay.",
      "He noted that during an interview where she announced the decision, Noem said the \u201cpeople of this country want these dirtbags out.\u201d",
      "He said the \"entire point\" of Noem's early termination decision \"was to enable the removal of Venezuelan TPS holders on a schedule well in advance of the schedule set\" by her predecessor, Alejandro Mayorkas.",
      "\"Nor has the government stated that, if the Court were to stay its postponement order, it will not immediately move forward with the removal of any Venezuelan TPS holder,\" Chen added.",
      "He pointed to the administration's acknowledgement in the AEA case that one of the deportees shouldn't have been removed as another reason not to pause his ruling.",
      "The \"government mistakenly deported an individual, who has legal status to be in the United States, to El Salvador but has essentially taken the position that it cannot do anything to address that mistake,\" the judge wrote, showing any removal in his case\u00a0\"likely could not be 'undone' should Plaintiffs ultimately prevail.\"",
      "'Inaccurate' claims",
      "The Justice Department also sought a stay from a federal judge in Washington, D.C., asking her to pause her preliminary injunction barring the administration from shuttering the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson's March 28 decision granting the injunction included some harsh words for the administration, finding its claims it wasn't trying to close the agency \"unreliable.\"",
      "The government's \"eleventh hour attempt to suggest immediately before the hearing that the stop work order was not really a stop work order at all was so disingenuous that the Court is left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything,\" Jackson wrote then.",
      "She was similarly unimpressed Thursday with its arguments for a stay of her order.",
      "\"[T]heir description of the Order is at odds with the terms of the Order, and their description of the ruling that prompted it is inaccurate as well,\" she wrote, denying the request.",
      "That same day, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the government a partial temporary stay of the order.",
      "\"The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,\" the ruling said.",
      "Supreme victory",
      "The Supreme Court gave the administration some relief late Friday by allowing it to terminate education grants for teacher training that administration officials view as violating Trump's policy opposing\u00a0diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0efforts.",
      "The 5-4 decision blocked a Massachusetts-based judge\u2019s ruling that found the administration hadn't followed the correct legal process in terminating the grants.",
      "The appeal was one of three the administration submitted to the high court with last week, including the Alien Enemies Act case."

    "summary": "While manufacturers of FDA-approved injectable pentobarbital are warning states not to use the sedative in executions, some states are still buying it \u2014 and paying top dollar.",
    "story": [
      "A discreet delivery pulled up outside of Idaho\u2019s maximum-security prison near Boise in the state\u2019s exhaustive quest for lethal injection drugs 1 1\u20442 years ago. Just outside of the prison gates, the warden said he met two people transporting pentobarbital \u2014 six vials of the liquid placed into cardboard boxes in the back seat of their car.",
      "Then, four months later, the warden arranged another pickup, meeting two people parked on a rural intersection at Pleasant Valley and Ten Mile Creek roads, about a mile from the Idaho Maximum Security Institution.",
      "The warden, Tim Richardson, would recall in a deposition in October that he chose to take the second transaction \u201coff site\u201d so as \u201cto not draw attention to it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so you cannot have, I guess, a visual on what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he said, according to a transcript.",
      "The details of the deal, revealed for the first time in court documents related to litigation in the cases of two death row inmates, Thomas Creech and Gerald Pizzuto, shed light on how Idaho procured its batches of lethal injection drugs while attempting to maintain confidentiality.",
      "Creech, 74, who was convicted of five murders in three states, was set to die by lethal injection in February 2024, but it was called off after prison staff failed to properly attach IV lines after 42 minutes. The botched execution has prompted a legal dispute to prevent the state from attempting it again.",
      "Pizzuto, 69, convicted of four murders in two states, faced execution in March 2023, but a federal judge halted it. Pizzuto is challenging the state\u2019s use of pentobarbital because of his medical condition, which Pizzuto\u2019s legal team says includes advanced bladder cancer.",
      "In court documents reviewed by NBC News, just as notable is what Richardson, now a warden at a different Idaho prison facility, was ordered by lawyers representing the state Department of Correction not to answer \u2014 including the identities of those who provided the drugs, if they were the same people each time and the type of vehicles they used.",
      "A 2022 Idaho law shields the identities of the state\u2019s execution team and the suppliers of lethal injection drugs. Correction officials say such secrecy makes it easier to obtain pentobarbital, given how the state has been unable to execute anyone since 2012 amid a nationwide shortage of lethal injection drugs. Idaho in 2023 also legalized execution by firing squad when it cannot obtain drugs.",
      "Meanwhile, major pharmaceutical companies have explicitly warned states not to use their drugs for executions, citing ethical and legal concerns. Pharmaceutical distributors may buy drugs from the companies, and they could in turn be sold to hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and other legitimate customers.",
      "But when it comes to supplying prisons that may want to use a manufactured drug for executions, drug companies have sued states for the return of their chemicals.",
      "\u201cWhat we know at this point is that every single drug manufacturer of any drug that could be potentially used for lethal injection, including pentobarbital, has not only objected to its use, but put contractual restrictions on their sales,\u201d said Corinna Barrett Lain, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law who studies lethal injection executions. \u201cThey have every right to do so as a private company that stands to lose a great deal of money if their drugs are used in lethal injection. They are risking the possibility of botched executions with their drugs, leading them to potential financial and legal damages. It\u2019s terrible for business.\u201d",
      "The Idaho Department of Correction did not immediately respond to a request for comment about where its most recent pentobarbital purchases came from. The state attorney general\u2019s office declined to comment this week, citing the pending litigation.",
      "Like other states, Idaho has turned to so-called compounding pharmacies for its lethal injection drugs, doing so for executions in 2011 and 2012. But the alternative has drawn concerns over quality and safety as compounded drugs are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "In the court filings, Idaho correction officials have suggested the pentobarbital procured by the state in 2023 and 2024 was not compounded but manufactured by an FDA-approved pharmaceutical company.",
      "\u201cMy belief is that they probably were\u201d manufactured, Richardson said in his deposition about the October 2023 delivery he received, adding, \u201cThey were in, like, an original-type manufacturer\u2019s box.\u201d",
      "He agreed that the second delivery he acquired during a roadside meeting in February 2024 was the same.",
      "In another court filing in October, the Idaho Maximum Security Institution\u2019s current warden, Randy Valley, described the state\u2019s supply of pentobarbital as having been sourced from \u201can FDA-approved manufacturer,\u201d and revealed the state received a new batch of \u201csix additional 2.5-gram vials of certified manufactured pentobarbital\u201d that same month.",
      "Court documents indicate the state has spent $200,000 in total for three separate purchases of pentobarbital, supplies that all expired after going unused in the wake of Creech\u2019s failed execution.",
      "In exhibits filed in Pizzuto\u2019s case, two pharmaceutical companies that manufacture injectable pentobarbital \u2014 Hikma, whose U.S. headquarters are in New Jersey, and Sagent, which is based in Illinois \u2014 sent letters to Idaho officials demanding they ensure that their drugs are not used in executions.",
      "Hikma spokesman Steven Weiss told NBC News on Friday that it has sent such letters to Idaho and other states every year for the past eight years \u201cto firmly remind them of and our strong objections to the use of our medicines in capital punishment.\u201d",
      "Weiss added that the company was able to determine that the medicines purchased by Idaho \"were not ours,\" because \u201cthere\u2019s information on the invoice that enables us to determine whether or not it was manufactured by us.\u201d",
      "Sagent did not respond to requests for comment about whether its drugs may have been purchased by the state.",
      "In letters last year to Idaho officials, the drugmaker said it \u201creserves the right to take legal action\u201d if it learns Idaho did not comply, and warned that if its \u201cproducts are diverted from legitimate channels, in violation of our distribution controls, they risk being counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful.\u201d",
      "The company also sent an email to the attorney general with the subject line: \u201cURGENT: Request Seeking Return of Pentobarbital Purchased for Capital Punishment Purposes.\u201d",
      "According to a court filing last month in Pizzuto\u2019s case, Josh Tewalt, the former director of the Idaho Department of Correction, declined to \u201cadmit\u201d or deny\u201d whether the department had obtained execution drugs manufactured by a company that opposes the use of its products in executions, citing the state\u2019s right to protect its sources.",
      "Tewalt, the agency\u2019s longtime director, denied the state would use expired chemicals for an execution. He left the agency for a private-sector job last month and did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In clinical settings, pentobarbital can be used for insomnia or to treat seizures in humans, while veterinarians use it as an anesthetic or to euthanize animals.",
      "But in executions, a potent dose of the sedative can cause death from respiratory failure, and for over a decade, it has become a go-to for states seeking to avoid the typical three-drug protocol. Indiana carried out its first execution in 15 years in December after having purchased pentobarbital for $900,000. The drug vendor and the amount of the drug were redacted from public records under the state\u2019s shield law.",
      "Tennessee next month is also planning to conduct its first lethal injection execution since 2019, after having bought pentobarbital in recent years for nearly $600,000 from an undisclosed supplier, according to reports.",
      "Utah bought pentobarbital for its last execution in 2024. Randall Honey, the state\u2019s chief of prison operations, said in a court filing last summer that Utah initially had difficulty obtaining the drug, but that someone who had read news reports contacted officials and put them in touch with a supplier asking $200,000. The drug was \u201cmanufactured, not compounded,\u201d but was paid for in \u201can appropriate and legal way,\u201d according to Honey.",
      "Such high costs were noted in court documents in Creech\u2019s case last fall, in which Michaela Almgren, a clinical associate professor at the University of South Carolina\u2019s College of Pharmacy, wrote that Idaho\u2019s purchase of a six-vial batch of pentobarbital at $50,000 was more than three times the cost on the wholesale market. She also said at the time that only Hikma and Sagent were making injectable pentobarbital at the size and strength that Idaho had obtained.",
      "It \u201craises the question of the legitimacy of the supplier, since the price of the drug vials is so severely inflated,\u201d said Almgren, on behalf of Creech\u2019s legal team, according to the court document. \u201cA drug supplier who marks prices 2-3 times higher than expected may be viewed as suspicious or illegitimate, leading to concerns about ethical practices and even regulatory compliance.\u201d",
      "Pizzuto\u2019s lawyers suggested in a court filing last week that it appears \u201cthe same profit-seeking actor is roaming the country selling pentobarbital to desperate correctional departments at huge markups.\u201d",
      "At the least, someone is profiting at the apparent expense of manufacturers who say they are against their drugs being used for executions, said Lain, the author of the upcoming book \u201cSecrets of the Killing State: The Untold Story of Lethal Injection.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe states\u2019 narrative is, \u2018Oh, we need secrecy to protect drug suppliers,\u2019\u201d Lain said. \u201cStates are using secrecy to violate. Who are you protecting? Because you\u2019re not protecting pharmaceutical manufacturers.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe state has to follow the law,\u201d she added. \u201cIt has to be different than the criminals that they are executing.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 18:44:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Bird flu cases could rise as birds migrate north. But the sweeping cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services include workers focused on the virus.",
    "story": [
      "The outbreak of bird flu that has been ravaging farms nationwide had started to slow over the past few weeks \u2014 but as wild birds migrate north, scientists say the virus may follow.",
      "At the same time, the United States will have fewer people leading the national effort to stop avian influenza.",
      "The sweeping cuts this week to the federal Department of Health and Human Services include the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s chief medical officer, who was helping to lead the federal government\u2019s bird flu response, and senior staff from the FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine, which linked bird flu cases to raw pet food, leading to several recalls.",
      "\u201cWe no longer are going to have the same eyes on this virus,\u201d said Dr. Meghan Davis, a former dairy veterinarian and associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She said active surveillance of and investigation into how the virus spreads are a necessity, but local health officials and veterinarians will no longer have the same support from the federal government.",
      "The ongoing outbreak of bird flu \u2014 the worst in U.S. history \u2014 picked up steam through the fall and winter, pushing egg prices to record highs. While outbreaks in both poultry and cattle have fallen, along with the average price of eggs, health experts say that cases could rise again amid the spring migration, which typically peaks in May and June in the continental U.S.",
      "Quantifying the scope of bird flu in the U.S. is complicated. The number of confirmed outbreaks in poultry fell to 53 flocks last month after reaching 133 flocks in January. Outbreaks in cattle fell to 21 herds last month, after peaking at 253 in November. Detections in other mammals, wild birds and humans are tracked separately. And the 168 million domestic birds affected so far include many slaughtered because any detection on a poultry farm requires culling all the birds on the premises.",
      "The current outbreak has also been notoriously difficult to predict and contain, jumping to cattle for the first time last year and spreading to other species. Limited data on cases and testing has made it even harder to track the virus\u2019s spread and evolution, experts said, which could mean the virus could surge and new variants could emerge with little warning.",
      "\u201cWe cannot let our guard down \u2014 now is not the time to do that,\u201d said Stacey Schultz-Cherry, an influenza researcher at St. Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Research Hospital.",
      "Wild birds are a major pathway for the virus when they land and mingle with domestic animals. Schultz-Cherry warned that the birds currently migrating northward might introduce new variants of the virus from South America to the U.S., giving the virus more opportunities to evolve in potentially dangerous ways. \u201cThat\u2019s what we worry about \u2014 is this something new?\u201d",
      "Variants of concern have already been emerging. In March, the U.S. confirmed the detection of a bird flu variant known as H7N9 on a Mississippi poultry farm. It was the first time since 2017 that the strain \u2014 which is especially deadly to humans \u2014 had been detected in a commercial U.S. poultry flock. In January, another variant linked to a handful of severe and fatal human infections was found in U.S. cattle for the first time.",
      "This week, more than 140 staff members from the FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine, which oversees animal food and medicine, were among the roughly\u00a010,000 staff\u00a0terminated from the Department of Health and Human Services, according to Alex Saint, who was an FDA communications specialist until she, too, was terminated. The cuts are part of the Trump administration\u2019s broader effort to shrink the federal government.",
      "The FDA has become increasingly involved in the bird flu response as the virus has spread beyond birds. More than 120 domestic cats have been infected with bird flu since 2022, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department, and FDA staff helped link some of the cases to raw pet food.",
      "The agency also helped to develop better diagnostic tests for the virus and has conducted extensive bird flu studies showing that pasteurization effectively inactivated the virus, making milk products safe for consumption.",
      "Already, the staff cuts prompted the FDA to suspend an effort to improve testing of pet food and dairy products for bird flu, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak to the media and who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing short of devastating to veterinary medicine,\u201d said Dr. K. Fred Gingrich II, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, which represents cow veterinarians. \u201cThey were absolutely critical \u2014 not just for the bird flu response, but for developing protocols for research and drug development.\u201d",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that the cuts were limited to administrative staff and intended \u201cto make the agency more efficient and responsive.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe FDA and HHS continue to prioritize public health and animal health, including ongoing efforts to monitor and respond\" to bird flu, the agency added.",
      "In February, the USDA\u00a0accidentally fired officials\u00a0working on bird flu and then moved to rehire them. Later that month, the agency announced\u00a0a $1 billion effort\u00a0to combat the virus and lower egg prices.",
      "The risk remains low to the public, with 70 confirmed human cases in the U.S. and one death. But the unchecked spread of bird flu increases the chances that the virus could mutate into a strain that is far more deadly to humans and easily transmissible among them.",
      "Experts warn that the broader Department of Health and Human Services cuts also could hamper the country\u2019s ability to track and contain the virus among both humans and animals, particularly when outbreaks spread across state lines."

    "published": "Sat, 05 Apr 2025 01:40:23 GMT",
    "summary": "The 87-month sentence proposed by prosecutors is on the high end of court guidelines for such cases. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for April 25.",
    "story": [
      "Prosecutors are seeking more than seven years in prison for disgraced former U.S. Rep.\u00a0George Santos\u00a0after he pleaded guilty to federal fraud and identity theft charges.",
      "The U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York argued in a court filing Friday that a significant sentence was warranted because the New York Republican\u2019s \u201cunparalleled crimes\u201d had \u201cmade a mockery\u201d of the country\u2019s election system.",
      "\u201cFrom his creation of a wholly fictitious biography to his callous theft of money from elderly and impaired donors, Santos\u2019s unrestrained greed and voracious appetite for fame enabled him to exploit the very system by which we select our representatives,\u201d the office wrote.",
      "Prosecutors also argued that Santos had been \u201cunrepentant and defiant\u201d for years, dismissing the prosecution as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and refusing to resign from Congress as his web of lies was debunked.",
      "They said his claims of remorse after pleading guilty \u201cring hollow\u201d and suggested he has a \u201chigh likelihood of reoffending\u201d given he has not forfeited any of his ill-gotten gains or repaid any of his victims.",
      "Santos\u2019 lawyers, in an email to The Associated Press, dismissed the seven-year proposal as \u201cabsurd and unfounded,\u201d saying it appears \u201cdesigned to beat up on a man that already took full responsibility for his actions.\u201d",
      "In their own sentencing memo Friday, they rejected the notion that Santos will fall back into criminal behavior, noting he has no prior criminal record and also provides \u201ccrucial\u201d support to his sister and her young daughter.",
      "They argued for a two-year prison term, which is the mandatory minimum sentence for aggravated identity theft.",
      "The lawyers maintain such a sentence is in line with those handed to\u00a0former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.\u00a0and other political figures facing similar financial crimes.",
      "They also touted Santos\u2019 cooperation in a separate federal investigation into a Texas man who\u00a0tried to dupe Santos\u00a0out of nearly $1 million by posing as a political fixer offering to destroy evidence in his cases.",
      "\u201cThis sentence, coupled with the significant collateral consequences Mr. Santos has already suffered\u2014including the loss of his congressional seat and public humiliation \u2014 would send a clear message that such conduct will not be tolerated,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "A federal judge on Long Island is scheduled to decide Santos\u2019 sentence during a court hearing April 25.",
      "The once-rising Republican, who represented parts of Queens and Long Island, served barely a year in office before he was ousted by his House colleagues in 2023, just the sixth congressperson ever expelled in the chamber\u2019s history.",
      "Santos\u2019 political demise came after it was revealed that he had fabricated much of his life story, leading to\u00a0questions\u00a0about how the political unknown had funded his winning campaign.",
      "The now-36-year-old cast himself as a wealthy businessman who had graduated from top colleges, worked at prestigious Wall Street firms and held a valuable real estate portfolio. In truth, he was struggling financially and faced eviction.",
      "Santos\u00a0admitted\u00a0in August that he duped voters, deceived donors and stole the identities of nearly a dozen people, including his own family members, to make donations to his congressional campaign.",
      "He was initially due to be sentenced in February, but a judge granted him a\u00a0three-month reprieve\u00a0to come up with more than half a million dollars in court fines.",
      "As part of his plea deal, Santos agreed to pay nearly $375,000 in restitution and $205,000 in forfeiture.",
      "Santos\u2019 lawyers said at the time that he had little more than $1,000 in liquid assets and needed more time to build his newly launched podcast \u201cPants on Fire\u201d in order to begin paying off the debt.",
      "Prosecutors maintain Santos profited handsomely from his infamy, arguing he has earned more than $800,000 from\u00a0appearances on the video-sharing website Cameo\u00a0and from a new documentary since his expulsion from Congress.",
      "Two of Santos\u2019 campaign staffers have also pleaded guilty to federal charges in connection to the campaign financing scheme.",
      "Sam Miele, his former campaign fundraiser, was\u00a0sentenced in March\u00a0to one year and one day in federal prison. He admitted to impersonating a high-ranking congressional aide and charging donors\u2019 credit cards without authorization while raising campaign cash for Santos.",
      "Nancy Marks, Santos\u2019 former campaign treasurer, admitted to filing bogus campaign finance reports filled with fake donors and a fake $500,000 personal loan from Santos himself.",
      "The embellishments helped the campaign hit fundraising thresholds needed to qualify for financial backing from the national Republican Party. Marks is due to be sentenced in May."

      "A Boston-area hospital is investigating after five nurses who have worked on the same floor have developed brain tumors.",
      "Mass General Brigham Newton-Wellesley Hospital said that in total, 11 employees from the fifth-floor maternity unit identified health concerns. Five had brain tumors, all of which are benign. Two of those have the most common, benign type \u2014 meningioma, according to the hospital in Newton, Massachusetts, which is about 10 miles west of Boston.",
      "\u201cThe investigation found no environmental risks which could be linked to the development of a brain tumor,\u201d the hospital\u2019s Jonathan Sonis, associate chief medical officer, and Sandy Muse, chief nursing officer, said in a statement.",
      "The hospital said its investigation was completed in collaboration with government health and safety officials and it considered multiple possible sources. It ruled out disposable masks, the water supply, nearby x-rays, and chemotherapy treatment on the floor below, the hospital said.",
      "\u201cBased on these results, we can confidently reassure our dedicated team ... and all our patients that there is no environmental risk at our facility,\" the administrators said.",

      "\"Right now, the best way we can help is to complete an independent, scientific investigation,\" MNA spokesperson Joe Markman said in a statement Friday. \"That effort is underway and may take additional weeks.\"",
      "The union indicated that nurses came forward with workplace health concerns, which led to the discovery of those with tumors.",
      "\u201cThe hospital only spoke to a small number of nurses, and their environmental testing was not comprehensive,\u201d he said in his statement. \u201cThe hospital cannot make this issue go away by attempting to provide a predetermined conclusion.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for a state agency was unable to provide conclusive information on the matter by deadline. Federal occupational health and safety officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The American Cancer Society says that in order to meet the definition of a cancer cluster, occurrences must be the same type, in the same area, with the same cause, and affecting a number of people that's \"greater than expected\" when a baseline for occurrences is established.",
      "\u201cNearly 4 out of 10 people in the United States will develop cancer during their lifetimes,\" the society said on its cancer clusters webpage. \"So, it\u2019s not uncommon for several people in a relatively small area to develop cancer around the same time.\""

      "Americans nearing retirement and recent retirees said they were  anxious and frustrated following a second day of market turmoil that hit their 401(k)s after President Donald Trump\u2019s escalation of tariffs.",
      "As the impending tariffs shook the global economy Friday, people who were planning on their retirement accounts to carry them through their golden years said the economic chaos was hitting too close to home.",
      "Some said they are pausing big-ticket purchases and reconsidering home renovations, while others said they fear their quality of life will be adversely affected by all the turmoil.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just kind of stunned, and with so much money in the market, we just sort of have to hope we have enough time to recover,\u201d said Paula, 68, a former occupational health professional in New Jersey who retired three years ago.",
      "Paula, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she feared retaliation for speaking out against Trump administration policies, said she was worried about what lies ahead.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been doing is trying to enjoy the time that we have, but you want to be able to make it last,\u201d Paula said Friday. \u201cI have no confidence here.\u201d",
      "Trump fulfilled his campaign promise this week to unleash sweeping tariffs, including on the United States\u2019 largest trading partners, in\u00a0a move that has sparked fears of a global trade war. The decision sent the stock market spinning. On Friday afternoon, the broad-based S&P 500 closed down 6%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 5.8%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 2,200 points, or about 5.5%.",
      "As Wall Street reeled Friday after China hit back with tariffs against the U.S., millions of Americans with 401(k)s watched their retirement funds diminish along with the stock market.",
      "\u201cI looked at my 401(k) this morning and in the last two days that\u2019s lost $58,000. That\u2019s stressful,\u201d said Victor Fettes, 54, of Georgia, who retired last week as a senior director of risk management and compliance at Verizon. \u201cIf that continues, I can\u2019t stay retired.\u201d",

      "One in five Americans age 50 and over have no retirement savings, and more than half, 61%, are worried they will not have enough money to support them in retirement, according to a survey published by the AARP last April.",
      "\u201cIt makes you realize how out of touch the current administration is with regular people,\u201d said Benajah Cobb, 63, Carey\u2019s husband, who also works in the theater industry.",
      "He said he hoped the last few days of stock market turmoil would motivate lawmakers to put more checks and balances on the president.",

    "story": [
      "Six young children at a Lubbock, Texas, day care center have tested positive for measles \u2014 a dreaded scenario with the potential to accelerate an already out-of-control outbreak that has spread to at least two other states.",
      "More than a dozen other states and Washington, D.C. are dealing with cases of measles unrelated to Texas.",
      "On Friday, the Texas Department of State Health Services said the toll rose to 481 confirmed cases, a 14% jump over last week. Fifty-six people have been hospitalized in the area since the disease started spreading in late January.",
      "At the Tiny Tots U Learning Academy, a center with approximately 230 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, the outbreak began on March 24, when a little girl who had been sick with fever and vomiting tested positive. She later needed to be hospitalized for pneumonia and trouble breathing.",
      "Kids who have tested positive at the day care so far are between the ages of 5 months and 3 years old, said Maegan Messick, a co-owner of the center. None was fully vaccinated against measles.",
      "For nearly two weeks, Messick has been working with local health officials who are in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the situation. Messick said she\u2019s not been given clear guidance on how to handle measles in such a large day care with so many vulnerable kids.",
      "\u201cFrom what I\u2019m being told, the CDC doesn\u2019t have a playbook for this,\u201d Messick said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had to make judgment calls.\u201d",
      "The U.S. is facing the largest measles outbreak in six years, but the CDC has remained relatively silent on the public health threat, providing just weekly updates on its website and sending an alert to doctors last month. The agency sent 2,000 doses of the MMR vaccine to Texas health officials at their request, but hasn't held a news briefing about measles since 2019, when\u00a0two large outbreaks in New York\u00a0threatened to reverse the United States\u2019 status of having eliminated the virus.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which is over CDC, did not respond Friday to a question about whether any briefings were in the works to address the current measles outbreak.",
      "It was unclear whether mass layoffs at HHS and CDC this week might stymie such efforts. But steep funding cuts to community health departments announced last week have already forced some areas to cancel vaccine clinics.",
      "Dallas County, for example, had to cancel more than 50 clinics. Many had been planned for schools in areas with low vaccination rates.",
      "According to an NBC News tally, 628 measles cases have been reported nationally in 2025. Other states with outbreaks include Kansas with 23 cases, Oklahoma with 10 cases, and New Mexico with 54 cases. Public health officials in Ohio have identified 17.",
      "The cases at the Lubbock day care center are likely linked to the epicenter of the outbreak, Gaines County, said Lubbock's public health director Katherine Wells.",
      "Wells said she\u2019s been concerned about cases spreading in child care centers since the beginning of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ll have additional outbreaks in other day care centers,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be the only one.\u201d",
      "Messick, of the Tiny Tots U Learning Academy, said she and her staff are trying to reduce risk of further spread by watching kids closely for symptoms and isolating certain classrooms.",
      "They\u2019re also urging other child care facilities to encourage their families to get the MMR vaccine. Families who choose not to vaccinate their children have been asked to keep them home for at least 21 days.",
      "Two doses are almost always enough to give lifetime protection against measles, according to the CDC. Unvaccinated people who are exposed to the virus are almost certain to become infected.",
      "The first dose isn\u2019t usually given until after a child\u2019s first birthday, but can be offered early, at 6 months.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the best that child care owners can do right now,\u201d Messick said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming. There\u2019s no way around it.\u201d"

      "Happy Friday, newsletter readers! President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs (and the market reaction) are the story of the week, but a key step toward more of his domestic policy agenda is underway right now in the Senate \u2014 and our Congress team breaks down how it\u2019s spotlighting some divides in the GOP\u2019s narrow majorities. And ahead of this weekend\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Kristen Welker goes through the three key questions Trump and his administration face on the tariffs. Plus, we answer a reader question about Elon Musk\u2019s role in government.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "\u2014 Scott Bland",
      "GOP concerns about tax cut strategy and Medicaid loom over Senate budget",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs grab headlines, Senate Republicans are moving through the procedural steps to set up Trump\u2019s tax plans and other major domestic spending priorities. But it\u2019s not going to be easy for them to agree on exactly what to do.",
      "Senate Republicans managed Thursday to advance their massive budget plan to debate, but not before an unexpected delay caused by some of their own who have concerns about their strategy on tax cuts and potential cuts to Medicaid.",
      "Prior to debate commencing on the measure Friday, the delay occurred as those Republicans met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to talk through their concerns.",
      "Some more centrist senators are worried about a\u00a0budget change the party is using to slap a zero-dollar price tag on extending Trump\u2019s tax cuts, which are estimated by the official scorekeeper in Congress to cost $4.6 trillion over a decade.",
      "Republicans are delaying a reckoning over the issue after they bypassed the Senate parliamentarian on the question of whether they can use a \u201ccurrent policy\u201d baseline to treat extending Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire this year, as costing nothing. But that means the move could be challenged later, and it could potentially blow up the bill if the parliamentarian rules against it \u2014 unless the Senate votes to overrule her, which some have likened to nuking the 60-vote filibuster rule.",
      "A handful of Republicans have concerns that they will be asked to do that later in the process.",
      "Another senator, Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he has \u201ca big concern\u201d about the bill slashing Medicaid \u2014 and took his concerns directly to Trump in a phone call Thursday evening before the vote.",
      "Twenty-one percent \u201cof my state receives Medicaid \u2014 CHIP or Medicaid. So, I\u2019ve made clear I\u2019m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts. And I thought the president\u2019s assurance to me tonight was completely unequivocal,\u201d Hawley added, saying that assurance made him comfortable voting to begin the process.",
      "That\u2019s easier said than done. The House-approved budget, which Trump endorsed, makes it mathematically impossible for Republicans to achieve their targets without cutting Medicare or Medicaid. Lawmakers say they want to cut waste and fraud, along with imposing a potential work requirement for Medicaid. Beyond that, they haven\u2019t identified ways to reduce spending.",
      "Three questions about Trump\u2019s tariffs",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping new tariffs have rattled the markets and raised new concerns about potential price hikes. While Trump campaigned on implementing tariffs, more questions remain as they take effect.",
      "First, how will the Trump administration explain the tariffs to the American public?",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand what the plan is, what the strategy is,\u201d former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., told \u201cMeet the Press NOW\u201d on Thursday, later adding: \u201cThere are Republicans on the Hill who are wondering: Where are we going?\u201d",
      "Another key question: What will the economic fallout look like?",
      "Trump warned that his trade policies would cause a \u201clittle disturbance\u201d in his speech to Congress last month. And we\u2019re already seeing markets rattled by the new tariffs, raising questions about the possibility of a national \u2014 or even global \u2014 recession.",
      "Some Republicans have indicated that the administration may need to rethink its policies if they result in an economic downturn.",
      "\u201cIf they make things better, they should want more; if it makes things worse, they should want to recalibrate,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told our Capitol Hill team on Wednesday.",
      "And lastly: When are Americans going to reap the benefits of this trade policy?",
      "Trump told me back in December that he \u201ccan\u2019t guarantee\u201d American families will not pay more, later adding that tariffs \u201care going to make us rich.\u201d",
      "The president also said on Air Force One last night that it could take \u201ca year and a half to two years\u201d to ramp up American manufacturing. But the administration has yet to lay out exactly when everyday Americans will start to benefit from these tariffs.",
      "We\u2019ll delve into these questions and more on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this Sunday with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Sen. Jim Lankford, R-Okla., and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.",
      "I also talked to our friends over at NBCU Academy about how I prepare for a \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview. Check out the video here!",

      "Judges showed some frustration this week with how the Trump administration has been defending itself in court, with one saying it appeared to have used \"bad faith\" tactics, another accusing it of using \"disingenuous\" arguments and a third saying it was making \"inaccurate\" claims.",
      "One of the judges, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, suggested he might hold contempt proceedings to hold the government to account for failing to comply with his orders.",
      "In a separate but related case, a federal judge in Maryland on Friday ordered the government to return a deportee it acknowledged was accidentally sent to a\u00a0notorious megajail\u00a0in El Salvador.",
      "The week ended with a major win for the administration, when the Supreme Court allowed it to terminate\u00a0Education Department grants that a lower court had restored. It was the first time during President Donald Trump's second administration that the Supreme Court sided with him.",
      "Here's a look at some of the biggest legal developments of the week:",
      "'The government acted in bad faith'",
      "At a hearing Thursday, Boasberg demanded detailed answers about the administration's failure to comply with his order halting deportations under Trump's invocation of the rarely used Alien Enemies Act.",
      "He didn't get them.",
      "After Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Immigration Drew Ensign told him \"it is our position that the actions of the government complied\" with his two restraining orders barring alleged Venezuelan gang members from being flown out of the country on March 15, the judge let his frustration show.",
      "\"OK. So it seems to me that there is a fair likelihood that that is not correct, and in fact, that the government acted in bad faith throughout that day,\" Boasberg said.",
      "\"If you really believed everything you did that day was legal and could survive a court challenge, I can't believe you ever would have operated in the way you did,\" he added.",
      "He also referenced the deportation of a Maryland man who the administration acknowledged was mistakenly sent to El Salvador.",
      "\"So what you were willing to do by trying to do this as quickly as possible and avoid being enjoined by the court was to risk putting people on those planes who shouldn\u2019t have been on the planes in the first place,\" Boasberg said later in the hearing.",
      "The judge noted that Trump had signed the AEA on Friday, March 14, but didn't make it public until Saturday afternoon, when preparations to ship the deportees to a prison in El Salvador were already underway.",
      "He suggested the timing was intentional, so the deportees could be \"removed from the country before it was possible to challenge it legally.\"",
      "Ensign said, \"I don't have any information on that.\"",
      "The lawyers for the plaintiffs, who all deny that they're members of the gang, got wind of the executive order on March 14 and filed suit overnight to block the deportations. Boasberg ordered an emergency hearing for that Saturday afternoon.",
      "During that hearing, the judge ordered any deportations under the AEA to be temporarily halted, and directed that any flights that were underway be returned to the U.S. Ensign said at the time he was not aware of any, a position he reiterated Thursday.",
      "\u201cI had no knowledge from my client that was the case,\u201d Ensign said, and \u201cI made diligent efforts to obtain that information\u201d from the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department.",
      "It was later revealed that two such flights were in the air at the time. The government has refused to release details on the exact timing, labeling it a \"state secret.\" The Justice Department lawyers claimed the flights were out of U.S. airspace at the time, and therefore didn't have to return.",
      "Boasberg pressed Ensign on who made the decision not to turn the planes around. \"I don't know that,\" Ensign replied.",
      "\"I'm certainly interested in finding that out because as we proceed with potential contempt proceedings, that may become relevant,\" the judge said.",
      "He said he'll likely issue an order on whether there's\u00a0probable cause to find the government in contempt next week.",
      "At an unrelated news conference Friday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi was asked if she \"was involved in the decision to defy\" Boasberg's order.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think anyone defied an order by a judge. That\u2019s pending in court right now,\" she said.",
      "On Tuesday, the parties will be back before Boasberg for arguments on the heart of the issue in the case \u2014 whether the Trump administration should be enjoined indefinitely from deporting alleged Tren de Aragua members under the AEA.",
      "The administration has already appealed his current restraining order to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging it infringes on the president's powers.",
      "Judge rules in favor of Maryland man deported to El Salvador",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis on Friday ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is a legal resident of Maryland, to be returned to the U.S. by Monday after a Justice Department lawyer acknowledged he should not have been sent to El Salvador.",
      "An immigration judge had specifically barred Garcia, who the government alleges is an MS-13 gang member, from being sent to El Salvador back in 2019, finding it \"more likely than not that he would be persecuted\" there.",
      "Xinis asked Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni why the administration couldn't ask El Salvador to return Garcia. Reuveni said he'd asked his client the same thing, and, \u201cI have not yet received an answer that I find satisfactory.\u201d",
      "Reuveni also said he did not know why Garcia had been arrested, how it was determined he would be sent to El Salvador or any details about the administration's deal with the prison there.",
      "\u201cThe government made a choice here to produce no evidence,\u201d he said.",
      "'Disingenuous' arguments in a California case",
      "A federal judge in California on Monday issued an order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from ending\u00a0Temporary Protected Status\u00a0for over 350,000 Venezuelan nationals.",
      "U.S. District Judge Edward Chen said the plaintiffs in the case are likely to succeed with their claims that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's \"unprecedented\" decision to bring an early end to their TPS protections \u2014 which allow them to live and work in the U.S. \u2014 is \"unauthorized by law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus.\"",
      "Noem had directed the TPS protections, which had been scheduled to expire late next year, to be terminated on April 7.",
      "The administration is appealing Chen's decision and separately asked him to stay his own ruling, arguing in part that ending the protections doesn't mean they'll be deported.",
      "\"[T]hat is a disingenuous argument,\" Chen wrote Friday, rejecting the administration's request for a stay.",
      "He noted that during an interview where she announced the decision, Noem said the \u201cpeople of this country want these dirtbags out.\u201d",
      "He said the \"entire point\" of Noem's early termination decision \"was to enable the removal of Venezuelan TPS holders on a schedule well in advance of the schedule set\" by her predecessor, Alejandro Mayorkas.",
      "\"Nor has the government stated that, if the Court were to stay its postponement order, it will not immediately move forward with the removal of any Venezuelan TPS holder,\" Chen added.",
      "He pointed to the administration's acknowledgement in the AEA case that one of the deportees shouldn't have been removed as another reason not to pause his ruling.",
      "The \"government mistakenly deported an individual, who has legal status to be in the United States, to El Salvador but has essentially taken the position that it cannot do anything to address that mistake,\" the judge wrote, showing any removal in his case\u00a0\"likely could not be 'undone' should Plaintiffs ultimately prevail.\"",
      "'Inaccurate' claims",
      "The Justice Department also sought a stay from a federal judge in Washington, D.C., asking her to pause her preliminary injunction barring the administration from shuttering the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson's March 28 decision granting the injunction included some harsh words for the administration, finding its claims it wasn't trying to close the agency \"unreliable.\"",
      "The government's \"eleventh hour attempt to suggest immediately before the hearing that the stop work order was not really a stop work order at all was so disingenuous that the Court is left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything,\" Jackson wrote then.",
      "She was similarly unimpressed Thursday with its arguments for a stay of her order.",
      "\"[T]heir description of the Order is at odds with the terms of the Order, and their description of the ruling that prompted it is inaccurate as well,\" she wrote, denying the request.",
      "That same day, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the government a partial temporary stay of the order.",
      "\"The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,\" the ruling said.",
      "Supreme victory",
      "The Supreme Court gave the administration some relief late Friday by allowing it to terminate education grants for teacher training that administration officials view as violating Trump's policy opposing\u00a0diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0efforts.",
      "The 5-4 decision blocked a Massachusetts-based judge\u2019s ruling that found the administration hadn't followed the correct legal process in terminating the grants.",
      "The appeal was one of three the administration submitted to the high court with last week, including the Alien Enemies Act case."

      "Administration officials said the funded programs \u201cpromote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another protected characteristic.\u201d",
      "In court papers, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said many of the programs contained \u201cobjectionable DEI material.\u201d",
      "A lawsuit was filed in March by eight states including California, Massachusetts and New York \u2014 on behalf of entities that receive the grants, such as universities and nonprofits \u2014 saying the decision to rescind the awards violated a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "U.S. District Judge Myong Joun issued a temporary restraining order blocking the administration\u2019s move, saying officials had failed to properly explain their reasoning.",
      "The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to block Joun\u2019s ruling, noting that the Education Department had sent the same boilerplate letter to all of the grant awardees announcing the termination of funding. The letters contained no specific information on why any particular program was deemed to be in violation of the anti-DEI policy, the appeals court said.",
      "The case only involves grants issued to entities in the states that sued. In total, the Department of Education canceled about $600 million in grants for teacher training.",
      "Trump last month signed an executive order that seeks to dismantle the Education Department. Completely eliminating the department, however, would require congressional approval.",
      "In two prior emergency applications filed by the Trump administration, the Supreme Court did not grant its requests.",
      "In one, the court rejected the administration's bid to avoid immediately paying contractors for the U.S. Agency for International Development whose funding was cut.",
      "In the other, the court sidestepped a decision on whether Trump could fire a federal government watchdog, although as a result of a lower court decision, the administration ultimately prevailed."

Fifty-thousand people have died ... all of Microsoft has blood on its hands. How do you all celebrate when Microsoft is killing children? Shame on you all.\u201d",

      "The interruption came in the middle of Microsoft\u2019s 50th Anniversary Copilot Event at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington.

A video livestreaming the event on YouTube was made private after videos of the protester began circulating online.",

So (writer-director) James (Gunn) laid the roadmap for us with his brilliant script.

    "story": [
      "Are you a Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda or a Samantha?",
      "It's a question as old as time (or at least since June 6, 1998, when \"Sex and the City\" premiered on HBO).",
      "The show's four leading ladies collectively comprise a group of best friends in their 30s, navigating life and relationships in New York City in a time after the\u00a0\"end of love in Manhattan,\" as Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) puts it in the pilot.",
      "Their friendship is maintained through phone calls, parties, cab rides and meals and often consists of a central debate, with each person bringing a different perspective to the situation. Their conversations are full of banter and little disagreements, with each scene illuminating just how different each character is, setting up a perfect \u2014 and lasting \u2014 form of self-categorization.",
      "Kristin Davis, who plays Charlotte, says she fittingly identifies as a \"Charlotte.\"",
      "\"I think BuzzFeed had a quiz and people send it around. My daughter has gotten it, which is hysterical, and luckily she is a Charlotte,\" she tells TODAY.com with a laugh, referring to daughter Gemma.",
      "The personality litmus test also lent itself to her latest venture, a \"Sex and the City\" rewatch podcast called, \"Are You A Charlotte?\" The goal of the podcast is to connect with fans, she says.",
      "Currently on the podcast, Davis and her guests \u2014 a lineup she says will include TODAY's own Jenna Bush Hager, \"Sex and the City\" author Candace Bushnell and Sarah Jessica Parker \u2014 are still rewatching Season 1.",
      "\"The first season, especially, I barely remember it,\" Davis says. \"Because we used to film really quickly, also, so we would film all night. Maybe we had five days, I want to say, an episode ... I'd have to go back, it might have even been four. Like it was fast.\"",
      "Now, there's more time dedicated to filming each episode, she says. Davis currently stars as Charlotte in \"And Just Like That...,\" the \"Sex and the City\" revival.",
      "Headed into Season 3, Davis calls it \"a big season.\" Viewers left Charlotte in Season 2 on her journey of returning to work while balancing the expectations of being a wife and mother, including setting husband Harry (Evan Handler) straight on the division of their workload.",
      "\"The pressure of trying to be a good wife, be a good mother, her children are getting older, so she's trying to figure out, 'How much time can I devote to my career, at my job? ... What do I need to succeed?'\" Davis says. \"This is a big question for everyone, so I really relate to it myself, obviously, too. And that continues through the season, and you're going to see her really struggle with that.",
      "\"And it's a fun, fun storyline,\" she adds.",
      "\"And Just Like That...,\" which premiered in December 2021, reunited Davis, Nixon and Parker as Charlotte, Miranda and Carrie. Season 2 memorably saw the brief return of Samantha, when Kim Cattrall made a cameo in the finale.",
      "How to tell if you're a Carrie, Charlotte, Samantha or Miranda",
      "While fans have been categorizing themselves as a Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda or Samantha for years, Davis has her own ideas for how to decide which character you're most like. She boils it down to four key questions to ask yourself, centered on each character's core identity:",
      "Are you a searcher? Are you a trailblazer?Do you say it like it is?Are you looking for a traditional outcome for your life?",
      "Are you a searcher?",
      "Are you a trailblazer?",
      "Do you say it like it is?",
      "Are you looking for a traditional outcome for your life?",
      "After whichever question has you shouting, \"Yes!\" the most definitively, read on for which \"Sex and the City\" character that makes you.",
      "Are you a searcher?",
      "Yes? Congrats, you're a ...",
      "Carrie!",
      "\"In terms of the other (characters), like Carrie, I would say, are you a searcher? Are you looking for answers? Are you investigating things?\" Davis poses.",
      "In each episode of the original show, Parker\u2019s character, a columnist, took on a relationship or life dilemma, and in the process of writing it, often framed the issue as a question. Davis says the key to Carrie's identity is her signature phrase: \"I couldn't help but wonder.\"",
      "Carrie is also \"not so worried about tradition,\" Davis notes.",
      "\"Carrie is more independent and looking for what would make her happy, not necessarily what society might be expecting,\" she says.",
      "Are you a trailblazer?",
      "Then you're a...",
      "Samantha!",
      "Taking things a step further from Carrie's independence, Davis describes Samantha as a \"trailblazer.\"",
      "\"Are you super independent?\" Davis says. \"Are you unapologetic about getting what you need? Such good qualities, powerful qualities.\"",
      "Do you say it like it is?",
      "You're most like...",
      "Miranda!",
      "Davis describes a Miranda as someone \"open in how you talk.\"",
      "\"Do you say it like it is?\" she says. \"Are you open to eating food out of a trash can? Do you like cats?\"",
      "A huge part of a Miranda's identity is also career-centric, she says.",
      "\"Are you into your career? She is a lawyer, and she's very good at it, and she wants to become partner, and she's super smart,\" Davis says. \"So are you super smart? That would be a Miranda question.\"",
      "Are you looking for a traditional outcome for your life?",
      "If yes, you are a...",
      "Charlotte!",
      "\u201cFirst of all, in terms of, are you a Charlotte, I would say, \u2018Do you believe in love? Are you loyal?\u2019\u201d Davis adds.",
      "At her core, Charlotte is looking for \u201ca traditional outcome\u201d to her life. She also has certain material loves that are part of her identity, too, Davis says.",
      "\u201cDo you love dogs? Are you into structured and starched clothing?\u201d Davis asks with a laugh. \u201cDo you like white flowers?\u201d"

      "\"It was a fun show for me because there's a lot of physical challenges, which I really like. There's a lot of running, jumping, fighting and underwater stuff,\" Bacon says during a sit-down interview with TODAY.com",
      "\"You know, just basically demon ass-kicking,\" he laughs.",
      "The new Prime series, which premiered on April 3, is about a murdered bounty hunter (Bacon) resurrected by Satan to help track down escaped demons, so it's naturally going to be hellish. But fortunately, for Bacon, it\u2019s in all the right ways.",
      "\"What's really fun to me is the fact that the character is such a badass, but at the same time, he's such a child in a lot of ways,\" Bacon says of the role. \"He's living in his mother's garage, he hasn't been able to make it work with his ex-wife. He's estranged from his son. He's kind of a mess in his life.\"",
      "That complicated backstory is exactly why he enjoyed taking on the character. \"If you're going to play somebody who is ultimately the hero of the show, it's fun to have that kind of complexity.\"",
      "Produced by showrunner Erik Oleson, \"The Bondsman\" also stars Beth Grant as Kitty Halloran, Bacon's tough-as-nails mother, Maxwell Jenkins as his son, Cade, and Sugarland's Jennifer Nettles as the ex-wife he still carries a torch for.",
      "It's a campy, often gory mix of comedy, action and straight-up horror as Bacon battles various demons as part of a mission he's been sent on to round up wayward demons by the Devil himself.",
      "No stranger to the genre, the \"Footloose\" actor has appeared in a variety of horror films, including the original \"Friday the 13th,\" \"Hollow Man\" and \"Tremors.\"",
      "Beyond it's genre identity, \"The Bondsman\" is also a metaphor for personal redemption, with its phrase, \"to hell and back,\" serving as both a literal and figurative meaning.",
      "Kevin Bacon vs. Hub Halloran: Similar or different?",
      "While Bacon says he doesn't connect with his character Hub's alter ego, they do share a passion for music.",
      "Along with acting, Bacon has spent decades touring with his brother, Michael, as one half of the musical duo known as The Bacon Brothers. Hub, a failed musician, provided Bacon with the perfect opportunity to marry two of his loves in \"The Bondsman.\"",
      "\"It came up when we were about to pitch (\"The Bondsman\"), that it might be fun for me to write some songs, and then Jennifer (Nettles) got cast, and she was definitely the best person for the part, the best actress, but she was also a fabulous singer and a great, great songwriter,\" Bacon tells Craig Melvin and Savannah Guthrie during a segment on TODAY April 3.",
      "\"So, right away, we wrote a song, and that song was rejected,\u201d Bacon said. \"And then we wrote some more, and wrote some more, and we ended up with three of our tunes in the show.\"",
      "Music, however, isn't the only thing that Bacon and Hub have in common. Bacon says that Hub's calm and collected way of dealing with chaos is something he can relate to.",
      "\"Part of the humor lies in the fact that when all this crazy stuff starts happening around (Hub), he's pretty cool around it. He's like, 'OK, well, now, I've come back from the dead and now I've got to go and hunt these demons. So, let me just figure out how I'm going to do that.' You know what I mean? I would say, if anything, that's a similar quality,\" explains Bacon.",
      "Big screen vs. little screen: Which does Kevin Bacon prefer?",
      "\"The Bondsman\" is far from Bacon's first TV series. The actor also starred in the 2019 cop drama \"City on a Hill,\" the 2016 comedy  \"I Love Dick\" and the 2013 serial killer series \"The Following,\" among others.",
      "He also stars opposite Julianne Moore in the upcoming Netflix series, \"Sirens,\" which will be released on May 22.",
      "Having appeared on both the big and little screens, does Bacon have a preference between the two?",
      "\"When I started out, all I wanted was to be in movies and on the stage. Those were my two dreams,\" he explains. \"It's hard to imagine, but back then, if you went from the movies to the small screen, it was kind of a sign that you were throwing in the towel.",
      "\"Now, movie stars left and right do it, everyone does it, and I love it. I'd never not do TV,\" Bacon continues. \"I also really love movies and I go to them, I would say, maybe once a week. I go to the theater, sit in the room, get the popcorn, go through that experience because I love it.\""

      "\u201cBoy Meets World\u201d stars have mixed feelings today about a complicated storyline that Will Friedle described as having an \u201cimportant message, not great execution.\u201d",
      "In the latest \u201cPod Meets World\u201d episode, podcast hosts Friedle, Danielle Fishel and Rider Strong criticized a 1998 episode titled \u201cEverybody Loves Stuart,\u201d in which a college professor makes an inappropriate move on Fishel\u2019s character Topanga.",
      "The theme of the episode, in their opinion, is, \u201cWhat happens when people in position of power take advantage of your trust.\u201d The trio, however, were frustrated with the way the storyline plays out.",
      "Professor Stuart is portrayed by Fred Savage, the older brother of \u201cBoy Meet World\u201d star Ben Savage. In it, he is known as the \u201ccool teacher\u201d and makes a pass on Topanga, who is one of his students and is engaged to Ben Savage\u2019s Cory.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t like (it),\u201d Friedle said. \u201cTopanga just sits there, quiet through the whole freaking thing, like, never speaks. It\u2019s not about her at all.\u201d",
      "In the episode, Cory becomes furious after Topanga tells him that Stuart hit on her in her dorm room. Cory confronts the professor and pushes him into a screen window in the common room. Because of his actions, he is at risk of being expelled.",
      "The \u201cPod Meets World\u201d hosts disliked how the storyline turned its focus on Cory instead of Topanga, who was the actual victim.",
      "Fishel agreed with Friedle, saying that being harassed by her professor became less about Topanga and more about, \u201cHow is the man in her life going to feel about it, and what\u2019s he going to do about it?\u201d",
      "\u201cTopanga's agency was completely just taken away, I did not appreciate that at all,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHow do we get across how important this is without being too heavy handed, and without trying to seem like we\u2019re making light of it?\" she added. \u201cI don\u2019t think that goal was achieved. I do think they just decided, let\u2019s lean into the melodrama of it.\u201d",
      "Friedle went on to note that the \u201cone time Topanga opens her mouth, she\u2019s told to be quiet by the dean.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe never tells her story to anybody that can help,\u201d he continued, adding that Cory doesn\u2019t even share Topanga\u2019s story. Instead, it's Mr. Feeny who takes charge.",
      "Strong, who called the episode \u201cpainful\u201d to watch, wondered why it was Cory\u2019s responsibility to stand up for Topanga.",
      "\u201cWhy is it Cory\u2019s responsibility to take the fall when he does stand up for her?\u201d\u00a0he asked.",
      "\u201cThe concern is not how Topanga feels,\u201d Strong added. \u201cIt\u2019s about how the violation of Topanga is reflected through how it violates Cory\u2019s rights ... It just made me so uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "Fishel did point out that the show is titled \u201cBoy Meets World,\u201d which centers on Cory\u2019s point of view. However, she believed the episode could have benefited from a scene where Cory asks Topanga, \u201cWhat do you want to do about this? This happened to you... How can I best support you?\u201d",
      "Fishel said she was also confused by Cory pushing Stuart and how it\u2019s unknown if Topanga asks Cory to confront him.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t even know whether or not Topanga wants this to happen or is expecting him to say something,\u201d she said, adding that what happens to her character \u201cbecomes unimportant.\u201d",
      "As the trio continued to watch the episode, Friedle said, overall, he was \u201cso thrown by this episode.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe second Cory walks in, it is now Cory\u2019s taking over the story and it\u2019s about how he\u2019s going to deal with what happened to Topanga,\" Friedle said. \u201cThey should\u2019ve stayed with the Topanga storyline.\""

      "\u201cThe White Lotus\u201d theme song has been composed by Tapia de Veer since Season 1, and it's become one of the hallmarks of the show.",
      "The first two theme songs featured unique spins on a similar melody, composed of a series of trilling vocals, with the first striking an ominous, tropical tone and the second, a vivacious, Italian beat.",
      "But when Season 3 premiered Feb. 16, some viewers checking in to \"The White Lotus\" expressed initial disappointment at the new theme song. Season 3's song, titled \"Enlightenment,\" shirked the familiar vocals for an ethereal, instrument driven song that divided fans \u2014\u00a0with some describing it as \"spellbinding\" and others demanding \"justice.\"",
      "\u201cJail for whoever made the decision to change \u2018White Lotus\u2019 theme song,\u201d one person\u00a0wrote on TikTok\u00a0as the opening credits played on a TV.",

      "Tapia de Veer reacted to the backlash while speaking with the Times for an article that published April 2, noting of the vocals, \"I don\u2019t think everybody was really aware of how attached people were to the ooh-loo-loo-loos.\"",
      "He said after the season premiered, \"I had TMZ calling me, even people from England and from France, because they wanted some kind of statement about the theme. People are furious about the change of the theme, and I thought that was interesting.\"",
      "Tapia de Veer said he responded by telling a producer to give fans an extended version of the theme song, \"because people will explode if they realize that it was going there anyway.\"",
      "\"He thought it was a good idea. But then Mike (White, show creator and writer) cut that \u2014 he wasn\u2019t happy about that,\" Tapia de Veer said.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to HBO and representatives for White for comment but did not immediately hear back.",
      "On March 19, Tapia de Veer uploaded the uncut version to his YouTube channel anyway.",
      "\"I mean, at that point, we already had our last fight forever, I think. So he was just saying no to anything. So I just\u00a0uploaded that to my YouTube,\" he told the Times.",
      "The comment section of the video is filled with praise for the longer version of the theme song.",
      "\"Anyone else moved to almost tears and definitely goosebumps when the old theme comes in after two minutes?\" one viewer said.",
      "\"THE HULULULUS ARE SENDING ME TO HEAVEN,\" another wrote.",
      "In the interview, Tapia de Veer also described disagreements that extend beyond Season 3. He said he was \"on the phone\" with a producer \"all the time, and she was trying to convince Mike about this theme, because he didn\u2019t want the theme.\"",
      "The composer said White's original vision for the song was comparable to \"something you would listen to in Ibiza,\" adding, \"there\u2019s literally no edge to it.\"",
      "\"I just stuck to what I was doing,\" he said. \"And when I was giving versions, it was still the same thing: There were still crazy people and screaming and stuff like that. From there, it became this weird relationship of, How do I pass all this weird music into the show?\"",
      "Reflecting on his time on the show, he called it a \"good struggle.\" Tapia de Veer notably won three Emmys for his work on \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "\"That is the main thing that I\u2019m most happy about \u2014 it was worth all the tension and almost forcing the music into the show, in a way, because I didn\u2019t have that many allies in there,\" he said.",
      "He confirmed that he would not return for Season 4 of \"The White Lotus,\" which was greenlit before Season 3 premiered, per Variety.",
      "\"This is your last season, for sure?\" the Times asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah. For sure,\" he responded."

And if this is true for Mexican citizens, it is evidently even more serious for migrant populations in Mexico,\u201d Javier Urbano, professor of International Studies at the Universidad Iberoamericana, said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo.",
      "The detention center closed after the fire; last May, Gardu\u00f1o announced that it would be replaced by a new building several miles away, near the Ysleta-Zaragoza International Bridge. The new center would be overseen by Mexico\u2019s National Human Rights Commission (CNDH).",
      "\u201cWhen they set fire to the mattress, it was hot, we had no ventilation or fire protection system, and there were no fire extinguishers. We had run out of drinking water, and there was practically no water in the bathrooms,\u201d P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez said of the conditions at the facility on the day of the fire.",
      "In 2024,\u00a0a cross-border investigative report by El Paso Matters, La Verdad and Lighthouse Reports revealed new details highlighting a series of lapses in the detention center's security protocols. \u201cMigrants detained by the National Migration Institute (INM)\u00a0lacked food and water, were held in an overcrowded cell and were verbally abused and threatened with deportation,\u201d the report stated.",
      "The detention center was designed to accommodate a total of 60 people, but on the day of the fire it had a total of 90, including seven employees.",
      "Authorities said the migrants were there because they had been returned from the U.S. to Mexico under Title 42, a public health measure initially implemented by the first Trump administration during the pandemic to immediately expel migrants back to Mexico until their immigration status was resolved.",
      "A call for changes",
      "Other fatal incidents involving migrants have taken place in Mexico in recent years, and they've been attributed to organized crime. In January 2021, 19 migrants were found burned in two vans in the municipality of Camargo, Tamaulipas. In February 2015, the remains of 16 migrants from Honduras and Guatemala were found in G\u00fc\u00e9mez, another town in Tamaulipas, and the same state also saw the massacre of 72 migrants in 2010.",

      "\u201cThe National Migration Institute opened the door for us to work with them, and in two years we replaced 15 Mexican government immigration detention centers,\u201d Rend\u00f3n said. \u201cWe realized that this immigration detention center model was conceived 20 years ago as a prisonlike model, and that\u2019s part of the problem.\"",

      "\u201cThe person in charge of immigration is Gardu\u00f1o. He\u2019s the one in charge of giving the orders, and he should be involved in the case, but he\u2019s practically unindicted,\u201d he said.",
      "Noticias Telemundo contacted the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s Office and the National Institute of Migration for comment on the allegations made by survivors and advocacy organizations, but received no response.",
      "However, the INM published\u00a0an interview\u00a0with Gardu\u00f1o on social media last week announcing he would issue a public apology on April 16 in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. Gardu\u00f1o so far has denied allegations of mistreatment of the victims and their families, and emphasized that the Mexican government has provided nearly 240 million pesos (about $12 million) or 3.5 million pesos (about $171,600) to those who were directly or indirectly affected by the fire.",
      "P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez, who spent more than a year recovering, said he did receive this compensation it's not enough.",

      "Fritz Alphonse Jean spoke a day after gunfire erupted in the capital, Port-au-Prince, as thousands of protesters demanding an end to gang violence clashed with police outside the offices of the council and the prime minister. It was the biggest protest held since the council was installed a year ago.",
      "\u201cHaitian people, you\u2019ve spoken, and we\u2019ve heard you,\u201d Jean said. \u201cWe understand your misery. We know your pain and your suffering.\u201d",
      "More than 4,200 people have been reported killed across Haiti from July to February, and another 1,356 were injured, according to the U.N.",
      "Recent gang violence also left more than 60,000 people homeless in one month alone, according to the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration.",
      "\u201cThis national address comes at a decisive moment for the transitional government,\u201d said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. \u201cProtesters from various parts of the capital deliberately marched toward key government buildings to express their frustration.\u201d",
      "He noted that Jean\u2019s address marked the first anniversary of the political agreement that established the new transitional government\u2019s structure and objectives. Since then, cohesion between political parties involved in creating that government \u201chas now largely collapsed,\u201d Da Rin said.",
      "\u201cThe groups that originally supported this government are now calling for a change in leadership,\u201d he noted.",
      "The council has not addressed those concerns, which also have been voiced by the international community.",
      "During his public address, Jean rattled off a list of neighborhoods that gangs have recently attacked.",
      "\u201cYou lost your homes, you lost your businesses, you lost your jobs, they raped you, they raped your kids. The criminal gangs killed a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fight against the darkness is not insignificant. But we are not insignificant ourselves\u2026 It\u2019s nothing compared with the battle we fought to get out of slavery.\u201d",
      "Jean referenced how Haiti became the world\u2019s first free Black republic in a bid to rally support from Haitians, asking them to help law enforcement officials and eschew efforts by gangs to recruit people, especially children.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let people profit from your distress and drag you in bad directions,\u201d he said.",
      "Jean said the council would take \u201cimportant measures\u201d to help quell the persistent violence, including setting aside a special budget and incorporating agents from an armed state environmental group known as BSAP.",
      "\u201cThe council asks the prime minister and the police to take these measures without delay,\u201d Jean said. \u201cWe are telling everyone in this government that we are at war.\u201d",
      "Jean did not provide further details, including how much money would be set aside for the budget and how many BSAP agents would join the fight against gangs.",
      "Jean also said that the electoral council is working so that Haiti can have new leadership once the transitional presidential council\u2019s term ends on Feb. 7 next year. He added that officials are taking steps so that the diaspora can vote in what would be Haiti\u2019s first general elections held in almost a decade.",
      "Haiti has not had a president since former President Jovenel Mo\u00efse was assassinated in 2021, with gangs becoming increasingly powerful in the aftermath.",
      "Last year, a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police arrived in Haiti to help local authorities quell gang violence, but the mission remains understaffed and underfunded, with only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel originally envisioned.",
      "Jean\u2019s speech did not appear to resonate with those most affected by gang violence.",
      "Mario Jean-Pierre, a 53-year-old street vendor who sells used clothes that he carries on his back, said he wasn\u2019t impressed by the public address.",
      "Gang violence recently forced him and his two children to move into a makeshift shelter in the yard of Haiti\u2019s Ministry of Public Works.",
      "\u201cFlying bullets are coming at you in different directions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few people in this camp who were hit by bullets as they slept.\u201d",
      "He worries constantly about his children\u2019s safety and said he didn\u2019t believe Jean\u2019s pledge to improve security.",
      "\u201cThis speech is not any different from other speeches,\u201d he said. \u201cThey keep making promises and don\u2019t accomplish any of the promises they\u2019ve made.\u201d",
      "Da Rin noted that throughout his speech, Jean emphasized the transnational dimension of Haiti\u2019s security crisis, stressing that the gang issue is part of a broader problem involving money laundering and arms and drugs trafficking that spans several countries.",
      "\u201cBy framing Haiti\u2019s gang problem as a matter of transnational crime that goes beyond Haiti\u2019s borders, the president seems to be seeking to rally international support for further security assistance that matches the escalating threats,\u201d he said."

      "While Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia was left out of the long list, Trump slapped 10% tariffs on Heard Island and McDonald Islands, a mostly barren, tiny outpost largely populated by penguins.",
      "The island group is located in the middle of the Antarctic Ocean and remains among the world\u2019s most remote places where no humans live. Administered by the Australian government as an external territory, the island group covers 140 square miles, is about 2,400 miles southwest of mainland Australia, and requires a two-week sail for a visit.",
      "\u201cIt just shows and exemplifies the fact that nowhere on Earth is safe from this,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters Thursday, calling Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u201cnot the act of a friend.\u201dFour of Australia's external territories, including Heard Island and McDonald Islands, as well as Christmas Island, and Cocos (Keeling) Islands, received the 10% tariff floor that Trump imposed on countries with which the U.S. runs a deficit, despite near-insignificant levels of trade.",
      "According to the World Bank, the Heard and McDonald islands exported about $1.4 million worth of goods to the U.S. in 2022, most of which were unspecified \u201cmachinery and electrical\u201d products, while the U.S. exported about $21,600 to the islands in the same year. It is unclear how these goods are traded despite a lack of human habitation, but a report by The Guardian newspaper found that some goods may have been mislabeled as coming from the territory.",
      "Norfolk Island, another Australian territory with a population of about 2000 people, received a 29% tariff, triple that of the rest of the country. Norfolk Island exported about $273,000 of mostly chemicals to the U.S. in 2022, while importing $52,000 worth of goods, according to World Bank data.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs on the penguin-occupied territories caused an uproar on social media, inviting sarcastic penguin memes.",

      "\u201cDonald Trump slapped tariffs on penguins and not on Putin,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer posted Friday on X.",
      "Mike Coffin, a marine geophysicist who undertook seven research voyages to the Heard and McDonald Islands over the past four decades, said he was \u201castonished\u201d that the territory was on Trump\u2019s tariff list.",
      "The islands have no infrastructure to support human habitation, Coffin told NBC News on Friday in an email.",
      "Penguins are the most visible inhabitants in the area, with an estimated population exceeding 1 million, said Coffin, who is also an emeritus professor at the University of Tasmania in Australia. \u201cSeals are also prominent.\u201d",
      "Although Australia established a year-round research station on Heard Island in 1947, the territory hasn\u2019t been inhabited since it closed in 1954, he said.\u201cThe most recent visit by humans that I\u2019m aware of was a three-week visit of amateur\u00a0radio operators in 2016,\u201d Coffin said, adding that two Australian fishing companies are licensed to catch\u00a0fish surrounding the Heard Island and McDonald Islands.",
      "NBC News has reached out to the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s International Trade Administration and Australia\u2019s Foreign Affairs and Trade Department for comment.",
      "Heard Island and the McDonald Islands and their surrounding waters are\u00a0unique in Australia, having the country\u2019s only active volcanoes, its highest mountain and only glaciers. There are currently no commercial tour operations that visit Heard Island due to high costs and tough sailing conditions."

      "Denmark\u2019s prime minister is wrapping up a three-day visit to Greenland on Friday after telling the U.S. \u201cyou cannot annex another country,\u201d even with the argument that international security is at stake.",
      "Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen traveled to the strategically critical Arctic island as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks control of Greenland. He argues that Greenland, a semiautonomous territory belonging to the Kingdom of Denmark, is critical to U.S. security.",
      "A week ago, Vice President JD Vance visited a remote U.S. military base in Greenland and accused Denmark of underinvesting in the territory.",
      "Frederiksen pushed back against the U.S. criticism as she spoke on Thursday alongside Greenland\u2019s incoming and outgoing leaders. She argued that Denmark, a NATO ally, has been a reliable friend.",
      "Speaking in English, she said that \u201cif we let ourselves be divided as allies, then we do our foes a favor. And I will do everything that I can to prevent that from happening.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you ask our businesses to invest in the U.S., they do. When you ask us to spend more on our defense, we do; and when you ask of us to strengthen security in the Arctic, we are on the same page,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBut when you demand to take over a part of the Kingdom of Denmark\u2019s territory, when we are met by pressure and by threats from our closest ally, what are we to believe in about the country that we have admired for so many years?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is about the world order that we have built together across the Atlantic over generations: you cannot annex another country, not even with an argument about international security,\u201d Frederiksen said.",
      "The Danish leader said that, if the U.S. wants to strengthen security in the Arctic, \u201clet us do so together.\u201d",
      "Political parties in Greenland, which has been leaning toward eventual independence from Denmark for years, last week agreed to form a broad-based new coalition government in the face of Trump\u2019s designs on the territory. Those have angered many in Greenland and Denmark.",
      "In an interview with Newsmax on Thursday, Vance repeated the accusation that Denmark has \u201creally underinvested in the infrastructure and security of Greenland.\u201d",
      "He said Trump\u2019s point is that \u201cthis matters to our security, this matters to our missile defense, and we\u2019re going to protect America\u2019s interests come hell or high water.\u201d"

      "Search teams pulled more bodies from the ruins of buildings on Friday, a week after a massive earthquake rocked Myanmar killing more than 3,100 people, as the focus turns toward the urgent humanitarian needs in a country that was already devastated by civil war.",
      "United Nations humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher, who is also the emergency relief coordinator, was to arrive Friday in an effort to spur action following the quake. Ahead of his visit, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed to the international community to immediately step up funding for quake victims \u201cto match the scale of this crisis,\u201d and he urged unimpeded access to reach those in need.",
      "\u201cThe earthquake has supercharged the suffering with the monsoon season just around the corner,\u201d he said Thursday.",
      "Myanmar authorities said Thursday that 3,145 people had been killed, with another 4,589 people injured and 221 missing, and did not immediately update the figures on Friday.",
      "Britain, which had already given $13 million to purchase emergency items like food, water and shelter, pledged an additional $6.5 million in funds to match an appeal from Myanmar\u2019s Disasters Emergency Committee, according to the U.K. Embassy in Yangon.",
      "Many international search and rescue teams were also on the scene, and eight medical crews from China, Thailand, Japan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Russia were operating in Naypyitaw, according to Myanmar\u2019s military-run government. Another five teams from India, Russia, Laos and Nepal and Singapore were helping in the Mandalay region, while teams from Russia, Malaysia and the ASEAN bloc of nations were assisting in the Sagaing region.",
      "The Trump administration has pledged $2 million in emergency aid and sent a three-person team to assess how best to respond given drastic cuts to U.S. foreign assistance.",
      "On Friday, five bodies were recovered from the rubble in the capital Naypyitaw and the second-largest city of Mandalay, near the epicenter of the 7.7 magnitude earthquake March 28, authorities said. The last reported rescue came Wednesday, some 125 hours after the quake struck, when a man was saved from the wreckage of a hotel in Mandalay.",
      "The quake also shook neighboring Thailand, bringing down a high-rise under construction in Bangkok, where recovery work continued Friday. Overall, 22 people have been found dead and 35 injured in Bangkok, primarily from the construction site.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s military seized power in 2021 from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has turned into a civil war.",
      "The quake worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis, with more than 3 million people displaced from their homes and nearly 20 million in need even before it hit, according to the United Nations.",
      "As concerns grew that ongoing fighting could hamper humanitarian aid efforts, the military declared a temporary ceasefire Wednesday, through April 22. The announcement followed unilateral temporary ceasefires announced by armed resistance groups opposed to military rule.",
      "On Thursday, however, there were renewed airstrikes in Kayah state, also known as Karenni, in eastern Myanmar, according to witnesses.",
      "The military has said that it would still take \u201cnecessary\u201d measures against resistance groups, if they use the ceasefire to regroup, train or launch attacks, and the groups have said they reserved the right to defend themselves."

      "The eight judges on the Constitutional Court ruled\u00a0unanimously against Yoon, 64, finding him guilty on all counts. The decision, which was broadcast live to cheering and despairing crowds and cannot be appealed, means an election for Yoon\u2019s successor must be held within 60 days."
