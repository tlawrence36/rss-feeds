      "Country singer Parker McCollum will release his fifth studio album on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- Imagine you come from a small town in Texas and you have big dreams of being a country music star. Imagine those aspirations come true, tenfold: You win a couple Academy of Country Music Awards, a CMT Music Award and you have a couple platinum singles to your name. What's next?",
      "If you're Parker McCollum, it's new challenges. Surpassing his wildest expectations meant reveling in the carte blanche that follows \u2014 the freedom to do whatever you want. For the 33-year-old singer, that's the release of his fifth full-length project, a self-titled album out Friday.",
      "\u201cI would hang my hat on this record seven days a week,\u201d he says of the album. \u201cIt's just the most focused I've ever been.\u201d",
      "He's self-assured now, but the road to \u201cParker McCollum,\u201d the album, wasn't so steady. He originally recorded half a full-length with his longtime collaborator, producer Jon Randall. It wasn't working. \u201cI was comfortable,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cI was like, \u2018I gotta go get as uncomfortable as I can.\u201d\u2019",
      "So, he scrapped what he had, went to New York, worked with a new producer, Frank Liddell (Miranda Lambert, Lee Ann Womack, Chris Knight), and recorded what became the final album in a week.",
      "\u201cIt sounds absolutely ridiculous when you say it out loud,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cThat\u2019s a crazy way to do it, but I think it worked.\u201d",
      "It helped that McCollum had most of the songs written. \u201cI wrote \u2018Permanent Headphones\u2019 when I was 15. I wrote \u2018My Blue\u2019 in 2019. I wrote a lot of songs last year,\u201d he says. Still, they cut \u201ca couple songs a day.\u201d He credits Liddell for pulling the best songs out of him, as well as New York's industrious energy, for helping him realize the record.",
      "\u201cI'm glowing when I'm there,\u201d he says of the city. \u201cWhen I was in high school dreaming about being on a major label cutting records, you know, 'It\u2019s going to be in New York City and it\u2019s gonna be ... like a movie. And, you know, I just decided to try and actually do that.\u201d",
      "The album possesses that vigor, from the slow-building, John Mayer-esq. \u201cNew York Is On Fire\u201d to more country-and-then-some fare: \u201cSolid Country Gold,\u201d \u201cSunny Days,\u201d and \u201cWhat Kinda Man.\u201d",
      "There's also a spirited cover of Danny O\u2019Keefe's folk classic \u201cGood Time Charlie\u2019s Got The Blues\u201d with fellow Texan singer Cody Johnson, the album's sole feature. \u201cI've played that song my entire life,\u201d McCollum says.",
      "He thought, \u201cThat song is going to be cut at some point or another in my career. Might as well make it now.\u201d",
      "The narrative opener \u201cMy Blue\u201d was the first song McCollum and Liddell recorded in the studio, and it was \u201ca breeze,\u201d as McCollum describes it, \"And the worst thing happened that could have possibly happened.\u201d They thought the rest of the process would be effortless, but that's not how it goes. \u201cIt was just an absolute emotional grind for the next six and a half days. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d",
      "That led to experimentation, too. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a country singer. And the more that I listen to what I do, I\u2019m like, \u2018This doesn\u2019t really sound like country music to me,\u2019 which is hard to put your thumb on nowadays, of course, what country music really is. It\u2019s just not as narrow as it used to be. But I\u2019m like, I just don\u2019t really even care anymore. You know, maybe I\u2019m not a country singer. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t give a (expletive) anymore. Whatever it is that I do sound like, you know, that\u2019s what I wanna do.\u201d",
      "As long as the songs \u201cmake you feel something.\u201d",
      "That's something fans have long connected to, since the release of his debut, \u201cThe Limestone Kid,\u201d a decade ago.",
      "\u201cIt really eats at me to put out music that hits you where music hits me,\u201d he says. \u201cI really enjoy that chase and that journey of, \u2018Am I going to write songs that are good enough?\u2019 ... I\u2019m trying to find those answers.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Venetian activists say they are planning a boisterous but peaceful protest during this weekend's wedding between multi-billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice",
      "VENICE, Italy -- This weekend's star-studded Venice wedding of multi-billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez has galvanized activist groups that are protesting it as a sign of the growing disparity between the haves and have-nots as well as disregard of the city's residents.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 have united to protest the multi-day event under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words also referring to the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "They have staged small-scale protests, unfurling anti-Bezos banners on iconic Venetian sites. They were joined this week by Greenpeace and the British group \u201cEveryone Hates Elon,\u201d which has smashed Teslas to protest Elon Musk, to unfurl a giant banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square protesting purported tax breaks for billionaires.",
      "\u201cIF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX,\u201d read the banner, which featured a huge image of Bezos. Police quickly took it away.",
      "There has been no comment from Bezos\u2019 representatives on the protests.",
      "The local activists had planned a more organized protest for Saturday, aiming to obstruct access to canals with boats to prevent guests from reaching a wedding venue. Then they modified the protest to a march from the train station after claiming a victory, asserting that their pressure forced organizers to change the venue to the Arsenale, a more easily secured site beyond Venice's congested center.",
      "\u201cIt will be a strong, decisive protest, but peaceful,\u2019\u2019 said Federica Toninello, an activist with the Social Housing Assembly network. \u201cWe want it to be like a party, with music, to make clear what we want our Venice to look like.\"",
      "Among the 200 guests confirmed to be attending the wedding are Mick Jagger, Ivanka Trump, Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry and Leonardo DiCaprio.",
      "Venice, renowned for its romantic canal vistas, hosts hundreds of weddings each year, not infrequently those of the rich and famous. Previous celebrity weddings, like that of George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014, were embraced by the public. Hundreds turned out to wish the couple well at City Hall.",
      "Bezos has a different political and business profile, said Tommaso Cacciari, a prominent figure in the movement that successfully pushed for a ban on cruise ships over 25,000 tons traveling through the Giudecca Canal in central Venice.",
      "\u201cBezos is not a Hollywood actor,\u2019\u2019 Cacciari said. \u201cHe is an ultra-billionaire who sat next to Donald Trump during the inauguration, who contributed to his re-election and is contributing in a direct and heavy way to this new global obscurantism.\u2019\u2019",
      "Critics also cite Amazon\u2019s labor practices, ongoing tax disputes with European governments and Bezos\u2019 political associations as additional reasons for concern.",
      "Activists also argue that the Bezos wedding exemplifies broader failures in municipal governance, particularly the prioritization of tourism over residents' needs. They cite measures such as the day-tripper tax \u2014 which critics argue reinforces Venice\u2019s image as a theme park \u2014 as ineffective. Chief among their concerns is the lack of investment in affordable housing and essential services.",
      "City officials have defended the wedding. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro called the event an honor for Venice, and the city denied the wedding would cause disruptions.",
      "\"Venice once again reveals itself to be a global stage,\u2019\u2019 Brugnaro told The Associated Press, adding he hoped to meet Bezos while he was in town.",
      "Meanwhile, a Venetian environmental research association, Corila, issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d",
      "Corila, which unites university scholars and Italy\u2019s main national research council in researching Venetian protection strategies, wouldn\u2019t say how much Bezos was donating but said contact began in April, well before the protests started.",

      "The birds scattered in every direction as the first drumbeat thundered across the plaza outside Paris\u2019s Centre Pompidou, heralding the start of Pharrell Williams\u2019 latest Louis Vuitton spectacle",
      "PARIS -- The birds scattered in every direction as the first drumbeat thundered across the plaza outside Paris\u2019 Pompidou Center Tuesday, clearing the way for a different kind of flight: Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z swept into the front row.",
      "The star couple anchored a guest list at Pharrell Williams\u2019 latest Louis Vuitton spectacle that doubled as a map of contemporary culture now: Bradley Cooper, J-Hope, Karol G, Pinkpanthress, Future, Pusha T, Jackson Wang, Bambam, Mason Thames, Miles Caton, D\u2019Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Malcolm Washington, Jalen Ramsey, and A$AP Nast. If there was any question about the gravitational pull of Louis Vuitton under Williams, it evaporated before the first look hit the runway.",
      "This was no ordinary catwalk: Williams \u2014 half showman, half pop impresario \u2014 staged a cultural passage from Paris to Mumbai, fusing Indian tradition and modern dandyism into a punchy, sunstruck vision of the Vuitton man in 2026.",
      "In Vuitton\u2019s world, a show is never just a show. It\u2019s a takeover, a mood. On Tuesday, the Pompidou\u2019s iconic colored pipes served as a sci-fi backdrop for a set dreamed up with Studio Mumbai architect Bijoy Jain: a lifesize \u201cSnakes and Ladders\u201d board, alluding to both the child\u2019s game and the adult risks of fashion\u2019s global game. For Williams, the house\u2019s mantra of travel is less about destination, more about movemen. Up, down, sideways, sunward.",
      "The clothes? This season, they marched to their own drumbeat. Out came models in Indian-style chunky sandals, striped boxy shorts and blue preppy shirts with sleeves billowing like monsoon sails. Silken cargo pants shimmered in the sun; pin-striped puffers added a louche, almost Bollywood-kitsch edge. Cricket jerseys appeared with jeweled collars or \u2014 why not? \u2014 a puffy hood dripping with rhinestones. Blue pearlescent leather bombers flirted with the bling of Mumbai\u2019s film sets, while pin-striped tailoring riffed on both the British Raj and Parisian boulevardiers.",
      "If all this felt like cultural collision, that\u2019s by design. Williams\u2019 Vuitton has become a mood board for global wanderlust: the checked silks, the mismatched stripes, the trompe l\u2019oeil fabrics that look sun-faded by actual adventures. It\u2019s a nod to the itinerant dandyism that\u2019s fast becoming his Vuitton calling card. Less about nostalgia, more about now.",
      "But don\u2019t mistake the globe-trotting optimism for naivety. There\u2019s calculation in the chaos. Williams\u2019 references bounce from Kenzo \u2019s Nigo (his onetime collaborator) to Indian contemporary artisans \u2014 like the hand-beaded snakes slithering across shirts, or the sandalwood-scented linens that recall a summer in Rajasthan. The \u201cworldwide community\u201d Vuitton preaches is real, but it\u2019s also realpolitik: What could be more luxurious in 2025 than clothing that tries to please everyone and everywhere, without losing itself?",
      "Of course, with Vuitton, the accessories make the man and this season\u2019s bags, bejeweled sandals and hardware-heavy necklaces delivered the requisite Instagram bait, each a covetable passport stamp in leather or gold. It\u2019s maximalism, sure, but not just for the TikTok set: the craftsmanship, from sun-bleached cloth to hand-loomed stripes, rewards anyone who bothers to look twice.",
      "If there\u2019s a criticism, it\u2019s that sometimes the noise of references threatens to drown out the signal. Williams piles motif on motif, color on color, joy on joy, until coherence blurs into sheer, Dionysian energy. But maybe that\u2019s the point: In a season of global anxiety the Vuitton man chooses to strut, sparkle, and swerve.",
      "LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury group, posted record revenue of 84.7 billion euros in 2024, with its Fashion & Leather Goods division anchored by Louis Vuitton still leading the pack. With a market value near $455 billion and over 6,300 stores worldwide, Vuitton remains the world\u2019s most valuable luxury brand. Even with a recent dip in sales, its scale and influence are unmatched.",
      "As the last look circled the Pompidou and the birds resettled, Vuitton\u2019s odyssey felt less like a fashion show and more like an announcement: the world is a game board, the ladders are real, and Louis Vuitton is still rolling the dice.",

      "Former teen idol Bobby Sherman has died at 81",
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and \u201970s with bubblegum pop hits like \u201cLittle Woman\u201d and \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d has died. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \u201cBobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace.\u201d Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky-clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunchboxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide\u2019s list of \u201cTV\u2019s 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\u201d",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the \u201960s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d \u201cEasy Come, Easy Go,\u201d and \u201cLa La La (If I Had You).\u201d He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \u201cHere Comes Bobby,\u201d which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump start when he was cast in the ABC rock \u2019n\u2019 roll show \u201cShindig!\u201d in the mid-\u201960s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \u201cHere Come the Brides\u201d (1968-70) and \u201cGetting Together\u201d (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified medical emergency technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, people say, \u2018Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?\u2019\u201d he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019d change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could\u2019ve relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\u201d",
      "Sherman, with sky blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high-school rock band.",
      "\u201cI was brought up in a fairly strict family,\u201d he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \u201cLaw and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people\u2019s feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn\u2019t do things just to be mischievous.\u201d",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \u201cShindig!\u201d",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \u201cHere Come the Brides,\u201d a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show\u2019s theme song, \u201cSeattle,\u201d and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \u201cGetting Together,\u201d a spinoff of \u201cThe Partridge Family,\u201d about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\u201cWhile the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman\u2019s smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\u201d The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \u201cWild In Streets,\u201d \u201cHe is My Brother\u201d and \u201cGet Crazy.\u201d",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \u201cI\u2019d film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn\u2019t know what home was.\u201d",
      "Sherman\u2019s pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses and he became the family\u2019s first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation from the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cIf I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I\u2019m in my own car,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times. \u201cI carry equipment with me. And there\u2019s not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\u201d",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman\u2019s partner what his name was. \u201cWhen he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn\u2019t tell her my name was Sherman,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD\u2019s Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI\u2019s Exceptional Service Award and the \u201cTwice a Citizen\u201d Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon wrote: \u201cBobby is a stellar example of the statement \u2018to protect and serve.\u2019 We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\u201d",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \u201cTeen Idols Tour\u201d with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman\u2019s Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman\u2019s performances: \u201cDressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with \u2018Easy Come, Easy Go.\u2019 As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\u201d",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children\u2019s Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health, and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",
      "\u201cEven in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That\u2019s who Bobby was \u2014 brave, gentle, and full of light,\u201d Poublon wrote.",

Ralphs had a stroke days after what would be his final performance with the band at London's O2 Arena in 2016, and had been bedridden ever since, the statement said. No further details on the circumstances of his death were provided.",
      "Ralphs is set to become a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Bad Company in November.",
      "\u201cOur Mick has passed, my heart just hit the ground,\" Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers said in a statement. \u201cHe has left us with exceptional songs and memories. He was my friend, my songwriting partner, an amazing and versatile guitarist who had the greatest sense of humour.\u201d",
      "Ralphs wrote the 1970's song \u201cReady for Love\u201d for Mott the Hoople, later revamped for Bad Company's 1974 debut album, which also included the Ralphs-penned hit \u201cCan't Get Enough.\u201d He co-wrote Bad Company's 1975 classic \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love\u201d with Rodgers.",
      "Born in Stoke Lacy, Herefordshire, England, Ralphs began playing blues guitar as a teenager, and in his early 20s in 1966, he co-founded the Doc Thomas Group. In 1969, the band would become Mott the Hoople, a name taken from the title and title character of a 1966 novel by Willard Manus.",
      "The group's self-titled first album, recorded in a week, won a cult following, but the two that followed were critical and financial flops. They finally found popular success and became glam-rock giants with the 1972 David Bowie-penned-and-produced song \u201cAll the Young Dudes.\" But Ralphs felt creatively cramped in the band led by singer-songwriter Ian Hunter and left in 1973.",
      "He would soon form Bad Company with Rodgers, a singer who had left his own band, Free.",
      "The two had intended only to write songs together, and possibly to make a one-off album as a project. But when Free drummer Simon Kirke asked to sit in, they realized they were nearly a proper group already and went seeking a bassist. They found him in former King Crimson member Boz Burrell.",
      "\u201cWe didn't actually plan to have a band,\u201d Ralphs said in a 2015 interview with Gibson Guitars. \u201cIt was all kind of accidental I suppose. Lucky, really.\u201d",
      "Kirke said in a statement Monday that Ralphs was \u201ca dear friend, a wonderful songwriter, and an exceptional guitarist. We will miss him deeply.\"",
      "Bad Company found immediate success. its albums were full of radio-ready anthems, and its live sound was perfectly suited to the 1970s height of arena rock.",
      "Their self-titled debut album went to No. 1 on Billboard's album chart. And Ralphs' \u201cCan't Get Enough\u201d \u2014 often mistakenly called \u201cCan\u2019t Get Enough of Your Love\u201d because of its chorus lyrics \u2014 would be their biggest hit single, peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.",
      "\u201cWe actually did the whole thing in one take live,\u201d Ralphs said in the Gibson interview. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect, but we just said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s great, it\u2019s going to capture the moment.\u2019 That\u2019s what I like to do in recording. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect as long as it captures the moment. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d",
      "Bad Company's 1975 follow-up, \u201cStraight Shooter,\u201d was also a hit, going to No. 3 on album charts in both the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. and the UK Albums Chart.",
      "Its opening track, \u201cGood Lovin' Gone Bad,\u201d written by Ralphs, was a modest hit, and the song that followed it, \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love,\u201d was a big one that would remain in rotation on classic rock radio for decades.",
      "The band's statement says Ralphs is survived by \u201cthe love of his life,\u201d his wife Susie Chavasse, along with two children, three step-children and \u201cbeloved bandmates\u201d Rodgers and Kirke.",
      "\u201cOur last conversation a few days ago we shared a laugh,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be our last.\u201d",

      "MILAN -- Giorgio Armani\u2019s menswear collection for the next warm weather season encoded the geography of summer in textures, geometrical designs and his signature relaxed silhouettes.",
      "The 90-year-old designer skipped the runway preview show closing Milan Fashion Week on Monday to recover from an undisclosed condition, but his fashion house said he kept a hand in the designs and watched the runway show on livestream.",
      "It was the first time in his career that the designer was absent.",
      "Taking the closing bow in his stead was Armani\u2019s longtime head of menswear, Leo Dell\u2019Orco, who has worked alongside Armani for 45 of the Giorgio Armani fashion house\u2019s 50 years.",
      "\u201cHe liked it,\u2019\u2019 Dell\u2019Orco told reporters after the show, adding that Armani was especially happy to see that he had sent male-female couples down the mostly menswear runway in matching looks, underlining their versatility.",
      "The collection was classic Armani: roomy wide pleated trousers paired with a seemingly endless array of softly constructed jackets, from a double-breasted made casual with shawl collars to shirt-weight leather coats. Vests with a deep-V front substituted for shirts, for looks that transition from work to leisure.",
      "The collection found balance in the melding of textures \u2013 raw linen, woven leather, soft suede and flowing silk. From a distance, ensembles may have appeared monochromatic, but a closer look revealed a harmonious blending of seemingly mismatched geometrical patterns and textures, adding depth to the looks.",
      "There was a touch of the exotic in the shapes, like Nehru collar, tunics or a kimono jacket, reflecting Armani\u2019s love of travel, without overwhelming the mood.",
      "Delicate decorative pins reflected the light, the sole adornment. Beachy touches included rope sandals and belts, which cinched through a loop.",
      "The showroom was awash in Mediterranean blue and featured installations of obsidian black stones, reflecting the sophisticated color palette that included washed-out desert shades, the palest green, deep blues and urban blacks and gray.",
      "Front-row guests included actors Giancarlo Esposito, who most recently appeared in \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u2019\u2019 and Jason Isaacs, who was in the third season of \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Twenty-five years ago, a little girl with a bob haircut appeared on our TVs, speaking a mix of English and Spanish, with a spunky, can-do spirit. She had an adventure planned, a backpack, a monkey friend and upbeat songs.",
      "\u201cHi, I\u2019m Dora. What\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked.",
      "This was, of course, \u201cDora the Explorer,\u201d the first Latina to lead a major cartoon series and the girl who helped spearhead the rise of multicultural children\u2019s programming in the U.S. on her way to becoming a cultural phenomenon.",
      "\u201cThe show allowed Latinos to be depicted on TV as educators, teaching viewers how to speak our language, and yet at the same time, just teaching ordinary things that children need to learn,\u201d said Brenda Victoria Castillo, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition.",

      "\u201cThe great thing about Dora is that, yes, she celebrates Latin culture through every aspect \u2014 language, food, dress and music,\u201d says Ramsey Naito president of animation at Paramount and Nickelodeon. \u201cBut she also empowers everybody to be their true self and to be brave. She\u2019s not exclusive. She\u2019s inclusive.\u201d",
      "Kathleen Herles had a special vantage point to see Dora's influence: She was the original voice of the pint-size heroine, cast in the role when she was 7 and staying until she was 18 and off to college.",
      "\u201cIt has been the longest journey and the greatest adventure of my life \u2014 no pun intended,\u201d said Herles, who grew up in New York City to parents of Peruvian descent.",
      "On the convention circuit, Herles would see firsthand the power of Dora. \u201cI remember I would make kids cry, not intentionally,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir mind goes to a memory, to a moment, it's just incredible. It\u2019s so special, it\u2019s magical.\u201d",
      "Herles has lately been the voice actor for Dora's mom on \u201cDora,\u201d the reboot that started in 2024. It's a full-circle moment for the actor and singer: \u201cIt changed my life forever, twice.\u201d",

      "\u201cDora\u201d co-creator Chris Gifford has watched his creation age up and down and take human form. \u201cShe has been older and she has been younger and she has a hair clip now,\u201d he says. \u201cHer essence, her positive spirit, her I-can-do-anything-with-your-help attitude has stuck through.\u201d",
      "Dora is firmly part of the culture, as big as her Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon. There's a reference to her in \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d she's been mocked on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and if you look carefully at the PBS show \u201cAlma's Way,\u201d you can see a Dora doll in that heroine's bedroom. TikTok users have embraced the \u201cBackpack Song.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose kids coming of age now \u2014 the ones who 25 years ago were just watching it as little preschoolers \u2014 they\u2019re out there and they\u2019re remembering,\u201d says Valerie Walsh Valdes, co-creator of the original series and an executive producer on the new series and movie.",

      "Nickelodeon suggested the girl be Latina and the creators ran with it, making her pan-Latina so no one would feel excluded. Latin representation on TV \u2014 then and now \u2014 has been a struggle.",
      "The Latino Donor Collaborative\u2019s 2024 Latinos in Media report found that Latino actors made up 9.8% of the main cast in lead, co-lead and ensemble roles in scripted shows. In non-scripted television, Latino hosts made up only 5% of host roles. That\u2019s despite Latin people making up nearly 20% of the country.",
      "\u201cThere were few programs at the time that featured Latina protagonists with Dora\u2019s skin tone or features, so from that perspective, the representation is valuable,\u201d says Erynn Masi de Casanova, head of the Sociology Department at the University of Cincinnati.",
      "Dora was put in an animated world inside a computer, and the creators asked kids to help make the show better. They hired education consultants to tease out the skills Dora teaches, like spatial understanding and interpersonal. They brought in language and culture experts.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\u201d became her signature song.",
      "The series is seen in more than 150 countries and territories and translated in 32 languages on Nickelodeon channels and Paramount+. In English-speaking countries such as the United States and Australia, Dora teaches Spanish; in other markets \u2014 including the Hispanic U.S. markets \u2014 she teaches English.",
      "Samantha Lorraine, 18, who grew up in Miami of Cuban heritage, had the Dora T-shirts and backpack. She laughs that she once even had the Dora bob.",
      "In July, she's starring as Dora in \u201cDora and the Search of Sol Dorado,\u201d which was filmed in Colombia. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing my audition since day one,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be stepping into Dora\u2019s shoes. It\u2019s such a huge legacy,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be able to be a part of representation where it counts. And Dora is the epitome of that.\u201d",
      "Castillo, of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, puts Dora up there with Mickey Mouse in terms of an instantly recognized cultural character and says she's relevant more than ever.",
      "\u201cWe need more Doras,\u201d she says. \u201cIf people were just open to being educated in other people\u2019s languages and cultures and beliefs and not see it as a threat, we wouldn\u2019t be in the situation that we\u2019re in this country and the world.\u201d",

      "The University of Chicago Crime Lab's Policing Leadership Academy tackles some serious topics like how to make data-driven decisions or how to help officers handle on-the-job trauma",
      "CHICAGO -- Three dozen police captains pair off in a Chicago conference room to play a game: They must start a sentence with the last word their partner used.",
      "Many exchanges are nonsensical, full of one-upmanship using difficult words and laughter. But the improvisation game eventually makes sense.",
      "\u201cWhat we are trying to do, is get you to listen to the end of the sentence,\u201d says Kelly Leonard, wrapping up the improvisational exercise. \u201cIf my arm was a sentence, when do most people stop listening? Always the elbow! But then you're missing everything that goes after... and sometimes that's critical information.\u201d",
      "The police captains who have flown in from departments across the country nod. \u201cI definitely do that,\" some call out.",
      "Officials at the University of Chicago Crime Lab's Policing Leadership Academy brought members of The Second City, Chicago's storied improv theater, to teach police leaders the more diverse skills found in improv exercises \u2014 like thinking on your feet, reserving judgment and fully listening.",
      "The academy, a workshop taught over five months, tackles some serious topics like to make data-driven decisions or how to help officers handle on-the-job trauma.",
      "\u201cWe call it yoga for social skills,\u201d said Leonard, the vice president of Creative Strategy, Innovation and Business Development at The Second City.",
      "The skills might not apply to all policing situations in the field, but being a better listener or learning to take a breath before responding can make for better leaders, according to Tree Branch, a strategic client partner at The Second City Works.",
      "The creation of improv and of The Second City is rooted in social work. Both trace their beginnings to Viola Spolin, who created some of the exercises still used in improv while she was a resettlement worker in the 1920s helping immigrant children and local Chicago children connect. Spolin was also the mother of Second City cofounder, Paul Sills.",
      "The Policing Leadership Academy's creators believe those skills can also help meet their goals to increase community engagement, improve officer morale and ultimately reduce violent crime.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to make the case that you can do all three things,\" without compromising one over the other, said Kim Smith, director of programs at the Crime Lab.",
      "The academy is focused on working with leaders from departments dealing with high levels of community gun violence and pays for them to fly to Chicago one week a month to attend the five-month training.",
      "Crime Lab researchers found that district and precinct captains have the largest potential impact on their colleagues, despite often receiving little leadership training for the job. A precinct could have high marks for morale, community relationships, or be making a dent in crime numbers, but if the captain changes, those gains could plummet, researchers found, even if the community, the officers and everything else stayed the same.",
      "Professors, researchers and police leaders teach courses on topics like developing transparent policing cultures, using and collecting data, managing stress and building community partnerships. So far, about 130 police leaders from about 70 departments including tribal police departments and even a police inspector from Toronto have participated.",
      "Capt. Louis Higginson with the Philadelphia Police Department said the academy provided a much broader training than the two weeks of police job training he got before being promoted to captain a little more than a year ago.",
      "\u201cThe big thing for me was thinking about the things we allow to happen because they\u2019ve been that way before us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the ways we can change the culture of our district by changing the thinking around why we do things.\u201d",
      "He said he did some of the improv exercises with his wife and daughters when he returned home and it opened up communication in a way he hadn\u2019t expected.",
      "\u201cI think it opened their eyes, like it did for me,\u201d Higginson said.",
      "Albuquerque Police Department Commander Ray Del Greco said he\u2019s still thinking more about how he communicates weeks after the improv class.",
      "\u201cWhen people talk to you and come to have you help solve their issues, to be able to push your ego out and worry less about your own agenda and listen, that\u2019s an understanding of leadership,\u201d Del Greco said. \u201cTo me that was the most valuable class we had.\u201d",
      "Academy leaders stressed the learning doesn't stop at graduation. They create communication channels so classmates can continue to support each other, they encourage captains to put on trainings with their departments, and participants are required to implement a capstone project that lasts well past the last day of class and addresses a real problem in their district or department.",
      "Many of the projects implement programs to address specific crimes, like involving the community in programs to prevent car thefts or piloting drones as first responders. One previous graduate created a partnership with community groups to increase community pride and reduce gun violence by reducing quality of life issues like littering, overgrown lots and graffiti.",
      "Stephen Donohue, a San Jose Police Department captain and recent academy graduate, is creating an early intervention system focusing on officer wellness. A typical system might flag citizen complaints or driving accidents, but Donohue's program gathers input from supervisors and peers to flag when an officer is taking on too much on-duty trauma, such as multiple murders or shooting investigations within a short time.",
      "\u201cIt's a Venn diagram between training, wellness and internal affairs,\" he said. \"And we can help them, we can lessen use-of-force complaints and allegations, offer better training and improve services put out by the department.\u201d",
      "The trainers hope in a few years more captains and officers will be saying \u201cyes and\u201d during improv classes. They are keeping tabs through a randomized control study on how well the overall training works. And with that evidence they hope funders, police departments or other universities will help expand the trainings to more departments.",
      "\u201cWe want there to be rigorously tested scientific evidence behind this,\u201d said Academy Executive Director Meredith Stricker. \u201cWe work to design a curriculum to ultimately make better leaders and better policing. The participants definitely talk about the improv class as one of their favorites. We hope all of it will work in tandem.\u201d",

      "The Vatican\u2019s sphere, which occupies a central place in the Pigna Courtyard of the Vatican Museums, features an internal mechanism that rotates with the wind. \u201cIn my work I see the cracks, the eroded parts, the destructive potential that emerges from our time of disillusionment,\u201d the Vatican quoted Pomodoro as saying about its sphere.",
      "The United Nations in New York received a 3.3-meter (10 foot, eight inch) diameter \u201cSphere Within Sphere\u201d sculpture as a gift from Italy in 1996. The U.N. sphere has refers to the coming of the new millennium, the U.N. said: \u201ca smooth exterior womb erupted by complex interior forms,\u201d and \u201ca promise for the rebirth of a less troubled and destructive world,\u201d Pomodoro said of it.",
      "Other spheres are located at museums around the world and outside the Italian foreign ministry, which has the original work that Pomodoro created in 1966 for the Montreal Expo that began his monumental sculpture project.",
      "Pomodoro was born in Montefeltro, Italy, on June 23, 1926. In addition to his spheres, he designed theatrical sets, land projects and machines. He had multiple retrospectives and taught at Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley and Mills College, according to his biography on the foundation website.",

      "NEW YORK -- Neither Pixar nor zombies were enough to topple \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\" from the No. 1 slot at North American box offices over the weekend. The Universal Pictures live-action remake remained the top film, bringing in $37 million in ticket sales in its second weekend, despite the sizeable new releases of \u201cElio\u201d and \u201c28 Years Later.\u201d , according to studio estimates Sunday. \u201cHow To Train Your Dragon\u201d has rapidly amassed $358.2 million worldwide.",
      "Six years after its last entry, the Dean DeBlois-directed \u201cHow To Train Your Dragon\u201d has proven a potent revival of the DreamWorks Animation franchise. A sequel is already in the works for the $150 million production, which remakes the 2010 animated tale about a Viking boy and his dragon.",
      "Pixar's \u201cElio\u201d had a particularly tough weekend. The Walt Disney Co. animation studio has often launched some of its biggest titles in June, including \u201cCars,\u201d \u201cWALL-E\u201d and \u201cToy Story 4.\u201d But \u201cElio,\u201d a science fiction adventure about a boy who dreams of meeting aliens, notched a modest $21 million, the lowest opening ever for Pixar.",
      "\u201cThis is a weak opening for a new Pixar movie,\u201d said David A.

      "\u201cElio,\u201d originally set for release in early 2024, had a bumpy road to the screen. Adrian Molina \u2014 co-director of \u201cCoco\u201d \u2014 was replaced mid-production by Domee Shi (\u201cTurning Red\u201d) and Madeline Sharafian. Back at Disney\u2019s D23 conference in 2022, America Ferrera appeared to announce her role as Elio\u2019s mother, but the character doesn\u2019t even exist in the revamped film.",
      "Disney and Pixar spent at least $150 million making \u201cElio,\u201d which didn\u2019t fare any better internationally than it did in North America, bringing in just $14 million from 43 territories. Pixar stumbled coming out of the pandemic before stabilizing performance with 2023\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d ($496.4 million worldwide) and 2024\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d ($1.7 billion), which was the company's biggest box office hit.",
      "\u201cElemental\u201d was Pixar's previously lowest earning film, launching with $29.6 million. It rallied in later weeks to collect nearly half a billion dollars at the box office. The company's first movie, \u201cToy Story,\u201d opened with $29.1 million in 1995, or $60 when adjusted for inflation. It remains to be seen whether \u201cElio's\u201d decent reviews and \u201cA\u201d from CinemaScore audiences can lead it to repeat \u201cElemental's\u201d trajectory.",
      "With most schools on summer break, the competition for family audiences was stiff. Disney\u2019s own \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d another live-action remake, continued to pull in young moviegoers. It grossed $9.7 million in its fifth weekend, bringing its global tally to $910.3 million. .",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d signaled the return of another, far gorier franchise. Director Danny Boyle reunited with screenwriter Alex Garland to resume their pandemic apocalypse thriller 25 years after \u201c28 Days Later\u201d and 18 years after its sequel, \u201c28 Weeks Later.\u201d",
      "The Sony Pictures release opened with $30 million. That was good enough to give Boyle, the filmmaker of \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201cTrainspotting,\u201d the biggest opening weekend of his career. The film, which cost $60 million to make, jumps ahead nearly three decades from the outbreak of the so-called rage virus for a coming-of-age story about a 12-year-old (Alfie Williams) venturing out of his family\u2019s protected village. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes co-star.",
      "Reviews have been good (90% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) for \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d though audience reaction (a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore) is mixed. Boyle has more plans for the zombie franchise, which will next see the release of \u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d next year from director Nia DaCosta.",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d added another $30 million in 59 overseas markets.",

      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- A judge has denied singer R. Kelly 's request to be freed from prison, saying she lacks jurisdiction to consider the convicted sex offender's allegations that federal prison officials plotted to murder him.",
      "U.S. District Judge Martha M. Pacold canceled Friday's scheduled arguments in Chicago, and instead issued a five-page ruling denying his emergency request to serve his time on home detention during a temporary furlough.",
      "Born Robert Sylvester Kelly, the 58-year-old Grammy-winning R&B singer is serving sentences at a prison in Butner, North Carolina, for child sex crimes and racketeering.",
      "Pacold noted that federal courts have only limited power in such cases, and one by one she examined and rejected various ways Kelly's request could be considered.",
      "\u201cJurisdictional limitations must be respected even where, as here, a litigant claims that the circumstances are extraordinary,\u201d Pacold wrote. \"Kelly has not identified (nor is the court aware of) any statute or rule that authorizes the court to exercise jurisdiction. Thus, the court cannot award relief in this case.\u201d",
      "Kelly claimed in a series of filings this month that prison officials solicited white supremacist leaders to kill him, to halt the disclosure of information damaging to prison officials.",
      "Kelly's attorney says he was then moved to solitary confinement and purposely given an overdose of medication, which required hospitalization and surgery for blood clots.",

      "Known for such hits as \u201cI Believe I Can Fly,\u201d Kelly was found guilty in Chicago in 2022 of three charges of producing child sexual abuse images and three charges of enticement of minors for sex. In New York in 2021, he was found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking. He is serving most of his 20-year Chicago sentence and 30-year New York sentence simultaneously.",
      "His appeals have been unsuccessful, including to the U.S. Supreme Court. Kelly has also sought President Donald Trump\u2019s help.",

    "story": [
      "Keke Palmer is giving her take on her 2023 public breakup with her ex Darius Jackson on her new album, \u2018Just Keke",
      "NEW YORK -- A sheer dress silhouetting a black body suit, Usher\u2019s signature crowd interaction and a tweet from her child\u2019s father: that concoction created a nearly two-week social media frenzy starring Keke Palmer back in 2023. Now, the multi-hyphenate creative has channeled that experience into her new album, \u201cJust Keke.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was tough \u2026 I didn\u2019t even realize I was in such grief,\u201d said the 31-year-old about the fallout of her extremely public breakup with her ex, Darius Jackson. \u201cI get to put that same emotion into a song, and I get tell those people that\u2019s been watching me since I was nine \u2026 what\u2019s going on in a way that it can translate.\u201d",
      "Following 2023\u2019s \u201cBig Boss,\u201d her third solo studio project, out now, is an 18-track visual album conceptualized and directed by Palmer and her team. Tayla Parx, who\u2019s written for Alicia Keys, Justin Bieber and Dua Lipa, handled the bulk of the writing and executive produced with Palmer. The storyline follows Palmer musically navigating celebrity, motherhood and self-reflection. But her vulnerability about her well-publicized relationship drama is the album\u2019s throughline.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what artistry is \u2026 mine is about transmutation, it\u2019s about bringing closure,\u201d said Palmer, who\u2019s usually mum about her romantic relationships. \u201cI have to address something that I would never address, especially nothing on an intimate level \u2014 that\u2019s just so not me. But I knew that I had to because now that it\u2019s become public, it\u2019s become a part of my work, and I have to respond to it as such. And that just caused me to have to grow.\u201d",
      "While attending Usher\u2019s popular Las Vegas residency in 2023, the Emmy winner danced closely with the music icon during his routine audience interaction segment. Social videos of the interaction prompted a viral tweet from Jackson, her ex-boyfriend and child\u2019s father, criticizing her attire, writing, \u201cIt\u2019s the outfit tho.. you a mom.\u201d",
      "While he was quickly admonished online, the conversation eventually moved beyond social media to articles and think pieces tackling subjects ranging from patriarchy, women\u2019s attire, and having children before marriage.",
      "Standout tracks on \u201cJust Keke\u201d include \u201cMy Confession\u201d \u2014 a tongue-in-cheek interpolation of Usher\u2019s hit \"Confessions, Pt. II\" \u2014 as well as the previously released \"125 Degrees\u201d and \u201cOff Script.\u201d She passionately belts out her love on the ballad \u201cUnless It\u2019s You,\u201d while \u201cMisunderstood\u201d finds her asking, \u201cDon\u2019t you see me throwing out a lifeline? / You too busy pinning me the bad guy / Maybe we ain\u2019t doing what we should / or maybe we\u2019re just misunderstood.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat the project, I think, speaks to as well is just like reclamation,\u201d said the \u201cNope\u201d star, admitting the album could reignite criticism about her personal life. \u201cI\u2019m just Keke, hate it or love it. This is me, this is my story, this is how I see things, I see my life \u2026 the whole point of it, too, is making peace with just saying what you got to say and letting it be that.\u201d",
      "While Palmer\u2019s mic is still hot, she\u2019s extremely booked and busy on Hollywood lots: a sequel to \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d and she stars with Eddie Murphy and Pete Davidson in \u201cThe Pickup\u201d from Prime Video in August. The \u201cAkeelah and the Bee\u201d actor will lead Peacock\u2019s upcoming TV adaptation of Mel Brook\u2019s \u201cThe \u2019Burbs,\u201d and she\u2019ll join the team on \u201cSpaceballs 2\u201d with original stars Bill Pullman and Rick Moranis, the latter a reclusive \u201880s and \u201990s star who\u2019s since largely stayed out of Hollywood.",
      "Palmer says she\u2019ll judge the success of \u201cJust Keke\u201d not necessarily by sales or Billboard charts, but by potential opportunities that arise, whether it\u2019s creating and directing visual albums for other artists, helming her own musical and comedic variety show, or even embarking on her own world tour.",
      "\u201cIt could look like so many things, and I\u2019m open to all of them,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cAs long as I know that I put my all into this, I know I can\u2019t lose.\u201d",

      "Trailblazing deaf actor Marlee Matlin opens up in the new documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d",
      "When American Masters approached Marlee Matlin about doing a documentary, Matlin had one name in mind to direct: Shoshanna Stern.",
      "Like Matlin, Stern is deaf. She also hadn\u2019t directed before. But Matlin, who herself became the first deaf person in the Directors Guild of America just a few years ago, was certain she was up to the task.",
      "The resulting film, \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore\u201d is an intimate look at her life: Growing up in a hearing family; winning the best actress Oscar at 21 for her first movie role in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d which film critic Rex Reed at the time called a \u201cpity vote\u201d; what she's described as an abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; getting sober; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.",
      "It\u2019s also an evocative portal into the world of the deaf community that uses groundbreaking techniques and sound design to put American Sign Language (ASL) and visual communication first. The film opens in select theaters Friday.",
      "While Matlin told much of her story in the memoir \u201cI\u2019ll Scream Later,\u201d on some level it wasn\u2019t a completely satisfactory experience. Before the #MeToo movement, its revelations were not treated entirely seriously in the media. But a documentary also provided an opportunity.",
      "\u201cWe communicate visually,\u201d she said.",
      "Matlin and Stern spoke though translators to The Associated Press about the \u201cCODA\u201d effect, making the doc on their terms, and why they hope Reed sees this film. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "STERN: I had never seen a deaf person direct an episode of TV or film. Never. I thought, what does that even look like? I didn\u2019t realize until I took the job that really the whole form of documentary as we know it is really rooted in sound, in the assumption that people will be speaking and they can speak. I thought, what are we going to do when we\u2019re using American Sign Language? I have to reframe a whole form of documentary. We have to be able to see what a visually-based documentary is going to look like.",
      "We wouldn\u2019t do justice to Marlee\u2019s life if I had forced this form that really wasn\u2019t rooted in the way that she experienced this life. And that was exciting to do. Scary for some people out there, but I never felt scared in making this documentary because she believed in me.",
      "MATLIN: If I had had a hearing director approach me to do this project, we could have done a very good job, but that person would not have seen me in the same way. They would not have the same lens as a deaf person.",
      "STERN: I did want to film with captions in mind, so I made sure that we did have a wider frame. We figured out visual voiceover with a split screen that we added. We did this little surgery with words and syllables in one of the scenes where we mixed them all around to be able to bring people into how Marlee experiences conversations and the world. We wanted to make this documentary an immersive experience for the audience members, a sensory experience to help them understand.",
      "MATLIN: \u201cCODA\u201d certainly was a milestone and respected by so many people in the industry. It tackled a lot of things that both deaf and hearing people or audiences can identify with. I love the fact that they burnt in the captions. That you can\u2019t just turn it off.",
      "And I hoped that all the love we received and the three Academy Awards that we got would make a difference. It was honored on so many other levels too as well, whether we\u2019re talking about (director) Sian (Heder) or you\u2019re talking about Troy (Kotsur) or the SAG award which was just a dream come true, specifically of mine. I took that opportunity to specifically address that that we \u201cexist,\u201d that we want to be actors just like you, we want to be directors, we want be producers, we want to be hair and wardrobe stylists. We want to work in all levels of production. So \u201cCODA\u201d really elevated that conversation about how much we wanted to be part of the industry. But for some reason it didn\u2019t really break open the door as wide as I would have thought. Yet we just don\u2019t give up. We are persistent. Because it is what it is. We are working on our own levels to make changes.",
      "STERN: Marlee said something really brave when we were at Sundance. She said, \u201cIt won\u2019t last.\u201d The moment, yes, in the moment. But I don\u2019t know if we have movement.",
      "MATLIN: There\u2019s so many stories that we can tell, so many stories that you can put up on screen, so many stories that we can put on stage.",
      "I\u2019d like to see action because I\u2019ve been hearing that, \u201cYes, we have to do this\u201d or \u201cI will do this,\u201d but it\u2019s been 40 years. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m complaining. I just want to make sure that we put our money where our mouth is.",
      "I go back to that comment about Rex Reed. I wonder if he would ever see this film. I\u2019d love to see if he has the balls to make a comment and say, \"Oh look, I realize I might have said something wrong.\"",
      "That\u2019s just one example of the things I\u2019d like to see happen. And maybe the people who interviewed me over the years. I don\u2019t want you to misunderstand me, I have a great deal of respect for them. But specifically, I am calling out Rex Reed. So, you know, sorry but not sorry.",

      "Rapper Suga will be the last of the bandmates to be released on Saturday, after fulfilling his duty as a social service agent, an alternative to serving in the military that he reportedly chose due to a shoulder injury.",
      "BTS\u2019 entertainment agency said no events are planned for Suga\u2019s release out of concern for overcrowding.",

      "Earlier this month, four members of BTS \u2014 RM, V, Jimin and Jung Kook \u2014 were discharged from South Korea\u2019s mandatory military service.",

      "BTS is expected to reunite later this year. Ahead of that highly anticipated homecoming, here's what you need to know about the group.",
      "BTS \u2014 short for Bangtan Sonyeondan, or \u201cBulletproof Boy Scouts\u201d in Korean \u2014 debuted in June 2013 under the company Big Hit Entertainment, now known as HYBE. The seven-member group consists of RM, Jin, Suga, j-hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook.",
      "The group launched in 2013 with the hip-hop heavy single album \u201c2 Cool 4 Skool,\" releasing three full-length projects before really gaining momentum with their 2016 album \u201cWings.\" Their global breakthrough came in 2017 when \u201cDNA\u201d entered the Billboard Hot 100, making BTS the first Korean boy band to achieve such a feat. The song\u2019s success was followed by a performance at the American Music Awards, further fueling their international fan base.",
      "The band is largely credited with bringing K-pop to the international stage, and with good reason. Across their discography, BTS broke boundaries and records: In 2020, they released the five-time platinum \u201cDynamite,\u201d their first all-English single, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 a first for an all-South Korean musical act. At the height of their popularity, BTS was not only the biggest K-pop group on the planet, but the biggest boy band overall.",
      "In fact, they've been certified platinum many times over, according to The Recording Industry Association of America. Their platinum successes include:",
      "\u2014 2018's \u201cMic Drop;\u201d",
      "\u2014 2020's \u201cMap of the Soul: 7,\" \u201cLove Yourself: Answer,\u201d and \u201cIdol;\u201d",

      "\u2014 and high-profile collaborations \u201cMy Universe\u201d with Coldplay and \u201cBoy With Luv\u201d featuring Halsey.",
      "BTS has also been nominated for five Grammy Awards. Their first, for \u201cDynamite\u201d in the best pop duo/group performance category, marked the first time a K-pop act received a Grammy nod.",
      "As their global popularity grew, the septet also became international advocates for social justice. Their 2018 address to the United Nations General Assembly launched the \u201cLove Myself\u201d campaign in partnership with UNICEF to combat violence, abuse and bullying while promoting self-esteem among young people. The group\u2019s commitment to human rights activism continued in 2020 when they donated $1 million to the Black Lives Matter movement, denouncing racial discrimination and violence. Their fan base, known the world over as ARMY, responded by matching the donation within 24 hours.",
      "Their dual impact on music and social causes culminated in 2022 when they were invited to the White House to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes with President Joe Biden.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",

      "Jin released two EPs, \u201cHappy\u201d in 2024 and \u201cEcho\u201d in May of this year. Suga dropped his debut solo album, \u201cD-Day,\u201d in 2023 under his moniker Agust D.",

      "PARIS -- After Hollywood's \u201cNapoleon\u201d exposed the legendary emperor to a new generation, over 100 relics \u2014 which shaped empires, broke hearts and spawned centuries of fascination \u2014 are on display in Paris ahead of what experts call one of the most important Napoleonic auctions ever staged.",
      "His battered military hat. A sleeve from his red velvet coat. Even the divorce papers that ended one of history\u2019s most tormented romances \u2014 with Josephine, the empress who haunted him to the end.",
      "Two centuries after his downfall, Napoleon remains both revered and controversial in France \u2014 but above all, unavoidable. Polls have shown that many admire his vision and achievements, while others condemn his wars and authoritarian rule. Nearly all agree his legacy still shapes the nation.",
      "\u201cThese are not just museum pieces. They\u2019re fragments of a life that changed history,\u201d said Louis-Xavier Joseph, Sotheby\u2019s head of European furniture, who helped assemble the trove. \u201cYou can literally hold a piece of Napoleon\u2019s world in your hand.\u201d",
      "The auction \u2014 aiming to make in excess of 7 million euros ($7.5 million) \u2014 is a biography in objects. The centerpiece is Napoleon\u2019s iconic bicorne hat, the black felt chapeau he wore in battle \u2014 with wings parallel to his shoulders \u2014 so soldiers and enemies could spot him instantly through the gunpowder haze.",
      "\u201cPut a bicorne on a table, and people think of Napoleon immediately,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the laurel crown of Julius Caesar.\u201d",
      "The hat is estimated to sell for at least over half a million dollars.",
      "For all the pageantry \u2014 throne, swords, the Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honor \u2014 the auction's true power comes from its intimacy. It includes the handwritten codicil of Napoleon's final will, composed in paranoia and illness on Saint Helena.",
      "There is the heartbreakingly personal: the red portfolio that once contained his divorce decree from Josephine, the religious marriage certificate that formalized their love and a dressing table designed for the empress. Her famed mirror reflects the ambition and tragedy of their alliance.",
      "\u201cNapoleon was a great lover; his letters that he wrote are full of fervor, of love, of passion,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cIt was also a man who paid attention to his image. Maybe one of the first to be so careful of his image, both public and private.\u201d",
      "The auction's timing is cinematic. The 2023 biopic grossed over $220 million worldwide and reanimated Napoleon\u2019s myth for a TikTok generation hungry for stories of ambition, downfall and doomed romance.",
      "The auction preview is open to the public, running through June 24, with the auction set for June 25.",
      "Not far from the Arc de Triomphe monument dedicated to the general's victories, Djamal Oussedik, 22, shrugged: \u201cEveryone grows up with Napoleon, for better or worse. Some people admire him, others blame him for everything. But to see his hat and his bed, you remember he was a real man, not just a legend.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t escape him, even if you wanted to. He\u2019s part of being French,\" said teacher Laure Mallet, 51.",
      "The exhibition is a spectacle crafted by celebrity designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, famed for dressing Lady Gaga and Pope John Paul II.",
      "\u201cI wanted to electrify history,\u201d Castelbajac said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a mausoleum, it\u2019s a pop culture installation. Today\u2019s collectors buy a Napoleon artifact the way they\u2019d buy a guitar from Jimi Hendrix. They want a cabinet of curiosities.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s filled the show with fog, hypnotic music and immersive rooms. One is inspired by the camouflage colors of Fontainebleau. Another is anchored by Napoleon\u2019s legendary folding bed. \u201cI create the fog in the entrance of the Sotheby\u2019s building because the elements of nature were an accomplice to Napoleon\u2019s strategy,\u201d the designer said.",
      "Castelbajac, who said his ancestor fought in Napoleon\u2019s Russian campaign, brought a personal touch. \u201cI covered the emperor\u2019s bed in original canvas. You can feel he was just alone, facing all he had built. There\u2019s a ghostly presence.\"",
      "He even created something Napoleon only dreamed of. \u201cNapoleon always wanted a green flag instead of the blue, white, red tricolore of the revolution,\" he said, smiling. \"He never got one. So I made it for Sotheby\u2019s.\u201d",

      "Despite the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle or sharply cut back on U.S. government-run news outlets like Voice of America, two Persian-language services have been called into duty to report on Israel's war with Iran to Iranian audiences",
      "In the early days of Israel's attack on Iran, U.S.-operated Radio Farda, which broadcasts in the Persian language in Iran, debunked a state media report that an Israeli pilot had been shot down and captured.",
      "Its journalism has continued despite the Trump administration's threat to its future, along with a Persian-language television outlet run by Voice of America.",
      "Radio Farda, a branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and based in Prague, has continued broadcasting even though its managing editor estimated that more than half of its staff had been furloughed. VOA's Persian staff, ordered to go on administrative leave in March, were suddenly ordered back to work last Friday afternoon.",
      "\u201cWe've been giving information to Iranians minute by minute about the conflict,\u201d said Golnaz Esfandiani, managing editor of Radio Farda. That includes explanatory stories about Iran's nuclear program and short videos posted on social media, she said.",
      "Several Iranians have contacted the radio network to express appreciation for reporting that they do not get on Iranian state media, she said. At the same time, families in Iran of five Radio Farda staff members have been pressured by people in the government who want to see the broadcasts stopped, she said.",
      "Through the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the Trump administration has sought to dismantle or sharply curtail the government-funded outlets that provide news reports to countries where there isn't a tradition of free press. The administration says these services operate with a liberal bias.",
      "Both Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are fighting the efforts in court.",
      "Employees at Voice of America's Persian service were notified in an email last Friday from Crystal Thomas, USAGM's human resources director, that they were being recalled and needed to report to work immediately.",
      "Kari Lake, who is running USAGM, told Fox News that \u201cwe are ramping up \u2014 as we've always planned to do \u2014 to meet this historic moment.\u201d",
      "One person who got that email was at the office within three hours and worked until midnight, helping to put out a one-hour broadcast, said the employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak to the press. About 50 people have returned to work. Voice of America is banned in Iran, but many of its citizens find ways through the internet to bypass the ban.",
      "Voice of America's broadcasts \u2014 and social media posts \u2014 have become a challenge to produce because the administration has canceled subscriptions to news services like The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse, said a second employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the employees, it's a stressful time, putting out urgent news reports without any sense of how long \u2014 or whether \u2014 they will continue to have a job.",
      "\u201cI'm grateful they've brought back our Persian service to continue their role as a trusted voice covering the region for the Iranian people,\u201d said Patsy Widakuswara, VOA's White House correspondent, who is a plaintiff in the court fight to keep the agency alive.",
      "\u201cBut why smash a working system only to cobble it back together when you realize you need it?\u201d Widakuswara asked. \u201cAnd how many crises would it take for them to realize that all VOA language services are important \u2014 before, after and during breaking news?\u201d",
      "During video reports posted online this week, a Voice of America anchor explained where Iranian counterattacks were landing in Israel, and how Iranians were trying to send out information about what is happening through social media.",
      "The danger for a service like VOA, having been off the air and off social media for more than two months, is that Iranian citizens will become accustomed to looking elsewhere for news, said Tom Kent, a media consultant and former president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.",
      "\u201cYou would hope that people would learn from this that international broadcasting cannot be turned on and off like a light bulb,\u201d said Kent, also a former AP editor.",
      "Despite an Israeli airstrike on its headquarters Monday while the Republic of Iran News Network was broadcasting live, the state-run news service is still operating.",
      "Radio Farda has stayed on the air despite cutbacks. It also continues to have access to news services like the AP, but those contracts will expire at the end of the month, Esfandiani said. Three people have been brought back from furlough to help cover the war, she said.",
      "She said she hopes the conflict lets people who question the service's existence know its value.",
      "\u201cIt's an information war, absolutely,\u201d Esfandiani said. \u201cThese countries \u2014 Iran, Russia and China \u2014 would be very happy if we were gone.\u201d",
      "One of the VOA employees called back to work said they have not been told how long it will be for. Despite evidence this week that someone in the administration saw value in what they do, might they still lose their job eventually?",

    "summary": "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s new vaccine advisers began their first meeting Wednesday under intense scrutiny from medical experts worried about Americans\u2019 access to lifesaving shots.",
      "First on the agenda is an awkward scenario: Kennedy already announced COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children or pregnant women, and his new advisers aren\u2019t scheduled to vote on whether they agree. Yet government scientists prepared meeting materials calling vaccination \u201cthe best protection\u201d during pregnancy \u2014 and said most children hospitalized for COVID-19 over the past year were unvaccinated.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months who could have some protection if their mom got vaccinated during pregnancy, according to the CDC's presentation.",
      "It\u2019s one signal that this week\u2019s two-day meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices isn\u2019t business as usual.",
      "Another sign: Shortly before the meeting, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist stepped down from the committee, bringing the panel's number to just seven. The Trump administration said Dr. Michael Ross withdrew during a customary review of members' financial holdings.",
      "The meeting opened as the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that it will continue publishing its own vaccine schedule for children but now will do so independently of the ACIP, calling it \u201cno longer a credible process.\u201d",
      "The panel, created more than 60 years ago, helps the CDC determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available, such as at pharmacies.",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices. And a number of the CDC\u2019s top vaccine scientists \u2014 including some who lead the reporting of data and the vetting of presentations at ACIP meetings \u2014 have resigned or been moved out of previous positions.",
      "The highly unusual moves prompted a last-minute plea from a prominent Republican senator to delay this week\u2019s meeting. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the chamber's health committee, said Monday that many of Kennedy\u2019s chosen panelists lack the required expertise and \u201cmay even have a preconceived bias\u201d against new vaccine technologies.",
      "In a House hearing Tuesday, Kennedy defended his purge, saying the old panel had been \u201ca template for medical malpractice.\u201d",
      "Rep. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician and Democrat from Washington state, told Kennedy: \u201cI will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet.\u201d",
      "The two-day meeting's agenda on was abruptly changed last week.",
      "Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session on Wednesday. Later in the day, the committee will take up RSV, with votes expected. On Thursday, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations and on the use of a preservative in certain flu shots.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality.",
      "The committee will discuss another company's newly approved antibody shot, but the exact language for the vote was not released prior to the meeting.",
      "\u201cI think there may be a theme of soft-pedaling or withdrawing recommendations for healthy pregnant women and healthy children,\u201d even though they are at risk from vaccine-preventable diseases, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University who co-authored a recent medical journal commentary criticizing the COVID-19 vaccination decision.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 month and older to get a flu shot, and helps greenlight the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "But given the recent changes to the committee and federal public health leadership, it's unclear how routine topics will be treated, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher who has studied the committee.",
      "Thursday also promises controversy. The advisory panel is set to consider a preservative in a subset of flu shots that Kennedy and some antivaccine groups have falsely contended is tied to autism. In preparation, the CDC posted a new report confirming that research shows no link between the preservative, thimerosal, and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Gostin said the agenda appears to be \u201ca combination of what we would normally expect ACIP to cover along with a mixture of potential conspiracy theories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly are in a new normal that's highly skeptical of vaccine science.\u201d",
      "The committee's recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC currently has no director, so the committee\u2019s recommendations have been going to Kennedy, and he has yet to act on a couple recommendations ACIP made in April.",
      "The CDC director nominee, Susan Monarez, is slated to go before a Senate committee on Wednesday.",

      "Anxiety, grief, sadness, anger",
      "NEW YORK -- Anxiety, grief, anger, fear, helplessness. The emotional toll of climate change is broad-ranging, especially for young people.",
      "Many worry about what the future holds, and a daily grind of climate anxiety and distress can lead to sleeplessness, an inability to focus and worse. Some young people wonder whether it\u2019s moral to bring children into the world. Many people grieve for the natural world.",
      "Activists, climate psychologists and others in the fight against climate change have a range of ways to build resilience and help manage emotions. Some ideas:",
      "Feeling isolated? Find ways to connect with like-minded people and help nature, said climate psychologist Laura Robinson in Ann Arbor, Michigan. There are many ways to get involved.",
      "Work locally to convince more residents to give up grass lawns and increase biodiversity with native plants, for instance. Help establish new green spaces, join projects to protect water, develop wildlife corridors, or decrease pesticide use to save frogs, insects and birds. Work to get the word out on turning down nighttime lighting to help birds and lightning bugs.",
      "\u201cI see people struggling with these emotions across the age range,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cI have parents who are themselves really struggling with their own feelings and really worried about their children in the future.\u201d",
      "Climate news and the onslaught of disaster and mayhem in general has become heavy and overwhelming for many with the rise of social media and mobile phone use. Try scheduling breaks from notifications on your phone or stepping back from the news cycle in other ways.",
      "Consider the idea of a \u201cpositivity sandwich,\u201d where you begin with a good piece of news, followed by a harder tidbit, then finish with a second feel-good story.",
      "Phoebe Yu, 39, gave up a cushy job in health technology to work on an MBA with a focus on sustainability. She started a business selling sponges made from the luffa gourd. And she does it all while raising her 6-year-old son with her husband in Fremont, California.",
      "\u201cI am generally a very happy person and I\u2019m very optimistic. And I\u2019m still that, but sometimes it becomes very difficult to manage. Like, what will happen and thinking about the long term,\u201d she said. \u201cAt points, I\u2019ve regretted bringing a child into this world, knowing how things could get much, much worse.\u201d",
      "Part of managing her own emotions is trying to model sustainable behaviors for her son while educating him on the importance of helping the environment. The family drives an electric vehicle. They don\u2019t eat meat and have encouraged extended family to do the same. They recycle, compost and limit travel by air.",
      "\u201cI try to explain things to my son so he can at least have some understanding of how the world and the ecosystem works as a whole,\u201d Yu said. \u201cI do think kids are able to absorb that and turn that into some level of action.\u201d",
      "Britnee Reid teaches middle school science for Gaston Virtual Academy, a K-12 virtual public school based in Gastonia, North Carolina.",
      "Reid participated in a pilot project for a free teacher tool kit on climate put together by the National Environmental Education Foundation and the Climate Mental Health Network, a collective of community advocates working on the emotional impacts of climate change.",
      "The kit is full of ways to help teachers support students\u2019 mental health and manage their own climate-related emotions. One of the exercises involves students documenting their interactions with the natural world in an environmental timeline. Laying it all out often stirs action, Reid said.",
      "\u201cThey can be anxious, they can be angry, they can feel fearful, but they\u2019re like these go-getters of, \u2018I\u2019m going to make the change in this world.\u2019 There\u2019s kind of two truths at once where they feel scared but they also feel like, you know, I can do something about this,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThe timelines,\" Reid said, \"provided some good, rich conversations.\u201d",
      "Psychotherapist Patricia Hasbach, just outside of Eugene, Oregon, has written several books on eco-psychology and eco-therapy and has taught graduate students on those topics.",
      "\u201cWe incorporate nature into the healing process,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we address a person\u2019s relationship with the natural world. Certainly with climate change, eco-therapy has a huge role to play.\u201d",
      "One of her most important missions is helping people find their words to talk about climate change in pursuit of resilience.",
      "\u201cThere have been some studies done that show an increased number of young people reporting concern, like 84% of young people in the U.S. reporting concern about climate change, but only like 59% of them think that other people are as concerned as they are,\u201d Hasbach said.",
      "That, she said, contributes to inaction and feelings of anxiety, depression or isolation.",

      "Global efforts to protect children against diseases like measles, polio and tuberculosis have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to deadly infections",
      "LONDON -- Efforts to vaccinate children globally have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to tetanus, polio, tuberculosis and other diseases that can be easily prevented.",
      "Protection from measles in particular dropped in 100 countries between 2010 and 2019, unravelling decades of progress, including in rich countries that had previously eliminated the highly infectious disease, according to a new analysis of global vaccination trends published Tuesday in the journal Lancet.",
      "\u201cAfter clean water, vaccination is the most effective intervention for protecting the health of our children,\u201d said Helen Bedford, a professor of children's health at University College London, who was not connected to the research. She warned there has been a small but worrying rise in the number of parents skipping vaccination for their children in recent years, for reasons including misinformation.",
      "In Britain, Bedford said that has resulted in the largest number of measles recorded since the 1990s and the deaths of nearly a dozen babies from whooping cough. Vaccination rates in the U.S. are also falling, and exemptions from vaccinations are at an all-time high.",
      "After the World Health Organization established its routine immunization program in 1974, countries made significant efforts to protect children against preventable and sometimes fatal diseases; the program is credited with inoculating more than 4 billion children, saving the lives of 154 million worldwide.",
      "Since the program began, the global coverage of children receiving three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine nearly doubled, from 40% to 81%. The percentage of kids getting the measles vaccine also jumped from 37% to 83%, with similar increases for polio and tuberculosis.",
      "But after the COVID-19 pandemic, coverage rates dropped, with an estimated 15.6 million children missing out on the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine and the measles vaccine. Nearly 16 million children failed to get vaccinated against polio and 9 million missed out on the TB vaccine, with the biggest impact in sub-Saharan Africa. The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.",
      "Researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, who conducted the analysis, noted that more than half of the world\u2019s 15.7 million unvaccinated children live in just eight countries in 2023: Nigeria, India, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Indonesia and Brazil.",
      "Since President Trump has begun to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO and dismantled the U.S Agency for International Aid, public health experts have warned of new epidemics of infectious diseases. The researchers said it was too early to know what impact recent funding cuts might have on children's immunization rates.",
      "The WHO said there had been an 11-fold spike in measles in the Americas this year compared to 2024. Measles infections doubled in the European region in 2024 versus the previous year and the disease remains common in Africa and Southeast Asia.",
      "\u201cIt is in everyone's interest that this situation is rectified,\u201d said Dr. David Elliman, a pediatrician who has advised the British government, in a statement. \u201cWhile vaccine-preventable infectious diseases occur anywhere in the world, we are all at risk.\u201d",

      "The professionalization of college sports has prompted concern among team physicians that they will be exposed to a greater risk of medical liability lawsuits by injured athletes who claim a poor outcome caused them to lose future earnings",
      "The professionalization of college sports has prompted concern among team physicians that they will be exposed to a greater risk of being sued by athletes who claim a poor outcome from treatment caused them to lose future earnings.",
      "Before July 2021, when college athletes were cleared to be compensated by third parties for the use of their name, image and likeness, such lawsuits would have been virtually unwinnable.",
      "Four years later, and with schools set to share millions directly with their athletes, team physicians are wary. Some of the most high-profile college athletes are already signing multimillion-dollar deals and six-figure contracts are common.",
      "Though no malpractice lawsuits seeking lost future earnings at the college level are known to have been filed, it's only a matter of time, said Dr. James Borchers, Big Ten chief medical officer and president and CEO of the U.S. Council for Athletes\u2019 Health.",
      "\u201cThe complexity for the clinician is going to be significant,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think there are people who are going to evaluate this and say, \u2018I didn\u2019t sign up for an 18-year-old making a million dollars and then saying the decision I make affected their ability to make money.\u2019 I think you may see people say this isn\u2019t for me.\u201d",
      "The case of former Philadelphia Eagles player Chris Maragos jolted the sports medicine field in 2023 when a jury ordered his surgeon and an orthopedics group affiliated with the team to pay him $43.5 million for lost future earnings and pain and suffering after he alleged improper care of a knee injury. The orthopedics group ended its two-decade association with the Eagles out of fear of future lawsuits.",
      "At the college level, it still would be hard for an athlete to contend a team doctor's errant care cost them an opportunity to make money in professional sports because there are no guarantees to play at the next level. However, a college athlete who didn't have an optimal recovery could argue treatment reduced their ability to make NIL money or to transfer to a higher-level school where they could make more money.",
      "\u201cYou had an ACL tear, I did surgery and you never quite made it back \u2014 back in my day, you just had bad luck,\u201d said Borchers, who played football at Ohio State from 1989-93. \u201cYou\u2019re making a million dollars and that happens, you\u2019re probably having a different discussion.\u201d",
      "Borchers offered a hypothetical situation to illustrate his concerns about the pressures faced by team doctors. A receiver is treated for a hamstring injury, returns to play and reinjures the hamstring. The receiver says the injury never felt fully healed and his agent takes him to another doctor who has a different opinion on how the injury should have been treated.",
      "Borchers said the receiver would have been better off to sit out longer and miss a few more games.",
      "\u201cBut there wasn\u2019t money tied to that,\u201d he said. \"Now you could say you hurt my ability to go out and perform, so I\u2019m not going to get as much money or (it) has cost me the ability to put more tape out there so I could have transferred to a better situation and made more money. Those are the types of issues we\u2019re hearing about that used to not exist in college sports.\u201d",
      "Typically in college sports, team physicians are employed by a university-affiliated medical center or local medical group. Athletic trainers are employed by the athletic department.",
      "Team physicians must carry liability insurance either individually or through the medical center or group. The most common limits for a malpractice insurance policy are $1 million per incident and $3 million total in a year, said Mike Matray, editor of Medical Liability Monitor.",
      "\u201cYou can see how an athlete\u2019s economic damages, should a medical error end his/her career, would easily exceed those limits,\u201d Matray wrote in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "MLM has followed the medical liability insurance industry since 1975, and though the publication does not track data specific to sports medicine practitioners who perform surgeries, Matray estimated rates for that specialty to be more than $100,000 per year in some states.",
      "Dr. Jon Divine, head team physician at Cincinnati, said Big 12 team doctors are discussing among themselves and university general counsels whether they should increase their liability insurance limits, perhaps to $2 million or $6 million or more.",
      "Divine said he and other team doctors also are taking extra steps in evaluating injuries in the new era of college sports.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve probably ordered more MRIs than I ever have in 25 years in the last two years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's to make sure we\u2019re getting it right for the (coaching) staff, for the kids, for the kid's family. There\u2019s that much more riding on it.\u201d",
      "A former Penn State football team doctor, Scott Lynch, alleged in 2019 that coach James Franklin attempted to interfere with medical decisions.",
      "A Penn State internal review found evidence of \u201cfriction\u201d between Lynch and Franklin but could not determine whether Franklin violated NCAA bylaws or Big Ten standards by interfering with medical decisions. Lynch was awarded $5.25 for wrongful termination by the hospital that had employed him.",
      "Dr. David McAllister, head team physician at UCLA who has been practicing for 27 years, said the relationship between team doctor and athlete has gone from one built on trust to now being transactional and at times adversarial.",
      "When athletes spent four or five years at the same school, as once was the norm, friendships were formed and the team doctor continued to provide care for the some athletes long after their playing days. Now, McAllister said, many football and basketball players are taking advice from agents and business managers whose priority is the athlete\u2019s earning power, and that puts pressure on team physicians.",
      "\u201cThere are seasoned, experienced people that do what I do who either recently got out of it or are really considering it because they don\u2019t want to be exposed to the liability,\u201d McAllister said, \u201cand they don\u2019t find it that much fun anymore.\u201d",

      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A West Virginia woman filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking a religious exemption from required school vaccinations for her young child.",
      "Miranda Guzman alleges that the state's vaccine mandate violates a 2023 West Virginia law that stipulates the government would not be able to \u201csubstantially burden\u201d someone\u2019s constitutional right to freedom of religion unless doing so \u201cis essential to further a compelling governmental interest.\u201d Guzman sued the state and local boards of education and the county schools superintendent in Raleigh County Circuit Court.",
      "West Virginia was among just a handful of states that granted only medical exemptions from school vaccinations when Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January allowing religious exemptions. However, the state Board of Education voted this month to direct public schools to ignore the executive order and instead follow long-standing school vaccine requirements that are laid out in state law.",
      "Also, two groups have sued over the governor's order, saying the Legislature, not the governor, has the authority to make such decisions.",
      "Guzman obtained a religious exemption to the vaccine mandate from the state health department and enrolled her child in elementary school for the 2025-26 school year. But on June 17, Guzman received an email from the Raleigh County school superintendent rescinding the certificate, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Guzman's attorneys said \u201cthe straightforward legal issue\" in the lawsuit is whether enforcement of the state vaccine mandate violates the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act.",
      "West Virginia Board of Education spokesperson Christy Day referred to a June 12 statement from the board that its intent is to \u201cdo what is best\u201d for public school students, educators and school service personnel. \u201cThis includes taking the important steps of protecting the school community from the real risk of exposure to litigation that could result from not following vaccination laws,\u201d the earlier statement said.",
      "A telephone message left with Raleigh County Schools Superintendent Serena Starcher wasn\u2019t immediately returned.",
      "West Virginia\u2019s school vaccination policy long has been heralded by medical experts as one of the most protective in the country for children. State law requires children to receive vaccines for chickenpox, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, diphtheria, polio, rubella, tetanus and whooping cough before starting school.",
      "Morrisey, who is not a party to the lawsuit, held a news conference Tuesday in Beckley in support of Guzman.",
      "\u201cThis is not about whether or not about parents should vaccinate their children,\u201d Morrisey said. \u201cThis is about standing up for religious liberty.\u201d",
      "At least 30 states have religious freedom laws, including one signed by Georgia's governor in April. The laws are modeled after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton, which allows federal regulations that interfere with religious beliefs to be challenged.",

      "DALLAS -- A new Texas law promoting the Trump administration's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on foods like chips and candies that contain dyes and additives not allowed in other countries.",
      "It could have far-reaching effects on the nation's food supply, but a review of the legislation shows it also misrepresents the status of some ingredients that would trigger the action.",
      "The law signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday requires foods made with any of more than 40 dyes or additives to have labels starting in 2027 saying they contain ingredients \u201cnot recommended for human consumption\u201d in Australia, Canada, the European Union or the U.K. But a review shows that nearly a dozen of the targeted additives are either authorized in the cited regions \u2014 or already restricted in the U.S.",
      "The law, which will send the food industry scrambling to respond, is laudable in its intent, but could lead to incorrect citations and potential legal challenges, a consumer advocacy group said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how the list of chemicals was constructed,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cWarnings have to be accurate in order to be legal.\u201d",
      "The law, approved with wide bipartisan support, is part of a flurry of similar legislation this year by GOP-led statehouses as lawmakers align themselves with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda. Texas would be the first in the U.S. to use warning labels to target additives, rather than nutrients like sugar or saturated fat, to change American diets.",
      "It will force food companies to decide whether to reformulate products to avoid the labels, add the newly required language, pull certain products from Texas shelves or oppose the measure in court.",
      "It's unclear how the list of additives was created. Inquiries to the office of the bill's author, Republican state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, were not immediately returned.",
      "Regulators in Australia, Canada, the EU and the U.K. take a cautious approach to food additives: If a product's safety is uncertain, it can be banned or restricted until it is determined to be safe. By contrast, the U.S. generally allows products on the market unless there is clear risk of harm.",
      "Three additives targeted by Texas \u2014 partially hydrogenated oils, Red Dye No. 4 and Red Dye No. 3 \u2014 are not approved or have been banned in food by U.S. regulators.",
      "Several of the other listed ingredients are allowed in all four of those regions, noted Galligan and representatives from the Consumer Brands Association, a food industry trade group.",
      "Examples of those include: Blue Dye No. 1; Blue Dye No. 2; butylated hydroxyanisole, or BHA; butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT; diacetyl; interesterified soybean oil; lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol; and potassium aluminum sulfate.",
      "In addition, the legislation contains regulatory loopholes that could prevent certain ingredients from being labeled at all, said Melanie Benesh, an analyst with the Environmental Working Group, an activist organization that focuses on toxic chemicals.",
      "For example, the food additive azodicarbonamide, known as ADA and used as a bleaching agent in cereal flours, is included on the Texas list. But under the Federal Code of Regulations, it may safely be used in food under certain conditions. That federal regulation likely exempts ADA from the state labeling law, Benesh said.",
      "\u201cThe law, as passed, may not end up having the impact that legislators intended,\u201d Benesh said.",
      "Nutrition experts have long worried about the potential health effects of food additives, even as it remains unclear how much of a role processed foods have in driving chronic health disease.",
      "Research has shown that requiring food label warnings can help steer consumers toward healthier choices and prompt industry to remove concerning ingredients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has proposed front-of-package labels that would flag levels of saturated fat, sugar and sodium.",
      "\u201cThis represents a big win for Texas consumers and consumers overall,\u201d said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of states not wanting to wait for the federal government to act.\u201d",
      "The law also creates a state nutrition advisory committee, boosts physical education and nutrition curriculum requirements in public and charter schools, and requires nutrition courses for college students and medical professionals doing continuing education.",
      "Several states have been taking action to restrict dyes and additives in foods.",
      "In 2023, California became the first state to ban some chemicals and dyes used in candies, drinks and other foods because of health concerns. The state expanded on that last year by barring several additional dyes from food served in public schools.",
      "Other laws passed this year include one in Arkansas banning two particular additives from food sold or manufactured in the state and a West Virginia law includes a statewide ban on seven dyes.",
      "Lawmakers in several states have passed measures this year banning certain additives from food served or sold at public schools, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural. That includes Texas, where the governor last month signed a bill banning foods with certain ingredients from being served in school lunches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty dizzying time to be watching what\u2019s happening, because usually policies that are not very industry friendly are opposed, particularly in red states,\" said Christina Roberto, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, \u201cWith RFK and the MAHA movement, it\u2019s really turned things upside-down in some ways.\u201d",
      "At the federal level, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary have pledged to remove artificial dyes from foods and have pressured industry to take voluntary action. Some large food manufacturers have complied.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",
      "The FDA previously has said that the approved dyes are safe and that \u201cthe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",

      "An intense and nearly historic weather pattern is cooking much of America in a dangerous heat dome this week with triple-digit heat that hasn\u2019t been seen in some places in more than a decade",
      "NEW YORK -- An intense and nearly historic weather pattern is cooking much of America under a dangerous heat dome this week with triple-digit temperatures in places that haven't been so hot in more than a decade.",
      "The heat wave is especially threatening because it's hitting cities like Boston, New York and Philadelphia early in the summer when people haven't gotten their bodies adapted to the broiling conditions, several meteorologists said. The dome of high pressure that's parking over the eastern United States is trapping hot air from the Southwest that already made an uncomfortable stop in the Midwest.",
      "A key measurement of the strength of the high pressure broke a record Monday and was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a \u201cnear historic\u201d heat wave, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist. The worst of the heat was likely to peak for Northeastern cities on Tuesday, forecasters said.",
      "\u201cLike an air fryer, it\u2019s going to be hot,\" Maue said. \u201dThis is a three-day stretch of dangerous heat that will test the mettle of city dwellers who are most vulnerable to oppressive heat waves.\u201d",
      "A heat dome occurs when a large area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere acts as a reservoir, trapping heat and humidity. A heat wave is the persistence of heat, usually three days or more, with unusually hot temperatures.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the country's population \u2014 245 million people \u2014 will swelter with 90 degrees Fahrenheit (about 32 Celsius) or higher temperatures on Monday, and 33 million people, almost 10% of the country, will feel blistering 100-degree heat (about 38 Celsius) on Tuesday, Maue said. The government's heat health website showed the highest level of heat risk in swaths from Chicago to Pittsburgh and North Carolina to New York.",
      "Those triple-digit air temperatures \u2014 with the feels-like index even worse because of humidity \u2014 are possible in places where it\u2019s unusual. New York hasn\u2019t seen 100 degrees since 2011 and Philadelphia, which is forecast to have consecutive triple-digit days, hasn\u2019t reached that mark since 2012, said Climate Central chief meteorologist Bernadette Woods Placky.",
      "In downtown Baltimore, temperatures climbed into the high 90s by early Monday afternoon, bringing dozens of people to cool off at St. Vincent de Paul's resource center. A few blocks away, the city's historic Broadway Market food hall closed early when the building's air conditioning broke.",
      "The heat forced the cancellation of events in west Baltimore, said Eric Davis Sr., who spends most of his days working at a baseball field there.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have kids getting heat stroke,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too hot today.\u201c",
      "NOAA meteorologist David Roth said it takes time to acclimate to summer heat and this heat dome could be a shock for some.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said.",
      "The heat is part of Earth's long-term warming. Summers in the United States are 2.4 degrees (1.3 degrees Celsius) hotter than 50 years ago, according to NOAA data. Human-caused climate change has made this heat wave three times more likely than without the burning of coal, oil and gas, the climate science nonprofit Climate Central calculated, using computer simulations comparing the current weather to a fictional world without the industrial greenhouse gases.",
      "A key question is how much humidity will add to the discomfort and danger of the heat.",
      "Maue is forecasting dry air which may be a degree or two or three hotter than predicted by NOAA, but more comfortable. Other meteorologists expected worse: Sticky, humid and even more dangerous.",
      "\"The \u2018big deal' will be with the humidity being provided with the wet late spring conditions,\" said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado. \u201cThe area of high pressure will allow for a lot of evaporation to occur from the wet grounds locally and regionally, which will increase the heat indices quite a bit.\u201d",
      "Woods Placky said to expect dew points, a key measure of humidity, in the 70s. That's downright tropical, with some places approaching a dew point of 80 \u2014 a level Woods Placky said feels like \u201cyou\u2019re in a swimming pool\u201d and \u201cthe atmosphere is absorbing you.\u201d",
      "If this heat were later in the summer, it might not be as dangerous because the human body can adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, but this one is coming within days of the solstice, Woods Placky and others said.",
      "\u201cIt will be a shock to the system,\u201d she said.",

      "The nation\u2019s major health insurers are promising to scale back and improve a widely despised practice that leads to care delays and complications.",
      "UnitedHealthcare, CVS Health's Aetna and dozens of other insurers said Monday that they plan to reduce the scope of health care claims subject to prior authorization, standardize the process and expand the number of responses done in real time.",
      "Prior authorization means insurers require approval before they\u2019ll cover medical care, a prescription or a service like an imaging exam. Insurers say they do this to guard against care overuse and to make sure patients get the right treatment.",
      "But doctors say the practice has grown in scope and complication, leading to frequent care delays. The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December prompted many people to vent their frustrations with coverage issues like prior authorization.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz called prior the practice \u201ca pox on the system\u201d that hikes administrative costs during his Senate confirmation hearing in March to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Insurers said Monday that they will standardize electronic prior authorization by the end of next year to help speed up the process. They will reduce the scope of claims subject to it.",
      "They also plan to expand the number of real-time responses and ensure medical reviews are done for denied requests.",
      "Researchers say prior authorization has grown more common as care costs have climbed, especially for prescription drugs, lab testing, physical therapy and imaging exams.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sort of trapped between care being unaffordable and then these non-financial barriers and administrative burdens growing worse,\u201d said Michael Anne Kyle, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies how patients access care.",
      "Nearly all customers of Medicare Advantage plans, the privately run version of the federal government's Medicare program, need prior authorization for some services, particularly expensive care like hospital stays, the health policy research organization KFF found in a study of 2023 claims. The study also found that insurers denied about 6% of all requests.",
      "Dr. Ashley Sumrall of Charlotte, North Carolina, says she has seen an increase in prior authorizations required for routine exams like MRIs. An oncologist who treats brain tumors, Sumrall said these images are critical for doctors to determine whether a treatment is working and to plan next steps.",
      "Doctors say delays from requests that are eventually approved or coverage rejections can harm patients by giving a disease time to progress untreated. They also can spike anxiety in patients who want to know whether their tumor has stopped growing and if insurance will cover the scan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a term that we use called \u2018scanxiety,\u2019 and it\u2019s very real,\u201d said Sumrall, a member of the Association for Clinical Oncology\u2019s volunteer leadership.",
      "Different forms and varied prior authorization policies also complicate the process. Sumrall noted that every insurer \u201chas their own way of doing business.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years, the companies have been unwilling to compromise, so I think any step in the direction of standardization is encouraging,\u201d she said.",

      "A new report finds that the number of abortions in the U.S. grew in 2024 as more women obtained pills through telehealth",
      "The number of abortions in the U.S. rose again in 2024, with women continuing to find ways to get them despite bans and restrictions in many states, according to a report out Monday.",
      "The latest report from the WeCount project of the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access, was released a day before the third anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended nearly 50 years of legal abortion nationally for most of pregnancy.",
      "Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they are pregnant.",
      "While the total number of abortions has risen gradually over those three years, the number has dropped to near zero in some states, while abortions using pills obtained through telehealth appointments have become more common in nearly all states.",
      "Pills are used in the majority of abortions and are also prescribed in person.",
      "The latest survey, released Monday, tallied about 1.1 million abortions nationally last year, or about 95,000 a month. That is up from about 88,000 monthly in 2023 and 80,000 a month between April and December of 2022. WeCount began after Roe was overturned, and the 2022 numbers don't include January through March, when abortions are traditionally at their highest.",
      "The number is still well below the historic peak in the U.S. of nearly 1.6 million a year in the late 1990s.",
      "The Society of Family Planning relies primarily on surveys of abortion providers and uses estimates.",
      "WeCount found that in the months before the Dobbs ruling was handed down, about 1 in 20 abortions was accessed by telehealth.",
      "But during the last three months of 2024, it was up to 1 in 4.",
      "The biggest jump over that time came in the middle of 2023, when laws in some Democratic-controlled states took effect with provisions intended to protect medical professionals who use telehealth to prescribe pills to patients in states where abortion is banned or where there are laws restricting telehealth abortion.",
      "WeCount found that about half of the telehealth abortions last year were facilitated by the shield laws. The number of telehealth abortions also grew for those in states without bans.",
      "WeCount is the only nationwide public source of information about the pills prescribed to women in states with bans. One key caveat is that it is not clear how many of the prescriptions result in abortion. Some women may change their minds, access in-person abortion or be seeking pills to save for future use.",
      "The WeCount data could help explain data from a separate survey from the Guttmacher Institute, which found the number of people crossing state lines for abortion declined last year.",
      "Anti-abortion efforts are zeroing in on pills, along with barring federal funds for Planned Parenthood and undoing ballot measures that provided for abortion access.",
      "Three states have sued to try to get courts to limit telehealth prescriptions of mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions. President Donald Trump's administration last month told a judge it does not believe the states have legal standing to make that case.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court last year found that anti-abortion doctors and their organizations didn't have standing, either.",
      "Meanwhile, officials in Louisiana are using criminal laws, and there is an effort in Texas to use civil penalties against a New York doctor accused of prescribing abortion pills to women in their states. Louisiana lawmakers have also sent the governor a bill to further restrict access to the pills.",
      "SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said on a call with reporters Monday that it's a priority for her group to keep pushing U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other officials to investigate the safety of abortion pills \u2014 and to require that they be dispensed only in person.",

      "Abbott, a Republican, waited until the final moment to veto the bill in what would have been one of the most restrictive THC bans in the country and a significant blow to the state's billion-dollar industry.",
      "The law would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture or sell consumable THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, products and was the latest push by states to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, a similar plant to marijuana that can be synthetically processed to produce THC, the compound giving marijuana its psychoactive properties.",
      "Loopholes in existing law have allowed many THC-infused goods to enter the market across the country, including states with strict marijuana laws.",
      "Texas has some of the strictest marijuana laws in the country, prohibiting all recreational use and providing a limited medical marijuana program. The consumables market has allowed residents to legally access goods giving a similar high to marijuana.",
      "Republican lawmakers have criticized the products as dangerous due to a lack of federal oversight in how the goods are manufactured. Texas' ban is one of the more far-reaching among states that have taken similar steps. Several states, including California, have imposed age limits and restrictions on the potency of THC products.",

    "story": [
      "Everyone needs protein \u2014 it's vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of your muscles, bones and skin",
      "The human body needs protein. Proteins carry out countless functions inside cells and they are vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of muscles, bones and skin. And with food companies rolling out high-protein versions of a huge range of foods, including milkshakes and granola bars \u2014 and even pancakes and popcorn \u2014 you might be tempted to think you need to add more to your diet.",
      "But nutritionists say that if you are getting enough food, you are probably getting enough protein.",
      "\u201cAdding protein to foods is very beneficial \u2014 for the profits of that food,\u201d said Federica Amati, nutrition lead at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at the health science company ZOE. \u201cIt is not based on health, it is not backed by science.\u201d",
      "The amount of protein you need depends on your age, weight and personal nutritional needs and it is especially important for children and older adults to make sure they eat protein-rich foods. Here\u2019s what to know about how much protein you need and how to ensure you're getting it from the best sources.",
      "Protein is a macronutrient, or a basic kind of food like fat or carbohydrates that your body needs to function. There are thousands of proteins, assembled from smaller molecules called amino acids \u2014 most of which can be made by the body.",
      "\u201cBecause protein is so important, our body has adapted really well to making sure that it can reassemble and change the building blocks of these amino acids to make sure we have what we need, as long as we\u2019re eating adequate amounts of food,\u201d Amati said.",
      "Still, the body can't make all the amino acids, so some must come from food.",
      "The World Health Organization recommends that healthy adults get about 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight (0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight). That's roughly 60 grams for men and 50 grams for women per day, based on body weights of 165 pounds (75 kilograms) for men and 143 pounds (65 kilograms) for women.",
      "In most rich countries, the average adult gets far more, Amati said. Protein deficiencies are mostly seen in malnourished people on subsistence diet in poorer countries, she said.",
      "Bridget Benelam, a nutritionist with the British Nutrition Foundation, said it was important to get protein from different foods, like dairy, fish, beans, nuts, vegetables and meat. She said studies suggest vegetarians and vegans have lower protein intake than meat and fish eaters, but that their average protein levels are still OK.",
      "Having some protein at every meal is also a likely a good idea. \u201cIt appears to be better for preserving muscle function if you have some protein throughout the day, rather than just having it all in one meal,\u201d Benelam said.",
      "Plant-based sources of protein include foods such as beans, lentils, peas, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and meat substitutes. Fish, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy foods such as milk and yogurt are also good sources of protein. Amati said that proteins from animal-based sources may be easier for the body to break down compared to plant-based proteins, which tend to have more fiber.",
      "\u201cIf you eat a piece of beef, you\u2019re getting protein and things like zinc and iron, but you\u2019re also getting more saturated fat,\u201d she said. In comparison, Amati said eating protein-rich foods like chickpeas or beans also provides the body with fiber, something that's lacking in most of our diets.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a specific health issue that requires you to have more protein, most people in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. do not need more,\u201d said Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation.",
      "Amati, of Imperial College London, said people should scrutinize the ingredient list of protein-enriched products to make sure they aren\u2019t loaded with sugar and fat.",
      "For people trying to build more muscle, she recommended a more direct solution: exercise.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about your body composition and muscle strength, you have to lift (heavier) weights and give your body a challenge,\u201d Amati said. \u201cEating a protein bar is not going to help.\u201d",

      "Bicycles have long been ubiquitous, and many families tend to have one. Cultural norms in northern Uganda don\u2019t prohibit women from riding. While the roads in Lira town are paved, dirt paths lead into the heart of the district where farming is the main economic activity.",
      "The Buffalo Bicycle is a recent arrival. Many have never heard of it, or can't afford it. Retailing for roughly $200, it is three times more expensive than the cheapest regular bicycle \u2014 otherwise out of reach for many CHEWs, who do not yet earn a salary.",
      "The bike's promoters cite its durability in rough terrain, needing fewer trips to the mechanic as a way to save money.",
      "The Buffalo Bicycle's heavy-gauge steel frame is so strong that it comes with a five-year warranty, said Amuza Ali, a monitoring officer in Lira for Buffalo Bicycles Uganda.",
      "Abalo and others told the AP the Buffalo Bicycle felt uncomfortable to use in the beginning, with a braking system that doesn\u2019t permit carefree backpedaling.",
      "\u201cWhen I climbed on it, it wasn\u2019t that easy as I thought,\u201d Abalo said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I am trying again to learn how to ride.\u2019\u201d",
      "CHEWs using the bicycles reported a 108% increase in households reached each week, and the time to reach health facilities dropped by nearly half, according to a study published in May by World Bicycle Relief.",
      "The study shows that \u201cmobility is not a luxury in healthcare\u201d but a lifeline, CEO Dave Neiswander said in a statement released for the report.",
      "Diana Atwine, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Health, has urged the distribution of bicycles to more CHEWs across Uganda, saying front-line health workers save an unknown number of lives each year.",
      "Abalo received her Buffalo Bicycle from the health minister last year.",
      "One of her neighbors, Babra Akello, said she has used the bicycle at least six times already. The first was for transport to an antenatal checkup. She praised Abalo\u2019s willingness to help.",
      "The bike has also been used for emergencies. One evening earlier this year, a neighbor\u2019s 4-year-old child suffered a deep cut while playing in the dirt. With the child\u2019s parents away, Abalo transported the bleeding boy to a facility where he briefly lost consciousness before being revived.",
      "\u201cThat bike, not me, saved the life of that child,\u201d Abalo said. \u201cIf that bike hadn\u2019t been there, I don\u2019t know what would have happened.\u201d",

      "A Brazilian woman who says she became pregnant after being raped in March should have been granted access to a legal abortion",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- A 27-year-old Brazilian woman, who said she became pregnant after being raped in March during Carnival in Brasilia, should have been granted access to a legal abortion. But when she sought to terminate the pregnancy at a hospital around a month later, she was told she needed a police report to access the service, despite it not being a legal requirement.",
      "She decided to abort at home with medication she bought on the black market, with only a few friends on site to help.",
      "\u201cI fainted several times because of the pain. I was terrified I was going to die,\u201d she said.",
      "The Associated Press does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted.",
      "In Brazil, abortion is legally restricted to cases of rape, life-threatening risks to the pregnant woman or if the fetus has no functioning brain. Theoretically, when a pregnancy results from sexual violence, the victim\u2019s word should suffice for access to the procedure.",
      "\u201cThe law doesn\u2019t require judicial authorization or anything like that,\u201d explained Ivanilda Figueiredo, a professor of law at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cA woman seeking an abortion recounts the situation to a multi-disciplinary team at the healthcare clinic and, in theory, that should be enough.\u201d",
      "In practice, however, advocates, activists and health experts say women encounter significant barriers to ending a pregnancy even under the limited conditions provided for by the law. This is due to factors including lack of facilities, disparities between clinic protocols and even resistance from medical personnel.",
      "\u201cHealthcare professionals, citing religious or moral convictions, often refuse to provide legal abortions, even when working in clinics authorized to perform them,\u201d said Carla de Castro Gomes, a sociologist who studies abortion and associate researcher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Women in Brazil also face geographical barriers to legal abortions. Only 290 facilities in a mere 3.6% of municipalities around the country of approximately 213 million people provide the service, according to a 2021 study from scientific journal Reports in Public Health.",
      "In June 2022, four nonprofits filed a legal challenge with the Supreme Court, arguing that restrictions on abortion access violate women\u2019s constitutional rights. The case is currently under review.",
      "A 35-year-old cashier from a small city in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state also said she became pregnant as a result of a rape. But, unlike the woman in Brasilia, she chose to pursue an abortion through legal means, fearing the risks that come with a clandestine procedure.",
      "Although Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry mandates that, in the case of a pregnancy resulting from rape, healthcare professionals must present women with their rights and support them in their decision, the woman said a hospital committee refused to terminate the pregnancy. They claimed she was too far along, despite Brazilian law not stipulating a time limit for such procedures.",
      "She eventually found help through the Sao Paulo-based Women Alive Project, a nonprofit specializing in helping victims of sexual violence access legal abortions. The organization helped her locate a hospital in another state, an 18-hour drive, willing to carry out the procedure.",
      "Thanks to a fundraising campaign, the woman was able to travel and undergo the operation at 30 weeks of pregnancy in late April.",
      "\u201cWe are already victims of violence and are forced to suffer even more,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a right guaranteed by law, but unfortunately still seen as taboo.\u201d",
      "Brazil\u2019s abortion laws are among the most constrictive in Latin America, where several countries \u2014 including Mexico, Argentina and Colombia \u2014 have enacted sweeping reforms to legalize or broadly decriminalize abortion.",
      "This legislative environment is exacerbated by a political landscape in which far-right politicians, supported by Catholic and Evangelical voters who make up a majority in the country, regularly seek to further restrict the limited provisions within the country's penal code.",
      "In 2020, the government of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro issued an ordinance requiring doctors to report rape victims seeking abortions to the police. Current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva revoked the measure in his first month in office in 2023.",
      "But the measure left lasting effects.",
      "\u201cThese changes end up generating a lot of legal uncertainty among health professionals, who fear prosecution for performing legal abortions,\u201d Castro Gomes said.",
      "Last year, conservative lawmaker S\u00f3stenes Cavalcante proposed a bill to equate the termination of a pregnancy after 22 weeks with homicide, sparking widespread protests by feminist groups across Brazil. The protests ultimately led to the proposal being shelved.",
      "But in November, a committee of the Chamber of Deputies approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would effectively outlaw all abortions by determining the \u201cinviolability of the right to life from conception.\u201d The bill is currently on hold, awaiting the formation of a commission.",
      "Earlier this month, Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, a Lula ally, came under fire after sanctioning a bill mandating anti-abortion messages on posters in municipal hospitals and other health establishments.",
      "Advocates say access to abortion highlights significant disparities: women with financial means dodge legal restrictions by traveling abroad for the procedure, while children, poor women and Black women face greater obstacles.",
      "According to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety, 61.6% of the 83,988 rape victims in 2023 were under the age of 14. A statistical analysis that year by investigative outlet The Intercept estimated less than 4% of girls aged 10 to 14 who became pregnant as a result of rape accessed a legal abortion between 2015 and 2020.",
      "In Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Mare favela, one of the city\u2019s largest low-income communities, the nonprofit Networks of Mare\u2019s House of Women provides women with information regarding their reproductive rights, including legal provisions for abortions.",
      "It was there, during a recent workshop, that Karina Braga de Souza, a 41-year-old mother of five, found out abortion is legal in certain cases in Brazil.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have access (to information). Doctors don\u2019t tell you,\u201d she said.",
      "Feminist groups in Brazil are campaigning at a federal level for enhanced access to legal abortion services.",
      "Last year, \u201cA Child Is Not a Mother,\u201d a campaign by feminist groups, successfully advocated for the National Council for the Rights of Children and Adolescents to adopt a resolution detailing how to handle cases of pregnant child rape victims. The body, jointly made up of government ministries and civil society organizations, approved the resolution by a slim majority in December.",
      "Brazilian activists also are seeking to improve access to abortion by forging links with organizations abroad.",
      "In May, members of feminist groups in Brazil including Neither in Prison, Nor Dead and Criola met with a delegation of mostly Black U.S. state legislators. The meeting, organized by the Washington, D.C.-based Women\u2019s Equality Center, aimed to foster collaboration on strategies to defend reproductive rights, especially in light of the U.S. Supreme Court 2022 decision to strip away the constitutional right to abortion.",
      "In the meantime, the consequences for women who struggle to access their rights run deep.",
      "The woman in Brasilia who underwent an abortion at home said she is coping thanks to therapy and the support of other women, but has been traumatized by recent events.",
      "By being denied access to a legal abortion, \u201cour bodies feel much more pain than they should,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever I remember, I feel very angry.\u201d",

      "Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan, a major figure in the influential Apostolic Church, was arrested by Armenia's Investigative Committee, which accused him of planning to carry out bombings and arson attacks to disrupt power supplies and stage accidents on major roads to paralyze traffic. His lawyer described the charges as \u201cfiction.\u201d",
      "Galstanyan leads the Sacred Struggle opposition movement and has demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who was the focus of protests last year by tens of thousands of demonstrators after Armenia agreed to hand over control of several border villages to bitter rival Azerbaijan and to normalize relations between the neighbors.",
      "Galstanyan leads the Tavush Diocese in northeastern Armenia and spearheaded a movement that opposed the handover of the villages in the country, which was once part of the Soviet Union. Although the territorial concession was the movement\u2019s core issue, it has expanded to a wide array of complaints about Pashinyan, who came to power in 2018.",
      "The decision to turn over the villages followed a lightning military campaign in September 2023, in which Azerbaijan\u2019s military forced ethnic Armenian separatists in the Karabakh region to capitulate.",
      "Pashinyan wrote on social media that the security services had foiled a plot by \u201cthe criminal oligarch clergy to destabilize Armenia and take power.\u201d",
      "Officials said 13 others also were detained amid raids by police on the homes of dozens of opposition activists. The Investigative Committee said it carried out over 90 searches and recovered evidence that included firearms and ammunition.",
      "In addition to disputing the charges, Galstanyan\u2019s lawyer, Sergei Harutyunyan, said police searched the cleric's residence for six hours but found only smoke bombs that are commonly used at protests in Armenia.",

      "Attempts to impeach Pashinyan were unsuccessful, but the relationship between him and the Apostolic Church has deteriorated.",
      "On June 8, Pashinyan called for church leader Catholicos Karekin II to resign after accusing him of fathering a child despite a vow of celibacy.

      "LONDON -- A man armed with a samurai sword who killed a London teenager on his way to school and injured five other people during what the prosecution said was a psychotic episode triggered by drug use was convicted of murder on Wednesday.",
      "A jury at London's Central Criminal Court found Marcus Arduini Monzo guilty of murdering 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin, along with three counts of attempted murder and one count each of grievous boldily harm, aggravated burglary and possessing a bladed article.",
      "The 37-year-old had admitted to carrying two samurai swords but denied all other charges.",
      "Monzo, who has dual Spanish and Brazilian citizenship, killed Anjorin during a 20-minute rampage in April 2024 in the Hainault area of northeast London that began when he struck a pedestrian with his van. He told the victim he was going to kill him and slashed the man's neck. The wounded man was able to get away and survived.",
      "Monzo then ambushed Anjorin, who was wearing headphones, and did not hear a neighbor yelling to warn him.",
      "\"We were shouting and waving towards Daniel as he came out,\u201d Aiste Dabasinskaite said after the attack. \u201cHe had his headphones in so he wouldn\u2019t hear us. It just happened right before our eyes, it was horrible.\u201d",
      "Monzo nearly beheaded the teen with the 2-foot (60 cm) blade and stabbed him as he lay on the ground.",
      "When police officers arrived and tried to help the boy, Monzo sprang from bushes nearby and bolted. Constable Yasmin Mechem-Whitfield gave chase and suffered what police said were \u201cbrutal and life-changing\u201d injuries including a fractured skull and severe nerve damage when he lunged at her.",
      "Monzo then broke into a nearby home, where he awoke a couple who had been sleeping with their 4-year-old daughter. He shouted about believing in God and attacked the girl\u2019s father, wounding him in the neck and arm.",
      "In his final act of violence, he struck police Inspector Moloy Campbell once with the sword before he was subdued with a stun gun and arrested.",
      "Monzo said he had turned to yoga and went on a spiritual quest after being injured doing mixed martial arts. He said he formed his views after traveling to India and consuming ayahuasca, a hallucinogen, and frequently smoking marijuana.",
      "Prosecutors said Monzo\u2019s social media use showed an interest in violence, far-right extremism and conspiracy theories. He had shared vaccine misinformation and liked posts on X praising Adolf Hitler.",
      "During the trial, Monzo told jurors he believed the Earth was flat and that the 9/11 terrorist attack was \u201cprobably\u201d a conspiracy. He also spoke about his practice of drinking his own urine.",
      "He wept during his testimony and said he didn\u2019t intend to kill anyone when he bought two swords, which he claimed he intended to put on display.",
      "Also, Monzo said a voice in his head told him to kill his cat and then eat it to replenish the energy the animal sapped from him. He killed but did not eat the pet, then had a feeling an Armageddon-like ending was happening and panicked and embarked on what became a 20-minute attack, he said.",
      "Monzo is due to be sentenced on Friday.",
      "Jurors had to determine whether Monzo was responsible for his actions. Prosecutors said he carried out his rampage during a psychotic episode, but argued that it was brought on by his cannabis use, rather than an underlying mental health condition.",
      "Kirsty O\u2019Connor, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said that meant Monzo \"was fully responsible for the devastation he caused last year.",
      "\u201cThe jury, by their unequivocal verdicts, have accepted the prosecution case,\u201d she said. \u201cOur hearts go out to Daniel Anjorin\u2019s family and friends who have suffered his unimaginable loss in horrific circumstances, and our thoughts remain with all of the victims who continue to recover from their injuries and trauma.\"",

      "Pope Leo XIV has affirmed that priests must be celibate",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV affirmed Wednesday that priests must be celibate and insisted that bishops take \u201cfirm and decisive\u201d action to deal with sex abusers, as he gave marching orders Wednesday to the world\u2019s Catholic hierarchs.",
      "Leo met in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica with about 400 bishops and cardinals from 38 countries attending this week\u2019s special Holy Year celebrations for clergy. A day after he gave an uplifting message of encouragement to young seminarians, Leo offered a more comprehensive outline of what bishops must do to lead their flocks.",
      "It\u2019s an issue the former Cardinal Robert Prevost would have long pondered given his role as the prefect of the Vatican Dicastery for Bishops. In that job from 2023 until his election in May, the Chicago-born Prevost vetted bishop nominations for Pope Francis, identifying the type of leader who would further Francis\u2019 view of a church where all are welcome and dialogue is the decisive form of governance.",
      "History's first American pope reaffirmed Wednesday that the primary role of bishops is to forge unity in his diocese among clergy and to be close to his flock in word and deed. Bishops must live in poverty and simplicity, generously opening their homes to all and acting as a father figure and brother to his priests, Leo said.",
      "\u201cIn his personal life, he must be detached from the pursuit of wealth and from forms of favoritism based on money or power,\u201d he said.",
      "Bishops must remain celibate \u201cand present to all the authentic image of the church, holy and chaste in her members as in her head,\u201d he said.",
      "Referring to cases of abuse, he said bishops \u201cmust be firm and decisive in dealing with situations that can cause scandal and with every case of abuse, especially involving minors, and fully respect the legislation currently in force.\u201d",
      "It was the second time in a week that Leo has commented publicly on the abuse scandal. On Friday night, in a written statement to a crusading Peruvian journalist who documented gross abuses in a Peruvian Catholic movement, Leo said there should be no tolerance in the Catholic Church for any type of abuse. He identified sexual and spiritual abuses, as well as abuses of authority and power in calling for \u201ctransparent processes\u201d to create a culture of prevention across the church.",
      "Francis, who in many ways placed Leo in position to succeed him, had also reaffirmed celibacy for Latin rite priests while acknowledging it was a discipline of the church, not doctrine, and therefore could change. But he refused appeals from Amazonian bishops to allow married priests to address the priest shortage in the region.",
      "Prevost spent two decades as a missionary and bishop in Peru and would know well those arguments. But on Wednesday he reaffirmed the celibate priesthood as the \u201cauthentic image\u201d of the church.",

      "BANGKOK -- Thai authorities said Wednesday the country is taking further steps to tighten control of cannabis sales after the health minister signed an order banning sales of the plant to those without prescriptions.",
      "Thailand became the first country in Asia to decriminalize cannabis in 2022, in a move that boosted Thailand\u2019s tourism and farming, and spawned thousands of shops. But the country has faced public backlash over allegations that under-regulation has made the drug available to children and caused addiction.",
      "Health Minister Somsak Thepsutin on Monday signed an order that bans shops from selling cannabis to customers without a prescription. It also seeks to reclassify cannabis buds as a controlled herb.",
      "Phanurat Lukboon, secretary-general of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board, said Wednesday that his agency is ready to study and implement the change in regulations.",
      "The order is set to be effective as soon as it is published in the Royal Gazette, although it is unclear when this will happen.",
      "The ruling Pheu Thai Party previously promised to criminalize the drug again, but faced strong resistance from its former partner in the coalition government, the Bhumjaithai Party, which supported the decriminalization. Bhumjaithai quit the coalition last week over a leaked phone call between Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and a former Cambodian leader Hun Sen.",
      "Somsak told reporters on Tuesday that he would like to relist cannabis as a narcotic in the future. The move came after officials last month revealed that cannabis smuggling cases involving tourists had soared in recent months.",
      "Phanurat said that a study done by his agency last year found the number of people addicted to cannabis had spiked significantly after it was decriminalized.",
      "Government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsab said in a statement Tuesday that the government ordered the Health Ministry to tighten control on sales of cannabis because \u201cmany shops opened to sell cannabis both for recreational and medical purposes, allowing easy access for children and general people, which contradicts the government\u2019s purpose to crack down on drugs.\u201d",
      "A group of cannabis advocates said Wednesday that the change in regulations was politically motivated. The group said they will rally at the Health Ministry next month to oppose the change and the attempt to make it a criminal offense again to consume or sell cannabis.",

      "On Jan. 29, 2024, two of the five tried to set a synagogue in the second largest Czech city of Brno on fire, Brejcha said without offering details.",
      "The following month, Czech media reported an arson attempt and said police were looking for witnesses. The reports said two suspects placed a firebomb in front of the synagogue but it did not explode and no damage was reported.",
      "The charges against them include hate-related crimes, promotion and support of terrorism and a terror attack attempt.",
      "The suspects were also involved in online groups recruiting fighters for IS militants in Syria, Brejcha said. The Czech authorities cooperated with their counterparts in Austria, Britain, Slovakia and with the European Union\u2019s law enforcement agency Europol in this case, he added.",
      "Michal Koudelka, the head of the Czech counterintelligence agency known as BIS, said the five shared a fascination with violence and hatred against Jews, LGBTQ+ people and others.",

      "The hearing in the South African administrative capital, Pretoria, began around an hour before Lungu's funeral service was due to take place. It was not clear when a judge would issue a ruling and if the ex-leader could be buried.",
      "Meanwhile, mourners arrived for the funeral service at a Johannesburg church around 60 kilometers (37 miles) away.",
      "The court challenge was the latest development in a nearly monthlong dispute between Lungu\u2019s family and the Zambian government over where and how the former leader is buried.",
      "The Zambian government wants Lungu to have a state funeral at home \u2014 something Lungu's family have refused to allow because of his bitter political feud with current Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema.",
      "Lungu, who was Zambia's leader from 2015 to 2021, died of an undisclosed illness in a South African hospital on June 5 at the age of 68.",
      "A state funeral for him in Zambia was canceled twice because of disagreements over the details. His family and lawyers said he left specific instructions that Hichilema should not attend his funeral, while the Zambian government said Hichilema was due to preside over the state funeral.",
      "Zambia's Attorney General Mulilo Kabesha filed papers in a South African court Tuesday seeking an urgent injunction to stop Wednesday's funeral, according to Zambia's national broadcaster ZNBC. The court papers demand that the former president be buried in Zambia with full military honors, as mandated by Zambian law and in keeping with the public interest, ZNBC reported.",
      "Zambia's government said it had already prepared a grave for Lungu at a cemetery where all presidents are traditionally buried. It added that any personal wishes must give way to the national interest.",
      "Lungu's family decided against repatriating his body and arranged their own funeral service and a private burial. Top members of Lungu's political party traveled to South Africa for the funeral.",
      "Lungu and Hichilema had a long history of political enmity in the southern African country.",
      "Lungu beat Hichilema in a 2016 presidential election, and his government imprisoned Hichilema for four months in 2017 on charges of treason because his convoy didn't give way to the president's motorcade on a road. The move to imprison Hichilema was widely criticized by the international community and Hichilema was released and the charges dropped.",

      "\u201cSo a transformational summit. Looking forward to it,\u201d Rutte told reporters in The Hague, before chairing the meeting\u2019s only working session, which was expected to last less than three hours.",
      "But ahead of the meeting, Spain announced that it would not be able to reach the target by the new 2035 deadline, calling it \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Belgium signaled that it would not get there either, and Slovakia said it reserves the right to decide its own defense spending.",
      "Many European countries face major economic challenges, and Trump\u2019s global tariff war could make it even harder for America\u2019s allies to reach their targets. Some countries are already squeezing welfare and foreign aid spending to channel extra funds into their military budgets.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump complained that \u201cthere\u2019s a problem with Spain. Spain is not agreeing, which is very unfair to the rest of them, frankly.\u201d He has also criticized Canada \u201ca low payer.\u201d In 2018, a NATO summit during Trump\u2019s first term unraveled due to a dispute over defense spending.",
      "But Rutte conceded that \u201cthese are difficult decisions. Let\u2019s be honest. I mean, politicians have to make choices in scarcity. And this is not easy.\u201d But he said: \u201cgiven the threat from the Russians, given the international security situation, there is no alternative.\u201d",
      "Other countries closer to the borders of Russia and Ukraine \u2014 Poland, the three Baltic states and Nordic countries \u2014 have committed to the goal, as have NATO's European heavyweights Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands.",

      "After Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the NATO allies agreed to make 2% of GDP the minimum spending level. Last year, 22 countries were expected to hit that target, up from just three a decade ago.",
      "In The Hague, the allies plan a major revamp of their spending targets. They are expected to up the ante for what NATO calls \u201ccore defense spending\u201d to 3.5%, while changing how it's counted to include providing military support to Ukraine.",
      "To hit Trump's 5% demand, the deal will set a second target of 1.5% of GDP for a broader range of defense-related spending, such as improving roads, bridges, ports and airfields so that armies can deploy more quickly, countering cyber and hybrid attack measures, or preparing societies to deal with future conflicts.",
      "Progress will be reviewed in 2029, after the next U.S. presidential elections.",
      "\u201cThis declaration is historic. We are 32 allies supporting that ambition, which is huge,\u201d said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re. \u201cWe have been struggling to get above 2% and now we said 3.5%, which is necessary in order to reach our capabilities.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, NATO agreed individual purchasing targets for nations to stock up on weapons and military equipment to better defend Europe, the Arctic and the North Atlantic, as part of the U.S. push to ramp up security spending.",
      "Extra funds will also be needed should the Trump administration announce a draw-down of forces in Europe, where around 84,000 U.S. troops are based, leaving European allies to plug any security gaps. The Pentagon is expected to announce its intentions in coming months.",
      "Beyond Trump's demands, European allies and Canada have steeply ramped up defense spending out of concern about the threated posed by Russia. Several countries are concerned that Russia could carry out an attack on NATO territory by the end of the decade. Hungary is not one of them, though.",
      "\u201cI think Russia is not strong enough to represent a real threat to us. We are far stronger,\u201d said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, fielding questions from reporters, leaning back with his hands thrust into his pockets.

      "Brazil's Supreme Court had a historic moment on Tuesday when it heard a confrontation between an army colonel and general, both disgraced for their involvement in an alleged coup plot to keep former President Jair Bolsonaro in office",
      "SAO PAULO -- When Lt. Col. Mauro Cid arrived at Brazil's Supreme Court on Tuesday to testify against his onetime ally, former Defense Minister Gen. Walter Braga Netto, he did not salute the senior officer.",
      "It was a departure from military protocol that underscored how the country\u2019s once hugely popular military has been divided and roiled by scandal as Brazil tries an explosive case in which top military officers are accused of helping former President Jair Bolsonaro attempt a coup to remain in power after losing an election.",
      "Analysts said that the two men's appearance in a civilian court marked a historic departure from the impunity senior military officers have enjoyed since the country underwent two decades of military rule.",
      "\u201cPutting a colonel up against a general levels the playing the field and signals that for the justice system, all defendants are equal,\u201d said Lucas Figueiredo, the author of several books about Brazil's dictatorship. \"The truth will prevail.\u201d",
      "Cid, a former aide-de-camp to Bolsonaro who signed a plea bargain to cooperate with authorities, has already testified that Braga Netto took part in a meeting in November 2022 during which military officials discussed plans to stop current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva from taking office.",
      "Braga Netto is a close ally of Bolsonaro who also served as the former president's chief-of-staff and his 2022 running mate.",
      "The officers are standing trial alongside Bolsonaro, several other officers, and a few civilians. They face five charges including attempting to stage a coup, involvement in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, aggravated damage and degredation of listed heritage.",
      "A verdict is expected by the end of 2025.",
      "Cid says that in the days after Bolsonaro lost to Lula, he was called to Braga Netto's office and handed a bag of cash to distribute to Bolsonaro supporters camped outside the military headquarters. Braga Netto denies the account and calls Cid a traitor.",
      "The two men were summoned to the Supreme Court on Tuesday for a confrontation, a step in Brazilian legal procedure in which the judge and both parties can interrogate witnesses about discrepancies in their testimony.",
      "The examination was conducted behind closed doors by order of Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is chair the coup probe and did not provide more details about the decision. Brazilian law allows closed court hearings when matters of national security or deeply personal matters are involved.",
      "Braga Netto arrived at the court in the country\u2019s capital of Brasilia from his jail cell in Rio de Janeiro, where he has been detained for obstructing investigations since December.",
      "A staffer of the Supreme Court who observed the testimony told The Associated Press that both Braga Netto and Cid mostly stuck to their contradictory versions of events and avoided even looking at each other despite sitting opposite one another.",
      "The staffer spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to brief the media.",
      "In a heated exchange, the former defense minister shot back that Cid was a \u201cliar,\u201d said Braga Netto\u2019s lawyer, Jos\u00e9 Luis Oliveira.",
      "Moraes' decision to call both men for questioning at the same time signaled the judge\u2019s lack of confidence in their testimonies, legal experts and officials said.",
      "The fact that the two men appeared in a civilian court at all was a break from decades of impunity enjoyed by Brazilian senior officers.",
      "No one in Brazil has been sent to jail on charges related to the 1964-1985 military dictatorship, unlike in neighboring countries Argentina and Chile. And Bolsonaro, despite facing a tangle of serious legal charges, remains the face of the country\u2019s opposition to President Lula.",
      "The last Brazilian general to be jailed was Argemiro de Assis Brasil, who was arrested in 1964 for opposing the coup d\u2019etat in which the military seized power.",
      "Since the beginning of the proceedings, members of the military establishment have claimed the Supreme Court trial is an embarrassment to the armed forces.",
      "\u201cSuch questioning doesn\u2019t help the armed forces,\u201d said Gen. Roberto Peternelli, a former congressman affiliated with Bolsonaro\u2019s Liberal Party. \u201cIn my perspective, it ends up harming the country.\u201d",
      "The accused sought to avoid civilian court by seeking a trial at the country\u2019s Superior Military Tribunal, where legal experts say they were more likely to find sympathy.",
      "The military court, which handles only a few dozen cases a year, refused the cases.",
      "\u201cMembers of the military court understood that, though perpetrated by military personnel, these are not military crimes,\u201d said Alexandre Knopfholz, a law professor at UniCuritiba.",
      "Millions of Brazilians have seen the case play out on TV over the past two years, from raids in which federal police arrest suspects and seize documents to court testimony.",
      "Still, some experts doubt that Cid and Braga Netto would end up serving out full sentences behind bars, even if they are found guilty.",
      "\u201cThis is the middle of the probe. We should not forget that every coup-mongering military man in Brazilian history was pardoned,\u201d said Fabio Victor, author of a book about the links between the military and politics after Brazil's transition to democracy in 1985.",
      "But he acknowledged: \u201cThe fact that generals have become defendants for an attempted coup does show some evolution.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "U.S. President Donald Trump is attending the NATO summit and facing an alliance he has worked to bend to his will while he continues to rattle its members",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- U.S. President Donald Trump huddled on Wednesday with members of a NATO alliance that he has worked to bend to his will over the years and whose members are rattled by his latest comments casting doubt on the U.S. commitment to its mutual defense guarantees.",
      "Trump's comments en route to the Netherlands that his fidelity to Article 5 \u201cdepends on your definition\" drew attention at the NATO summit, as will the new and fragile Iran-Israel ceasefire that the Republican president helped broker after the U.S. unloaded airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "At the same time, the alliance is poised to enact one of Trump's chief priorities: a pledge by NATO member countries to increase, sometimes significantly, how much they spend on their defense.",
      "\u201cI've been asking them to go up to 5% for a number of years,\u201d Trump said Wednesday as he met with Mark Rutte, the alliance's secretary-general. \u201cI think that's going to be very big news.\u201d",
      "The boost in spending follows years of Trump's complaints that other countries weren't paying their fair share for membership in an alliance created as a bulwark against threats from the former Soviet Union. Most NATO countries, with the key exception of Spain, are preparing to endorse the 5% pledge, motivated to bolster their own defenses not just by Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine but also, perhaps, to placate Trump.",
      "As a candidate in 2016, Trump suggested that as president he would not necessarily heed the alliance\u2019s mutual defense guarantees outlined in Article 5 of the NATO treaty. In March of this year, he expressed uncertainty that NATO would come to the United States' defense if needed, though the alliance did just that after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.",
      "On Tuesday, he told reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to The Hague for the summit that whether he is committed to Article 5 \u201cdepends on your definition.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s numerous definitions of Article 5. You know that, right?\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I\u2019m committed to being their friends.\u201d He signaled that he would give a more precise definition of what Article 5 means to him once he was at the summit.",
      "New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, who traveled to The Hague and met with several foreign leaders at the summit, said other countries raised \u201cunderstandable questions\u201d about the U.S. commitment to the alliance, \u201ccertainly given President Trump's past statements.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were very strong and reassuring everyone that we are committed to NATO, we are committed to Article 5, we are committed to maintaining troops on the Eastern flank,\u201d said Shaheen, who represented the U.S. Senate with Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware.",
      "Trump also vented to reporters before leaving Washington about the actions by Israel and Iran after his announced ceasefire \u2014 although on Monday, he said the ceasefire was \u201cvery good.\u201d",
      "After Trump arrived in the Netherlands, news outlets, including The Associated Press, reported that a U.S. intelligence report suggested in an early assessment that Iran's nuclear program had been set back only a few months by weekend strikes and was not \u201ccompletely and fully obliterated,\u201d as Trump had said.",
      "But on Wednesday morning, Trump and other senior Cabinet officials vigorously pushed back on the assessment, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the administration was launching an investigation into who disclosed those findings to reporters.",
      "\u201cThat hit ended the war,\" Trump said. Drawing comparisons to the atomic bombings from the U.S. during World War II, he added: \"I don\u2019t want to use an example of Hiroshima. I don\u2019t want to use an example of Nagasaki. But that was essentially the same thing. That ended that war.\u201d",
      "The White House has not said which other world leaders Trump would meet with one on one while in The Hague, but Trump said during his meeting with Rutte that he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy later Wednesday.",

      "Big families looking for a three-row electric SUV have more options than ever before thanks to a few new arrivals",
      "Most electric vehicles are five-passenger sedans or SUVs. But automakers are increasingly expanding their lineups to cater to shoppers wanting a three-row EV that can serve as a family hauler. These EVs can seat six or seven passengers, haul lots of cargo, and potentially have more than 300 miles of driving range. They also come standard with many advanced safety features. To help you with your search, the car experts at Edmunds rounded up five of their favorites. They are ordered by price, and all pricing includes destination charges.",
      "The most affordable three-row SUV on the list is one of Edmunds\u2019 favorite electric SUVs. The EV9 delivers lots of safety features, a very comfortable ride, and plenty of passenger space in all three rows. The EV9 is also a good road tripper because it\u2019s one of the quickest-charging electric SUVs when hooked up to a powerful fast-charging station. Adding to its appeal is its ability to tow up to 5,000 pounds.",
      "The base EV9 Light trim level has an attractive starting price but comes up short on power and range. Instead, Edmunds recommends getting the midrange EV9 Wind. The Wind has a more suitable amount of power and an EPA-estimated 280 miles of range on a full charge. It also comes with all-wheel drive for more traction in wet and snowy conditions.",
      "2025 EV9 starting price: $56,395",
      "Hyundai\u2019s newest electric SUV is sleek and futuristic while providing what families need. It essentially serves as an electric alternative to Hyundai\u2019s highly rated Palisade. Like its corporate cousin, the Kia EV9, the Ioniq 9 has luxury levels of comfort, roomy seating in all rows, lots of standard safety features, and fast charging speeds.",
      "But the Ioniq 9 boasts a longer max range of 335 miles, which is impressive for a large SUV. And that\u2019s in the most affordable S model. All other models offer over 300 miles, which is more than the EV9. The top Calligraphy Design model is about as lush and powerful as a luxury SUV and offers neat tech features like a fingerprint scanner that starts the SUV and sets personalized settings.",
      "2026 Ioniq 9 starting price: $60,555",
      "If you\u2019re looking to stand out from the crowded sea of mainstream SUVs, consider the ID. Buzz. This electric minivan\u2019s retro styling is a throwback to the old VW Bus, but beneath the quirky design is a cavernous interior. Passengers, even tall ones, have more than enough headroom and legroom in all three rows. Drivers enjoy a high and commanding view of the road ahead.",
      "Thanks to the van\u2019s tall and boxy body, there\u2019s loads of cargo space behind the third row. Maximum cargo space is comparable to that of minivans and large SUVs. The Buzz also comes standard with a package of advanced safety features, but its maximum driving range of 234 miles will limit its appeal if you plan on a lot of long-distance driving.",
      "2025 ID. Buzz starting price: $61,545",
      "This electric luxury SUV hails from Rivian, a relatively new American EV startup. Debuting in 2022, the R1S was one of the first three-row electric SUVs and is a compelling choice if you can afford its high price tag. Rivian has also been making small but significant improvements to the R1S each year.",
      "There are a variety of 2025 R1S configurations to choose from, including versions that provide a long range of up to 410 miles and performance models touting 1,025 horsepower. The R1S also comes standard with height-adjustable air suspension that you can use to get more ground clearance when off-roading. The R1S also has plenty of passenger and cargo space, a premium interior, and lots of standard advanced safety features.",
      "2025 R1S starting price: $77,700",
      "Mercedes\u2019 EQS SUV is ideal for shoppers looking for a family-friendly EV that delivers a genuine luxury experience. The EQS impresses with its supremely smooth ride, premium cabin design, and extensive list of standard tech and safety features. The base 450+ model gets an EPA-estimated range of 323 miles. In the independent Edmunds EV Range Test, it went substantially farther, going 407 miles on a full charge.",
      "On the downside, the EQS SUV\u2019s third-row seat is an option. And if you get it, you\u2019ll find that it isn\u2019t as roomy as those in the other EVs on our list. The EQS\u2019 price might also be a prohibitive factor. But few SUVs, electric or gas, offer the EQS SUV\u2019s combination of future-forward design, opulent comfort and impressive functionality.",
      "2025 EQS SUV starting price: $106,400",
      "The SUVs above make up most of the electric three-row options in today\u2019s market. Fortunately, they are all excellent choices for families wanting lots of space, ample range and advanced safety features.",

The hackathon, he said, \u201cis a good place to sort of go and contribute your ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cRobotics and drones are having their iPhone moment\" because costs have come down and the hardware is widely available, Ramesh said. That means building drones to do new things is more a \u201cthinking challenge\" than a technical one, he said.",
      "Ramesh already knew one teammate, a former British army paratrooper, from a previous event. They recruited two others \u2014 one engineer and one with a Ph.D. in computer vision \u2014 through the event\u2019s group chat on Signal.",
      "The drone problem was just one of the many challenges the teams could choose to solve. The tasks were proposed by defense startups like German drone maker Helsing and robotics company Arx, the British military and Kyiv-based venture capital firm D3.",
      "Some worked on software, such as an algorithm to predict which way a target would move. Others came with their own ideas. One team made a plastic cup packed with sensors that could be produced in large amounts to be scattered across a battlefield. Another team built a scale model of an autonomous medical evacuation aircraft.",
      "Similar competitions have been held regularly across Europe since last year, inspired by the Ukrainian military\u2019s on-the-fly wartime innovations to fend off the larger Russian army.",
      "The grassroots meetups are part of a wider network of defense innovation that organizers hope to foster in Europe, underscoring the continent's scramble to churn out weapons that have been turbocharged by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s persistent threats to withdraw from the NATO trans-Atlantic security alliance.",
      "The idea is to \u201cgo build a prototype, take your prototype to become a product, and go build a company\u201d that can \u201cdeliver stuff to the frontline and hopefully save someone\u2019s life,\u201d said Benjamin Wolba, who organizes a separate but similar series, the European Defense Tech Hackathon.",
      "Wolba's group has held tournaments in about 10 cities in the past twelve months, including one in Lviv, Ukraine, in May, and has scheduled more this year in Sheffield, England; Gothenburg, Sweden; Marseilles, France; London; and Berlin.",
      "The European Union-backed EUDIS Defence Hackathon holds simultaneous competitions at eight universities twice a year. Meanwhile, NATO has launched DIANA, an \u201caccelerator\u201d program to speed up defense innovations.",
      "The competitions are producing real-world results. The winners of one European Defense Tech Hackathon were a team of Bulgarian high school students who came up with a de-mining solution that they used to found a startup.",
      "At last year\u2019s London event, the winning team devised an idea for an anti-drone system. They went to Ukraine for more testing, and then were bought by a startup that went on to raise millions in venture capital funding, said Richard Pass, co-founder of the London hackathon.",
      "This year, instead of a trophy, some London teams signed term sheets with investors.",
      "Hackathons have their origins in the software industry. Small teams of programmers and developers are pitted against each other in marathon brainstorming sessions to write programs that could become new products.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of the hackathon is you get a mixture of people who never normally meet,\u201d said Wolba. \u201cEngineers are \u201cpaired with actual investors who understand something on the commercial side, but also, critically, military end users.\u201d",
      "Organizers want to foster a culture of nimble startups to join Europe's defense ecosystem, traditionally dominated by a handful of big \u201cprime\u201d military contractors such as Britain's BAE, Germany's Rheinmetall and France's Thales that are focused on building pricey hardware.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a shift in the industry from the purchase of more exquisite, high-cost capabilities, such as fighter jets, or submarines, or expensive tanks, towards more low-cost systems that can give you scale advantages,\u201d said Pass.",
      "A recent aerial confrontation between Pakistan and India further highlights how Europe is at risk of losing its edge against adversaries, he said.",
      "Pass said reports that Pakistan used Chinese-made fighter jets armed with Chinese air-to-air missiles to down Indian air force planes, including three French-made Rafale jets, came as a big surprise.",
      "Not only does it show \u201ctechnological parity between the Chinese and leading Western industrial nations like France,\u201d but it also hints at China's advantages in mass-producing fighter jets that could overwhelm Western forces, he said.",
      "Fostering a broader European defense tech start-up ecosystem is a way \u201cto regain that technological advantage,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense tech startup founders can ride a wave of investment as Europe moves to beef up its military capabilities. Leaders of NATO, which includes 30 European nations, are meeting this week to endorse a goal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense.",
      "The European Union has sought to mobilize 800 billion euros ($927 billion) to boost the 27-nation bloc's defense, with priorities including drones, AI, autonomous systems and quantum computing.",
      "Britain, which left the EU, has meanwhile pledged to spend 10% of its defense budget on new technologies.",
      "Europe still has a long way to go. The continent's defense tech startup ecosystem is young and about five years behind the United States, consulting firm McKinsey said in a recent report. But it's growing rapidly as investors flock there. Venture capital investment in Europe's defense tech sector for 2021-2024 more than quadrupled from the previous three-year period, according to Pitchbook.",
      "At the London hackathon, teams worked into the evening, fueled by chocolate bars, energy drinks, fruit and a late-night pizza delivery. Army cots were available for those who wanted to catch a few hours of sleep.",
      "Soldiers in camouflage and defense company reps hovered on the sidelines to provide advice and answer questions.",
      "Andrii Solonskyi, CEO of Soloma Avionics, which fielded a team, said defense hackathons are \u201ca bit of a novelty.\u201d",
      "The industry has traditionally been more structured and formal, because \u201cit\u2019s a serious business and there\u2019s a lot of things that can go wrong,\u201d he said. But, \"what we definitely feel is that you can be very agile in defense right now.\"",

      "Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek has signed into law a bill that provides unemployment benefits to striking workers",
      "SALEM, Ore. -- Democratic Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek on Tuesday signed into law a bill that provides unemployment benefits to striking workers, following neighboring Washington state in adopting measures spurred by recent walkouts by Boeing factory workers, hospital nurses and teachers in the Pacific Northwest.",
      "Oregon\u2019s measure makes it the first state to provide pay for picketing public employees \u2014 who aren\u2019t allowed to strike in most states, let alone receive benefits for it. It makes striking workers eligible to collect unemployment benefits after two weeks, with benefits capped at 10 weeks.",
      "Only three other states \u2014 New York, New Jersey and most recently Washington state \u2014 give striking workers unemployment benefits. Washington's bill, which passed in April, pays striking private sector workers for up to six weeks, starting after at least two weeks on the line.",
      "Democratic Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont on Monday vetoed a bill that would provide financial help for striking workers, after vetoing a similar measure last year.",
      "The final passage for Oregon's bill proved tumultuous. It first passed the state Senate in March and then passed the state House earlier this month. But a majority of senators did not concur with amendments added by the House, which sent the measure to a conference committee to resolve the differences between the two bills. It ultimately received final approval following a compromise on the 10-week benefits cap.",
      "The bill sparked debate among lawmakers as well as constituents, with over 1,000 letters of written testimony submitted.",
      "Supporters said it would level the playing field between workers and wealthy corporations that can wait until union strike funds run out to pressure employees under financial distress to accept deals.",
      "Opponents said it could incentivize strikes and hurt employers, particularly public employers such as school districts. Private employers pay into the state\u2019s unemployment insurance trust fund through a payroll tax, but many public employers do not, meaning they would have to reimburse the fund for any payments made to their workers.",
      "In response to those concerns, the bill requires school districts to deduct the benefits received by an employee from their future wages.",
      "Some argued it wouldn\u2019t cost public employers more than what they have already budgeted for salaries, as workers aren\u2019t paid when they are on strike. Also, those receiving unemployment benefits get at most 65% of their weekly pay, and benefit amounts are capped, according to documents presented to lawmakers by employment department officials.",
      "Oregon has seen two large strikes in recent years: Thousands of nurses and dozens of doctors at Providence\u2019s eight Oregon hospitals were on strike for six weeks earlier this year, while a 2023 walkout of Portland Public Schools teachers shuttered schools for over three weeks in the state\u2019s largest district.",

      "But Republicans who have majority control of the House and Senate are finding that their push to move fast and change things \u2014 namely cuts to federal government programs including Medicaid and SNAP food stamps used by millions of Americans \u2014 is easier said than done.",
      "Not all GOP lawmakers are on board, and the Senate parliamentarian has advised that several key proposals violate procedural rules. With Democrats flatly opposed, it's all leaving GOP leaders scrambling days before final votes.",
      "Here's the latest on what's in, out and still up for debate as lawmakers work to finish the massive 1,000-page plus package.",
      "The top priority for Republicans is preventing what they warn would be a massive tax hike, some $3.8 trillion, after December when the tax breaks they put in place during Trump's first term, in 2017, expire.",
      "The big bill seeks to make existing tax rates and brackets permanent, while also temporarily adding new ones Trump campaigned on \u2014 no taxes on tips, overtime pay or some automotive loans, along with a bigger $6,000 deduction in the Senate draft for seniors who earn no more than $75,000 a year.",
      "The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase, while the bill would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",

      "Additionally, the House bill proposes $12 billion for the Homeland Security secretary to provide grants to states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. The Senate package also provides the attorney general with $3.5 billion to create a similar state fund \u2014 called Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide, or Biden, referring to the former president.",

      "To help partly offset the lost tax revenue, Republicans are seeking to cut back some long-running government programs \u2014 Medicaid, food stamps and green energy incentives \u2014 basically unraveling the accomplishments of the past two Democratic presidents: Joe Biden and Barack Obama.",
      "Republicans argue they are trying to right-size the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve \u2014 mainly pregnant women and children \u2014 and root out waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children older than 10 would have to work to qualify for food aid, and those with teens would have to comply with the work requirement for Medicaid.",

      "Louisiana accused pharmaceutical giant CVS of using its dominant market position to abuse customer information, drive up drug costs and unfairly undermine independent pharmacies",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Louisiana filed several lawsuits accusing pharmaceutical giant CVS of abusing customer information and using its dominant market position to drive up drug costs and unfairly undermine independent pharmacies, the state\u2019s attorney general said Tuesday.",
      "Attorney General Liz Murrill began investigating CVS after the company sent out mass text messages to thousands of residents on June 11 to lobby against legislation that took aim at its business structure. The texts warned that medication costs could go up and all CVS pharmacies in the state would close.",
      "The lawsuits, which were filed Monday in central Louisiana\u2019s St. Landry Parish, seek \u201cinjunctive relief, civil penalties and restitution,\" Murrill said.",
      "CVS \u201cabused customers\u2019 sensitive information to push a political message,\u201d Republican Gov. Jeff Landry said Tuesday at a press conference.",
      "He noted CVS had lobbied his wife over text via the same messaging chain normally used to notify her about picking up a prescription drug or other healthcare-related matters.",
      "One lawsuit argues that the text message lobbying constituted \u201cunfair or deceptive acts\" in violation of state trade law.",
      "CVS has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cOur communication with CVS customers, patients and members of the community was consistent with the law,\u201d CVS said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe believe it was important for people to know about a potential disruption to where they get their medicine.\u201d",
      "Two other lawsuits allege that CVS artificially inflates prices for consumers and independent pharmacies.",
      "CVS serves as a pharmacy benefit manager \u2014 essentially an intermediary that buys medication from manufacturers and distributes drugs to pharmacies.",
      "CVS and the mail-order pharmacy Express Scripts dominate the market by processing about eight out of every 10 prescription drug claims, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which warned in a 2024 report that this allows for \u201cinflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies.\"",
      "Because CVS also owns a vast network of retail pharmacies \u2014 including 119 in Louisiana \u2014 it sets the terms for how prescription drugs are sold to customers there.",
      "The proposed law that sparked the text messages from CVS had sought to ban pharmacy benefit managers like CVS from owning drug stores. The law failed to pass, but Landry has stated he will seek to revive it.",
      "In the state's litigation, Murrill alleges that CVS business structure and practices allow the company to \u201cmanipulate prices, restrict competition and channel profits internally.\"",
      "One lawsuit accuses CVS of \u201csystematically under-reimbursing independent Louisiana pharmacies to the point of economic hardship, while routing patients to CVS-owned facilities.\u201d The lawsuit alleges that CVS imposes \u201cunethical, unscrupulous, and exorbitantly high fees on independent pharmacies.\u201d",
      "CVS said that it should not have to pay higher rates for \u201cless efficient pharmacies\u201d and that this would lead to \u201chigher costs for consumers.\u201d",
      "\u201cImportantly, CVS Pharmacy remains the lowest cost pharmacy and a critical partner in lowering prescription drug costs for Louisianans,\u201d the company said.",
      "Another lawsuit argues that CVS uses its market control to exclude lower-cost drugs for \"high-rebate, high-price brand drugs\u201d and other practices that \u201cdistort the drug market\u201d and \u201cdrive up costs for the state's public health programs and its citizens.\u201d",
      "CVS said that its business structure allows for \u201cbetter access, affordability, and advocacy for those we serve.\u201d The company said that removing CVS pharmacies from Louisiana would increase costs to the state by more than $4.6 million.",

      "Attorneys for 12 of NASCAR\u2019s 15 race teams told a federal judge that disclosing their financial records to the stock car series would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d to competitive balance",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Attorneys for 12 of NASCAR's 15 race teams argued in federal court Tuesday that disclosing their financial records to the stock car series would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d to competitive balance and warned that making such details public would put them all in danger.",
      "The hearing was over a discovery dispute between NASCAR and the teams that are not parties in the ongoing antitrust suit filed by 23XI Racing, which is owned by retired NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, and Front Row Motorsports, owned by entrepreneur Bob Jenkins.",
      "23XI and Front Row are the only two organizations out of the 15 that refused last September to sign take-it-or-leave offers on a new charter agreement. Charters are NASCAR\u2019s version of a franchise model, with each charter guaranteeing entry to the lucrative Cup Series races and a stable revenue stream. Of the 13 teams that signed, only Kaulig Racing has submitted the financial documents NASCAR subpoenaed as part of discovery.",
      "The other 12 organizations are fighting against releasing the information to NASCAR and even argued that NASCAR asking for them violates the charter agreement, which claims all disputes must go to arbitration.",
      "U.S. District Judge Kenneth Bell of the Western District of North Carolina promised a quick ruling but, just like last week, seemed exasperated at the lengths being taken in this brawl that for now is heading toward a December trial.",
      "\u201cI am amazed at the effort going into burning this house down over everybody's heads,\u201d Bell said at the end of the nearly two-hour hearing. \u201cBut I'm the fire marshal and I will be here in December if need be.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for the teams say their financial records are private and there is no guarantee the information won't be leaked; in a hearing last week, information learned in discovery was disclosed in open court.",
      "\u201cIt would be absolutely devastating to these race teams if their competitors were able to find out sponsorships on the cars, driver salaries and all revenue streams,\u201d attorney Adam Ross said. \u201cIt cannot make its way into the public realm.\u201d",
      "Ross said NASCAR has asked for 11 years of records and communications \u2014 including what Hendrick Motorsports spent on both its Garage 56 project building a car to race at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the cost of Kyle Larson running both the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 the last two seasons.",
      "\u201cNASCAR has gone a step too far,\u201d Ross said.",
      "NASCAR argued it needs the financials to understand profit margins and whether teams are actually unable to make ends meet under the charter agreement. NASCAR vowed to redact details to conceal team identities, a suggestion that was met with skepticism from team attorneys who contended it would be easy to connect the dots and, for example, figure out which contracts belong to, say, Team Penske.",
      "Attorneys also argued that money is not often distributed equally across the board with each team. For example, Team Penske might use an engineer for a NASCAR team, an IndyCar team and a sports car team.",
      "Bell asked NASCAR why it would not be satisfied with just \u201ctopline\u201d numbers.",
      "\u201cWhy is not enough to know it costs X to run a car?\u201d Bell asked.",
      "Attorneys for the 12 teams also noted that their clients are extremely uncomfortable to be dragged into the suit.",
      "\u201cThis is the opposite of what they want \u2014 all the teams are torn to pieces that NASCAR wants them to disclose this information and they don't want to upset NASCAR,\u201d Ross said.",
      "Teams have long argued that NASCAR is not financially viable and they needed multiple concessions, including a greater revenue stream and a more permanent length on the charter agreements. Those presently have expiration dates and can be revoked by NASCAR. Two years of negotiations ended last fall with 13 teams signing on but 23IX and FRM instead heading to court.",
      "The hearing came one day after Bell declined to dismiss the teams\u2019 request to toss out NASCAR\u2019s countersuit, which accuses Jordan business manager Curtis Polk of using \u201ccartel\u201d-type tactics in the most recent round of charter negotiations.",

      "But as with most things in life, the key for new- and near-retirees making it through this period with their sanity intact is to focus on what they can control.",
      "People who have just retired or are about to do so are vulnerable to sequence-of-returns risk, which means that a bad market shows up early in retirement. And this imperils your portfolio\u2019s ability to last throughout your retirement years.",
      "Retirees who are pulling cash flows from their portfolios can address that risk by adjusting spending down to ensure that more of their portfolios are in place to recover when the market eventually does.",
      "In our retirement income research, we found that tweaks like forgoing an inflation adjustment following a bear market help ensure that spending lasts over a 30-year period.",
      "If you haven\u2019t yet retired, assess your planned in-retirement spending and identify where you could make cutbacks if needed.",
      "Ideally, you can pull portfolio cash flows from safer assets and leave your stock positions undisturbed.",
      "That\u2019s the general logic behind the Bucket approach to portfolio construction. In good years for the stock market, harvest appreciated equity assets for income. In bad ones, don\u2019t touch stocks but instead source cash flows from high-quality bonds or cash.",
      "Using that logic, you may even want to reinvest income distributions back into securities that have recently lost value rather than spending them.",
      "If pulling too much from a portfolio during down markets is a bad idea, filing for Social Security might look compelling.",
      "But it could be a mistake to let what we hope will be a short-lived downturn steer you away from the lifetime benefits of delayed Social Security. Delayed filing can be particularly impactful if you\u2019re the higher earner in your family and you have a younger spouse who will receive that higher benefit for her lifetime.",
      "In our retirement income research, we found that the benefits of delaying filing until age 70 are greatest if you have other funds to draw from until then. And they\u2019re obviously more valuable for people with above-average life expectancies, in that they stand to receive that inflation-protected income for longer.",
      "If you need funds and have to choose between filing for Social Security and pulling from a depressed equity portfolio, consider filing for Social Security and then doing a \u201c withdrawal of benefits \u201d within a year of when you initially filed.",
      "Inflation is a key risk for retiree portfolios, because the income you receive from your safe investments is going to buy you less as you age.",
      "Many retirees focus exclusively on nominal bonds and underrate the value of inflation-protected bonds, but most of the better target-date series stake about a fourth of the bond positions in short-term Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities for people who have just retired.",
      "Another strategy is to build a laddered portfolio of TIPS that will mature and supply you with living expenses throughout your retirement.",
      "Finally, one small silver lining in market volatility is the opportunity to save on taxes.",
      "The early-retirement years are an excellent time to convert traditional IRA balances to Roth. The reason is that without income from work and because you won\u2019t be subject to required minimum distributions until you\u2019re 73, your income and, in turn, the taxes that you\u2019ll owe on conversions will be lower.",

      "The $1.5 billion sale of the Minnesota Timberwolves from Glen Taylor to an investment group led by e-commerce entrepreneur Marc Lore and former baseball star Alex Rodriguez has gained unanimous approval by NBA owners more than four years after the deal...",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The $1.5 billion sale of the Minnesota Timberwolves from Glen Taylor to an investment group led by e-commerce entrepreneur Marc Lore and former baseball star Alex Rodriguez gained NBA approval on Tuesday, finalizing a complex and contentious process more than four years after the deal was reached.",
      "The ownership transfer that Taylor tried to stop last year received an unanimous vote from the league's board of governors that comprises the 30 team owners. The deal, which is expected to close this week nearly 51 months and more than 1,500 days after the initial agreement, includes the four-time WNBA champion Minnesota Lynx.",
      "The Timberwolves are planning an introductory news conference for Lore and Rodriguez next month in Las Vegas during the NBA Summer League. Lore and Rodriguez will serve as co-chairmen on the board, with Lore as Timberwolves governor and Rodriguez as alternate governor, the league announced. For the Lynx, Rodriguez will serve as governor and Lore as alternate governor.",
      "\u201cWe fully recognize the great responsibility that comes with serving as stewards of these exceptional franchises,\u201d Lore said in a statement distributed by the organization. \"We are committed to building an organization that sets the standard for excellence, is universally admired, and rooted in pride that spans generations.\u201d",
      "The business partners and close friends who met during the pandemic over a Zoom call have said they're committed to keeping the teams in Minnesota.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve dedicated my entire life to the world of sports, not just as a game, but as a powerful force that unites people, uplifts communities, and changes lives,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly honored and energized to roll up my sleeves and get to work. I know what it takes to be a champion, and I\u2019m ready to bring that same commitment and drive to create a winning culture in Minnesota.\u201d",
      "The 83-year-old Taylor, who grew up on a Minnesota dairy farm and built a fortune with a business that specialized in printing wedding invitations, bought the Timberwolves for about $88 million in 1994 to prevent them from moving after a deal between the original owners and a group in New Orleans was nixed by the NBA.",
      "After Lore and Rodriguez were outbid for the New York Mets by hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, they turned their attention to basketball after learning Taylor was exploring a sale. The deal was arranged in phases to allow Taylor to stay as a mentor of sorts.",
      "The value of the franchise has more than doubled since that April 10, 2021, agreement due largely to soaring NBA revenues. Forbes has estimated the Timberwolves are worth $3.1 billion. Sportico\u2019s most recent calculations pegged the club at $3.29 billion. Both publications put them as the third-lowest in the league, playing in a midsized market in a 35-year-old arena.",
      "The Lynx have been valued between $230 million (Forbes) and $240 million ( Sportico ), in the bottom half of the league that\u2019s in the midst of an expansion to 16 teams by 2028.",
      "Taylor announced on March 28, 2024, he was exercising his right to back out of the sale because Lore and Rodriguez missed the deadline to purchase a third portion of the club that would have given their group about an 80% stake.",
      "Lore and Rodriguez were blindsided by the decision and defended their integrity, accusing Taylor of having seller\u2019s remorse. They blamed the payment delay on the slow pace of the league\u2019s approval process and said they submitted paperwork six days ahead of the deadline.",
      "The dispute first went to mediation and then to arbitration, where a three-panel judge ruled in favor of Lore and Rodriguez. Their group, which includes former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Google executive Eric Schmidt, has been poised to buy Taylor and his partners completely out rather than the leave him with a 20% stake from the initial agreement.",
      "Taylor decided in April not to appeal the arbitration decision, near the end of his 31st season controlling the team. The Timberwolves saved him the best for last, reaching the Western Conference finals for a second straight year before losing to NBA champion Oklahoma City.",
      "Even after making the playoffs in each of Taylor\u2019s final four seasons, the Timberwolves have the worst all-time regular season record \u2014 1,196-1,680, a .416 winning percentage \u2014 of the league\u2019s current 30 franchises. They\u2019re 39-55 in playoff games, with a first-round elimination in 10 of the 13 times they qualified.",
      "Taylor and his wife, Becky, published a farewell message in Monday\u2019s print edition of the Minnesota Star Tribune, which Taylor bought in 2014. The Timberwolves also posted it on the front of their website.",
      "\u201cThis marks the end of an extraordinary chapter in our lives \u2014 one filled with purpose, pride, and a deep connection. When we kept the Timberwolves from moving to New Orleans in 1994, we did so with the hope of building something that could unite people across Minnesota and beyond. And when we added the Lynx in 1998, it was driven by our belief in supporting women and fully embracing the diversity and promise of the WNBA,\u201d the Taylors said, thanking their limited partners, the players, the staff, the community and the fans for their support.",
      "\u201cThough we are stepping away as owners, our love for this organization and this community remains as strong as ever. We will always be fans, cheering from our seats, celebrating your triumphs, and believing in what comes next. It has been the honor of our lives.\u201d",
      "Lore, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at $2.9 billion, is the CEO of the New York-based meal delivery service Wonder. He has founded e-commerce companies that were previously acquired by retail giants Walmart and Amazon.",
      "Rodriguez, a 14-time All-Star who hit 696 career home runs but has fallen short of Hall of Fame induction due to his admitted use of performance enhancing drugs, built a business career around real estate investment and development. He made more than $450 million in salaries over 22 years in the major leagues.",

      "The Morning Midas sank Monday in international water off Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands chain, the ship\u2019s management company, London-based Zodiac Maritime, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThere is no visible pollution,\u201d said Petty Officer Cameron Snell, an Alaska-based U.S. Coast Guard spokesperson. \"Right now we also have vessels on scene to respond to any pollution.\u201d",
      "Fire damage compounded by bad weather and water seepage caused the carrier to sink in waters about 16,404 feet (5,000 meters) deep and about 415 miles (770 kilometers) from land, the statement said.",
      "The ship was loaded with about 3,000 new vehicles intended for a major Pacific port in Mexico. It was not immediately clear if any of the cars were removed before it sank, and Zodiac Maritime did not immediately respond to messages Tuesday.",
      "A salvage crew arrived days after the fire disabled the vehicle.",
      "Two salvage tugs containing pollution control equipment will remain on scene to monitor for any signs of pollution or debris, the company said. The crew members of those two ships were not injured when the Morning Midas sank.",
      "Zodiac Maritime said it is also sending another specialized pollution response vessel to the location as an added precaution.",
      "The Coast Guard said it received a distress alert June 3 about a fire aboard the Morning Midas, which then was roughly 300 miles (490 kilometers) southwest of Adak Island.",
      "There were 22 crew members onboard the Morning Midas. All evacuated to a lifeboat and were rescued by a nearby merchant marine vessel. There were no injuries.",
      "Among the cars were about 70 fully electric and about 680 hybrid vehicles. A large plume of smoke was initially seen at the ship\u2019s stern coming from the deck loaded with electric vehicles, the Coast Guard and Zodiac Maritime said at the time.",
      "Adak is about 1,200 miles (1,930 kilometers) west of Anchorage, Alaska\u2019s largest city.",
      "The 600-foot (183-meter) Morning Midas was built in 2006 and sails under a Liberian flag. The car and truck carrier left Yantai, China, on May 26 en route to Mexico, according to the industry site marinetraffic.com.",
      "A Dutch safety board in a recent report called for improving emergency response on North Sea shipping routes after a deadly 2023 fire aboard a freighter that was carrying 3,000 automobiles, including nearly 500 electric vehicles, from Germany to Singapore.",
      "One person was killed and others injured in the fire, which burned out of control for a week. That ship was eventually towed to a Netherlands port for salvage.",

      "Independent car mechanics in South Africa\u2019s townships have long worked outside of the country\u2019s vehicle repair industry",
      "BRAKPAN, South Africa -- Themba Maseko quickly wipes oil and grease off his hands with a rag as he breaks away from repairing one car to assist another customer who needs parts for a low-riding BMW 325is that he\u2019s pulled up in, exhausts booming.",
      "As soon as Maseko returns beneath the hood of the first vehicle to continue his work, yet another man arrives desperately wanting his car to be looked at.",
      "\u201cIt gets hectic,\u201d said the 39-year-old mechanic, sweat plastering his face.",
      "The father of three runs a small motor repair shop in the township of Tsakane, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) east of South Africa\u2019s biggest city of Johannesburg. His hopes for his business to succeed when it\u2019s up against established urban car service and repair centers have been boosted by a new initiative started at the end of last year.",
      "Maseko has joined with other mechanics from townships to form a cooperative. Together, they now have combined purchasing power to ensure they can source official car spares and equipment for their shops and don\u2019t get cut out of the market. The Motor Spares Collective means they can place orders to an online spares shop through WhatsApp and authentic parts are usually delivered to them in 24 hours.",
      "That avoids what Maseko says is his biggest challenge: spending hours away from his garage queuing for parts, sometimes to find there aren\u2019t any in stock because they\u2019ve been bought up by larger chains.",
      "As one busy day at his shop showed, the customers are lining up for Maseko\u2019s services, he just needs the parts.",
      "\u201cNow with the collective it\u2019s much easier. I don\u2019t have to go stand in queue and waste time,\u201d said Maseko, who changed career from an electrician to a full-time mechanic in 2008. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s at a cheaper price.\u201d",
      "The Motor Spares Collective is one initiative designed to unlock the potential of small township businesses in South Africa, which the government has identified as key to driving growth and creating jobs in areas where unemployment and poverty are high.",
      "Various studies indicate that more than 21 million people in South Africa live in townships on the edge of major cities or towns \u2014 a third of the population \u2014 and they have a combined spending power of billions of dollars and generally prefer local businesses.",
      "South Africa has over 700,000 registered small businesses. In the townships these include hair salons, taverns, car repair shops, laundromats and others sometimes operating out of people\u2019s homes. According to a report by financial services group Lesaka, South Africa\u2019s informal sector generates an estimated $33 billion in revenue, or more than 6% of GDP.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t respect the trade in the townships,\u201d said Sharief Bartus, another member of the motor spares collective.",
      "For a $10 monthly membership fee for the first year, Maseko and the others get more than just access to car parts and tools for their garages. The collective also offers skills development opportunities, help with business registration and financing.",
      "\u201cThe more members we get, the more discounts we get, the more work we have,\u201d said Dorian Slimmerts, another mechanic in the collective who is operating not far from Maseko.",
      "Township mechanics offering a local option for car owners have long battled on the fringes of the country\u2019s commercial auto manufacturing and repair sector. A regulation change in 2020 also made a big difference. New \u201cright to repair\u201d rules in South Africa mean car owners can now have their vehicles serviced by registered independent mechanics and not lose their warranties.",
      "That\u2019s opened the door a little more for township mechanics.",
      "Car maintenance is especially needed in South Africa, where there are around 12 million automobiles on the road and people are keeping their cars longer. The demand for affordable pre-owned cars has outpaced new cars since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Time is the critical element for township mechanics, though. Their businesses see lots of walk-in clients, prices are often negotiated and customers expect quick service \u2014 or they will look elsewhere.",
      "\u201cAll the mechanic sells is time,\u201d said Amanda Gcabashe, managing director of UBU Investment Holdings, an economic advisory company that helped set up the cooperative. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we came with this to say, how do we make sure that we then solve that pain point by making spares easily accessible?\u201d",
      "She said that as well as the business help, the collective is also looking to offer life insurance packages and other social safety net services for its mechanics.",
      "Bulelani Balabala, the founder of the Township Entrepreneurs Alliance, said cooperatives were a powerful way to harness the potential of small businesses serving millions of people in townships.",

      "The price of oil initially jumped 6% after trading began Sunday night, a signal of rising worries as investors got their first chance to react to the U.S. bombings.

    "story": [
      "The National Transportation Safety Board is set to hold a public meeting about the door plug panel that blew out during a terrifying Alaska Airlines flight in January of 2024",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday will be focused on preventing another terrifying event like the one involving a panel that flew off a Boeing 737 Max midair in January of 2024.",
      "The board will discuss what NTSB investigators have uncovered over the past 17 months, including their revelation that bolts securing what is known as the door plug panel were removed and never replaced during a repair. Board members were also expected to approve recommendations to keep something similar from ever happening again.",
      "The blow out aboard Alaska Airlines flight 1282 occurred minutes after it took off from Portland, Oregon, and created a roaring air vacuum that sucked objects out of the cabin and scattered them on the ground below along with debris from the fuselage. Seven passengers and one flight attended received minor injuries, but no one was killed. Pilots were able to land the plane safely back at the airport.",
      "The accident occurred as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression and a few cellphones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane as 171 passengers contended with wind and roaring noise.",
      "The first six minutes of the flight to Southern California\u2019s Ontario International Airport were routine. The Boeing 737 Max 9 was about halfway to its cruising altitude and traveling at more than 400 mph (640 kph) when passengers described a loud \u201cboom\u201d and wind so strong it ripped the shirt off someone\u2019s back.",
      "\u201cWe knew something was wrong,\u201d Kelly Bartlett told The Associated Press in the days following the flight. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what. We didn\u2019t know how serious. We didn\u2019t know if it meant we were going to crash.\u201d",
      "The 2-foot-by-4-foot (61-centimeter-by-122-centimeter) piece of fuselage covering an unoperational emergency exit behind the left wing had blown out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, including the two seats closest to the opening.",
      "The panel that blew off was made and installed by a supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. It was removed at a Boeing factory so workers could repair damaged rivets, but bolts that help secure the door plug weren\u2019t replaced. It\u2019s not clear who removed the panel.",
      "The NTSB said in a preliminary report that four bolts were not replaced after a repair job in a Boeing factory, but the company has said the work was not documented.",
      "Boeing factory workers told NTSB investigators that they felt pressured to work too fast and were asked to perform jobs that they weren\u2019t qualified for, including opening and closing the door plug on the particular plane involved.",
      "A Boeing door installer said he was never told to take any shortcuts, but everyone faced pressure to keep the assembly line moving.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how mistakes are made. People try to work too fast,\u201d he told investigators. The installer and other workers were not named in documents about the probe.",
      "The Max version of Boeing\u2019s bestselling 737 airplane has been the source of persistent troubles for the company since two of the jets crashed, one in Indonesia in 2018 and another in Ethiopia in 2019, killing a combined 346 people.",
      "Investigators determined those crashes were caused by a system that relied on a sensor providing faulty readings to push the nose down, leaving pilots unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned the system.",
      "Last month, the Justice Department reached a deal allowing Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading U.S. regulators about the Max before the two crashes.",
      "But regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration have capped Boeing's 737 Max production at 38 jets per month while investigators ensure the company has strengthened its safety practices.",
      "Boeing hired a new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, last year and created a new position for a senior vice president of quality to help improve its manufacturing.",
      "The company was back in the news earlier this month when a 787 flown by Air India crashed shortly after takeoff and killed at least 270 people. Investigators have not determined what caused that crash, but so far they have not found any flaws with the model, which has a strong safety record.",

      "An instructor glides between speaking Spanish and English as he teaches Manuel Castillo, a native Spanish speaker, how to inspect a school bus. They\u2019re using a printed script of English phrases to practice what Castillo would say during a roadside inspection.",
      "Brushing up on English has taken on new urgency for future and current truck drivers after President Donald Trump issued an executive order saying truckers who don\u2019t read and speak the language proficiently would be considered unfit for service.",
      "\u201cA driver who can\u2019t understand English will not drive a commercial vehicle in this country. Period,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said last month while announcing enforcement guidelines that take effect on Wednesday.",
      "Updated U.S. Department of Transportation procedures call for enhanced inspections to determine if commercial motor vehicle operators can reply to questions and directions in English, as well as understand highway traffic signs and electronic message boards.",
      "Truckers who learned English as a second language are concerned they may lose their jobs if they make a mistake or speak with a heavy accent while under questioning. Some have worked to improve their English fluency by taking classes, reciting scripts and watching instructional videos.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s not the language that you prefer to use daily, you may get a little nervous and you may feel, \u2018What if I say the wrong thing?\u2019\u201d said Jerry Maldonado, chairman of the board of the Laredo Motor Carriers Association, a trade association in Laredo, Texas, that represents approximately 200 trucking companies. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be, at the end of the day, the interpretation of the officer, so that makes people nervous.\u201d",
      "The guidance applies to truck and bus drivers engaged in interstate commerce. It aims to improve road safety following incidents in which truck drivers' inability to read signs or speak English may have contributed to traffic deaths, the Transportation Department said.",
      "Requiring truck drivers to speak and read English isn\u2019t new, but the penalty for not meeting the proficiency standard is becoming more severe.",
      "To get a commercial driver\u2019s license, applicants must pass a written test and be able to name the parts of a bus or truck in English as they check tire inflation, tread depth, lug nuts and coolants.",
      "The revised policy reverses guidance issued nine years ago, near the end of then-President Barack Obama\u2019s final term, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. In 2016, the agency said drivers whose English skills were found lacking could receive a citation but not be prohibited from working. Before that, the penalty was getting placed on \u201cout-of-service status.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have bridges that get hit because drivers don\u2019t understand the signs on the bridges for things like height clearance,\u201d Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association President Todd Spencer said.",
      "In Laredo, a border city where many residents speak a mix of English and Spanish, Maldonado\u2019s association is offering free English classes on weekends to help truckers feel more confident in their ability to communicate.",
      "\u201cEverybody knows what a stop sign looks like,\u201d Maldonado said. \u201cBut if there\u2019s construction or if there is an accident five miles down the road, and they have to put up a sign \u2014 \u2018Caution, must exit now, road closed ahead,\u2019 and you are not able to read that or understand that, that could potentially be a safety issue.\u201d",
      "At Driving Academy in Linden, New Jersey, multilingual instructors teach students how to inspect vehicle parts in their first language and then provide explanations in English, according to founder Jonathan Marques. The school created scripts so students could practice what to say if they're stopped, he said.",
      "Students are advised to watch training videos as homework, while licensed truckers can listen to English language apps instead of music when they're on the road, Marques suggested.",
      "Instructor Paul Cuartas helps students prepare but worries that inspectors will now expect truckers and bus drivers to have perfect English. \u201cI\u2019m concerned because now for all the Spanish people it\u2019s more difficult,\u201d he said.",
      "Castillo, who moved to the U.S. from Ecuador in 1993, said he has no problem understanding English but has been watching videos to study industry terms. \u201cSome words I don\u2019t understand, but I try to learn more English,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked whether he supports the president's executive order, Castillo said he voted for Trump but doesn\u2019t agree with the president's push to deport some immigrants who haven\u2019t committed crimes.",
      "\u201cHe makes a lot of problems, especially for Hispanic people,\u201d Castillo said.",
      "GTR Trucking School in Detroit also has offered students ESL classes. Co-owner Al Myftiu drove a truck after moving to the U.S. from Albania in 1993. He said he wants to create a small book of phrases that truckers need to learn.",
      "For students with a thick accent, \u201cI tell them, \u2018Slow down, speak slowly and people can understand you, and if you don\u2019t understand something, you can ask,\u2019\" Myftiu said.",
      "Roadside inspections can be initiated over issues such as a faulty brake light or on a routine basis, and often take place at weigh stations.",
      "The guidance directs inspectors who suspect a driver doesn\u2019t understand what they're saying to administer an English proficiency test, which includes both an interview and a highway traffic sign recognition component.",
      "In the past, some drivers used translation apps to communicate with federal inspectors. The updated policy bars the use of interpreters, smartphones, cue cards or other aids during interviews.",
      "Several truck drivers taking a break at Flying J Travel Center in New Jersey said they support Trump's order, adding that drivers who heavily rely on translation programs probably wouldn\u2019t be able to read important signs.",
      "\u201cWe try to ask them questions about the business just to strike a conversation, ... and they\u2019re not able to communicate with us at all,\u201d Kassem Elkhatib, one of the drivers at Flying J, said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how safety inspectors will decide whether a driver knows enough English because that portion of the instructions was redacted from the guidance distributed by Transportation Department.",
      "The department advised motor carriers that drivers should be able to answer questions about shipping documents, the origin and destination of trips, and how long they've been on duty.",
      "A trucker placed out of service and the company they work for are responsible for ensuring a language violation is corrected before the driver hits the highway again, the Transportation Department said.",
      "Truck drivers who practice the Sikh religion already face discrimination in hiring and at loading docks, according to Mannirmal Kaur, federal policy manager for Sikh Coalition, an advocacy group. Now they are worried about inspectors making subjective, non-standardized determinations about which of them are proficient in English, she said.",
      "\u201cA truck driver who does speak English sufficiently to comply with federal standards but maybe they speak with an accent, or maybe they use a different vocabulary that the inspector isn\u2019t used to hearing: Is that person then going to be subject to an English language violation?\u201d Kaur asked. \u201cAnd under the new policy, are they then going to be designated out-of-service, which could result in unemployment?\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. entry into Israel\u2019s war with Iran has caused travel disruptions to pile up globally.",
      "Following unprecedented bombings ordered by President Donald Trump on three Iranian nuclear and military sites over the weekend, Iran on Monday launched a missile attack on U.S. forces at Qatar's Al Udeid Air Base. Qatar had closed its airspace just hours earlier, after both the U.S. and U.K. also urged their citizens to shelter in place there.",
      "The region has been on edge following the weekend strikes from the U.S. \u2014 and since Israel began the war with a surprise bombardment on Iran, which has responded with its own missile and drone strikes, earlier this month.",
      "As deadly attacks escalated between Israel and Iran, sections of airspace and airports throughout the region have temporarily closed. And airlines canceled more flights in recent days, with some halting select routes through the middle of the week \u2014 particularly in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, just across the Persian Gulf from Iran.",
      "The Middle East carriers were severely affected with cancellations and delays. Qatar Airways said its flights were suspended because of the closure of air traffic in Qatar.",
      "\u201cThe airline is working closely with government stakeholders and the relevant authorities to support impacted passengers, and will resume operations when the airspace reopens,\u201d it said, while warning that delays were likely even after operations resume.",
      "Additional ground staff was sent to Hamad International Airport and other key airports to assist affected passengers, it said.",
      "Emirates suspended all flights to Iran and Iraq, including those serving Baghdad and Basra, until and including Monday 30 June 2025. An unspecified number of other Emirates flights were rerouted but continuing to operate flights as scheduled, using flight paths well distanced from conflict areas. Some flights may be delayed.",
      "Etihad Airways, the other of the two flag carriers of the United Arab Emirates, suspended all flights between Abu Dhabi and Tel Aviv through 15 July, and also announced several regional flight cancellations for Monday and Tuesday, including those connecting Abu Dhabi to and from Kuwait, Doha, Dammam and Muscat.",
      "Gulf Air, the carrier of the Kingdom of Bahrain, extended the cancellation of scheduled flights to Jordan and until June 27.",
      "\u201cAs the safety of its passengers and crew members remains a top priority, Gulf Air will continue to monitor developments in the region closely, and work with its partners to help accommodate and reroute passengers affected by these flight cancellations,\u201d it said.",
      "Singapore Airlines, for example, canceled some flights to and from Dubai starting Sunday and through Wednesday, citing \u201ca security assessment of the geopolitical situation in the Middle East.\u201d And British Airways has similarly suspended flights to and from Doha through Wednesday.",
      "\u201cSafety is always our highest priority,\u201d British Airways said in a statement confirming its cancellations to The Associated Press, adding that it \u201cwill keep the situation under review.\u201d",
      "Air India on Monday announced it was ceasing \u201call operations to the region as well as to and from the East Coast of North America and Europe\u201d immediately until further notice. The airline, which is still reeling from a plane crash that killed at least 270 people earlier this month, added that India-bound flights from North America were being diverted or rerouted away from closed airspaces.",
      "Air tracking data from FlightAware showed 243 cancellations worldwide as of Tuesday. Dubai International Airport topped the list with 26 cancellations in and out of the airport as of 0600 GMT. And Air India had had the highest amount of cancellations among carriers, totaling 25 at about 0600 GMT.",
      "In other developments, Philippine Airlines canceled several flights to the Middle East, including those to Doha, Dubai and Riyadh for Tuesday and one to Doha Wednesday. Japan Airlines said a flight from Tokyo's Haneda airport to Doha had to return Monday, and subsequently scheduled flights have all been canceled through June 27.",
      "A Qatar Airways flight from Hong Kong to Doha was canceled on Tuesday. Hong Kong\u2019s flagship carrier Cathay Pacific said none of its flights enter the airspace of Israel, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Jordan or Lebanon, and their operations to and from the Middle East remain normal.",
      "Such disruptions have snarled travel, particularly as central hubs in the Middle East often connect flights worldwide \u2014 but experts stress that these kind of airspace closures and flight diversions are critical to ensuring safety, especially if future escalation emerges suddenly.",
      "\u201cIt is the responsibility of states, countries to ensure that their airspace is safe for passage of aircraft,\u201d Hassan Shahidi, president and CEO of the Flight Safety Foundation. He added that on Monday \u201cthe Qataris did the absolutely right thing to close their airspace because of the threat of conflict.\u201d",
      "Beyond Qatari airspace, Flightradar24 reported that UAE airspace was also closed on Monday. After several hours of diversions, flights appeared to be landing and taking off in the country again.",
      "Monday marks the latest \u201cdramatic increase\u201d in this kind of impact, said Ian Petchenik, director of communications at Flightradar24. And while the future is unknown, he added that it's important to remember airspace closures and flight cancellations reflect that \u201cairlines, air traffic controllers and flight crews are doing their best to keep everybody safe.\u201d",
      "Shahidi adds that it's important for travelers to monitor government guidance \u2014 such as safety notices from the U.S. State Department.",
      "How long the war lasts and what, if any, future escalation comes next could carry more widespread implications. Beyond disrupting global flight networks farther down the road, Shahidi stresses that it's very difficult for people who may need or want to evacuate countries impacted by the war to do so without access to commercial flights.",
      "At the same time, he adds, it's critical that state authorities focus on keeping their skies safe \u2014 pointing to past tragedies of passenger flights that were shot down by strikes. That includes Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which was shot down by Russian-backed forces while flying over Ukraine in 2014, killing 298 people.",
      "\u201cWe are all praying and urging resolution to this conflict \u2014 and especially as it relates to protection of civilian air travel,\" Shahidi said. \"We do not want to have an MH17, with innocent lives being lost in a missile strike ... We do not want to repeat that history.\u201d",

      "A budget proposal from Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee would mandate the sale of more than 3,125 square miles (8,093 square kilometers) of federal lands to state or other entities. It was included recently in a draft provision of the GOP\u2019s sweeping tax cut package.",

      "Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman on Monday said the central bank should consider cutting its key interest rate as soon as its next meeting in July, underscoring deep divisions among Fed officials as they endure sharp criticism from the White House",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman on Monday said the central bank should consider cutting its key interest rate as soon as its next meeting in July, underscoring deep divisions among Fed officials as they endure sharp criticism from the White House.",
      "Bowman said that President Donald Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, and any upcoming increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise.",
      "\u201cIt is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed, and have a smaller effect than initially expected,\u201d Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. \u201cShould inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting,\u201d which is scheduled for July 29-30.",
      "Bowman, who was appointed to the Fed's board of governors by Donald Trump in 2018, is the second high-profile official to express support for a potential July cut in as many days. On Friday, Christopher Waller, also a Trump appointee to the Fed's board, said in a television interview that the Fed should consider cutting borrowing costs next month.",
      "The blunt calls for rate cuts by Waller and Bowman differ from Fed Chair Jerome Powell's suggestion in a news conference last week that the central bank would monitor the economy over the summer and see how inflation responded to tariffs before deciding whether to reduce borrowing costs.",
      "The comments arrive as Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not cutting rates, calling the Fed chair a \u201cnumbskull\u201d and a \u201cfool\u201d for not doing so, raising concerns about the Fed's independence from politics. The president claims Fed cuts would reduce the government\u2019s borrowing costs, though the rates the government pays are mostly set by market forces, not the Fed.",
      "Bowman appeared particularly dismissive toward the threat of tariffs, which many economists say could slow growth, particularly if companies absorb the cost of the duties rather than passing them on to consumers. Doing so would cut their profit margins, which would reduce their ability to hire and invest in new business.",
      "\u201cSmall and one-off price increases this year should translate only into a small drag on real activity,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI also expect that less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more friendly business environment will likely boost supply and largely offset any negative effects on economic activity and prices.\u201d",
      "When the Fed lowers the short-term interest rate it controls, it often reduces borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and business loans. Yet sometimes financial markets keep longer-term rates higher: The Fed cut its rate a full percentage point last year, to about 4.3%, but mortgage rates only declined slighty.",
      "On Friday, Waller told CNBC that with inflation remaining tame and the economy potentially slowing, the Fed should consider a rate cut next month. He pointed to rising unemployment among recent college graduates as a sign of possible weakening in the economy, and said it was better to cut before the labor market noticeably worsened.",
      "\u201cI'm all in favor of saying maybe we should start thinking about cutting the policy rate at the next meeting, because we don\u2019t want to wait until the job market tanks before we start cutting,\u201d Waller said.",
      "Still, at last week's Fed meeting, seven of the 19 officials who participate in the central bank's interest-rate decisions supported keeping rates unchanged for the rest of this year, and two penciled in just one cut.",
      "Inflation has steadily cooled this year despite widespread concerns among economists that Trump's tariffs would boost prices. The consumer price index ticked up just 0.1% from April to May, the government said last week, a sign that price pressures are muted. Prices for some goods rose last month, but the cost for many services such as air fares and hotels fell, offsetting any tariff impact.",
      "Compared with a year ago, prices rose 2.4% in May, up from 2.3% in April.",
      "Trump has slapped a 10% duty on all imports, along with an additional 30% levy on goods from China, 50% on steel and aluminum, and 25% on autos.",
      "Still, many economists say it is likely that tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months. Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested at a news conference last week that the central bank wants to closely monitor how inflation evolves over the next few months before deciding whether to cut rates.",
      "Also Friday, Mary Daly, president of the Fed's San Francisco branch, said on CNBC that she looked \u201cmore to the fall\u201d as an appropriate time to cut rates.",

      "New York\u2019s governor is calling for the construction of the state\u2019s first new nuclear power plant in decades",
      "NEW YORK -- New York\u2019s governor on Monday proposed the construction of the state\u2019s first new nuclear power plant in decades.",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul directed the state\u2019s power authority to develop an advanced, \u201czero-emission\u201d facility in upstate New York that she hopes will help create a clean, reliable and affordable electric grid for the state.",
      "She said the state power authority will seek to develop \u201cat least\u201d one new nuclear energy facility with a combined capacity of no less than one gigawatt of electricity. That would increase the state\u2019s total nuclear capacity to about 4.3 gigawatts.",
      "The Democrat said the state needs to secure its \u201cenergy independence\u201d if it wants to continue to attract large manufacturers that create good-paying jobs as it deactivates aging fossil fuel power plants.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to get it done,\u201d Hochul said, speaking at the Niagara County Power Project in Lewiston. \u201cThis historic initiative will lay the foundation for the next generation of prosperity.\u201d",
      "The governor said the state hasn\u2019t decided on a potential location, but that upstate communities appear receptive, given the potential for creating 1,600 construction jobs and 1,200 permanent jobs once the facility is operational.",
      "\u201cEverybody is raising their hand right now,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to decide.\u201d",
      "Among those likely in the running is the Nine Mile Point nuclear plant in Oswego. Hochul\u2019s administration has been supportive of Maryland power company Constellation\u2019s bid to build a new nuclear reactor at the two-reactor facility.",
      "American utilities have been broadly reluctant to launch new nuclear plants due to high cost overruns and delays on recent high-profile projects.",
      "Georgia Power Company completed the first two new nuclear reactors in the country in a generation last year. But Units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle in Waynesboro, Georgia, cost nearly $35 billion and were powered up some seven years later than initially hoped.",
      "Last month, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation\u2019s largest public power company, applied to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop what it bills as a next-generation nuclear power plant at its Clinch River site in Oak Ridge. The federally owned utility provides electricity to seven states and operates three traditional, large nuclear power plants, providing about 40% of the Tennessee Valley\u2019s power.",
      "New York currently has three active nuclear plants, all located upstate along Lake Ontario and owned by Constellation. The Nine Mile Point, Robert Emmett Ginna and James A. FitzPatrick plants provide about 3.3 gigawatts of power, or roughly 20% of the state\u2019s electricity, according to Hochul\u2019s office.",
      "The last nuclear power plant built in the state was Unit 2 at Nine Mile Point in 1989. At its peak, nuclear power provided about 5.4 gigawatts, or roughly one-third of the state\u2019s electrical supply, according to the advocacy group Nuclear New York.",
      "The New York Power Authority previously operated two nuclear plants, including the Indian Point Power Plant, which shut down in 2021. That facility was located along the Hudson River some 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of New York City in Buchanan.",
      "The other facility, once operated by the state, was the FitzPatrick plant, which the power authority sold in 2000 and is now run by Constellation.",

      "\u201cI don't think so,\u201d the judge replied.",
      "Plaintiffs' attorney William Schultz argued that the administration isn't following Lamberth's order and failed to restore VOA programming in line with its mandate from Congress, which appropriated $262 million for VOA in the 2025 fiscal year. Schultz, who represents VOA journalists, said virtually its entire staff has been on paid administrative leave for more than three months.",
      "\u201cHaving people sit at home is not complying with these statutes or congressional appropriations,\u201d he said.",

      "Plaintiffs' attorneys asked Lamberth to order the administration to develop a plan that would operate VOA in a manner that complies with the preliminary injunction in the case. The judge didn't immediately rule on that request.",
      "Approximately 1,400 people at Voice of America and the U.S. Agency for Global Media, or 85% of its workforce, have lost their jobs since March, said Kari Lake, Trump\u2019s senior advisor to the agency. She said it was part of a \u201clong-overdue effort to dismantle a bloated, unaccountable bureaucracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor decades, American taxpayers have been forced to bankroll an agency that\u2019s been riddled with dysfunction, bias and waste,\u201d Lake said in a news release. \u201cThat ends now.\u201d",
      "Recipients of the layoff notices included employees at VOA\u2019s Persian-language service who were brought back from administrative leave last week to broadcast reports to Iran following Israel\u2019s attack.",
      "Most VOA employees have been on administrative leave since March 15, their broadcasts and social media posts mostly silenced.",
      "\u201cWhat would be the purpose of Voice of America if there was no voice?\u201d Lamberth asked.",
      "Plaintiffs' attorney Georgina Yeomans said the administration's plans for VOA have been \u201cremarkably hard to pin down.\u201d",
      "VOA began by broadcasting stories about American democracy to residents of Nazi Germany and grew to deliver news around the world in dozens of languages, often in countries without a tradition of free press.",

      "There\u2019s going to be plenty of hard throwing Wednesday in the first pitching matchup between Pittsburgh\u2019s Paul Skenes and Milwaukee\u2019s Jacob Misiorowski",
      "MILWAUKEE -- There\u2019s going to be plenty of hard throwing Wednesday in the first pitching matchup between Pittsburgh\u2019s Paul Skenes and Milwaukee\u2019s Jacob Misiorowski.",
      "Just don\u2019t expect too much hard contact.",
      "Skenes, the 2024 NL rookie of the year, didn\u2019t allow a hit the last time he pitched in Milwaukee. Misiorowski doesn\u2019t have Skenes\u2019 track record, but he has given up just one hit over 11 innings in his first two career starts.",
      "The 23-year-old flamethrowing right-handers meet as opposing starters for the first time Wednesday at Milwaukee.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be really entertaining to watch,\u201d Misiorowski said. \u201cTwo really good prospects \u2013 I mean, he\u2019s not a prospect anymore, I guess. Two guys that are at the top of their game right now. So I think it\u2019s cool. It\u2019s going to be fun.\"",
      "Statcast says Skenes has an average four-seam fastball velocity of 98.1 mph that ranks him behind only Cincinnati\u2019s Hunter Greene (99.3) among starters who have thrown enough pitches to qualify. In his first two starts, Misiorowski had an average four-seam fastball velocity of 99.7 mph.",
      "According to Sportradar, this would be the second-highest combined average velocities by two starters entering a game in which they faced each other since at least 2009. Jacob deGrom had an average fastball velocity of 99.7 and Spencer Strider's was at 98.2 heading into an Aug. 7, 2022, matchup that deGrom's New York Mets won 5-2 over Strider's Atlanta Braves.",
      "While Misiorowski and Skenes have similar velocities, Brewers manager Pat Murphy said it\u2019s far too soon to start grouping them together.",
      "\u201c(Skenes is) one of the best in the game,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cMiz is in his third start. It\u2019s unfair to compare them, for sure. Unfair to Skenes, you know what I mean? It should be exciting. Miz is going on four days rest for the first time.\u201d",
      "But this showcase should give Misiorowski a chance to measure himself against the game\u2019s best.",
      "Skenes indeed has long since graduated from prospect status to solidify himself as one of the game\u2019s top pitchers. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 draft finished third in the NL Cy Young Award voting last year and has gone 15-9 with a 1.91 ERA and 276 strikeouts over 235 innings in his young career.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like everything just flows off his back,\u201d Pirates manager Don Kelly said. \u201cHe never lets anything affect him too much, the way that he\u2019s able to adjust and adapt not just start to start, from inning to inning, batter to batter, understanding his stuff, what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "In his two previous appearances against the Brewers, Skenes has struck out 19 while allowing only four hits and one run over 13 innings. The last time he pitched at Milwaukee, Skenes pitched seven innings of no-hit ball before departing as the Pirates limited the Brewers to one total hit in a 1-0 victory last July.",
      "Misiorowski has been equally effective in a significantly smaller sample size.",
      "He made his major league debut June 12 and held St. Louis hitless for five innings before departing the Brewers\u2019 6-0 victory with cramping and his right calf and quadriceps. He threw 14 pitches at least 100 mph and reached a top speed of 102.2 that night.",
      "Misiorowski came back Friday and had a perfect game going until he walked Byron Buxton and allowed a homer to Matt Wallner in the seventh inning of a 17-6 triumph at Minnesota.",
      "Both teams are eager to see what happens as Misiorowski gets to measure himself against one of the game's most dominant pitchers in Skenes.",
      "\u201cGood luck to the hitters,\u201d Brewers pitcher Brandon Woodruff said. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 mph every pitch. It\u2019s kind of crazy in terms of how the game has changed that way. It seems like everybody throws 100 now. It\u2019s cool. It\u2019s good for the game. It\u2019s two young guys who are obviously really good.\u201d",
      "Although the two pitchers hadn\u2019t met until Monday, Misiorowski nearly preceded Skenes at LSU. Misiorowski committed to LSU, but decided to start his pro career after the Brewers selected hm out of Crowder College in Neosho, Missouri, in the second round of the 2022 draft.",
      "One year later, Skenes led LSU to a College World Series title in his lone season with the Tigers. Skenes transferred to LSU after spending two seasons at Air Force.",
      "Now, they\u2019re finally in a ballpark together, only as opponents rather than teammates.",
      "\u201cWe know what Paul can do,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see their guy out there. It\u2019s going to be a good pitching matchup. Just really looking forward to that one.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Cooper Flagg and his Duke teammates were together celebrating a victory over North Carolina the night of Feb. 1 when one of them saw the news that had rocked the basketball world.",
      "The Dallas Mavericks were trading Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers.",
      "\u201cWe just all started going crazy,\u201d Flagg said Tuesday. \u201cIt was such a shock. Like, it was craziness.\u201d",
      "Now Flagg is set to take Doncic's place as the franchise superstar in Dallas.",
      "Flagg is expected to be selected by the Mavericks with the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft on Wednesday night after a sensational one-season stopover with the Blue Devils.",
      "Everybody but Flagg seems certain he is the Mavs' man \u2014 \u201cI haven\u2019t had that conversation at all,\u201d he insisted \u2014 and there's really no reason for the team to look otherwise. Flagg was the consensus college player of the year, only the fourth freshman to win the Wooden Award after averaging 19.2 points and 7.5 rebounds while leading Duke to the Final Four.",
      "A little more than a month later, the Mavericks turned just a 1.8% chance into a lottery victory, giving them the right to pick first for the second time in franchise history. They brought Flagg in for what he felt was a good workout that lasted more than an hour, though he said they never said he would be their pick.",
      "He's surely one of the few who might believe there's reason to wait until Commissioner Adam Silver announces the selection at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.",
      "\u201cI mean, my whole family is in Dallas and they\u2019re stoked to be able to go to Mavs games and watch Cooper. He\u2019s part of the family,\u201d said UConn forward Liam McNeeley, Flagg's teammate at Montverde Academy in Montverde, Florida.",
      "Flagg's selection would return the NBA draft to the way it was for so long, with a one-and-done college player starting it. A freshman went first for 13 straight years from 2010-22 before the last two No. 1 picks, Victor Wembanyama and Zaccharie Risacher, were both from France.",
      "The No. 2 pick could be Wembanyama's teammate, as the Spurs are set to draft at No. 2. Philadelphia, Charlotte and Utah round out the top five, with NBA champion Oklahoma City holding two first-round selections and the Brooklyn Nets owning four.",
      "It's already been a busy NBA offseason, with Kevin Durant and Jrue Holiday being traded. It's unlikely the Mavericks would consider trading the rights to Flagg, especially not after the uproar from their fans when they dealt away the beloved Doncic.",
      "The No. 3 pick in 2018 from Slovenia led the Mavericks to the 2024 NBA Finals and had become a perennial All-Star and MVP candidate. Flagg said he's not concerned about the pressure that would come with stepping into Doncic's shoes.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t look at anything as pressure,\u201d Flagg said. \u201cI think me going into whatever situation I go into, I\u2019m just going to try to be myself all the time and I\u2019m going push myself to be better and better every single day and make the most out of every day. I\u2019m not worried about living up to certain players\u2019 expectations or things like that.\u201d",
      "Flagg has already shown he isn't afraid of a challenge. He could have still been in high school last season, but decided to reclassify so he could enter college, and subsequently the NBA, a year earlier.",
      "\u201cI think a quote my mom likes to say a lot, if you\u2019re the best player in the gym than you need to find a new gym,\u201d he said in explaining that decision. \"So for me, it was thinking about what I had left to do in high school, how much that would push me to become a better player.",
      "\u201cI felt it was time for me to kind of get to a new environment and push myself to higher levels.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, he reaches the highest one in basketball.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- India, Poland and Hungary launched their first astronauts in more than 40 years Wednesday, sending them on a private flight to the International Space Station.",
      "The three countries shared the tab for the two-week mission. Axiom Space, the Houston company that arranged the deal, put the ticket price at more than $65 million per customer.",
      "SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rocket blasted off from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center two weeks late because of space station leak concerns. The capsule on top carried not only the three newcomers to space \u2014 none of whom were alive when their countries\u2019 first astronauts launched \u2014 but America\u2019s most experienced astronaut, Peggy Whitson.",
      "Besides Whitson, the crew includes India\u2019s Shubhanshu Shukla, a pilot in the Indian Air Force; Hungary\u2019s Tibor Kapu, a mechanical engineer; and Poland\u2019s Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, a radiation expert and one of the European Space Agency\u2019s project astronauts sometimes pressed into temporary duty.",
      "The astronauts are due to arrive at the orbiting lab the next morning.",
      "In addition to dozens of experiments, the astronauts are flying food that celebrates their heritage: Indian curry and rice with mango nectar; spicy Hungarian paprika paste; and freeze-fried Polish pierogies.",
      "Hungary\u2019s first astronaut, Bertalan Farkas, cheered on Kapu from the launch site.",
      "\u201cFor such a small country as Hungary, it is really important to collaborate in a peaceful international space cooperation,\u201d Farkas told The Associated Press. He called it \u201cone of the most important moments\" of his life.",
      "Farkas launched with the Soviets in 1980, taking along a teddy bear in a cosmonaut suit that went back up with Kapu. India and Poland\u2019s original astronauts also launched with the Soviets in the late 1970s and 1980s.",
      "Uznanski-Wisniewski carried up the Polish flag worn on his predecessor\u2019s spacesuit, noting that Miroslaw Hermaszewski was his biggest supporter until his death in 2022. India\u2019s first astronaut, Rakesh Sharma, couldn\u2019t make it to Florida for the launch; Shukla said he\u2019s been a mentor \u201cat every step of this journey\u201d and is flying a surprise gift for him.",
      "While others born in India and Hungary have flown in space before \u2014 including NASA astronaut Kalpana Chawla, who died aboard the shuttle Columbia in 2003, and two-time space tourist Charles Simonyi, of Microsoft fame \u2014 they were U.S. citizens at the time of launch.",
      "Shukla said before the flight that he hopes \u201cto ignite the curiosity of an entire generation in my country\u201d and drive innovation. Like his crewmates, he plans several outreach events with those back home.",
      "\u201cI truly believe that even though I, as an individual, am traveling to space, this is the journey of 1.4 billion people,\u201d he said.",
      "It was Axiom\u2019s fourth chartered flight to the space station since 2022 and Whitson\u2019s second time flying as an Axiom crew commander and chaperone. The trip caused her to miss her induction into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame late last month, since she was in quarantine before the flight. Whitson joined Axiom after retiring from NASA nearly a decade ago and has logged almost two years in orbit over her career.",
      "Once opposed to nontraditional station guests, NASA now throws out the welcome mat, charging for their food and upkeep while insisting that an experienced astronaut accompany them.",
      "It\u2019s all part of NASA\u2019s push to open space \u2014 moon included \u2014 to private businesses. Axiom is among several U.S. companies planning to launch their own space stations in the next few years. The goal is for them to be up and running before the international station comes down in 2031 after more than three decades of operation.",
      "Access to space \u201cis not only for the biggest agencies anymore \u2014 space is for everyone,\u201d Poland\u2019s Uznanski-Wisniewski said ahead of liftoff. He repeated the sentiment upon reaching orbit.",
      "Hungarians want to \u201csit at the same table with the giants,\u201d said Kapu. Through this mission, \u201cHungary gets one step closer to the stars.\u201d",
      "They should have flown earlier this year, but their mission was delayed following a switch in SpaceX capsules. The change enabled NASA\u2019s two stuck astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to return to Earth in March sooner than planned.",
      "The Axiom astronauts faced more launch delays once arriving in Florida. SpaceX had to fix an oxygen leak in its rocket, then NASA put the crew\u2019s visit on indefinite hold while monitoring repairs to longtime air leaks on the Russian side of the space station.",
      "Once in orbit, the astronauts radioed messages in their native languages and revealed the name they gave to their brand-new capsule: Grace.",
      "\u201cGood things come to those who wait,\" SpaceX told the crew. \"Godspeed to the maiden crew of Grace.\u201d",

      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters searching through the debris of Russia's nightly assault on their cities found a drone that was different to the rest",
      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters picking up the debris from Russia\u2019s nightly assault on their cities found a weapon that stood out from the rest.",
      "It had an advanced camera, a computing platform powered by artificial intelligence and a radio link, allowing an operator to pilot it remotely from Russia. It also contained new, Iranian-made, anti-jamming technology, according to a Ukrainian drone expert.",
      "Most Russian attack drones are black, said Serhii Beskrestnov, an electronics expert more widely known as Flash. The new one, he told The Associated Press, was white.",
      "Inside, there were no markings or labels consistent with Russian-made drones. Instead, the stickers followed a \u201cstandard Iran labeling system,\u201d Beskrestnov said.",
      "Experts who spoke to AP said the labels are not conclusive proof but the English-language words are consistent with how Iran marks its drones. It is quite possible, they said, that it was sold by Iran to Russia to test in combat.",
      "Moscow has pummeled Ukraine almost nightly with Iranian-designed drones throughout the course of the war, now in its fourth year. They swarm above Ukrainian cities, their moped-like sound filling the air, as air defenses and sharpshooters take aim. While some carry warheads, many are decoys.",
      "Russia is improving its drone technology and tactics, striking Ukraine with increasing success. But the U.K's Defense Ministry said Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran will \u201clikely negatively impact the future provision of Iranian military equipment to Russia,\" since Tehran had supplied \u201csignificant quantities\u201d of attack drones to Moscow.",
      "Israel\u2019s military would not comment on what it struck. Although it has carried out sweeping attacks across Iranian military facilities and the U.S. bombed nuclear sites, the impact on Iran\u2019s drone industry is not yet clear.",
      "The anti-jammer in the latest drone discovered in Ukraine contained new Iranian technology, suggested Beskrestnov. Other components in Russia's drones often come from Russia, China and the West.",
      "Although Russia's drones are based on an Iranian design, the majority are now made in Russia.",
      "And because much of the technology to make them, including the Iranian software and technical expertise, has already been transferred to Russia, the immediate impact on Moscow\u2019s drone program could be limited, experts said.",
      "However, if Israel struck facilities producing drones and components \u2014 such as engines and anti-jamming units \u2014 which are shipped to Russia, then Moscow could face supply shortages, experts suggested.",
      "Moscow makes its Shahed \u2014 meaning \u201cwitness\u201d in Farsi \u2014 drones based on an Iranian model in a highly secure factory in central Russia.",
      "The Alabuga plant in the Tatarstan region took delivery of its first Iranian drones in 2022 after Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal. It later established its own production lines, churning out thousands of them.",
      "The upgrades identified from debris in Ukraine are the latest in a series of innovations that began with Russia buying drones directly from Iran in the fall of 2022, according to leaked documents from Alabuga previously reported on by AP.",
      "In early 2023, Iran shipped about 600 disassembled drones to be reassembled in Russia before production was localized. In 2024, the design was adapted.",
      "Specialists added cameras to some drones and implemented a plan, revealed in an AP investigation, dubbed Operation False Target \u2014 creating decoys to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.",
      "Alabuga also modified the Shahed to make it more lethal, creating a thermobaric drone which sucks out all the oxygen in its path \u2014 potentially collapsing lungs, crushing eyeballs and causing brain damage. The size of the warhead was also upgraded.",
      "In at least one case, Iran shipped a jet-powered Shahed that Russia \u201cexperimented\u201d with in Ukraine, said Fabian Hinz, an expert on Russian and Iranian drones at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force found two more examples of jet-powered Shaheds in May but it appears they have not been widely adopted.",
      "That\u2019s possibly because the Iranian design uses a very sophisticated jet engine that also powers Iran\u2019s cruise missiles, Hinz said. That likely makes it too expensive to use nightly in Ukraine, he said, even if the engine is swapped to a cheaper Chinese model.",
      "The electronics in the drone most recently found in Ukraine are also very expensive, Beskrestnov said, pointing to its AI computing platform, camera and radio link. It\u2019s unclear why it was deployed but Beskrestnov suggested it could be used to target \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d including electrical transmission towers.",
      "Previous versions of the Shahed drone could not hit a moving object or change their flight path once launched. They sometimes ended up \u201ctraveling in circles all through Ukraine before they finally hit a target,\u201d which made them easier to shoot down, said David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.",
      "The radio link means an operator can communicate with the drone from Russia, introduce a new target and potentially control many drones at the same time, the experts said.",
      "The remotely operable Shahed has similarities to drones Russia is already using on the front lines and is particularly resistant to jamming, Beskrestnov said.",
      "There are eight, rather than four, antennas on the drone which means it is harder for Ukraine to overwhelm it with electronic warfare, he said.",
      "The new drone has markings that suggest the anti-jamming unit was made in Iran within the past year and similarities to Iranian components found in older models of the Shahed, said Beskrestnov.",
      "Such advanced antennas, said Hinz, have not previously been seen on drones used in Ukraine but have been found on Iranian missiles destined for Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "In a statement, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense told AP in the past four months it had found drones with eight and 12 antennas made in China and Russia.",
      "Despite sanctions, both Russia and Iran have continued to find ways to procure Western technology.",
      "The drone\u2019s AI computing platform can help it autonomously navigate if communications are jammed. Similar technology was used by Ukraine to attack aircraft deep inside Russia during Operation Spiderweb, when it used drones to target Russian air bases hosting nuclear-capable strategic bombers.",
      "Russia is improving its technology at the same time as it is also changing its tactics.",
      "Moscow is flying the Shahed drones at high altitudes where they are out of reach of Ukrainian shooters, as well as lower down to avoid radio detection.",
      "It is also carrying out massive group attacks on cities including where drones sometimes dive-bomb a target, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said.",
      "The drones can be used to clear a path for cruise missiles or to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses by sending a wave of decoys followed by one or two with a warhead.",
      "The tactics appear to be working.",
      "AP collected almost a year\u2019s worth of Russian drone strike data on Ukraine posted online by the Ukrainian air force.",
      "An analysis shows that Russia significantly ramped up its attacks after U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January. And Russian hits have increased markedly since March \u2014 shortly before reports emerged that Russia was using Shahed drones with advanced jammers.",
      "In November 2024, only around 6% of drones hit a discernible target but, by June, that reached about 16%. On some nights, almost 50% of drones got through Ukraine\u2019s air defenses.",
      "Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said the Shaheds' effectiveness is likely because Russia is firing more drones, including decoys, as well as the change in technology and tactics.",
      "But although Russia appears to have had increasing success striking Ukraine, it is not clear if that will continue.",
      "Israel's strikes on Iran will \u201ccertainly\u201d hurt Russia long-term, Albright said.",

      "\u201cWe just showed the world: You don\u2019t want to mess with us kinetically,\u201d said Bellini, CEO of Bellini Capital. \u201cBut we are wide open digitally. We are like Swiss cheese.\"",
      "Two pro-Palestinian hacking groups claimed they targeted more than a dozen aviation firms, banks and oil companies following the U.S. strikes over the weekend.",
      "The hackers detailed their work in a post on the Telegram messaging service and urged other hackers to follow their lead, according to researchers at the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks the groups' activity.",
      "The attacks were denial-of-service attacks, in which a hacker tries to disrupt a website or online network.",
      "\u201cWe increase attacks from today,\u201d one of the hacker groups, known as Mysterious Team, posted Monday.",
      "Federal authorities say they are on guard for additional attempts by hackers to penetrate U.S. networks.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security issued a public bulletin Sunday warning of increased Iranian cyber threats. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a statement Tuesday urging organizations that operate critical infrastructure like water systems, pipelines or power plants to stay vigilant.",
      "While it lacks the technical abilities of China or Russia, Iran has long been known as a \u201cchaos agent\u201d when it comes to using cyberattacks to steal secrets, score political points or frighten opponents.",
      "Cyberattacks mounted by Iran's government may end if the ceasefire holds and Tehran looks to avoid another confrontation with the U.S. But hacker groups could still retaliate on Iran's behalf.",
      "In some cases, these groups have ties to military or intelligence agencies. In other cases, they act entirely independently. More than 60 such groups have been identified by researchers at the security firm Trustwave.",
      "These hackers can inflict significant economic and psychological blows. Following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, for instance, hackers penetrated an emergency alert app used by some Israelis and directed it to inform users that a nuclear missile was incoming.",
      "\u201cIt causes an immediate psychological impact,\" said Ziv Mador, vice president of security research at Trustwave's SpiderLabs, which tracks cyberthreats.",
      "Economic disruption, confusion and fear are all the goals of such operations, said Mador, who is based in Israel. \u201cWe saw the same thing in Russia-Ukraine.\u201d",
      "While Iran lacks the cyberwarfare capabilities of China or Russia, it has repeatedly tried to use its more modest operations to try to spy on foreign leaders \u2014 something national security experts predict Tehran is almost certain to try again as it seeks to suss out President Donald Trump\u2019s next moves.",
      "Last year, federal authorities charged three Iranian operatives with trying to hack Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. It would be wrong to assume Iran has given up those efforts, according to Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency cybersecurity expert who is now vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy, a Washington-based cybersecurity firm.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fairly certain that these limited resources are being used for intelligence collection to understand what Israel or the U.S. might be planning next, rather than performing destructive attacks against U.S. commercial organizations,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Calls to bolster America's digital defense come as the Trump administration has moved to slash some cybersecurity programs as part of its effort to shrink the size of government.",
      "CISA has placed staffers who worked on election security on leave and cut millions of dollars in funding for cybersecurity programs for local and state elections.",
      "The CIA, NSA and other intelligence agencies also have seen reductions in staffing. Trump abruptly fired Gen. Timothy Haugh, who oversaw the NSA and the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command.",
      "The Israel-Iran conflict shows the value of investments in cybersecurity and cyber offense, Mador said. He said Israel's strikes on Iran, which included attacks on nuclear scientists, required sophisticated cyberespionage that allowed Israel to track its targets.",
      "Expanding America's cyber defenses will require investments in education as well as technical fixes to ensure connected devices or networks aren't vulnerable, said Bellini, who recently contributed $40 million toward a new cybersecurity center at the University of South Florida.",
      "There is a new arms race when it comes to cyberwar, Bellini said, and it's a contest America can't afford to lose.",
      "\u201cIt's Wile E. Coyote vs. the Road Runner,\u201d Bellini said. \"It will go back and forth, and it will never end.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- It is often said music is the universal language of humanity. Now a 12-year-old Houston boy is putting that to the test among an unlikely audience \u2014 man's best friend.",
      "Yuvi Agarwal started playing keyboard when he was 4 and several years ago noticed his playing soothed his family's restless golden doodle, Bozo. He grew curious if it also could help stressed homeless animals.",
      "With help from his parents, who both have backgrounds in marketing, he founded the nonprofit Wild Tunes in 2023 to recruit musicians to play in animal shelters. So far he has enlisted about 100 volunteer musicians and singers of all ages and abilities to perform at nine shelters in Houston, New Jersey and Denver.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand the lyrics to enjoy the music. Just enjoy the melody, the harmony and the rhythms. So it transcends linguistic barriers, and even it can just transcend species,\u201d Agarwal said recently after playing hits like The Beatles' \u201cHey Jude\u201d and Ed Sheeran's \u201cPerfect\u201d on his portable keyboard at the Denver Animal Shelter.",
      "Agarwal, who was playing for an elderly miniature poodle named Pituca \u2014 Spanish slang sometimes used to describe a snob \u2014 said many of his four-legged listeners, which include cats, become excited when he enters their kennel. But after a few minutes of playing, they calm down. Some even go to sleep.",
      "He remembers a rescue dog named Penelope that refused to come out of her enclosure in Houston to be fed.",
      "\u201cWithin a short period of me playing, she went from not even coming out of her kennel to licking me all over my face and nibbling my ears,\u201d Agarwal said.",
      "A few stalls down from where he was jamming on his keyboard at the Denver shelter, volunteer Sarah McDonner played Mozart and Bach on her flute for Max, a 1-year-old stray boxer that tilted his head when she hit the high notes.",
      "\u201cThe animals having that human interaction in a positive way, I think, gives them something to look forward to, something that is different throughout their day,\u201d said McDonner, a professional musician who met Argawal in Houston.",
      "She helped bring the program to Colorado after moving to Denver a few months ago. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to give them something different from what they\u2019re used to in their little tiny cages ... and makes them more adoptable in the long run,\u201d McDonner said.",
      "While the effect of music on humans has been studied extensively, its role in animal behavior remains murky.",
      "Several studies suggest that classical music generally has a calming influence on dogs in stressful environments like kennels, shelters and veterinary clinics. But some researchers warn there is not enough data to support the claim.",
      "\u201cWe always want these really simplistic answers. So we want to say that music calms animals, for example, and I think that it\u2019s much more nuanced than that,\u201d said Lori Kogan, a self-described \u201cdog-person\" who chairs the human-animal interaction section of the American Psychological Association. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more research that needs to happen before I think that we can unequivocally say that music is a great thing for animals.\"",
      "Kogan, a professor and researcher at Colorado State University, has studied for more than two decades how animals and humans get along. Research involving the effect of music on dogs often produces mixed results, she said, because there are so many variables: the setting; the volume, type and tempo of the music and the breed of the dog and its previous exposure to music.",
      "She suggests a case-by-case approach to introducing music to animals.",
      "\u201cIf you play music for your pet, and they seem to like it and they appear calmer, then I think we can say that that\u2019s a positive thing, that you\u2019re providing some level of enrichment for that pet. ... I would encourage people to give it a try and to see how their pets respond,\u201d she said.",
      "For Agarwal, his firsthand experience at shelters is undeniable evidence that music helps comfort stressed animals, and he plans to grow Wild Tunes into a nationwide program. The volunteers get something out of it, too, he said.",
      "\"You get a really great way to practice your instrument or sing in front of a nonjudgmental audience, which can boost your confidence,\u201d he said.",

      "Defense tech hackathons are attracting engineering students, tech industry workers and hobbyists to solve military challenges",
      "SANDHURST, England -- Hunched over laptops, the team of four raced to solve a challenge: how to get a set of drones to fly themselves from one place to another when GPS and other signals are jammed by an enemy.",
      "Elsewhere around the hall, groups of people \u2014 engineering students, tech workers and hobbyists \u2014 gathered around long tables to brainstorm, write computer code or tinker with more drones and other hardware.",
      "Most of them were strangers when they first gathered last month at Britain's Sandhurst Military Academy to compete in a 24-hour \u201chackathon\" focused on defense technology. Many were drawn to the event because they wanted to use their technical skills to work on one of the biggest challenges confronting Europe: the continent's race to beef up its military capabilities as Russia's war in Ukraine threatens to widen global instability.",
      "\u201cGiven the geopolitical climate, defense tech is relevant now more than ever,\u201d said Aniketh Ramesh, a startup founder with a Ph.D. in robotics in extreme environments and one of the drone team members. The hackathon, he said, \u201cis a good place to sort of go and contribute your ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cRobotics and drones are having their iPhone moment\" because costs have come down and the hardware is widely available, Ramesh said. That means building drones to do new things is more a \u201cthinking challenge\" than a technical one, he said.",
      "Ramesh already knew one teammate, a former British army paratrooper, from a previous event. They recruited two others \u2014 one engineer and one with a Ph.D. in computer vision \u2014 through the event\u2019s group chat on Signal.",
      "The drone problem was just one of the many challenges the teams could choose to solve. The tasks were proposed by defense startups like German drone maker Helsing and robotics company Arx, the British military and Kyiv-based venture capital firm D3.",
      "Some worked on software, such as an algorithm to predict which way a target would move. Others came with their own ideas. One team made a plastic cup packed with sensors that could be produced in large amounts to be scattered across a battlefield. Another team built a scale model of an autonomous medical evacuation aircraft.",
      "Similar competitions have been held regularly across Europe since last year, inspired by the Ukrainian military\u2019s on-the-fly wartime innovations to fend off the larger Russian army.",
      "The grassroots meetups are part of a wider network of defense innovation that organizers hope to foster in Europe, underscoring the continent's scramble to churn out weapons that have been turbocharged by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s persistent threats to withdraw from the NATO trans-Atlantic security alliance.",
      "The idea is to \u201cgo build a prototype, take your prototype to become a product, and go build a company\u201d that can \u201cdeliver stuff to the frontline and hopefully save someone\u2019s life,\u201d said Benjamin Wolba, who organizes a separate but similar series, the European Defense Tech Hackathon.",
      "Wolba's group has held tournaments in about 10 cities in the past twelve months, including one in Lviv, Ukraine, in May, and has scheduled more this year in Sheffield, England; Gothenburg, Sweden; Marseilles, France; London; and Berlin.",
      "The European Union-backed EUDIS Defence Hackathon holds simultaneous competitions at eight universities twice a year. Meanwhile, NATO has launched DIANA, an \u201caccelerator\u201d program to speed up defense innovations.",
      "The competitions are producing real-world results. The winners of one European Defense Tech Hackathon were a team of Bulgarian high school students who came up with a de-mining solution that they used to found a startup.",
      "At last year\u2019s London event, the winning team devised an idea for an anti-drone system. They went to Ukraine for more testing, and then were bought by a startup that went on to raise millions in venture capital funding, said Richard Pass, co-founder of the London hackathon.",
      "This year, instead of a trophy, some London teams signed term sheets with investors.",
      "Hackathons have their origins in the software industry. Small teams of programmers and developers are pitted against each other in marathon brainstorming sessions to write programs that could become new products.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of the hackathon is you get a mixture of people who never normally meet,\u201d said Wolba. \u201cEngineers are \u201cpaired with actual investors who understand something on the commercial side, but also, critically, military end users.\u201d",
      "Organizers want to foster a culture of nimble startups to join Europe's defense ecosystem, traditionally dominated by a handful of big \u201cprime\u201d military contractors such as Britain's BAE, Germany's Rheinmetall and France's Thales that are focused on building pricey hardware.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a shift in the industry from the purchase of more exquisite, high-cost capabilities, such as fighter jets, or submarines, or expensive tanks, towards more low-cost systems that can give you scale advantages,\u201d said Pass.",
      "A recent aerial confrontation between Pakistan and India further highlights how Europe is at risk of losing its edge against adversaries, he said.",
      "Pass said reports that Pakistan used Chinese-made fighter jets armed with Chinese air-to-air missiles to down Indian air force planes, including three French-made Rafale jets, came as a big surprise.",
      "Not only does it show \u201ctechnological parity between the Chinese and leading Western industrial nations like France,\u201d but it also hints at China's advantages in mass-producing fighter jets that could overwhelm Western forces, he said.",
      "Fostering a broader European defense tech start-up ecosystem is a way \u201cto regain that technological advantage,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense tech startup founders can ride a wave of investment as Europe moves to beef up its military capabilities. Leaders of NATO, which includes 30 European nations, are meeting this week to endorse a goal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense.",
      "The European Union has sought to mobilize 800 billion euros ($927 billion) to boost the 27-nation bloc's defense, with priorities including drones, AI, autonomous systems and quantum computing.",
      "Britain, which left the EU, has meanwhile pledged to spend 10% of its defense budget on new technologies.",
      "Europe still has a long way to go. The continent's defense tech startup ecosystem is young and about five years behind the United States, consulting firm McKinsey said in a recent report. But it's growing rapidly as investors flock there. Venture capital investment in Europe's defense tech sector for 2021-2024 more than quadrupled from the previous three-year period, according to Pitchbook.",
      "At the London hackathon, teams worked into the evening, fueled by chocolate bars, energy drinks, fruit and a late-night pizza delivery. Army cots were available for those who wanted to catch a few hours of sleep.",
      "Soldiers in camouflage and defense company reps hovered on the sidelines to provide advice and answer questions.",
      "Andrii Solonskyi, CEO of Soloma Avionics, which fielded a team, said defense hackathons are \u201ca bit of a novelty.\u201d",
      "The industry has traditionally been more structured and formal, because \u201cit\u2019s a serious business and there\u2019s a lot of things that can go wrong,\u201d he said. But, \"what we definitely feel is that you can be very agile in defense right now.\"",

      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco said in a ruling filed late Monday that the AI system's distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic\u2019s (AI large language models) trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "But while dismissing a key claim made by the group of authors who sued the company for copyright infringement last year, Alsup also said Anthropic must still go to trial in December over its alleged theft of their works.",
      "\u201cAnthropic had no entitlement to use pirated copies for its central library,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "A trio of writers \u2014 Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 alleged in their lawsuit last summer that Anthropic's practices amounted to \u201clarge-scale theft,\" and that the San Francisco-based company \u201cseeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\u201d",
      "Books are known to be important sources of the data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build large language models. In the race to outdo each other in developing the most advanced AI chatbots, a number of tech companies have turned to online repositories of stolen books that they can get for free.",
      "Documents disclosed in San Francisco's federal court showed Anthropic employees' internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. But that didn't undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.",

      "The ruling could set a precedent for similar lawsuits that have piled up against Anthropic competitor OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, as well as against Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Anthropic \u2014 founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021 \u2014 has marketed itself as the more responsible and safety-focused developer of generative AI models that can compose emails, summarize documents and interact with people in a natural way.",
      "But the lawsuit filed last year alleged that Anthropic\u2019s actions \u201chave made a mockery of its lofty goals\u201d by building its AI product on pirated writings.",
      "Anthropic said Tuesday it was pleased that the judge recognized that AI training was transformative and consistent with \u201ccopyright\u2019s purpose in enabling creativity and fostering scientific progress.\u201d Its statement didn't address the piracy claims.",

      "Waymo's robotaxis will begin carrying passengers through parts of Atlanta on Tuesday in an expansion of a partnership with Uber that began earlier this year in Austin.",
      "Waymo's driverless march into Atlanta comes just days after Tesla finally launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, more than five years after CEO Elon Musk brashly promised the electric automaker would quickly overtake Waymo as the leader in autonomous driving technology. Unlike Waymo's robotaxis, Tesla is initially placing a human in the passenger seat of its rival service to take over the vehicle if something goes wrong.",
      "While Tesla is starting with about a dozen supervised robotaxis, Waymo and Uber have dispatched about 100 completely driverless vehicles in Austin less than four months after their partnership began. The expansion into Atlanta keeps the two companies aligned with a road map they laid out last September.",
      "As has been the case in Austin, Waymo's robotaxis in Atlanta will be dispatched through Uber's app. Uber will give customers a choice to request a car operated by a human if they don't want to take a driverless ride. The robotaxis will initially cover a 65-square-mile (168,00-square-kilometers) area within the Atlanta market before expanding to a larger stretch.",
      "Waymo's own ride-hailing app is available in Phoenix, Los Angeles and a steadily expanding swath of the San Francisco Bay Area. Factoring in its partnership with Uber, Waymo is currently providing more than 250,000 paid rides per week \u2014 making it the early frontrunner in the still-nascent robotaxi market.",
      "But competition looms down the road as Musk continues to insist Tesla's robotaxi service will be able to grow quickly and Amazon gears up to bring its Zoox driverless cabs to Las Vegas later this year \u2014 with plans to expand into San Francisco next year. Zoox is also aiming to bring its robotaxi service to Atlanta, although it hasn't set a target date for that yet.",
      "Uber once had ambitions to build robotaxis, but reversed course after a bruising legal battle with Waymo, which alleged the ride-hailing company stole its autonomous technology after poaching one of its engineers. After reaching a $245 million settlement with Waymo, Uber eventually sold its self-driving vehicle division following a 2018 crash that killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona.",
      "Uber then pivoted to robotaxi partnerships to remain competitive as driverless cabs reshape the ride-hailing market. \u201cBy integrating Waymo\u2019s cutting-edge technology into the Uber platform, we\u2019re continuing to make transportation more convenient, sustainable, and reliable,\u201d said Sarfraz Maredia, who oversees Uber's efforts in autonomous driving.",
      "With 18 different robotaxi partnerships in place around the world, Uber says it is on pace to make about 1.5 million annual driverless trips that either transport passengers or deliver food.",

      "A Japanese company says a laser navigating tool doomed its lunar lander, causing it to crash into the moon",
      "A laser navigating tool doomed a Japanese company's lunar lander earlier this month, causing it to crash into the moon.",
      "Officials for ispace announced the news from Tokyo on Tuesday. The crash landing was the second for ispace in two years.",
      "This time, the company\u2019s lander named Resilience was aiming for the moon\u2019s far north in Mare Frigoris, or Sea of Cold. NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter relayed pictures of the crash site last week where Resilience and its mini rover ended up as wreckage.",
      "Company officials blamed the accident on the lander's laser range finder, saying it was slow to kick in and properly measure the spacecraft's distance to the lunar surface. Resilience was descending at a rapid rate of 138 feet (42 meters) per second when contact was lost, and crashed five seconds later, they said.",
      "Bad software caused ispace's first lunar lander to slam into the moon in 2023. Like the latest try, the problem occurred during the final phase of descent.",
      "Of seven moon landing attempts by private outfits in recent years, only one can claim total success: Firefly Aerospace's touchdown of its Blue Ghost lander in March. Blue Ghost launched with Resilience in January, sharing a SpaceX rocket ride from Florida.",
      "Aside from Texas-based Firefly, only five countries have pulled off a successful lunar landing: the Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan. And only the U.S. has put astronauts on the moon, back during NASA's Apollo program more than a half-century ago.",
      "Despite back-to-back losses, ispace is pressing ahead with its third moon landing attempt in 2027, with NASA cooperation, as well as a fourth planned mission. Extra tests and improvements will add as much as 1.5 billion yen (more than $10 million) to the development costs, officials said.",
      "CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada stressed that his company \u201chas not stepped down in the face of setbacks\" and is looking to regain customers' trust. Outside experts will join the accident review, and ispace will collaborate more closely with the Japanese Space Agency on technical matters.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re firmly taking the next step toward our future missions,\u201d he said in Japanese.",

      "The observatory's first look features the vibrant Trifid and Lagoon nebulas located thousands of light-years from Earth. A light-year is nearly 6 trillion miles. A gaggle of galaxies known as the Virgo Cluster were also captured, including two bright blue spirals.",
      "The observatory hopes to image 20 billion galaxies and discover new asteroids and other celestial objects.",

    "story": [
      "Although women face the threat of more injury risks in vehicle crashes, the crash test dummies used in U.S. safety tests are designed almost entirely around the body of a man",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn had one lingering question about the car crash that forced her to have emergency surgery during a vacation in Ireland: Why did she and her mother sustain serious injuries while her father and brother, who sat in the front, emerge unscathed?",
      "\u201cIt was a head-on crash and they were closest to the point of contact,\" said Kuhn, now 25, who missed a semester of college to recover from the 2019 collision that caused her seat belt to slide off her hips and rupture her intestines by pinning them against her spine. \"That was an early clue that something else was going on.\u201d",
      "When Kuhn returned home to Maine, she found an article her grandma had clipped from Consumer Reports and left on her bed. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a frontal crash, she learned, yet the dummy used in vehicle tests  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dates back to the 1970s and is still modeled almost entirely off the body of a man.",
      "Kuhn, who is starting law school at New York University this fall, took action and founded the nonprofit Drive US Forward. Its aim was to raise public awareness and eventually encourage members of Congress to sign onto a bill that would require NHTSA to incorporate a more advanced female dummy into its testing.",
      "The agency has the final word on whether cars get pulled from the market, and the kind of dummy used in its safety tests could impact which ones receive coveted five-star ratings.",
      "\u201cIt seems like we have an easy solution here where we can have crash test dummies that reflect an average woman as well as a man,\u201d Sen. Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican who has introduced the legislation the past two sessions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Senators from both parties have signed onto Fischer's \u201cShe Drives Act,\u201d and the transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for updating the rules.",
      "But for various reasons, the push for new safety requirements has been moving at a sluggish pace. That's particularly true in the U.S., where much of the research is happening and where around 40,000 people are killed each year in car crashes.",
      "The crash test dummy currently used in NHTSA five-star testing is called the Hybrid III, which was developed in 1978 and modeled after a 5-foot-9, 171-pound man (the average size in the 1970s but about 29 pounds lighter than today's average). What's known as the female dummy is essentially a much smaller version of the male model with a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger seat or the back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t do is design a crash test dummy that has all the sensors in the areas where a woman would be injured differently than a man,\u201d said Christopher O'Connor, president and CEO of the Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Humanetics Group, which has spent more than a decade developing and refining one.",
      "A female dummy from Humanetics equipped with all of the available sensors costs around $1 million, about twice the cost of the Hybrid used now.",
      "But, O'Connor says, the more expensive dummy far more accurately reflects the anatomical differences between the sexes \u2014 including in the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs, which one NHTSA study found account for about 80% more injuries by women in a car crash compared to men.",
      "Such physical dummies will always be needed for vehicle safety tests, and to verify the accuracy of virtual tests, O'Connor said.",
      "Europe incorporated the more advanced male dummy developed by Humanetics' engineers, the THOR 50M (based on a 50th percentile man), into its testing procedures soon after Kuhn's 2019 crash in Ireland. Several other countries, including China and Japan, have adopted it as well.",
      "But that model and the female version the company uses for comparison, the THOR 5F (based on a 5th percentile woman), have been met with skepticism from some American automakers who argue the more sophisticated devices may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Bridget Walchesky, 19, had to be flown to a hospital, where she required eight surgeries over a month, after a 2022 crash near her home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, that killed her friend, who was driving. While acknowledging the seat belt likely saved her life, Walchesky said some of the injuries \u2014 including her broken collarbone \u2014 were the result of it pinning her too tightly, which she views as something better safety testing focused on women could improve.",
      "\u201cSeat belts aren\u2019t really built for bodies on females,\u201d Walchesky said. \u201cSome of my injuries, the way the force hit me, they were probably worsened.\u201d",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group, said in a statement to the AP that the better way to ensure safety \u2014 which it called its top priority \u2014 is through upgrades to the existing Hybrid dummy rather than mandating a new one.",
      "\u201cThis can happen on a faster timeline and lead to quicker safety improvements than requiring NHTSA to adopt unproven crash test dummy technology,\u201d the alliance said.",
      "Humanetics' THOR dummies received high marks in the vehicle safety agency's early tests. Using cadavers from actual crashes to compare the results, NHTSA found they outperformed the existing Hybrid in predicting almost all injuries \u2014 including to the head, neck, shoulders, abdomen and legs.",
      "A separate review by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, was far more critical of the dummy's ability to predict chest injuries in a frontal crash. Despite the vast expansion in the number of sensors, the insurance institute's testing found, the male THOR dummy was less accurate than the current Hybrid dummies, which also had limitations.",
      "\u201cMore isn\u2019t necessarily better,\u201d said Jessica Jermakian, senior vice president for vehicle research at IIHS. \u201cYou also have to be confident that the data is telling you the right things about how a real person would fare in that crash.\"",
      "NHTSA\u2019s budget plan commits to developing the female THOR 5F version with the ultimate goal of incorporating it into the testing. But there could be a long wait considering the THOR's male version adopted by other countries is still awaiting final approval in the U.S.",
      "A 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, which conducts research for Congress, cited numerous \u201cmissed milestones\u201d in NHTSA's development of various crash dummy enhancements \u2014 including in the THOR models.",
      "Kuhn acknowledges being frustrated by the slow process of trying to change the regulations. She says she understands why there's reluctance from auto companies if they fear being forced to make widespread design changes with more consideration for women's safety.",
      "\u201cFortunately, they have very skilled engineers and they\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election Tuesday, a system that takes some explaining, even for New Yorkers who have used it before.",
      "Voters' understanding of how ranked choice works could play a role in which candidate comes out on top in a race that features former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, progressive upstart Zohran Mamdani and several other current and former public officials, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested last week at an immigration court.",
      "The system is based on a simple premise: Democracy works better if people aren't forced to make an all-or-nothing choice with their vote.",
      "Rather than pick just one candidate, voters get to rank several in order of preference. Even if a voter's top choice doesn't have enough support to win, their rankings of other candidates still play a role in determining the victor.",
      "The system is more complex than a traditional election, making it tough to forecast a winner. It could also take longer to get results.",
      "In New York City's version, voters get to rank up to five candidates, from first to last, on the ballot.",
      "If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters \u2014 more than 50% \u2014 that person wins the race outright, just like in a traditional election.",
      "If nobody hits that threshold, ranked choice analysis kicks in.",
      "Vote tabulation is done by computer in rounds. After the first round, the candidate in last place \u2014 the candidate ranked No. 1 by the fewest amount of people \u2014 is eliminated. The computer then looks at the ballots cast by people who ranked that candidate first, to see who they ranked second. Those people's votes are then redistributed to their second choices.",
      "That process then repeats. As more candidates are eliminated, voters' third, fourth and even fifth choices could potentially come into play. Rounds continue until there are only two candidates left. The one with the most votes wins.",
      "Eleven candidates are on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams isn't one of them. He's a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.",
      "The computerized process of tabulating votes takes little time, but it doesn't start right away.",
      "Polls close at 9 p.m. Tuesday. Within a few hours, preliminary results should give a picture of how the candidates are doing based on voters' first choices.",
      "The ranked choice tabulations, however, won't start until July 1 because the city needs to wait for the arrival of mail-in ballots.",
      "The July 1 tabulation could potentially give a clear picture of who won, but the result won't be official. Further rounds of ranked choice analysis will be done as additional absentee ballots come in until the board certifies the election July 15.",
      "This will be the second time New York City has used ranked choice in a mayoral primary. The first time, in 2021, things went haywire when elections officials neglected to clear test data from the tabulation program. That led to an inaccurate vote tally being reported until officials realized the error.",
      "Officials are hoping things go smoother this time.",
      "One benefit is that nobody \u201cwastes\u201d their vote by picking an unpopular candidate as their first choice.",
      "Voters can rank someone they like No. 1, even if they suspect the candidate doesn't stand a chance. If that person is eliminated, voters still get a say in who wins based on their other rankings.",
      "Another benefit is that it's tough for someone to get elected without broad support. In a traditional election, it's possible for someone with fringe political views to win in a crowded field of candidates, even if they are deeply disliked by a majority of voters.",
      "That's theoretically less likely in a ranked choice system. A candidate could get the largest share of first-choice votes but still lose to someone who is the second or third choice of a large number of people.",
      "The system is tough to grasp. It requires voters to do more research. It also makes races less predictable.",
      "Transparency and trust are also potential problems. Ordinarily, candidates, the public and news organizations can see votes coming in, precinct by precinct, and know exactly who is leading and where their support comes from.",
      "Under the ranked choice system, the process of redistributing votes is done by computer. Outside groups will have a harder time evaluating whether the software sorted the ranked votes accurately.",
      "That\u2019s a challenge for news organizations, like The Associated Press, that analyze vote tallies and attempt to report a winner before the count is complete.",
      "There may be instances when candidates who seem to have a comfortable lead in first-place votes on election night lose because relatively few voters rank them as their second or third choice. That could lead to people questioning the results.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk has long promised to put a fleet of driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\" on the roads, but fans and shareholders have been kept waiting",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk promised in 2019 that driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\u201d would be on the road \u201cnext year,\u201d but it didn\u2019t happen. A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn\u2019t happen either.",
      "Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, \u201cNext year for sure, we\u2019ll have over a million robotaxis.\u201d",
      "Would you settle for 10 or 12?",
      "Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, starting Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.",
      "The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.",
      "While Musk was making those \u201cnext year\u201d promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.",
      "Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout  when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.",
      "Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he\u2019s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company \u2014 self-driving car promises aside \u2014 and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.",
      "Musk says the Austin test will begin modestly enough, with just 10 or 12 vehicles picking up passengers in a limited area. But then it will quickly ramp up and spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.",
      "Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.",
      "\u201cHow quickly can he expand the fleet?\u201d asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. \u201cWe're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.\"",
      "Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,\" he says. \u201cTesting is going to take a while.\u201d",
      "Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.",
      "In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.",
      "More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.",
      "Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.",
      "Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk \u201cknowingly\u201d made false statements.",
      "Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.",
      "He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.",
      "\u201cInstead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,\u201d Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. \u201cYou will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.\u201d",
      "Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.",
      "\u201cTesla will have, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Musk mused in an conference call with investors, \u201d99% market share or something ridiculous.\u201d Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.",
      "But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.",
      "He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.",
      "\u201cMaybe his timelines aren\u2019t realistic,\" Goldstein says, \u201cbut he can develop futuristic technology products.\u201d",

      "A Connecticut man whose parents were kidnapped after he took part in a $245 million Bitcoin theft has pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges and has agreed to testify against his co-defendants, according to court documents that were unsealed this week.",
      "Veer Chetal, 19, from Danbury, Connecticut, was one of three men charged with stealing 4,100 Bitcoins from a victim in Washington, D.C., in an elaborate online scam last August. The trio lived large after the heist, spending millions of dollars on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties, prosecutors say.",
      "A week after the theft, Chetal's parents were assaulted and kidnapped briefly in Danbury in a failed ransom plot aimed at Chetal, who the attackers believed had a large amount of cryptocurrency, authorities said.",
      "Chetal's criminal case was unsealed on Monday in federal court in Washington, revealing his guilty pleas in November and his agreement to cooperate with federal authorities investigating the Bitcoin theft. It also revealed new allegations that he was involved in about 50 similar thefts that raked in another $3 million between November 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Another man charged in the Bitcoin theft, Malone Lam, was also among 13 people indicted by a federal grand jury in May in an alleged online racketeering conspiracy involving cryptocurrency thefts across the U.S. and overseas that netted more than $260 million, including the $245 million Bitcoin theft.",
      "Chetal is facing 19 to 24 years in prison, a fine between $50,000 and $500,000 and restitution to the victim that has yet to be determined, according federal sentencing guidelines and his plea agreement.",
      "His lawyer, David Weinstein, declined to comment, saying Chetal's case is still pending.",
      "In September, federal agents with a search warrant raided Chetal's apartment in Brunswick, New Jersey, and his parents' home in Danbury in connection with the $245 million Bitcoin heist. Authorities said they found more than $500,000 in cash, expensive jewelry and watches and high-end clothing. Federal agents also said Chetal had $39 million worth of cryptocurrency that he turned over to investigators.",
      "Authorities alleged Chetal, Lam and Jeandiel Serrano were involved in online \u201csocial engineering\u201d attacks against cryptocurrency holders. Lam would send victims alerts about unauthorized attempts to access their crypto accounts, while the others would call the victims posing as representatives from well-known companies like Google and Yahoo and gain access to their accounts, authorities said.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with lawyers for Lam and Serrano on Friday.",
      "A week after the theft, six Florida men were accused of kidnapping Chetal's parents in broad daylight in Danbury. One of them crashed a car into the parents' Lamborghini, while others pulled up in a van, police said. The attackers forced the couple out of their vehicle, beat them, put them in the van and tied them up, police said.",
      "The plot was foiled, and the attackers were arrested quickly because there were eyewitnesses who immediately called police, and an off-duty FBI agent happened to be driving by at the time of the kidnapping, authorities said. Federal agents said a seventh man who was later arrested in connection with the kidnapping had previously gotten into a dispute with Chetal that turned physical at a Miami nightclub.",
      "The attack on the couple is part of an increasing trend worldwide in robbers using violence to steal cryptocurrency.",
      "Chetal, who was attending Rutgers University in New Jersey at the time of the $245 million theft and later withdrew, was born in India and came to the U.S. with his family when he was 4 years old in 2010, according to court documents. His father was granted a foreign worker's visa, and his wife and children obtained related dependent visas.",
      "Federal authorities said Chetal could face deportation as a result of the criminal case.",
      "Authorities say Chetal's father lost his job at Morgan Stanley because of the kidnapping and his son's connection to it.",
      "Chetal was initially released from federal custody on his own recognizance. But a judge ordered him detained until trial earlier this year after federal prosecutors said they discovered Chetal was involved in another crypto theft worth $2 million in October that he didn't tell them about, after he had begun cooperating with federal authorities.",

      "Researchers at cybersecurity outlet Cybernews say that billions of login credentials have been leaked and compiled into datasets online, giving cybercriminals \u201cunprecedented access\u201d to accounts consumers use each day",
      "NEW YORK -- Researchers at cybersecurity outlet Cybernews say that billions of login credentials have been leaked and compiled into datasets online, giving criminals \u201cunprecedented access\u201d to accounts consumers use each day.",
      "According to a report published this week, Cybernews researchers have recently discovered 30 exposed datasets that each contain a vast amount of login information \u2014 amounting to a total of 16 billion compromised credentials. That includes user passwords for a range of popular platforms including Google, Facebook and Apple.",
      "Sixteen billion is roughly double the amount of people on Earth today, signaling that impacted consumers may have had credentials for more than one account leaked. Cybernews notes that there are most certainly duplicates in the data and so \u201cit's impossible to tell how many people or accounts were actually exposed.\u201d",
      "It's also important to note that the leaked login information doesn't span from a single source, such as one breach targeting a company. Instead, it appears that the data was stolen through multiple events over time, and then compiled and briefly exposed publicly, which is when Cybernews reports that its researchers discovered it.",
      "Various infostealers are most likely the culprit, Cybernews noted. Infostealers are a form of malicious software that breaches a victim's device or systems to take sensitive information.",
      "Many questions remain about these leaked credentials, including whose hands the login credentials are in now. But, as data breaches become more and more common in today's world, experts continue to stress the importance of maintaining key \u201ccyber hygiene.\u201d",
      "If you're worried about your account data potentially being exposed in a recent breach, the first thing you can do is change your password \u2014 and avoid using the same or similar login credentials on multiple sites. If you find it too hard to memorize all your different passwords, consider a password manager or passkey. And also add multifactor authentication, which can serve as a second layer of verification through your phone, email or USB authenticator key.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- As the war between Israel and Iran hits the one-week mark, Iranians have spent nearly half of the conflict in a near-communication blackout, unable to connect not only with the outside world but also with their neighbors and loved ones across the country.",
      "Civilians are left unaware of when and where Israel will strike next, despite Israeli forces issuing warnings through their Persian-language online channels. When the missiles land, disconnected phone and web services mean not knowing for hours or days if their family or friends are among the victims. That\u2019s left many scrambling on various social media apps to see what\u2019s happening \u2014 again, only a glimpse of life able to reach the internet in a nation of over 80 million people.",
      "Activists see it as a form of psychological warfare for a nation all-too familiar with state information controls and targeted internet shutdowns during protests and unrest.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian regime controls the information sphere really, really tightly,\u201d Marwa Fatafta, the Berlin-based policy and advocacy director for digital rights group Access Now, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe know why the Iranian regime shuts down. It wants to control information. So their goal is quite clear.\u201d",
      "But this time, it\u2019s happening during a deadly conflict that erupted on June 13 with Israeli airstrikes targeting nuclear and military sites, top generals and nuclear scientists. At least 657 people, including 263 civilians, have been killed in Iran and more than 2,000 wounded, according to a Washington-based group called Human Rights Activists.",
      "Iran has retaliated by firing 450 missiles and 1,000 drones at Israel, according to Israeli military estimates. Most have been shot down by Israel\u2019s multitiered air defenses, but at least 24 people in Israel have been killed and hundreds others wounded. Guidance from Israeli authorities, as well as round-the-clock news broadcasts, flows freely and consistently to Israeli citizens, creating in the last seven days an uneven picture of the death and destruction brought by the war.",
      "The Iranian government contended Friday that it was Israel who was \u201cwaging a war on truth and human conscience.\" In a post on X, a social media platform blocked for many of its citizens, Iran's Foreign Ministry asserted Israel banned foreign media from covering missile strikes.",
      "The statement added that Iran would organize \u201cglobal press tours to expose Israel's war crimes\u201d in the country. Iran is one of the world\u2019s top jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and in the best of times, reporters face strict restrictions.",
      "Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org reported on Friday that Iran had been disconnected from the global internet for 36 hours, with its live metrics showing that national connectivity remained at only a few percentage points of normal levels. The group said a handful of users have been able to maintain connectivity through virtual private networks.",
      "Those lucky few have become lifelines for Iranians left in the dark. In recent days, those who have gained access to mobile internet for a limited time describe using that fleeting opportunity to make calls on behalf of others, checking in on elderly parents and grandparents, and locating those who have fled Tehran.",
      "The only access to information Iranians do have is limited to websites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s state-run television and radio stations offer irregular updates on what\u2019s happening inside the country, instead focusing their time on the damage wrought by their strikes on Israel.",
      "The lack of information going in or out of Iran is stunning, considering that the advancement of technology in recent decades has only brought far-flung conflicts in Ukraine, the Gaza Strip and elsewhere directly to a person's phone anywhere in the world.",
      "That direct line has been seen by experts as a powerful tool to shift public opinion about any ongoing conflict and potentially force the international community to take a side. It has also turned into real action from world leaders under public and online pressure to act or use their power to bring an end to the fighting.",
      "But Mehdi Yahyanejad, a key figure in promoting internet freedom in Iran, said that the Islamic Republic is seeking to \u201cpurport an image\u201d of strength, one that depicts only the narrative that Israel is being destroyed by sophisticated Iranian weapons that include ballistic missiles with multiple warheads.",
      "\u201cI think most likely they\u2019re just afraid of the internet getting used to cause mass unrest in the next phase of whatever is happening,\u201d Yahayanejad said. \u201cI mean, some of it could be, of course, planned by the Israelis through their agents on the ground, and some of this could be just a spontaneous unrest by the population once they figure out that the Iranian government is badly weakened.",

      "U.K. lawmakers have backed a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law",
      "LONDON -- U.K. lawmakers on Friday approved a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law.",
      "Members of Parliament voted 314-291 to back the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill following an impassioned and respectful debate. The majority of 23 was less than the 55 when they last voted on the issue in November, meaning that some lawmakers changed their minds in the intervening months.",
      "Since November, the bill has been scrutinized, leading to some changes in the proposed legislation, which has been shepherded through Parliament by Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater rather than the government.",
      "\u201cI appreciate it's a huge moment for the country.\u201d she told Sky News after the vote. \u201cIt was a huge sense of relief because this is the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "It's not quite law yet as the bill now goes to the unelected House of Lords, which can amend or delay policy, though it can\u2019t overrule the lower chamber.",
      "The vote is potentially the biggest change to social policy since abortion was partially legalized in 1967.",
      "The bill would allow terminally ill adults over age 18 in England and Wales, who are deemed to have less than six months to live, to apply for an assisted death. This particular bill doesn\u2019t apply to Northern Ireland and Scotland, the latter of which is holding its own vote on the issue.",
      "Perhaps the most important change to the bill from last November was the dropping of the requirement that a judge sign off on any decision. Many in the legal profession had objected.",
      "Now any request would be subject to approval by two doctors and a panel featuring a social worker, senior legal figure and psychiatrist.",
      "Changes were also made to ensure the establishment of independent advocates to support people with learning disabilities, autism or mental health conditions and the creation of a disability advisory board.",
      "Having received the go-ahead from doctors and the panel, the terminally ill person would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves.",
      "Another big change made was that \u201cno person,\u201d including doctors, social care workers and pharmacists, will be obliged to take part.",
      "For months, the bill has divided lawmakers, political parties, as well as the country.",
      "Proponents of the bill argued that those with a terminal diagnosis must be given a choice at the end of their lives to relieve their suffering. They also said that the current situation discriminates against the poor as wealthy individuals can already travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones die.",
      "However, opponents warned that the most vulnerable people in society, such as the disabled and older people, could be at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, into ending their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members.",
      "Supporters of both sides all agreed of the need to make improvements in palliative care and greater investments in hospices to ease suffering.",
      "Passions were running high outside of Parliament where hundreds of people gathered to make their voices heard.",
      "Supporters were dressed in clothing emblazoned with the phrase \u201cCampaign for Dignity in Dying,\u201d while opponents held up banners urging lawmakers not to make the state-run National Health Service the \u201cNational Suicide Service.\u201d",
      "The legislation now goes to the unelected House of Lords, Any amendments would then go back to the House of Commons.",
      "Backers of the bill say implementation will take four years, rather than the initially suggested two. That means it could become law in 2029, around the time that the next general election must be held.",
      "There is clearly no consensus in the Cabinet about the measure.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer backed the bill on Friday, while his health secretary, Wes Streeting, voted against.",
      "The government has said it will respect the outcome.",
      "However, it's not clear what the cost implications are, or how it would impact the NHS, hospice care and the legal system.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves health care practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances.",

      "Summer gets its official start in the Northern Hemisphere with the arrival of the summer solstice",
      "Peak sunshine has arrived in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 the summer solstice.",
      "Friday is the longest day of the year north of the equator, where the solstice marks the start of astronomical summer. It's the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is the shortest day of the year and winter will start.",
      "The word \u201csolstice\u201d comes from the Latin words \u201csol\u201d for sun and \u201cstitium\u201d which can mean \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cstop.\u201d The solstice is the end of the sun's annual march higher in the sky, when it makes its longest, highest arc. The bad news for sun lovers: It then starts retreating and days will get a little shorter every day until late December.",
      "People have marked solstices for eons with celebrations and monuments, including Stonehenge, which was designed to align with the sun's paths at the solstices. But what is happening in the heavens? Here\u2019s what to know about the Earth\u2019s orbit.",
      "As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle relative to the sun. For most of the year, the Earth\u2019s axis is tilted either toward or away from the sun. That means the sun\u2019s warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet.",
      "The solstices mark the times during the year when this tilt is at its most extreme, and days and nights are at their most unequal.",
      "During the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer solstice, the upper half of the earth is tilted toward the sun, creating the longest day and shortest night of the year. This solstice falls between June 20 and 22.",
      "Meanwhile, at the winter solstice, the Northern Hemisphere is leaning away from the sun \u2014 leading to the shortest day and longest night of the year. The winter solstice falls between December 20 and 23.",
      "During the equinox, the Earth\u2019s axis and its orbit line up so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.",
      "The word equinox comes from two Latin words meaning equal and night. That\u2019s because on the equinox, day and night last almost the same amount of time \u2014 though one may get a few extra minutes, depending on where you are on the planet.",
      "The Northern Hemisphere\u2019s spring \u2014 or vernal \u2014 equinox can land between March 19 and 21, depending on the year. Its fall \u2013 or autumnal \u2014 equinox can land between Sept. 21 and 24.",
      "On the equator, the sun will be directly overhead at noon. Equinoxes are the only time when both the north and south poles are lit by sunshine at the same time.",
      "These are just two different ways to carve up the year.",
      "While astronomical seasons depend on how the Earth moves around the sun, meteorological seasons are defined by the weather. They break down the year into three-month seasons based on annual temperature cycles. By that calendar, spring starts on March 1, summer on June 1, fall on Sept. 1 and winter on Dec. 1.",

      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don\u2019t return as expected",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cHave you seen the cats?\u201d",
      "That's a common refrain in my household because our two felines, Maple and Juniper, can venture outside through a flap in the backdoor. Like many other London house cats, they're free to come and go, roaming the surrounding backyards and beyond, equipped with microchips to identify them if they get lost.",
      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don't return as expected.",
      "If you're worried about your furry friend's whereabouts, technology can help you keep tabs on them.",
      "Dedicated pet trackers are collar-worn devices that typically use GPS signals to pinpoint the location of the animal wearing them. They use a 4G cellphone signal or your home Wi-Fi connection to relay the position to a smartphone app.",
      "There are many products on the market. Tractive, Jiobit and Pawfit are among brands that offer trackers for both dogs and cats. Devices for the latter are generally smaller and lighter.",
      "Dog trackers with integrated collars are available from Fi and Whistle. PetTracer is a cat collar that uses both GPS and radio signals from a home base station. FitBark, also for dogs, has an Apple Watch app to monitor location and other activity.",
      "Garmin has a range of GPS dog collars that work with handheld devices resembling walkie-talkies, but they're pricey and aimed at outdoors enthusiasts like hunters.",
      "Most trackers let you designate a safe zone on a map, usually your house and surrounding area, and alert you if your pet has left it.",
      "They usually operate on the 4G LTE spectrum commonly used by wireless carriers. It typically has the longest range of any cellular signal, said Andrew Bleiman, Tractive's executive vice president for North America.",
      "That means strong connectivity in most of Europe and North America \u201cunless you\u2019re in a really far flung place like the middle of a national park,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "Exact price depends on brand and model. Most devices sell for less than $100. However, keep in mind you'll also have to pay a subscription fee for the cell service to function.",
      "While that could cost $100 or more a year, for some pet owners it's worth the \u201cpeace of mind,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "The collars usually have a built-in rechargeable battery but battery life varies. Most will be last at least two to three days before they need charging, and a lot longer in ideal conditions.",
      "One big factor is signal strength. The battery will drain faster if the device has to work harder to pick up the GPS or connect to Wi-Fi. Some save power by not sending coordinates in the safe zone.",
      "Like fitness watches for humans, pet tracking apps offer health and activity monitoring features. You can see how long your cat or dog has spent resting or exercising on a daily or hourly basis.",
      "But be aware, a tracker is \u201cnot going to keep your pet in the backyard,\" Bleiman said. It will only \"alert you when they leave the virtual fence area that you set up.\u201d",
      "This One TechTip was inspired by Maple, who once went AWOL for days. It turned out he was hanging out in a backyard 10 doors down the street. We only found out after the residents got hold of a pet microchip scanner to look up our contact details to let us know so we could retrieve him.",
      "Tractive provided a loaner device to try. Using the included breakaway collar, we put it on Maple, who clearly didn\u2019t like it at first. He dashed out the back door and jumped through a hole in the fence.",
      "Over the next day, I used the Tractive app to monitor his movements. It showed his travels back and forth onto various neighboring properties. He came back to rest for a few hours around midnight, went out to prowl again around 3 a.m, then came back after an hour to nap some more.",
      "It was fascinating to see where he was spending his time. According to the app's \u201cheatmap,\" one of Maple's favorite spots was the same backyard where we had to retrieve him previously.",
      "About 24 hours after I attached the Tractive collar on Maple, I noticed he was no longer wearing it. It had somehow come off.",
      "If you can't find your pet's exact location, or the device gets lost, Tractive has a \u201cradar\u201d feature to pinpoint it with your phone's Bluetooth. Other brands have similar features.",
      "On the app's map, I could see it was in a nearby backyard and that I was getting closer because the circle was getting bigger. But I couldn\u2019t figure out where it was and, not wanting to disturb the neighbors, I gave up.",
      "Bleiman recommends using a harness for cats that don't like collars, but I'm not convinced.",
      "It's common for cats and dogs to be implanted with microchips, with the details added to a database. That makes it much easier to reunite owners with lost dogs and cats, even if they've strayed hundreds of miles away or gone missing for years.",
      "Pet microchips, about the size of a grain of rice implanted just below the skin, are legally required in some European countries. There's no federal law in the U.S., though some places like Hawaii now require them, so check with state or local authorities.",
      "But there's some confusion about what microchips can do. Because they don't have a power supply, they can't be tracked in real time. Whoever finds your pet would need to take it to a vet or a shelter to can scan the device for contact details.",
      "Many pet owners use Bluetooth trackers like Apple's Air Tags, Samsung's SmartTags or similar devices from Tile, Cube and Chipolo, which rely on low-power signals relayed by passing smartphones.",
      "Bluetooth trackers have a range of 100 to 500 feet (30 to 150 meters), depending on the model. The batteries last for months if not longer, and there's no need to pay for a subscription.",
      "However, they're not specifically marketed for pets. That hasn't stopped pet owners, judging from many recommendations they've posted in online forums.",
      "Chipolo advises that its round plastic trackers are only for \u201cin-house pets like house-trained cats and smaller dogs\u201d and warns against using them on \"larger dog breeds and outdoor cats.\"",
      "Still, they can be a solution for some pet owners.",
      "\u201cBluetooth is a totally reasonable solution if you\u2019re in a downtown urban core,\u201d Bleiman said. \u201cBut pets move fast. And if you\u2019re in a wooded park, or you\u2019re in a suburban area \u2014 let alone a more rural or wilderness area \u2014 it\u2019s pretty unlikely your pet is going to be close to a Bluetooth device.\"",

      "For European drone manufacturers, being able to say that their equipment has been tried in war by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch",
      "LE BOURGET, France -- About once a month, French drone manufacturer Henri Seydoux makes what has become a necessary pilgrimage for many in his business \u2014 he goes to Ukraine.",
      "Because for drone technology, there is no harder place to survive than the frontlines of the war against Russia\u2019s invasion, where both sides are using unmanned aerial machines of all shapes and sizes to kill and to observe, reshaping modern warfare.",
      "And because the battlefields also bristle with electronic countermeasures and weapons to confuse, jam and shoot down drones, Ukraine has also become an extreme real-life proving ground for advances in drone technology, some of which has started to spill over into non-military sectors.",
      "For manufacturers, being able to say that their drones and related equipment have been battle-tried and tested by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch as they market their wares not just to national defense departments, but also to police forces, border authorities, rescue services and civilian users.",
      "\u201cWhen we say, \u2018This is a good machine, it works,\u2019 people can believe us or not. But when it\u2019s guys in Ukraine and others saying they\u2019re happy, it has greater value,\" says Bastien Mancini, president and co-founder of French drone manufacturer Delair, which has teamed up with European defense contractor KNDS to supply Ukrainian forces with 100 exploding drones. KNDS' sales literature notes that they are \u201ccombat-proven.\"",
      "Mancini says civilian users of Delair's other non-military drones \u201csee things that work in Ukraine and say to themselves, \u2018It resists jamming, it resists the loss of a radio connection and whatnot and so it\u2019s going to be fine for civilian use, like inspecting electric cables or whatever.\"",
      "\u201cIt really has helped us win markets. It gives people confidence,\" he told The Associated Press at the Paris Air Show, a major shop-window for the aviation and defense industries.",
      "Henri Seydoux, the founder and head of French drone maker Parrot, says Ukraine is \u201cfascinating\u201d from a drone-technology perspective because \u201cit changes so quickly, there are new ideas non-stop.\u201d He's been making regular trips since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 to meet Ukrainian drone manufacturers, drone software developers and the military authorities.",
      "\u201cEvery quarter, the situation changes completely,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cEvery company, let\u2019s say, that makes military equipment or every army is very interested by drones. But the ones that really use them and understand how to use them is the Ukrainians.\"",
      "For Ukraine, trying to defend against swarms of Russian drones that target cities and waves of drone-supported Russian troops is a matter of survival. So, too, is finding workarounds to counter electronic warfare systems that Russia deploys to jam and disable Ukrainian drones, igniting what has become a drone-technology arms race between the two sides and for manufacturers outside of Ukraine, too.",
      "Small drones that drop bombs and explode against targets \u2014 mass-produced at a fraction of the cost of other more complex weapons systems that its allies have supplied \u2014 have become increasingly vital for Ukraine's resistance. Its Defense Ministry has said that it plans to buy 4.5 million drones this year, all Ukrainian-made, that allow their operators to see what the machines see, so they can guide the flights in real time \u2014 exploding in a Russian trench, for example, or even against a single enemy soldier. That's three times more drones than the ministry bought last year, it says.",
      "\u201cDrones saved Ukraine,\u201d said Alex Vorobei, the Ukrainian sales representative for Ailand Systems, a Ukrainian start-up developing a drone that detects land mines.",
      "Vorobei and others in the drone business say that manufacturers not involved in Ukraine risk being left behind.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in the defense field and still not in Ukraine, it means you are nowhere,\" Vorobei said at the Paris show.",
      "A micro surveillance drone unveiled by Parrot at the Paris show has a nod to Ukraine in its name \u2014 the Anafi UKR \u2014 and also has been field-tested in what Seydoux describes as the \u201cvery harsh environment\u201d on the frontline. It\u2019s equipped with artificial intelligence technology to enable it to find its way when radio and navigational signals are jammed.",
      "Parrot says the drone\u2019s ready-for-war resilience and features also make it a good fit for law enforcement operations, such as monitoring crowds, tracking suspects or keeping watch over borders, and for rescue services in remote areas or during fires and accidents when navigational signals might go down.",
      "Ukraine has been \u201ca real laboratory or test for us, to see if our products worked,\u201d said Delair's Mancini. Its Oskar exploding drone, which has polystyrene wings, carries a half-kilogram (one pound) warhead to detonate against troops and lightly armored vehicles.",
      "Delair developed it in under a year, repurposing one of its civilian drones that was already used in France for mapping and inspecting power cables, and hardening it for Ukraine with technology to resist Russian jamming.",
      "\"Five or 10 years ago, lots of people were asking themselves, \u2019Are drones really useful for something?' No one is asking that question today,\" he said.",

      "Trump earlier Wednesday insisted Iran's nuclear program had been set back \"basically decades,\" adding, \"It's gone for years.\"",
      "\"I believe they didn't have a chance to get anything out, because we acted fast,\" Trump said. \"If it would have taken two weeks, maybe.

      "Asked if they could rebuild and whether the U.S. would strike again, Trump said that would be someone else's problem.",

      "Asked if he trusted U.S. intelligence, the president said the initial report was \"very inconclusive. The intelligence says we don't know, it could have been very severe, that's what the intelligence says. So I guess that's correct, but I think we can take the 'we don't know.' It was very severe.

      "The defense secretary also rejected the early Pentagon analysis of the damage done by the military operation.",
      "\"Given the 30,000 pounds of explosives and capability of those munitions, it was devastation underneath Fordo,\" Hegseth said.",
      "\"Any assessment that tells you it was something otherwise is speculating with other motives,\" Hegseth continued. \"And we know that because when you actually look at the report, by the way, it was a top secret report, it was preliminary, it was low confidence.\"",
      "Hegseth suggested the leak of the report had \"a political motive,\" adding, \"We're doing a leak investigation with the FBI right now because this information is for internal purposes.\"",
      "Rubio also claimed that the leak of the preliminary report was politically motivated, saying that the attacks led to \"complete and total obliteration.\"",
      "\"But all this leaker stuff, these leakers are professional stabbers,\" he said. \"They go out and they read this stuff, and then they tell you what it says against the law, but they characterize it for you in a way that's absolutely false.\"",
      "The report prompted further consternation among Trump's opponents in Washington. Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Chris Coons told ABC News at the NATO summit it is too soon to determine the success of U.S. strikes, adding that the recent round of fighting could have been avoided if Trump had not withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal in his first term.",
      "\"The American public needs answers for what what's really going on,\" Shaheen, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said. \"If what we see is Iran's nuclear program has not been obliterated, then we need to try and get Iran back to the negotiating table,\" she added.",
      "Shaheen said further nuclear tensions are also possible, as Tehran may \"be convinced their race to get a nuclear weapon is even more important -- given North Korea's example -- and they will do everything possible to get there as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Trump said the ceasefire is \"going very well\" despite Tuesday's continued exchanges, which prompted him to lambast both Israel and Iran and to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to warn him off further attacks.",
      "\"Israel came back yesterday,\" he said. \"I was so proud of them, because they came back, you know, they went out because they felt it was a violation. And technically they were right, but it just wouldn't have worked out very well. And they brought the planes back.\"",
      "\"They're not going to be fighting each other,\" he added of Israel and Iran. \"They've had it. They've had a big fight, like two kids in a schoolyard. You know, they fight like hell. You can't stop them. Let them fight for about two, three minutes. Then it's easier to stop them.\"",
      "Trump said the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities on Saturday proved decisive. \"That hit ended the war,\" he said, likening the U.S. atomic bomb attacks on Japan at the end of World War II.",
      "\"I don't want to use an example of Hiroshima, I don't want to use an example of Nagasaki, but that was essentially the same thing that ended that war,\" Trump said. \"If we didn't take that out, they would have been, they'd be fighting right now,\" he continued.",
      "The president expressed optimism about the future of U.S. and Iranian relations.",
      "\"I think we'll end up having somewhat of a relationship with Iran,\" he said. \"I've had a relationship over the last four days. They agreed to the ceasefire, and it was a very equal agreement. They both said, that's enough. They both said it.\"",

      "\"But I've got a lot of questions for the administration,\" Warner said. \"I can tell you there was plenty of debate in the open domain about whether bunker-buster bombs alone could take out Iran's facilities. We also have got questions about where all of Iran's enriched uranium is located at this point and if it's not taken out, what next? Are troops still in harm's way?\"",
      "Warner was asked if he believed the briefing might have been postponed due to the preliminary assessment, but he said he did not know.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, a frustrated Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the Trump administration's postponement of Tuesday's scheduled classified briefing on the Iran-Israel conflict \"outrageous,\" \"evasive\" and \"derelict\" -- and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the postponement of the House's briefing \"a slap in the face to the Congress of the United States.\"",
      "\"There is a legal obligation for the administration to inform Congress of what is happening. What are they afraid of? Why won't they engage Congress in the critical details, the result of the recent strike, the scope and trajectory of the conflict, the administration's long-term strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, the potential risks facing American citizens and our service members who we all have an obligation to protect?\" Schumer said while addressing reporters Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Schumer said senators deserve transparency.",
      "\"This last-minute postponement of our briefing is outrageous, it's evasive, it's derelict. They are bobbing and weaving and ducking. Senators deserve full transparency,\" he said.",
      "The Senate's classified briefing, which was set to include briefers from the Department of State as well as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dan Caine, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, had been postponed to later in the week to allow for other briefers to join.",
      "Schumer suggested, and a GOP leadership aide confirmed, that those other briefers who are expected to join the rescheduled meeting on Thursday are Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who are currently at the NATO conference. It's unclear whether the original slate of briefers will still attend Thursday's briefing.",
      "\"I was given no explanation for this delay,\" Schumer told reporters. \"They said 'well Hegseth and Rubio will be here Thursday.' We are happy to hear them on Thursday in addition to this briefing, which we think will be far more valuable than hearing from Hegseth and Rubio, who are secretaries and top people and are very good at political talking points. We need facts; we need real information.\"",
      "Schumer said if Rubio and Hegseth wish to address members he's happy to hear from them. But he also wants to hear from the original slate of briefers.",
      "\"If they want to come up on Thursday in addition -- not in replacement of this hearing -- that is OK,\" Schumer said. \"But the obstruction of this administration on a crucial issue like this where American lives and particularly the lives of American service members are at stake, is their obligation and it undermines the very principles of accountability and oversight that safeguard our democracy.\"",
      "The delay came as an early intelligence assessment showed the attack did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program and likely set it back only by months, according to two people familiar with the assessment.",
      "While the White House is disputing the assessment, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said that it\u2019s further justification for a congressional briefing.",
      "\u201cIt's one of the reasons why we need both a Gang of Eight briefing immediately and a classified briefing for all members of the House of Representatives,\u201d Jeffries said.",
      "Asked on CNN if he believed the briefing might have been postponed because of the preliminary assessment, Warner said he did not know.",
      "Schumer said he has still not received a more formal briefing from the administration since he received a brief call informing him of Saturday night's strike just before it occurred. That call, he said, lacked any specific details.",
      "'Slap in the face'",
      "The House's classified briefing set for Tuesday afternoon was postponed as well, which prompted a legislative tantrum on the floor Tuesday afternoon, with lawmakers demanding an explanation.",
      "Democratic Rep. Yvette Clarke, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, attempted four times to seek an explanation from the chair as part of a \"parliamentary inquiry.\"",
      "Clarke's inquisition was dismissed repeatedly by the presiding chair, Republican Rep. Scott DesJarlais, who informed Clarke that she had not properly stated a parliamentary inquiry.",
      "After some back and forth, Clarke then informed DesJarlais that without an explanation for the postponed briefing, she'd offer a motion to adjourn. That forced the lawmakers to return to the chamber for an unexpected vote to defeat the Democratic motion.",
      "Pelosi criticized the postponement of the briefing.",
      "\"We must all exercise our best judgement in how we prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon and honor our relationship with Israel in the interest of our national security. But the unjustified cancellation of this briefing by the Trump administration is an intolerable insult to their co-equal branch of government and the constitutional requirement that the president comes to Congress before going to war,\" the California Democrat said. \"The president owes the American people an explanation on why his administration is keeping them and their representatives in the dark.\"",
      "It's not yet clear when the House's briefing will be rescheduled.",
      "Massie considers pulling War Powers Resolution",
      "When the meetings occur, it's expected that lawmakers, especially Democrats, will be looking for answers and evidence at the briefings from the administration -- specifically why Trump said there was an imminent threat and carried out U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites over the weekend.",
      "Their meetings come after several lawmakers on Capitol Hill argued the military action was unconstitutional. There are several bipartisan resolutions that could receive a vote in coming days that may put some lawmakers in uncomfortable positions as they consider whether Trump ignored the role of Congress in striking Tehran.",
      "Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna introduced a War Powers Resolution last week to rebuke the president's decision to launch strikes. As Massie continued to rail against Trump and his role in the conflict, the president lashed out at the Kentucky Republican, saying he was \"not MAGA\" and threatened to campaign for Massie's Republican primary opponent in the next election.",
      "Massie has now softened his approach, telling reporters at the Capitol on Monday that he's now considering pulling the bipartisan War Powers Resolution.",
      "\"If the ceasefire holds, and we're not engaged in hostilities, then it's a moot point. I wouldn't need to bring it to the floor,\" Massie said.",
      "Massie also added that he is open to patching things up with the president: \"I'd like a ceasefire between me and President Trump. If I can get the same deal, after his bunker busters he dropped on me.\"",
      "Trump on Monday announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, after more than a week of fighting following Israel's strikes -- and subsequent U.S. attacks -- on Iran's nuclear program. Hours after the ceasefire took effect, Israel said Iran violated it -- which Iran denies.",
      "Trump expressed anger at both Israel and Iran, accusing both of violating the ceasefire agreement shortly after it began.",
      "\"I'm not happy with Israel. OK, when I say now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either,\" Trump said to reporters Tuesday morning.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson said late Monday that he expects the House briefing to have a different \"tone\" in the light of the ceasefire.",

      "President Donald Trump on Tuesday told Senate Republicans to lock themselves in a room if necessary to work out their differences and pass the megabill that will fund his second-term agenda.",
      "\u201cTo my friends in the Senate, lock yourself in a room if you must, don\u2019t go home, and GET THE DEAL DONE THIS WEEK,\u201d Trump posted on his social media platform while on his way to the NATO summit in the Netherlands. \u201cWork with the House so they can pick it up, and pass it, IMMEDIATELY. NO ONE GOES ON VACATION UNTIL IT\u2019S DONE.\u201d",
      "Both the Senate and House are under pressure to reconcile differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill and get it to Trump\u2019s desk by July 4.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson warned House Republicans Tuesday that their Independence Day celebrations may be in jeopardy as the House waits for the Senate to complete its changes to the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act and the speaker sticks to the Fourth of July deadline.",
      "While the House is scheduled to leave town Friday for a week back in their districts, the speaker set off his own fireworks -- telling his conference that members will not be dismissed for recess until the House approves the Senate\u2019s changes.",
      "\u201cI said to keep your schedules flexible. July 4 is always a district work period. This is tradition, so everybody can go home and celebrate the Fourth of July with their constituents and their families,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut this -- there's nothing more important that we should be involved in, or can be involved in than getting one big, beautiful bill to the president's desk. So if the Senate does its work on the timeline that we expect, we will do our work as well. And I think everybody's ready for that.\u201d",
      "The bill would make the Trump 2017 tax cuts permanent, allocate additional funding for border security and the Department of Defense, scale back Medicaid and SNAP benefits, limit taxes on tips and overtime, change state and local tax caps, and do far more.",
      "Republicans are attempting to pass the bill using budget reconciliation, a procedure that allows them to sidestep Senate rules that normally require 60 votes to pass legislation and to instead pass the bill with a simple majority.",
      "A KFF poll released Tuesday suggests nearly two-thirds of the public views the One Big Beautiful Bill Act unfavorably, by nearly twice as much who view it favorably, 35% to 64% of those polled.",
      "When those polled learned the impact the bill would have on health care -- for example, increasing the number of people without insurance and decreasing funding to hospitals -- support fell, even among MAGA supporters.",
      "The poll found 83% of the public, including 74% of Republicans, have a favorable view of Medicaid, and 66% have a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act.",
      "Senate Republicans met behind closed doors Monday night to go over the latest contours of their version of the bill as Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough continued to go through the bill to ensure provisions are within the scope of using reconciliation.",
      "Her rulings have already rankled some Republican plans, and Monday\u2019s meeting appeared to have focused largely on how they intend to retool their provisions for compliance.",
      "A lot remains outstanding, but there\u2019s general optimism in the conference that a floor vote this week is still possible.",
      "The meeting also took into account \u201cconsiderations as to what the president wants,\u201d according to Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., who said she still expects the bill to make it to the floor later this week.",
      "Johnson said Tuesday he expects the Senate to vote on Friday or Saturday -- after the lower chamber had been expected to conclude its legislative work period -- potentially pushing the House\u2019s consideration of the Senate\u2019s changes into next week.",
      "There remains a number of challenges that Republicans must address between now and then. Here\u2019s where things stand on some of the key provisions:",
      "The House and Senate have been divided on this issue as Senate Republicans have made clear they want to modify language in the House bill that some House moderates could balk at.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., who has been leading negotiations over SALT said Monday that the Senate has more or less reached a place of \u201cacceptance\u201d on SALT. The proposal, he said, won\u2019t touch the $40,000 cap negotiated in the House, but it will alter the income threshold.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to lose any votes,\u201d Mullin said, speaking for his conference. \u201cBut, as I said, it\u2019s not a joyful spot for any of us to be in. I\u2019ll be happy when this is done, and then we can move on.\u201d",
      "But Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday that the SALT caucus of five House Republicans has banded together to create a bloc that could defeat a vote given Johnson\u2019s slim three-vote majority.",
      "\u201cI hope they recognize the reality that five very salty House Republicans will vote no if they break apart on that deal,\u201d LaLota said.",
      "Capito said that provisions on SNAP were the most \u201cupended\u201d by the parliamentarian. Her ruling threatens to lessen the savings to the federal government that Republicans are hoping the bill will achieve.",
      "Some of Monday\u2019s meeting focused on the parliamentarian\u2019s ruling that a provision that would require states to share the cost of the SNAP was out of order.",
      "Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee that has jurisdiction over SNAP, said that Republicans are aiming to retool the SNAP provision to make it compliant with Senate rules.",

      "\u201cWhat needs to happen now is that the leader needs to get with the rural hospitals, and he needs to satisfy their concerns and make sure that they can stay open. I mean, that will solve the problem of the House, too. You got the House out there now saying they can't pass the Senate version of this bill,\u201d Hawley said.",
      "\u201cThis is not a game of chicken. This is real now, it's like, this is -- this is not like some Model UN or student government. Like, this is a real deal. So they need to get with the House. They need to get with the speaker. Make sure that they can pass this bill,\u201d Hawley added.",

    "summary": "Emil Bove, President Trump's former personal attorney who has been helping lead the DOJ, faces a Senate confirmation hearing to serve as a federal appeals court judge.",
    "story": [
      "Bove has been serving as principal associate deputy attorney general.",
      "Emil Bove, President Donald Trump's former defense attorney who took aggressive steps to enforce Trump's political agenda at the Justice Department in the early months of his presidency, told the Senate Judiciary Committee, \"I'm not anybody's henchman\" at a confirmation hearing Wednesday to consider him for a federal judgeship.",
      "Trump last month tapped Bove, who has been helping lead the Justice Department, for a judgeship on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "In his opening statement Wednesday, Bove vigorously disputed what he described as \"a wildly inaccurate caricature\" of himself generated by the \"mainstream media\" which has cast him as a \"henchman\" of President Trump.",
      "\"I am someone who tries to stand up for what I believe is right, I'm not afraid to make difficult decisions -- I understand that some of those decisions have generated controversy,\" Bove said. \"I respect this process, and I'm here today to address some of your questions about those decisions, but I want to be clear about one thing up front: There is a wildly inaccurate caricature of me in the mainstream media. I'm not anybody's henchman. I'm not an enforcer.\"",
      "The hearing comes one day after a former top DOJ career official issued an explosive whistleblower complaint accusing Bove of allegedly suggesting the Trump administration should defy judicial orders that sought to restrict their aggressive efforts to deport undocumented immigrants earlier this year.",
      "The 27-page complaint, provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Justice Department's top watchdog and obtained by ABC News, alleges that Bove and other top DOJ officials strategized how they could mislead courts regarding the administration's immigration enforcement efforts and potentially ignore judges' rulings outright.",
      "Addressing the complaint, Bove denied the allegations outright.",
      "\"No, I have never advised the Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order,\" Bove said. \"Even if that account is taken at face value, the whistleblower acknowledges that he left the meeting on March 14 of this year with the understanding that, of course, the department would advise clients to abide by court orders.\"",
      "Bove also suggested the issuance of the complaint by Erez Reuveni, a longtime career official who was promoted under the first Trump Administration for his immigration legal work, was an example of the \"unelected bureaucracy\" seeking to thwart \"the unitary executive\" and \"the people that elected the president.\"",
      "\"What I mean by that is, throughout this complaint, there's a suggestion that a line attorney, not even the head of the Office of immigration litigation, was in a position or considered himself to be, to bind the department's leadership and other Cabinet officials,\" Bove said. \"I don't abide that line thinking in my management style, and I'm not apologetic of that.\"",
      "Bove also rejected allegations that there was any \"quid pro quo\" deal with New York Mayor Eric Adams in the DOJ's decision to drop federal corruption charges against him in exchange for his support on immigration enforcement.",
      "\"That's simply false and it's refuted by -- refuted by the record,\" Bove said.",
      "Multiple career prosecutors resigned in protest over the move and described the arrangement as a clear 'quid pro quo.' A federal judge ultimately rejected the department's request to drop the case 'without prejudice' -- which would have left the prospect they could seek charges against Adams again if he did not continue supporting the administration. In his ruling dismissing the charges, Judge Dale Ho was deeply skeptical of the government's motives, writing, \"Everything here smacks of a bargain.\"",
      "Adams has denied the allegations and has pushed back on accusations of a quid quo pro.",
      "Ranking Democratic Senate Judiciary member Sen. Dick Durbin, in his opening remarks at Wednesday's hearing, said, \"The former personal defense attorney of President Trump, Mr. Bove has led the effort to weaponize the Department of Justice against the president's enemies. Having earned his stripes as a loyalist to this President, he's been rewarded with this lifetime nomination.\"",
      "Republican Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley cast Bove as a victim of an \"intense opposition campaign\" by Democrats and the media.",
      "\"I think that this committee owes this nominee a fair shake and respect at this hearing,\" Grassley said. \"This is hardly the first time this Congress that we've come into a nomination hearing against a backdrop of breathless claims that one of President Trump's nominees is uniquely unqualified or unfit.\"",
      "Grassley argued that lawmakers should instead look to Bove's resume as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and his time as a judicial clerk on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, prior to serving as Trump's personal attorney.",
      "\"This high stakes worked demands sharp legal judgment and steady resolve,\" Grassley said. \"Day in and day out, he was in the trenches putting terrorists and drug traffickers behind bars ... Put very simply, Mr. Bove checks every box -- academic distinction, federal courtships, complex trial and appellate litigation, senior Justice Department leadership. His experience isn't just sufficient, it is very exceptional.\"",

      "The allegations from Erez Reuveni -- who was fired from the department in April after he appeared in federal court in Maryland and admitted to a judge that the government had mistakenly deported accused MS-13 member Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador -- were delivered to the Senate on the eve of a confirmation hearing for Bove to serve on the powerful 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "\"Mr. Reuveni's disclosures detail violations of law, rules or regulations, and the abuse of authority by DOJ and White House personnel, as well as the creation of substantial and specific health and safety threats to noncitizens,\" Reuveni's attorneys said in the letter.",
      "\"These high-level governmental personnel knowingly and willfully defied court orders, directed their subordinate attorneys to make misrepresentations to courts, and engaged in a scheme to withhold relevant information from the court to advance the Administration's priority of deporting noncitizens,\" the letter said.",
      "Reuveni's whistleblower complaint details several internal meetings where he alleges Bove and other officials debated over how they could evade legal scrutiny in implementing President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th century wartime authority used to remove noncitizens with little-to-no due process. At a meeting on March 14, the complaint alleges that Bove said the department should consider saying \"f--- you\" to the courts and \"ignore any such court order.\"",
      "\"Mr. Reuveni was stunned by Bove's statement because, to Mr. Reuveni's knowledge, no one in DOJ leadership -- in any Administration -- had ever suggested the Department of Justice could blatantly ignore court orders,\" the letter says, repeating the expletive. \"Mr. Reuveni was in disbelief, because, on the contrary, the Department of Justice consistently advises its clients of their obligation to follow court orders, not to ignore them.\"",
      "In a statement to The New York Times responding to the letter -- which was first reported by the paper -- Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche described Reuveni as a \"disgruntled former employee\" and said that his accusations about Bove and other DOJ leadership \"are utterly false.\"",
      "\"I was at the meeting described in the [New York Times] article and at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed,\" Blanche said.",
      "The allegations by Reuveni fall at the center of an effort by D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg to potentially hold top administration officials in contempt for violating a March 15 order to turn a plane of undocumented immigrants deported under the Alien Enemies Act around before it arrived in El Salvador. That inquiry was put on a temporary hold by an appeals court panel in the D.C. Circuit in April.",
      "Bove, according to Reuveni's account, made clear to officials the day before Boasberg's order that the planes carrying the deported individuals \"needed to take off no matter what,\" and that is when he made the comment about potentially defying court orders.",
      "Officials in the room \"looked stunned\" following Bove's alleged remarks, and those in the room left the meeting still \"understanding that DOJ would tell DHS to follow all court orders,\" according to Reuveni.",
      "In Reuveni's telling, the meeting was just one in a series of instances that demonstrated efforts by White House and DOJ leadership to defy court orders \"through lack of candor, deliberate delay, and disinformation.\"",
      "\"Discouraging clients from engaging in illegal conduct is an important part of the role of a lawyer,\" the letter states. \"Mr. Reuveni tried to do so and was thwarted, threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged for both doing his job and telling the truth to the court.\"",
      "Senate Democrats are expected to highlight Reuveni's account at Bove's judicial confirmation hearing Wednesday to bolster their claims that Bove, who previously served as President Trump's personal defense attorney, has abused his position at DOJ to advance Trump's political agenda.",
      "\"These serious allegations, from a career Justice Department lawyer who defended the first Trump Administration's immigration policies, not only speak to Mr. Bove's failure to fulfill his ethical obligations as a lawyer, but demonstrate that his activities are part of a broader pattern by President Trump and his allies to undermine the Justice Department's commitment to the rule of law,\" Senate Judiciary ranking member Dick Durbin said in a statement reacting to Reuveni's letter.",
      "\"And I implore my Senate Republican colleagues: do not turn a blind eye to the dire consequences of confirming Mr. Bove to a lifetime position as a circuit court judge,\" Durbin said.",

The group wields enormous influence setting vaccine policy in the United States, including which vaccines will be covered by insurance.",

      "Kennedy, however, has begun removing guardrails protecting some pediatric vaccines. Some public health professionals are worried the ACIP\u2019s upcoming recommendations will be part of Kennedy\u2019s purported larger goal to reduce access to certain vaccines.",

      "Years before becoming HHS secretary, Kennedy led Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD), a group that pursues anti-vaccine causes.",

      "The group has continued to exert influence in anti-vaccine circles as seen during the measles outbreak in Texas this year, particularly among the Mennonite community.",
      "CHD aired interviews with the two Mennonite families whose young children died from measles in the outbreak. In the interviews, both families claimed their children did not die from measles and said they did not support vaccination.",
      "Kennedy has resigned from the board of CHD during his run for the presidency in 2023. But when Kennedy went to Texas in April to meet families affected by the measles outbreak, he shared two contradictory messages on X.",
      "In the first post, Kennedy called the measles vaccine \u201cthe most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.\u201d",
      "In the second post later that evening, Kennedy said he met with two physicians who \"treated and healed\" about 300 children infected with measles in the Mennonite community with aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin -- a steroid and an antibiotic, respectively, and neither of which are treatments for measles.",
      "\u201c[Kennedy] basically came back to [CHD] to say, \u2018Look, I had to put out a post of who they want me to be and who I'm supposed to be in this role. But here's a post to show you all who I really am and what I'm really fighting for,\u2019\u201d Spencer said. \u201cAnd I think that was really profoundly important for a lot of CHD people.\u201d",
      "RFK Jr. becomes HHS Secretary",
      "During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy said he supports vaccines and that he is not \u201canti-vaccine\u201d but \u201cpro-safety.\u201d",
      "However, throughout the hearings, he refused to say that vaccines were not linked to autism, while still insisting he supports vaccination.",
      "\"So it does not appear that he supports vaccination by the actions he has taken and the statements he has made in the past,\u201d said Dr. Jason M. Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, ACP\u2019s liaison to the ACIP, and a member of the college\u2019s immunization committee and CDC-affiliated vaccine workgroups on pneumonia and COVID\u201119.",
      "\u201cHis statements seem apparently contradictory in trying to promote public health and welfare yet undercutting one of our very basic and foundational tools for prevention of disease,\u201d Goldman added.",
      "During his confirmation hearing, Kennedy also pledged not to remove the existing members of the CDC's ACIP committee -- a promise that was later broken when Kennedy removed its sitting members. The Biden administration had appointed all 17 sitting members of the ACIP, including 13 in 2024.",
      "Open CDC Director Role",
      "The Trump administration initially nominated Dr. David Weldon for CDC director, who was considered closely aligned with Kennedy and had previously stated the false idea that vaccines cause autism, a claim that has been long debunked by numerous, large-scale studies over the course of decades. His nomination was withdrawn after sources said he didn\u2019t have the votes to be confirmed.",
      "With the acting director position open, Kennedy has had final say over some CDC decisions. Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, a Democrat from Delaware, publicly called out the need to fill the open role in a May Senate hearing.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear: the absence of a CDC Director is a serious public health risk,\u201d Blunt said in a statement. \u201cThe Director of the CDC has the sole authority to make critical decisions that affect millions of Americans. The Director is responsible for coordinating the response to emerging infectious disease outbreaks \u2013 which is now more important than ever, in the midst of our country\u2019s largest measles outbreak in over two decades.\u201d",
      "Dr. Susan Monarez, the administration\u2019s new pick for CDC director, will be at confirmation hearings this week.",
      "\u201cThere is currently no acting CDC director, and so that means that these decisions all fall within the purview of RFK Jr.,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cHe is able to do all of the things that only a CDC director would otherwise be able to do: to sign off on vaccines, to reconstitute ACIP.\u201d",
      "Changes around COVID vaccines",
      "Prior to becoming HHS secretary, Kennedy spread misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, falsely claiming the COVID vaccine is dangerous.",
      "Since he became head of HHS, there have been major changes at federal health agencies related to COVID vaccines.",
      "In late May, the FDA announced it was planning to limit access to future COVID to those aged 65 and older and others with underling health conditions.",
      "Additionally, the agency said it would allow vaccine manufacturers to conduct large studies to assess the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines in children and younger, healthy adults.",
      "About a week later, Kennedy cut COVD-19 vaccine recommendations for \"healthy children and pregnant women\" without a vote from the committee and posted the announcement on X rather than through official federal channels, in a break with tradition and stunning doctors.",
      "\u201cThe decision to not allow pregnant women and children to get vaccinated based on a social-media post is not how science is conducted. And the second is the fact that he arbitrarily, unilaterally, without evidence, science, research or fact decides to change a vaccine schedule is abhorrent,\u201d Goldman said.",
      "Revamping ACIP",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy removed all 17 sitting members of the ACIP and appointed eight new members, some of whom have been critics of shots -- especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The new eight members appear to have strong credentials related to medicine, public health, epidemiology and statistics, but with less of an emphasis on credentials related to immunology, virology and vaccinology in comparison with previous committees.",
      "One of the new members, Dr. Robert Malone -- who made some early contributors to mRNA vaccine technology -- spread misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming people were \"hypnotized\" into believing mainstream ideas about COVID-19, such as vaccination.",
      "Retsef Levi, another newly appointed member, has previously published non-peer reviewed research alongside Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo on COVID-19 vaccines, suggesting healthy people have died from the shots, claims that are not backed by evidence.",
      "Goldman pointed out that he has served as a liaison to the ACIP for more than five years, helping review data and shape vaccine recommendations, but says he and other liaison committee members have been shut out of the process this time with no communication or access to meeting materials.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s concerning to me is the process is not being followed. There\u2019s no transparency. We\u2019re not being given information,\u201d he said.",
      "In a statement, an HHS spokesperson said, \"The Secretary has no intention of restricting access to vaccines, but to ensure all vaccines and medical interventions adhere to the highest standards of safety. Secretary Kennedy believes the American people deserve full transparency to make truly informed decisions about their health.\u201d",
      "The new members will be at the ACIP meeting and will vote on new recommendations for several vaccines, including RSV vaccines and influenza vaccines.",
      "\u201cThe folks that were on ACIP prior to their forced resignation were all incredible, wonderful people, and they were all great scientists,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cAnybody that follows this [meeting] is going to see that it is a sham and a shameful process. It is a silly replacement for a process that was well-structured, well defined, and helped create guardrails of safety.\u201d",
      "It remains to be seen whether the new ACIP members will move to place further limits on existing vaccines.",

      "At a confirmation hearing Wednesday, President Donald Trump's pick for the director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Susan Monarez, faced questions about her stance on vaccines -- after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a vaccine skeptic, has recently made controversial choices around them",
      "Monarez was clear in her support for vaccines.",
      "\"I think vaccines save lives. I think that we need to continue to support the promotion of utilization of vaccines,\" Monarez said.",
      "Her comments came as she was asked by Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders about a recent decision reported by POLITICO that Kennedy has decided to end U.S. funding for a global vaccine alliance, Gavi.",
      "\"I wasn't involved in that decision making. If I'm confirmed as a CDC director, I will certainly look into it, and I'm happy to follow up with you,\" Monarez said.",
      "Kennedy has long held many vaccine-skeptic views, refuted by experts and high-quality studies, long before he joined the administration, but he has insisted he is not \"anti-vaccine\" and rather \"pro-safety.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy removed all 17 sitting members of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee and replaced them with new members. The move has been controversial, with some experts saying it makes the U.S. \"less prepared for infectious disease threats.\"",

      "\"I have not seen a causal link between vaccines and autism,\" Monarez said, asked by Sanders if she agrees with the American Medical Association's stance \"that there is no scientific proven link between vaccines and autism.\"",
      "Kennedy, in his own confirmation hearing, refused to acknowledge that there is not a link between vaccines and autism, causing him to nearly lose the key vote of Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican and a doctor.",
      "Kennedy has since launched a major effort at NIH to look into the causes of rising autism diagnoses.",
      "The myth that vaccines cause autism was born out of a fraudulent 1998 study, hypothesizing that the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine caused intestinal inflammation, which, in turn, led to the development of autism.",
      "The paper has since been discredited by health experts, retracted from the journal in which it was published, and its primary author, Andrew Wakefield, lost his medical license after an investigation found he had acted \"dishonestly and irresponsibly\" in conducting his research.",
      "More than a dozen high-quality studies have since found no evidence of a link between childhood vaccines and autism.",
      "Monarez outlined her credentials in her opening statements, touting her experience with health technology and public health. She also laid out her goals as the CDC director, which includes restoring public trust, modernizing public health infrastructure and employing evidence-based rapid decision making.",
      "\"These priorities support the president's and the secretary's vision of a healthier America. To achieve them, I will lead with integrity, transparency and purpose, and work with Congress to maximize health outcomes and protect the American people,\" Monarez said in her opening statement.",
      "Trump tapped Monarez to lead the CDC in March after the administration withdrew Trump's other pick, Dr. David Weldon, to head the agency citing the fact that he did not have the votes needed to be confirmed.",
      "Monarez, if confirmed, will work with Kennedey to \"prioritize Accountability, High Standards, and Disease Prevention to finally address the Chronic Disease Epidemic and, MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN!\" Trump said in a social media post announcing her nomination.",
      "Monarez has served as the acting CDC director since late January.",
      "She has experience in both the public and private sector -- including working in the government under former presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Trump's first term and Joe Biden. Her work has included strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance, too.",

      "Richard Gowan, U.N. director of the International Crisis Group, a think tank, said the United Nations has bounced from crisis to crisis since the 1990s. With the gloomy geopolitical picture and U.S. funding cuts impacting humanitarian operations, he said this \u201cis not just another blow-up that will blow over.\"",
      "\"Everyone seems to be resigned to the fact that you\u2019re going to have a smaller U.N. in a few years\u2019 time,\" Gowan said. \"And that is partially because virtually every member state has other priorities.\u201d",
      "Guterres has launched several major reform efforts, getting approval from U.N. member nations last September for a \u201cPact for the Future\u201d \u2013 a blueprint to bring the world together to tackle 21st-century challenges. Gowan said Guterres\u2019 successor, who will be elected next year and take over in 2027, will have to shrink the organization.

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has found that the California Department of Education and the state\u2019s high school sports federation violated civil rights law by allowing transgender girls to compete on girls sports teams.",
      "The federal Education Department announced the finding Wednesday and proposed a resolution that would require California to bar transgender women from women\u2019s sports and strip transgender athletes of records, titles and awards. It\u2019s the latest escalation in the Republican administration\u2019s effort to bar transgender athletes from women\u2019s sports teams nationwide.",
      "If California rejects the proposal, the Education Department could move to terminate the state\u2019s federal education funding.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration will relentlessly enforce Title IX protections for women and girls, and our findings today make clear that California has failed to adhere to its obligations under federal law,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said. \u201cThe state must swiftly come into compliance with Title IX or face the consequences that follow.\u201d",
      "Title IX is a 1972 law forbidding sex discrimination based in education.",
      "California education and sports officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.",
      "Federal officials opened an investigation into the California Interscholastic Federation in February after the organization said it would abide by a state law allowing athletes to compete on teams consistent with their gender identity. That followed an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that was intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls and women\u2019s sports.",
      "In April, McMahon's department opened an investigation into the California Department of Education over the same issue.",
      "Both investigations concluded that state policies violated Title IX. The administration has been invoking the law in its campaign against transgender athletes, launching scores of investigations into schools, colleges and states. It\u2019s a reversal from the Biden administration, which attempted to expand Title IX to provide protections for transgender students. A federal judge struck down the expansion before Trump took office in January.",
      "The administration's proposed resolution would require California to notify schools that transgender athletes should be barred from girls athletic teams and that all schools must \u201cadopt biology-based definitions of the words \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female.\u2019\u201d The state would also have to notify schools that any conflicting interpretation of state law would be considered a violation of Title IX.",
      "Athletes who lost awards, titles or records to transgender athletes would have their honors restored under the proposal, and the state would be required to send personal apology letters to those athletes.",
      "A similar resolution was offered to Maine\u2019s education agency in a separate clash with the administration over transgender athletes. Maine rejected the proposal in April, prompting a Justice Department lawsuit seeking to terminate the state\u2019s federal education funding.",
      "Under federal guidelines, California\u2019s education office and the sports federation have 10 days to come into compliance or risk enforcement action.",
      "The federation separately tested a pilot policy at a state track meet in May, allowing one extra competitor in three events featuring high school junior AB Hernandez, who is trans. The organization announced the change after Trump took to social medial to criticize Hernandez\u2019s participation. The Justice Department said it would investigate Hernandez\u2019s district and the state to determine if Title IX was being violated.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The budget bill championed by President Donald Trump could complicate next year's tax filing season after the IRS lost one-quarter of its employees through staffing cuts, an independent watchdog reported Wednesday.",
      "The IRS workforce has fallen from 102,113 workers to 75,702 over the past year, according to the latest National Taxpayer Advocate report to Congress. The report Wednesday offered the first official numbers on the IRS job losses associated with Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",

The biggest cuts were in taxpayer services, the small business/self-employed office and information technology.",
      "The report noted that the Republican administration's proposed budget includes a 20% reduction in IRS funding next year. That's a 37% reduction when taking into account the supplemental funding in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act that Republicans previously stripped away.",
      "\u201cA reduction of that magnitude is likely to impact taxpayers and potentially the revenue collected,\" wrote Erin M. Collins, who leads the organization assigned to protect taxpayers\u2019 rights.",
      "Collins said the 2025 filing season was \u201cone of the most successful filing seasons in recent memory,\u201d though she warned that the 2026 season could be rocky.",
      "\u201cWith the IRS workforce reduced by 26% and significant tax law changes on the horizon, there are risks to next year\u2019s filing season,\u201d Collins wrote. \"It is critical that the IRS begin to take steps now to prepare.\u201d",
      "She said that, halfway through the year, there were concerns that the IRS had not yet undertaken key preparation steps, including hiring and training seasonal and permanent employees.",
      "The report warned about the possibility of understaffing to manage new provisions from Trump's legislative package if it's enacted.",
      "\u201cSeveral provisions will retroactively affect the 2025 tax year, thus impacting millions of taxpayers and requiring the IRS to quickly update tax year 2025 tax forms and programming for the 2026 filing season,\" the report said.",
      "Specifically, the House bill retroactively prohibits the IRS from allowing or making payment of Employee Retention Credit claims filed after Jan. 31, 2024.",
      "The report also said the IRS historically receives more calls in years following significant changes in tax law, so it may need additional employees and improved digital tools to maintain its level of service.",
      "The IRS is dealing with delays in resolving self-reported identity theft victim assistance cases \u2014 taking up to 20 months to resolve, the report said.",
      "As of the end of the 2025 filing season, the IRS was handling about 387,000 of these cases.",

    "story": [
      "Ten years after the Supreme Court ruled there's a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, the split between Republicans and Democrats on the issue is wider than it\u2019s been in decades",
      "WASHINGTON -- For years, it looked as though the United States was steadily climbing toward a consensus on same-sex marriage. But 10 years after the Supreme Court ruled that there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, the split between Republicans and Democrats on the issue is wider than it's been in decades.",
      "Recent polling from Gallup shows that Americans' support for same-sex marriage is higher than it was in 2015. Gallup's latest data, however, finds a 47-percentage-point gap on the issue between Republicans and Democrats, the largest since it first began tracking this measure 29 years ago.",
      "The size of that chasm is partially due to a substantial dip in support among Republicans since 2023.",
      "An Associated Press polling analysis shows how same-sex marriage shifted from a clear minority position to a stance with broad support \u2014 and what the future could hold for views on the issue.",
      "Less than 40 years ago, same-sex marriage was a deeply unpopular issue.",
      "In 1988, The General Social Survey showed that just about 1 in 10 U.S. adults \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d or \u201cagreed\u201d with a statement that gay couples should have the right to marry. At that point, roughly 7 in 10 Americans \u2014 including similar shares of Democrats and Republicans \u2014 disagreed with the statement.",
      "But as early as the 1990s, the politics of same-sex marriage were shifting. Gallup data from 1996 \u2014 the year the Defense of Marriage Act defined marriage as between one man and one woman \u2014 showed that 27% of U.S. adults said marriages between same-sex partners \u201cshould be recognized by the law as valid.\u201d But Democrats and Republicans weren\u2019t in lockstep anymore: Democrats were nearly twice as likely as Republicans to support legal recognition of same-sex marriages.",
      "By 2004, the legalization of same-sex marriage started to unfold at the state level. That year, Massachusetts became the first state to allow same-sex couples to marry. President George W. Bush, a Republican, championed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage on the campaign trail, while Democrats vying for their party's 2004 presidential nomination said the legalization of same-sex marriage should be left to the states.",
      "At this time, Americans\u2019 support for same-sex marriage was still somewhat limited, and the divide between Republicans and Democrats deepened. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults agreed that same-sex marriage should be permitted, according to the Gallup data. Among Democrats, that agreement was higher \u2014 about half were in favor \u2014 compared with 22% of Republicans.",
      "Since then, Americans' upward movement on support for same-sex marriage has been driven by Democrats and independents. Throughout Gallup\u2019s trend, Democrats have been more supportive of same-sex marriage than Republicans have. Since 2006, at least half of Democrats have supported same-sex marriage, and independents started to see consistent majority support in 2012.",
      "The gap between Democrats and Republicans, meanwhile, stayed wide. By 2015, the year of the Supreme Court's ruling, about three-quarters of Democrats \u2014 but only about one-third of Republicans \u2014 supported same-sex marriage.",
      "But Republicans did become somewhat more supportive of same-sex marriage between 2010 and 2020. While Democrats continued to lead the shift, Republican public opinion also moved during this decade \u2014 signaling a broader movement toward acceptance of same-sex marriage across party lines, even if it wasn't always linear.",
      "About 7 in 10 Americans think marriages between same-sex partners should be recognized by the law as valid, according to Gallup data from this year, which is similar to the latest General Social Survey data showing 63% of U.S. adults agree that same-sex marriage should be considered a right.",
      "But while the public's support for same-sex marriage ticked up in the years following the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling \u2014 from about 60% in 2015 \u2014 it has been relatively steady since 2020.",
      "At the same time, Republicans\u2019 support has fallen in each of the past three years. Now, about 4 in 10 Republicans say marriages between same-sex partners should be recognized as legal, down from a record high of 55% in 2021 and 2022. This latest decline by Republicans returns their views to their 2016 measure, when 40% supported legal same-sex marriage.",
      "Gallup Senior Editor Megan Brenan said Republicans' recent shift in opinion on same-sex marriage is dramatic.",
      "\u201cThis was a much steeper fall from 2022 through 2025,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now, of course, we have the widest partisan gap that we\u2019ve seen in the trends.\u201d",
      "Even as overall Republican support for same-sex marriage declines, a generational split within the party suggests that opposition may not hold in the long run.",
      "Among Republicans under age 50, about 6 in 10 say same-sex marriages should be legally recognized, the Gallup poll finds. That stands in stark contrast to just 36% of Republicans over 50 who say the same \u2014- suggesting that views on the issue could continue to shift.",
      "Overall, younger adults are significantly more likely to support legal recognition of same-sex marriage. About 8 in 10 adults under 35 are in favor, compared with roughly 7 in 10 between ages 35 and 54 and 6 in 10 among those 55 or older.",
      "Brenan noted that younger Americans are more accepting of same-sex marriage than older adults are, and it's an issue that especially appears to divide Republicans today.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s a key to where things will be headed, presumably,\u201d Brenan said. \u201cHistorically, people have become more conservative as they age, but this is an issue that\u2019s so ingrained in society today and especially younger society.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A top Justice Department official under scrutiny over a whistleblower's claims that he suggested ignoring court orders will face questions on Capitol Hill on Wednesday as he seeks to be confirmed as a federal appeals court judge.",
      "Emil Bove, a former criminal defense attorney for President Donald Trump, has been behind some of the most contentious actions that Justice Department leadership has taken since January. The Senate Judiciary Committee hearing comes a day after a former Justice Department lawyer alleged in a whistleblower complaint that he was fired after resisting efforts to defy judicial orders.",
      "Bove was nominated last month by the Republican president to serve on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears cases from Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. A former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, Bove was on the defense team during Trump\u2019s New York hush money trial and defended Trump in the two federal criminal cases brought by the Justice Department.",
      "Bove is likely to face heated questions over the allegations made by the whistleblower, Erez Reuveni, who was fired in April after conceding in court that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who had been living in Maryland, was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison. Reuveni sent a letter on Tuesday to members of Congress and the Justice Department's inspector general seeking an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by Bove and other officials in the weeks leading up to his firing.",
      "Reuveni described a Justice Department meeting in March concerning Trump\u2019s plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act over what the president claimed was an invasion by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Reuveni says Bove raised the possibility that a court might block the deportations before they could happen. Reuveni claims Bove used a profanity in saying the department would need to consider telling the courts what to do and \u201cignore any such order,\u201d Reuveni's lawyers said in the letter.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche called the allegations \u201cutterly false,\u201d saying that he was at the March meeting and \u201cat no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed.\u201d",
      "\u201cPlanting a false hit piece the day before a confirmation hearing is something we have come to expect from the media, but it does not mean it should be tolerated,\u201d Blanche wrote in a post on X on Tuesday.",
      "Bove has been at the center of other moves that have roiled the Justice Department in recent months, including the order to dismiss New York City Mayor Eric Adams' federal corruption case. Bove's order prompted the resignation of several Justice Department officials, including Manhattan\u2019s top federal prosecutor, who accused the department of acceding to a quid pro quo \u2014 dropping the case to ensure Adams\u2019 help with Trump\u2019s immigration agenda.",

      "U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver has pleaded not guilty to federal charges accusing her of assaulting and interfering with immigration officers outside a New Jersey detention center",
      "NEWARK, N.J. -- U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver pleaded not guilty Wednesday to federal charges accusing her of assaulting and interfering with immigration officers outside a New Jersey detention center during a congressional oversight visit at the facility.",
      "\u201cThey will not intimidate me. They will not stop me from doing my job,\u201d she said outside the courthouse in Newark after the brief hearing.",
      "McIver, a Democrat, was charged in a complaint by interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, following the May 9 visit to Newark\u2019s Delaney Hall. Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses the privately owned, 1,000-bed facility as a detention center.",
      "This month she was indicted on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Habba said two counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third has a maximum of one year.",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, McIver stood and told U.S. District Judge Jamel Semper: \u201cYour honor, I plead not guilty.\u201d The judge set a Nov. 10 trial date.",
      "Outside the courthouse, McIver warned that anyone who pushes back against the Trump administration will find themselves in a similar position.",
      "McIver\u2019s lawyer, former U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Paul Fishman, said McIver pleaded not guilty because she is not guilty. He said federal agents created a risky situation at Delaney Hall.",
      "The indictment is the latest development in a legal-political drama that has seen the Trump administration take Democratic officials from New Jersey\u2019s largest city to court amid the president's ongoing immigration crackdown and Democrats\u2019 efforts to respond. The prosecution is a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress for allegations other than fraud or corruption.",
      "During the same visit to the detention center, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested on a trespassing charge that was later dropped. Baraka is suing Habba over what he called a malicious prosecution.",
      "A nearly two-minute video clip released by the Department of Homeland Security shows McIver at the facility inside a chain-link fence just before Baraka's arrest on other side of the barrier, where other people were protesting. McIver and uniformed officials go through the gate, and she joins others shouting that they should circle the mayor.",
      "The video shows McIver in a tightly packed group of people and officers. At one point her left elbow and then her right elbow push into an officer wearing a dark face covering and an olive green uniform emblazoned with the word \u201cPolice.\u201d",
      "It is not clear from police bodycam video if the contact was intentional, incidental or the result of jostling in the chaotic scene.",
      "The complaint alleges that she \u201cslammed\u201d her forearm into an agent and then tried to restrain the agent by grabbing him.",
      "The indictment also says she placed her arms around the mayor to try to stop his arrest and says again that she slammed her forearm into and grabbed an agent.",
      "Democrats including New Jersey Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez, who were with McIver at the detention center that day, have criticized the arrest and disputed the charges.",
      "Members of Congress are legally authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a 2019 appropriations bill spelling out that authority.",
      "McIver, 39, first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District. She was then elected to a full term in November.",
      "A Newark native, she was president of the Newark City Council from 2022 to 2024 and worked in the city\u2019s public schools before that.",

    "story": [
      "A Revolutionary War-era boat is being reconstructed more than two centuries after being buried deep beneath Manhattan\u2019s expanding shoreline",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- Workers digging at Manhattan's World Trade Center site 15 years ago made an improbable discovery: sodden timbers from a boat built during the Revolutionary War that had been buried more than two centuries earlier.",
      "Now, over 600 pieces from the 50-foot (15-meter) vessel are being painstakingly put back together at the New York State Museum. After years on the water and centuries underground, the boat is becoming a museum exhibit.",
      "Arrayed like giant puzzle pieces on the museum floor, research assistants and volunteers recently spent weeks cleaning the timbers with picks and brushes before reconstruction could even begin.",
      "Though researchers believe the ship was a gunboat built in 1775 to defend Philadelphia, they still don\u2019t know all the places it traveled to or why it ended up apparently neglected along the Manhattan shore before ending up in a landfill around the 1790s.",
      "\u201cThe public can come and contemplate the mysteries around this ship,\u201d said Michael Lucas, the museum\u2019s curator of historical archaeology. \u201cBecause like anything from the past, we have pieces of information. We don\u2019t have the whole story.\u201d",
      "The rebuilding caps years of rescue and preservation work that began in July 2010 when a section of the boat was found 22 feet (7 meters) below street level.",
      "Curved timbers from the hull were discovered by a crew working on an underground parking facility at the World Trade Center site, near where the Twin Towers stood before the 9/11 attacks.",
      "The wood was muddy, but well preserved after centuries in the oxygen-poor earth. A previously constructed slurry wall went right through the boat, though timbers comprising about 30 feet (9 meters) of its rear and middle sections were carefully recovered. Part of the bow was recovered the next summer on the other side of the subterranean wall.",
      "The timbers were shipped more than 1,400 miles (2,253 kilometers) to Texas A&M\u2019s Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation.",
      "Each of the 600 pieces underwent a three-dimensional scan and spent years in preservative fluids before being placed in a giant freeze-dryer to remove moisture. Then they were wrapped in more than a mile of foam and shipped to the state museum in Albany.",
      "While the museum is 130 miles (209 kilometers) up the Hudson River from lower Manhattan, it boasts enough space to display the ship. The reconstruction work is being done in an exhibition space, so visitors can watch the weathered wooden skeleton slowly take the form of a partially reconstructed boat.",
      "Work is expected to finish around the end of the month, said Peter Fix, an associate research scientist at the Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation who is overseeing the rebuilding.",
      "On a recent day, Lucas took time out to talk to passing museum visitors about the vessel and how it was found.",
      "Explaining the work taking place behind him, he told one group: \u201cWho would have thought in a million years, 'someday, this is going to be in a museum?\u2019\u201d",
      "Researchers knew they found a boat under the streets of Manhattan. But what kind?",
      "Analysis of the timbers showed they came from trees cut down in the Philadelphia area in the early 1770s, pointing to the ship being built in a yard near the city.",
      "It was probably built hastily. The wood is knotty, and timbers were fastened with iron spikes. That allowed for faster construction, though the metal corrodes over time in seawater.",
      "Researchers now hypothesize the boat was built in Philadelphia in the summer of 1775, months after the first shots of the Revolutionary War were fired at Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts. Thirteen gunboats were built that summer to protect Philadelphia from potential hostile forces coming up the Delaware River. The gunboats featured cannons pointing from their bows and could carry 30 or more men.",
      "\u201cThey were really pushing, pushing, pushing to get these boats out there to stop any British that might start coming up the Delaware,\" Fix said.",
      "Historical records indicate at least one of those 13 gunboats was later taken by the British. And there is some evidence that the boat now being restored was used by the British, including a pewter button with \u201c52\u201d inscribed on it. That likely came from the uniform of soldier with the British Army\u2019s 52nd Regiment of Foot, which was active in the war.",
      "It's also possible that the vessel headed south to the Caribbean, where the British redirected thousands of troops during the war. Its timbers show signs of damage from mollusks known as shipworms, which are native to warmer waters.",
      "Still, it's unclear how the boat ended up in Manhattan and why it apparently spent years partially in the water along shore. By the 1790s, it was out of commission and then covered over as part of a project to expand Manhattan farther out into the Hudson River. By that time, the mast and other parts of the Revolutionary War ship had apparently been stripped.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an important piece of history,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a nice artifact that you can really build a lot of stories around.\u201d",

      "Vietnam veteran Richard Gerald Jordan is set to be executed in Mississippi nearly 50 years after being sentenced to death",
      "JACKSON, Miss. -- Mississippi\u2019s longest-serving death row inmate is set to be executed Wednesday nearly five decades after he kidnapped and killed a bank loan officer\u2019s wife in a violent ransom scheme.",
      "Richard Gerald Jordan, a 79-year-old Vietnam veteran who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman. He is one of several people on Mississippi's death row suing the state over its three-drug execution protocol, which they claim is inhumane.",
      "Jordan would be the third person executed in the state in the last 10 years; the most recent execution was in December 2022.",
      "His execution comes a day after a man was executed in Florida in what is shaping up to be a year with the most executions since 2015.",
      "Jordan was sentenced to death in 1976 for killing and kidnapping Edwina Marter, a mother of two young children, earlier that year. As of the beginning of the year, Jordan is one of 22 people across the country sentenced for crimes in the 1970s who are still on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Eric Marter, who was 11 when his mother was killed, said neither he, his brother, nor his father will attend the execution, but other family members will be there.",
      "\u201cIt should have happened a long time ago,\u201d he said of the execution. \u201cI\u2019m not really interested in giving him the benefit of the doubt.\u201d",
      "Mississippi Supreme Court records show that in January 1976, Jordan called the Gulf National Bank in Gulfport, Mississippi, and asked to speak with a loan officer. After he was told Charles Marter could speak to him, he hung up. He then looked up the Marters\u2019 home address in a telephone book and kidnapped Edwina Marter. According to court records, Jordan took her to a forest and shot her to death before calling her husband, claiming she was safe and demanding $25,000.",
      "\u201cHe needs to be punished,\u201d Eric Marter said.",
      "The execution ends Jordan\u2019s decades-long court process that included four trials and numerous appeals. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a petition that claimed he was denied due process rights.",
      "\u201cHe was never given what, for a long time, the law has entitled him to, which is a mental health professional that is independent of the prosecution and can assist his defense,\u201d said lawyer Krissy Nobile, the director of Mississippi\u2019s Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel, who represents Jordan. \u201cBecause of that, his jury never got to hear about his Vietnam experiences.\u201d",
      "A recent petition asking Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves for clemency echoed Nobile\u2019s claim. It argues Jordan developed PTSD after serving three back-to-back tours in the Vietnam War, which could have been a factor in his crime.",
      "\u201cHis war service, his war trauma, was considered not relevant in his murder trial,\u201d said Franklin Rosenblatt, the president of the National Institute of Military Justice, who wrote the petition on Jordan\u2019s behalf. \u201cWe just know so much more than we did 10 years ago, and certainly during Vietnam, about the effect of war trauma on the brain and how that affects ongoing behaviors.\u201d",
      "Eric Marter said he doesn\u2019t buy that argument.",
      "\u201cI know what he did. He wanted money, and he couldn\u2019t take her with him. And he \u2014 so he did what he did,\u201d he said.",

      "A federal judge has partially granted a preliminary injunction that sought to release funds for the build out of electric vehicle chargers in more than a dozen states",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A federal judge Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to release billions of dollars in funding for the build out of electric vehicle chargers in more than a dozen states.",
      "U.S. District Judge Tana Lin in Washington state partially granted a preliminary injunction that sought to free up the money approved under then-President Joe Biden that the Trump administration withheld earlier this year. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia sued over the move, arguing that the administration did not have the authority to block the congressionally approved funds. The program was set to allocate $5 billion over five years to various states, of which an estimated $3.3 billion had already been made available.",
      "Lin ordered that funding be released in 14 of the states, including in Arizona, California and New York. But she denied granting the preliminary injunction for D.C., Minnesota and Vermont, saying that they did not provide enough evidence that they would face \u201cirreparable harm\u201d if the money wasn't immediately freed up.",
      "Lin said the Trump administration overstepped its constitutional authority when it froze the funding previously approved by Congress in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.",
      "\u201cWhen the Executive Branch treads upon the will of the Legislative Branch, and when an administrative agency acts contrary to law, it is the Court\u2019s responsibility to remediate the situation and restore the balance of power,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The order will go into effect July 2 unless the Trump administration appeals. The Federal Highway Administration did not immediately respond to an email request for comment on the decision.",
      "The Trump administration in February directed states to stop spending money for electric vehicle charging under the program. The move was part of a broader push by the Republican president to roll back environmental policies advanced by his Democratic predecessor.",
      "States suing the Trump administration said the decision to freeze funding halted projects midstream, requiring immediate court intervention.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said after the ruling that the Trump administration could not \u201cdismiss programs illegally.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are pleased with today\u2019s order blocking the Administration\u2019s unconstitutional attempt to do so, and California looks forward to continuing to vigorously defend itself from this executive branch overreach,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "The Trump administration argued that it was working on new guidance for the program and was only pausing future funding in the meantime.",
      "The program was meant to assuage concerns about electric vehicles and build infrastructure along highway corridors first, then address gaps elsewhere once the state highway obligations were met.",
      "Some states with projects running under the program have already been reimbursed by the Biden-era federal funds. Others are still contracting for their sites. Still more had halted their plans by the time the Trump administration ordered states to stop their spending. Regardless, getting the chargers installed and operating has been a slow process with contracting challenges, permitting delays and complex electrical upgrades.",
      "It was expected that states would fight against the federal government\u2019s efforts to slow the nation\u2019s electric vehicle charger build out. New York, for example, which is part of the lawsuit, has been awarded over $175 million in federal funds from the program, and state officials say $120 million is currently being withheld by the Trump administration.",

      "A lawsuit filed Tuesday argues the agreement between Nassau County and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced in February violates state law, undermines individuals' rights and will lead to racial profiling.",
      "Dozens of other police departments around the U.S. have similar partnerships, known as 287(g) agreements, with ICE, but only a handful exist in New York, where state law limits when police agencies can cooperate with federal immigration officials. The agreements ramp up the number of immigration enforcement staff available to ICE as it aims to meet President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation goals.",
      "Broome County and Niagara County officials also reached agreements with ICE this year, joining Rensselaer County, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the Diocese of Long Island, immigrant and refugee advocates and two Long Island residents. Nassau County is on Long Island just east of New York City.",

      "In announcing the agreement, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican and Trump ally, said 10 county police detectives would be given the same authority as federal immigration agents and work with them to detain immigrants who are in the country illegally.",
      "Blakeman said police would check the immigration status of people charged with crimes and notify ICE if they are there illegally.

      "North Carolina trial judges have issued a mixed ruling for Democratic Gov. Josh Stein and Republican legislative leaders in litigation over recent law changes that eroded gubernatorial powers",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina trial judges issued a mixed ruling Tuesday for Democratic Gov. Josh Stein and Republican legislative leaders in Stein's litigation over recent law changes that eroded the governor\u2019s powers to appoint members to state boards and to fill appeals court vacancies.",
      "A three-judge panel unanimously sided with Stein and struck down as unconstitutional a portion of a law that placed some limits on whom the governor could choose to fill vacancies on the seven-member state Supreme Court and 15-member intermediate-level Court of Appeals.",
      "But the Superior Court judges let stand a pair of provisions that take away some of Stein\u2019s appointments to the state Utilities Commission and Building Code Council.",
      "In a brief order issued after two hours of arguments earlier in the day, Superior Court Judges James Ammons, Graham Shirley and Imelda Pate wrote that Stein \u201cfailed to demonstrate, beyond reasonable doubt,\u201d that the alterations involving the two state boards were unconstitutional.",
      "The order, which can be appealed, is the latest result from lawsuits that Stein or his fellow Democrat and predecessor Roy Cooper filed in recent years to attempt to counter measures approved by the Republican-controlled legislature that they say weaken gubernatorial control and the separation of powers between government branches. Several lawsuits have focused on the State Board of Elections.",
      "The state constitution says the governor fills appellate court vacancies. Appointees must be licensed to practice law in North Carolina.",
      "But the law approved last December directed the governor to fill such a vacancy from a list of three people offered by the political party with which the departing judge or justice was affiliated when elected. That limitation wouldn\u2019t apply if the court judge was unaffiliated at the time, or if the party didn\u2019t provide the list quickly.",
      "Stein attorney Daniel Smith told the judges that legal scholars \u2014 among them the current chief justice \u2014 have said the governor has an \u201cunfettered power of appointment\u201d for these vacancies, which fill positions until the next statewide election.",
      "Shirley pushed back on arguments by Noah Huffstetler \u2014 an attorney for House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger \u2014 that since the constitution doesn\u2019t specifically forbid conditions on these appointments, the legislature can act to add some.",
      "The panel declined to block the latest changes to the Utilities Commission, which regulates electricity, natural gas and other public utilities. Beginning next month, the commission will decrease to five members.",
      "Without the December law, the retooled commission would be composed of three members appointed by the governor and two by the General Assembly. But the challenged law gave one of the governor\u2019s three appointments to the elected state treasurer, currently Republican Brad Briner. His nominee is set to take his post in July.",
      "Stein\u2019s attorneys argued that the change would dilute the governor\u2019s powers and prevent him from controlling the commission to make sure utilities regulations are enforced. But GOP leaders countered that they can assign duties to other statewide elected executive officials known as the Council of State.",
      "Briner, who joined the case to help defend the law, said Tuesday's decision affirms that \u201cthe governor does not have ultimate authority over other duly elected members of the Council of State to carry out their roles and responsibilities as members of the executive branch.\u201d",
      "The panel also let stand General Assembly changes to the Building Code Council, whose members have been appointed solely by the governor.",
      "Under the new law, the governor still would appoint seven of the 13 members, with legislative leaders choosing six. Stein\u2019s lawyers say he\u2019ll lack sufficient control over the revised board because code changes and other action couldn\u2019t be approved unless nine members agree.",
      "Stein's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Pate is a registered Democrat, while Ammons is unaffiliated. Shirley ran unsuccessfully for another court term in 2024 as a Republican. He became a special Superior Court judge this year.",
      "Just last week another three-judge panel dismissed a lawsuit filed by Stein that challenged another law from December directing that current State Highway Patrol Col. Freddy Johnson remain patrol commander until 2030.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A Washington state man who was charged with aiding the bomber of a fertility clinic in Southern California died Tuesday in federal custody, just weeks after his arrest, prison officials said.",
      "Daniel Park, 32, was accused of supplying chemicals to Guy Edward Bartkus of California, the bomber, who died in the May 17 explosion.",
      "Park, of suburban Seattle, was found unresponsive at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles Tuesday morning and was pronounced dead at a hospital, the Bureau of Prisons said in a statement. No cause of death was provided.",
      "The two men connected in fringe online forums over their shared beliefs against human procreation, investigators said. The blast gutted the clinic in Palm Springs, east of Los Angeles, and shattered the windows of nearby buildings, with officials calling the attack terrorism. The facility was closed, and no embryos were damaged.",
      "Park shipped 180 pounds (about 82 kilograms) of ammonium nitrate to Bartkus in January and bought another 90 pounds (about 41 kilograms) and had it shipped to him days before the explosion, investigators said. Park purchased ammonium nitrate online in several transactions between October 2022 and May 2025, according to a federal complaint.",
      "Authorities said Park traveled to Twentynine Palms, California, near Palm Springs, to experiment with explosives in Bartkus\u2019 garage months before the attack.",
      "Three days before Park visited him in January, Bartkus asked an AI chat application about explosives, detonation velocity, diesel and gasoline mixtures, the complaint said. The discussion centered on how to create the most powerful blast.",
      "Park was taken into custody at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport on June 3, after he was extradited from Poland, where he fled four days after the attack. Park had been charged with providing and attempting to provide material support to terrorists. He had been at Metropolitan Detention Center since June 13, federal prison officials said.",
      "The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California, which is prosecuting the case, referred questions about Park\u2019s death to the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "Park and Bartkus bonded over a \u201cshared belief that people shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d Akil Davis, the FBI\u2019s assistant director in charge, said earlier this month.",
      "They believed in anti-natalism, a fringe theory that opposes childbirth and population growth and contends that people should not continue to procreate. Officials said Bartkus intentionally targeted the American Reproductive Centers, a clinic that provides services to help people get pregnant, including in vitro fertilization and fertility evaluations.",
      "Park appeared to be a frequent poster in an anti-natalist Reddit forum going back nearly a decade, according to court papers. In 2016, he spoke of recruiting others to the movement, which he described as hopeful.",
      "According to court papers, he wrote: \u201cWhen people are lost and distraught, death is always an option.\u201d",
      "Relatives told federal investigators that Park had made \u201cpro-mortalist\u201d statements since high school, according to the complaint.",
      "More recently, in March, he posted in the forum to say he was seeking to find fellow anti-natalists in and around Washington state to \u201cstart some protests or just any in-person events,\u201d according to court papers. The post did not receive any public comments.",
      "The Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles is also used to detain people arrested for immigration violations. It's been the site of many recent protests over President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, and Trump has deployed the National Guard to stand guard outside the facility.",

      "SEATTLE -- Authorities who have spent the past three weeks searching in the mountains of Washington state for an ex-soldier wanted in the deaths of his three young daughters say there is no evidence that he remains in the area or that he is alive at all.",
      "Travis Decker, 32, has been wanted since June 2, when a sheriff\u2019s deputy found his truck and the bodies of his three daughters \u2014 9-year-old Paityn Decker, 8-year-old Evelyn Decker and 5-year-old Olivia Decker \u2014 at a campground outside Leavenworth. The discovery came three days after he failed to return the girls to their mother\u2019s home in Wenatchee, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Seattle, following a scheduled visit.",
      "\u201cThere is no certain evidence that Decker remains alive or in this area,\u201d the Kittitas County Sheriff's Office said in a social media post Monday. \u201cSeemingly strong early leads gave way to less convincing proofs over the last two weeks of searching. Still, we can\u2019t and won\u2019t quit this search; Paityn, Evelyn, and Olivia Decker deserve justice. And Decker remains a danger to the public as long as he\u2019s at large.\u201d",
      "The post said resources were being shifted to focus on finding Decker's remains \u201cif he died in the rugged wilderness during this intense search \u2014 a possibility that increases every day.\u201d Sheriff's Inspector Chris Whitsett said Tuesday that includes the use of dogs trained to find human remains.",
      "\u201cBecause of the ruggedness, the remoteness of the of that country, and some of the conditions that we\u2019ve observed, it\u2019s clear that the longer he stays out there \u2014 the longer anybody stays out there \u2014 the greater the chance that something\u2019s gonna happen, and whether he intends it or not, that he\u2019s gonna die,\u201d Whitsett said.",
      "The U.S. Marshals Service is working to track down Decker if he managed to escape the region, the sheriff's office said, and extra patrols have been on duty. The killings occurred in neighboring Chelan County, but backcountry trails link the area to Kittitas and to the Pacific Crest Trail, which runs from Canada to Mexico.",
      "It would not be unprecedented for Decker to evade a search in the rugged, remote region for three weeks; the area is dotted with abandoned buildings as well as unoccupied vacation homes in which he might find shelter, as well as caves and former mines.",
      "In 2020, Jorge Alacantara-Gonzalez, who was wanted in the killing of a turkey hunter, spent 23 days on the run in much of the same terrain. He was finally caught when someone called police to report seeing someone in a cabin that should have been unoccupied.",
      "Authorities looking for Decker say they are similarly relying on tips from the public to help find him. They have asked people to be alert in the backcountry and to check surveillance or game cameras on their properties.",
      "Earlier this month, hikers in a popular Cascade Range backpacking area called The Enchantments reported seeing a lone person who appeared to be ill-prepared for the conditions and seemed to be avoiding others. A helicopter crew responded and spotted an off-trail hiker near an alpine lake.",
      "The person ran from sight as the helicopter passed, the Chelan County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. Authorities later found a trail, and K-9 teams tracked the person to the area of the Ingalls Creek Trailhead, south of Leavenworth, before the trail went cold.",
      "\u201cWe still believe public awareness and help is our best tool \u2014 whether it comes from a cabin owner who finds something out of place, a hiker in the Enchantments who discovers evidence our searches missed, or anyone else,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said.",
      "Decker was an infantryman in the Army from March 2013 to July 2021 and deployed to Afghanistan for four months in 2014. He has training in navigation, survival and other skills, authorities have said, and he once spent more than two months living in the backwoods off the grid.",
      "Last September, Decker\u2019s ex-wife, Whitney Decker, wrote in a petition to modify their parenting plan that his mental health issues had worsened and that he had become increasingly unstable. He was often living out of his truck, and she sought to restrict him from having overnight visits with their daughters until he found housing.",
      "An autopsy determined the girls\u2019 cause of death to be suffocation. They had been bound with zip ties and had plastic bags placed over their heads.",

      "BOSTON -- Attorneys general from more than 20 states and Washington, D.C. filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday challenging billions of dollars in funding cuts made by the Trump administration that would fund everything from crime prevention to food security to scientific research.",
      "The lawsuit filed in Boston is asking a judge to limit the Trump administration from relying on an obscure clause in the federal regulation to cut grants that don\u2019t align with its priorities. Since January, the lawsuit argues that the administration has used that clause to cancel entire programs and thousands of grants that had been previously awarded to states and grantees.",
      "\u201cDefendants\u2019 decision to invoke the Clause to terminate grants based on changed agency priorities is unlawful several times over,\u201d the plaintiffs argued. \u201cThe rulemaking history of the Clause makes plain that the (Office of Management and Budget) intended for the Clause to permit terminations in only limited circumstances and provides no support for a broad power to terminate grants on a whim based on newly identified agency priorities.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit argues the Trump administration has used the clause for the basis of a \u201cslash-and-burn campaign\u201d to cut federal grants.",
      "\u201cDefendants have terminated thousands of grant awards made to Plaintiffs, pulling the rug out from under the States, and taking away critical federal funding on which States and their residents rely for essential programs,\u201d the lawsuit added.",
      "The White House's Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to a request made Tuesday afternoon for comment.",
      "Rhode Island Attorney General Neronha said this lawsuit was just one of several the coalition of mostly Democratic states have filed over funding cuts. For the most part, they have largely succeeded in a string of legal victories to temporarily halt cuts.",
      "This one, though, may be the broadest challenge to those funding cuts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that this President has gone to great lengths to intercept federal funding to the states, but what may be lesser known is how the Trump Administration is attempting to justify their unlawful actions,\u201d Neronha said in a statement. \u201cNearly every lawsuit this coalition of Democratic attorneys general has filed against the Administration is related to its unlawful and flagrant attempts to rob Americans of basic programs and services upon which they rely. Most often, this comes in the form of illegal federal funding cuts, which the Administration attempts to justify via a so-called \u2018agency priorities clause.\"",
      "Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said the lawsuit aimed to stop funding cuts he described as indiscriminate and illegal.",
      "\u201cThere is no \u2018because I don\u2019t like you\u2019 or \u2018because I don\u2019t feel like it anymore\u2019 defunding clause in federal law that allows the President to bypass Congress on a whim,\" Tong said in a statement. \u201cSince his first minutes in office, Trump has unilaterally defunded our police, our schools, our healthcare, and more. He can\u2019t do that, and that\u2019s why over and over again we have blocked him in court and won back our funding.\u201d",
      "In Massachusetts, Attorney General Andrea Campbell said the U.S. Department of Agriculture terminated a $11 million agreement with the state Department of Agricultural Resources connecting hundreds of farmers to hundreds of food distribution sites while the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency terminated a $1 million grant to the state Department of Public Health to reduce asthma triggers in low-income communities.",
      "\u201cWe cannot stand idly by while this President continues to launch unprecedented, unlawful attacks on Massachusetts\u2019 residents, institutions, and economy,\u201d Campbell said in a statement.",
      "The lawsuit argues that the OMB promulgated the use of the clause in question to justify the cuts. The clause in question, according to the lawsuit, refers to five words that say federal agents can terminate grants if the award \"no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration has claimed that five words in this Clause\u2014'no longer effectuates . . . agency priorities'\u2014provide federal agencies with virtually unfettered authority to withhold federal funding any time they no longer wish to support the programs for which Congress has appropriated funding,\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "The intensity of the thunderstorm surprised even forecasters, who had predicted rain but nothing like the squall that lashed the southern part of the lake around 3 p.m., said meteorologist Matthew Chyba with the National Weather Service office in Reno, Nevada. Winds topped 35 mph (56 kph) and waves swelled up more than 8 feet (2.5 meters).",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting it to be so strong,\u201d Chyba said Monday. He said temperatures in the area were far below normal for this time of year, which could have contributed to the unstable air mass.",

      "Florida officials are racing ahead with the construction of what they've dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d to help carry out President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda, working to build a compound of heavy-duty tents, trailers and temporary buildings similar to sites used during natural disasters.",
      "The construction of the facility in the remote and ecologically sensitive wetland about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of downtown Miami is alarming environmentalists, as well as human rights advocates who have slammed the plan as cruel and inhumane.",
      "State officials say the installation is critical to support the federal government's immigration crackdown, which has resulted in a record-high number of detentions, totaling more than 56,000 immigrants in June, the most since 2019.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Construction of the site in the dog days of summer is part of the state\u2019s plan to operationalize 5,000 immigration detention beds by early July, according to Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, a former chief of staff for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and a key architect of the state's aggressive immigration enforcement campaign.

      "A plan to sell more than 3,200 square miles of federal lands has been ruled out of Republicans\u2019 big tax and spending cut bill after the Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal by Senate Energy Chairman Mike Lee would violate the chamber\u2019s rules",
      "WASHINGTON -- A plan to sell more than 3,200 square miles of federal lands has been ruled out of Republicans\u2019 big tax and spending cut bill after the Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal by Senate Energy Chairman Mike Lee would violate the chamber\u2019s rules.",
      "Lee, a Utah Republican, has proposed selling millions of acres (8.300 square kilometers) of public lands in the West to states or other entities for use as housing or infrastructure. The plan would revive a longtime ambition of Western conservatives to cede lands to local control after a similar proposal failed in the House earlier this year.",
      "Lee's plan has revealed sharp disagreement among Republicans who support wholesale transfers of federal property to spur development and generate revenue, and other lawmakers \u2014 including GOP senators in Montana and Idaho \u2014 who are staunchly opposed.",
      "The proposal comes as the Trump administration said Monday it will move to rescind a 2001 rule that blocked logging on national forest lands. The so-called roadless rule has angered Republicans, especially in the West where forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.",
      "Democrats and environmental groups roundly oppose both plans as giveaways to private interests that will threaten clean water and wildlife and block recreation on public lands.",
      "\u201cDemocrats will not stand idly by while Republicans attempt to circumvent the rules of (budget) reconciliation in order to sell off public lands to fund tax breaks for billionaires,'' said Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee.",
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said her constituents want to be able to hike and hunt on public lands, as they have for generations all over the West. \"They don't want these lands to be luxury resorts or golf courses,'' she said at a news conference Tuesday.",
      "Lee, in a post on X Monday night, said he would keep trying.",
      "\u201cHousing prices are crushing families and keeping young Americans from living where they grew up. We need to change that,'' he wrote, adding that a revised plan would remove all U.S. Forest Service land from possible sale. Sales of sites controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management would be significantly reduced, Lee said, so that only land within 5 miles of population centers could be sold.",
      "Environmental advocates celebrated the ruling late Monday by Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough but cautioned that Lee's proposal was far from dead.",
      "\u201cThis is a victory for the American public, who were loud and clear: Public lands belong in public hands, for current and future generations alike,'' said Tracy Stone-Manning, president of The Wilderness Society. \u201cOur public lands are not for sale.\u201d",
      "Carrie Besnette Hauser, president and CEO of the nonprofit Trust for Public Land, called the procedural ruling in the Senate \u201can important victory in the fight to protect America\u2019s public lands from short-sighted proposals that would have undermined decades of bipartisan work to protect, steward and expand access to the places we all share.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut make no mistake: this threat is far from over,\u201d Hauser added. \u201cEfforts to dismantle our public lands continue, and we must remain vigilant as proposals now under consideration,\" including plans to roll back the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act and cut funding for land and water conservation, make their way through Congress, she said.",
      "MacDonough, the Senate parliamentarian, also ruled out a host of other Republican-led provisions Monday night, including construction of a mining road in Alaska and changes to speed permitting of oil and gas leases on federal lands.",
      "While the parliamentarian\u2019s rulings are advisory, they are rarely, if ever, ignored. Lawmakers are using a budget reconciliation process to bypass the Senate filibuster to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s tax-cut package by a self-imposed July 4 deadline.",
      "Under Lee's plan, land in 11 Western states from Alaska to New Mexico would be eligible for sale. Montana was carved out of the proposal after lawmakers there objected. In states such as Utah and Nevada, the government controls the vast majority of lands, protecting them from potential exploitation but hindering growth.",
      "\"Washington has proven time and again it can\u2019t manage this land. This bill puts it in better hands,\u201d Lee said in announcing the plan earlier this month.",
      "The proposal received a mixed reception Monday from the governors of Western states. Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham called it problematic in her state because of the close relationship residents have with public lands.",
      "Republican Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon voiced qualified support. \u201cOn a piece-by-piece basis ... we can actually allow for some responsible growth in areas with communities that are landlocked at this point,\u201d he said at a meeting of the Western Governors\u2019 Association in Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "Housing advocates have cautioned that federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing. Some of the parcels up for sale in Utah and Nevada under a House proposal were many miles from developed areas.",
      "New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the energy committee, said Lee's plan would exclude Americans from places where they fish, hunt and camp.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s clear that we would even get substantial housing as a result of this,\u201d Heinrich said earlier this month. \u201cWhat I know would happen is people would lose access to places they know and care about and that drive our Western economies.\u201d",

      "The temperature in New York City has reached 100 degrees as the eastern U.S. sweltered under an extreme heat wave",
      "NEW YORK -- Extensive triple digit heat, broken temperature records and oppressive humidity piled up into a steaming mess as the heat dome crushing the Eastern half of the nation sizzled to what should be its worst Tuesday.",
      "New York City\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) a little after noon, the first time since 2013. Then Baltimore, Philadelphia and Boston joined the 100 club. More than 150 million people woke up to heat warnings and forecasters at the National Weather Service expected dozens of places to tie or set new daily high temperature records Tuesday. The dangerous heat sent people to the hospital, delayed Amtrak trains and caused utilities to urge customers to conserve power.",
      "\u201cEvery East Coast state today from Maine to Florida has a chance of 100 degree actual temperature,\u201d said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist.",
      "Fryeburg, Maine, also hit 100, for the first time since 2011.",
      "\u201cGetting Maine to 100 degrees is infrequent,\u201d Maue said.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s heat came on top of 39 new or tied heat records Monday. But just as dangerous as triple digit heat is the lack of cooling at night, driven by the humidity.",
      "\u201cYou get the combination of the extreme heat and humidity but no relief,\u201d said Jacob Asherman, a meteorologist at NOAA\u2019s Weather Prediction Center. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of been just everything stacked on top of itself.... It just speaks to how strong this heat wave is. This is a pretty, pretty extreme event.\u201d",
      "Asherman and Maue said Tuesday is the peak of the high pressure system that sits on top of the Mid-Atlantic and keeps the heat and humidity turned up several notches.",
      "\u201cNobody is immune to the heat,\u201d said Kimberly McMahon, the weather service public services program manager who specializes in heat and health.",
      "Dozens attending outdoor high school graduation ceremonies in a northern New Jersey city on Monday were treated for heat exhaustion and related problems, including 16 taken to hospitals. The Paterson school district held ceremonies in the morning and the afternoon as temperatures soared to nearly 100 degrees. Officials halted the second ceremony about an hour after it had started due to the heat.",
      "And in New Hampshire, two 16-year-old hikers were rescued from a mountain in Jaffrey late Monday afternoon, overcome by the heat, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said. They were described as being in and out of consciousness and taken to a hospital.",
      "The heat hit New York City as residents headed to the polls for the city\u2019s primary election. In Queens, Rekha Malhotra was handing out flyers in support of Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani while wearing a pink electric fan around their neck.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 90 bazillian degrees and here I am,\u201d said Malhotra. \u201cI could have been phone banking.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have all the things \u2014 hat, ice and this,\u201d Malhotra added, clutching a commercial-grade spray bottle.",
      "Utilities across the Midwest and East braced for the surge of extra demand in the heat, at times asking people to cut back on air conditioning when it felt like it was needed the most. In Memphis, Tennessee, residents were asked to turn off unnecessary lights and electronics, wait until nighttime to use dishwashers, washing machines dryers, and raise thermostats a few degrees, if health allows.",
      "The heat and humidity during the day was compounded by humid nights where the temperatures don\u2019t drop much and the human body and the electric bill don\u2019t get a break to recover, said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central.",
      "\u201cThe longer the heat lasts, the more it wears on the body, the more it wears on the health,\u201d Woods Placky said.",
      "A good rule of thumb is the temperature has to get at least as low as 75 degrees, if not lower, for people to recover, McMahon said. That\u2019s a lesson from the Pacific Northwest heat wave of 2021, when many of the deaths were older people who lived at home and died at night because it wasn\u2019t getting cool enough, she said.",
      "\u201cUnlike other weather hazards, heat does have that compounding effect on the human body. Your body tolerates less and less heat as the days go on,\u201d McMahon said.",
      "Because warmer air from human-caused climate change holds more moisture, making it more humid, summer nights are actually heating up faster than summer days, Woods Placky said. That\u2019s why the Dust Bowl of the 1930s hit high temperatures similar to now, but it wasn\u2019t as warm overall because the nights cooled, she said.",
      "The United States daytime summer high temperature has increased 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1975, but the nighttime lowest temperature is now on average 2.6 degrees higher, according to NOAA data. In Baltimore, summer nights have warmed 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1975, while summer days only 1.5 degrees, the data showed.",
      "Marc Savenor, who owns Acme Ice and Dry Ice Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, struggled to keep up with phones ringing as the heat wave overwhelmed ice machines and refrigerators, forcing customers to seek emergency supplies.",
      "\u201cDuring the heat waves, my phone will ring at 3 in the morning till 11 at night,\u201d Savenor said as workers shoveled dry ice into pellets. \u201cThere\u2019s no help for the weary here, because you\u2019ve got to get it when it\u2019s coming in and everybody wants some.\u201d",
      "Air conditioners and fans have been flying off the shelves at Khan Electronics in Queens, owner Mudassar Khan said.",
      "\u201cIt started getting hot at night. People buy air conditioners when they feel uncomfortable at night,\u201d Khan said.",
      "\u201cRelief is coming,\u201d Maue said, predicting that on Friday, New York City probably won't even get into the 70s. \u201cIt'll feel incredible.\u201d",

He said the mismanagement has caused significant hardship for grieving families, who often experience yearslong delays in processing and approving claims.",
      "\u201cThis is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d he wrote in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, in which he suggested she consider replacing longtime program leader Hope Janke.",
      "Grassley's letter comes days after The Associated Press published an investigation detailing the claims backlog at the program, which provides a nearly $450,000 one-time payment to the families of deceased and disabled officers and firefighters in addition to education benefits.",
      "The AP found dozens of families are waiting five years or more to learn whether they qualify for the life-changing payments, and more are being denied. As of late April, nearly 900 claims had been pending for more than one year, more than triple the number from five years ago, with a small number languishing for a decade.",
      "Grassley cited a Government Accountability Office report issued last year that detailed deficiencies in the program's management dating back to 2009. He said the program had failed to make changes recommended by outside reviewers but that \u201cgovernment bureaucrats\u201d such as Janke have never been held accountable.",
      "Janke has not responded to AP emails seeking comment, including one Tuesday. A request for comment to the DOJ wasn't immediately returned.",
      "DOJ officials said earlier this year that they are adopting several recommendations from the GAO, including improvements to make the program's electronic claims management system more user-friendly. They say they are responding to a surge of claims after Congress has made more categories of deaths and injuries eligible for benefits.",
      "Grassley demanded the DOJ provide updates and documents within two weeks related to the status of those changes.",
      "Texas widow Lisa Afolayan, who is still fighting the program for benefits 16 years after her husband died while training for the Border Patrol, welcomed Grassley's oversight of the program.",
      "\u201cWe need movement. We need change and not only for my family,\u201d she said. \u201cThey've lost sight of why the program was started.\u201d",

      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech\u00a0on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",

      "The song gained momentum again after the pair made a surprise appearance in Ariana Grande's \"The Boy is Mine\" music video last year, sparking viral interest and earning them a Grammy nomination for their remix collaboration more than 25 years after winning their first Grammy for the original song.",

    "summary": "His mother is a member of the Kennedy clan; his father was the Terminator. Now, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger, a standout in the HBO Max series \"The White Lotus,\" talks about how he chose to pursue a career while carrying the weight of a famous Hollywood name.",
    "story": [
      "\"Every time I'm out in, like, nature, that's kind of where I like to do my prayers or gratitude list,\" said Patrick Schwarzenegger. These days he is counting his blessings, even though the role he was recently blessed with is anything but reverent. He plays the much-talked-about (and much-hated) Saxon Ratliff, the eldest son of a wealthy family visiting Thailand, in the latest incarnation of HBO's \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "Saxon is a chiseled car crash \u2013 a sex-obsessed, protein shake-chugging bro who is so irredeemably into his own masculinity, he offends even his own sister. How do you even audition for a part like that?",
      "Schwarzenegger says he was only given a short sentence describing Saxon's excitable personality: \"The wording was that ''He flirted with anything.' So, I just took the first few seconds and just kind of, you know, stared at the camera in a loving way.\"",
      "Did he have any reservations? \"Yes, I was worried,\" he said. \"I didn't want him to come off as just this one-note character.\"",
      "And early on he didn't even know yet just how sexually awkward things were going to get. \"When I was auditioning, they had said, 'Are you okay with, know, performing things sexually? Are you okay being nude at times?'\" Schwarzenegger recalled. \"So, I knew an idea of where it could go. I didn't know to what extent the show would go.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for Season 3 of \"The White Lotus,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The series' creator, Mike White, has spent three seasons pushing the envelope, writing exotic whodunits that, along the way, skewer the rich and privileged vacationing at White Lotus resorts all around the world \u2013 a world he knew Patrick probably understood. Schwarzenegger said, \"There was a joke because he was always like, 'You don't look like you're rich. You're not walking rich. Aren't you a Schwarzenegger? Aren't you a Kennedy? Aren't you rich in real life? You don't look like you're rich at all!'\"",
      "The show's first season, set in Hawaii, debuted during the pandemic in 2021, and it hit Schwarzenegger and his family head-on. \"It was me, Abby, my fianc\u00e9e, and my mom,\" he said. \"We lived together, us three, during the pandemic. So, you can imagine how fun that was! And then they were always like, 'You need to be in the show, you need to audition, this is perfect.'\"",
      "His fianc\u00e9e is fashion model Abby Champion; his mom is journalist and member of the Kennedy clan Maria Shriver; and his dad, well, that goes without saying.",
      "Arnold Schwarzenegger has said that he didn't recognize his son in the role. \"It would be a little bit alarming if he did recognize a lot of those characteristics!\" Patrick laughed.",
      "His best friends are his family.  They're also his greatest fans.  When he got the part, they were tears all around. Patrick Schwarzenegger has emerged from \"The White Lotus,\" as a standout among standouts \u2013 the kind of breakout he hopes will put to rest any suspicions about nepotism.",
      "In a recent father-and-son chat on Variety's \"Actors on Actors,\"\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger said, \"To me, the name Schwarzenegger always meant a big plus.\"",
      "Patrick revealed that he worried his name might get in the way: \"There were times earlier in my career where I was wondering, Does it makes sense to go under some sort of alias? Does it make sense to go under a different name?\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad that you kept the name, 'cause now I can take credit,\" Arnold said. \"My son! The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\"",
      "Patrick idolized his dad growing up, spending time on movie sets that became his playground. By the time he was 13, he was on his own sets, but he says he rarely brought up his dad. \"I mean, I always know that there's, you know, my last name, there's connections, there's, you know, things that are gonna help me, but I wanted to try to take a different path than that.\"",
      "He did, however, follow his dad's path on matters of money \u2013 how to run a business, how to create a brand. \"My dad put me in charge of his memorabilia when I was 10,\" said Patrick. \"And so, I would take these different photos of him, you know, at Muscle Beach, and we would frame them. I took a replica of the Conan swords and get him to sign them, and I would sell them for $10,000 a pop. It was all for nonprofit. I didn't make any money, but it was to understand how to sell.\"",
      "He actually majored in business as USC, starting college just about a year after his parents had left the California Governor's office. Politics has been in his genes, after all \u2013 and so has the idea of public service. His grandfather, Sargent Shriver, was the founding director of the Peace Corps. His grandmother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founded the Special Olympics.",
      "Asked if he's thought about going into politics himself, Patrick replied, \"I think it was instilled in us to find ways to give back at an early age. It doesn't have to be through public office, to find ways to give back.\"",
      "Through it all, his focus on acting remained pretty singular. He spent a decade in acting class, building a resume one part at a time, recently acting opposite Colin Firth in the HBO mini-series, \"The Staircase.\" That, he said, \"was the first time that the people in the industry were able to see me in a dramatic role. ... Before, people maybe didn't take me serious. They didn't know if I was really, you know, in it for the long haul, was I really working on my craft?\"",
      "WATCH: \"The White Lotus\" clip: Saxon and TimothyIn this scene, Saxon Ratliff (Patrick Schwarzenegger) demands to know from his dad, Timothy (Jason Isaacs)\u00a0 whether everything is OK at the office. [Spoiler alert: Everything is NOT OK at the office.]",
      "He hopes his next role will be a character with a few less character flaws than Saxon Ratliff. That said, Patrick Schwarzenegger would happily check back into the White Lotus anytime Mike White asks. \"I said, if you don't hire me again, I'll come and be the head of craft services,\" he said. \"I'll come and hire me as your scouting location guy because I just want to come in and be part of the journey.\"",

      "They came together 60 years ago in Venice, California: Jim Morrison, a poet in leather pants, backed by Ray Manzarek on keys, Robby Krieger on guitar, and John Densmore on drums.",
      "The Doors soon got their break, in May of '66, at London Fog, a tiny nightclub on the Sunset Strip. It's now a barber shop. \"Oh, I need a haircut,\" laughed Densmore on a recent return visit.",
      "The barber shop's owner, Chad Oringer, an avid Doors fan, asked for a photo with Densmore and Krieger, the band's last surviving members.",
      "The Doors were fired by London Fog, but quickly got another gig just a few doors down Sunset, at the Whisky a Go Go. Playing there, said Krieger, was \"the biggest deal in town.\"",
      "\"It was Mecca,\" Densmore added.",
      "The room isn't much different from what it was back then. \"The stage is lower,\" Densmore said. People would dance in front of the stage. \"And they would just all be down there writhing around. Very inspirational!\" he laughed.",
      "He described the improvisational attitude of the band: \"Ray handed me a crumpled piece of paper and it said, 'Day destroys the night. Night divides the day. Try to run. Try to hide \u2026 Break on through.'\"",
      "Morrison had never sung lead before, and Densmore wasn't sure about him at first: \"He was so shy, it was ridiculous. And I thought, 'This is not the next Mick Jagger! But I love playing music, so I'll fool around here.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Why did you have confidence the band would work if he was so inexperienced as a singer?\"",
      "\"It was the words,\" Krieger said. \"They were so different than anything that was out there.\"",
      "\"Gifted,\" said Densmore. \"'Let's swim to the moon. Let's climb through the tide\u2026 ' A psychedelic love song. Wow!\"",
      "In 1967, Los Angeles DJ Dave Diamond began playing their records on his show, \"The Diamond Mine.\" Krieger said, \"And he would call us all the time and say, 'Hey, man. Every time I play 'Light My Fire,' people go nuts!'\"",
      "\"Light My Fire,\" written by Krieger, went to #1.",
      "But Morrison's troubles with alcohol and drugs were already apparent. Densmore said, \"At first I remember we talked about, 'Oh, he's an Irish drunk. He'll live forever. But deep down, maybe he's just a shooting star that'll be a quick impact.'\"",
      "\"You knew that right away?\" I asked.",
      "\"Kinda sensed it.\"",
      "\"Was that hard to accept?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" Densmore said. \"I mean, we miss his artistry like crazy. We don't miss his self-destruction.\"",
      "After Morrison's sudden death in Paris in 1971 at age 27, Densmore and Krieger didn't always agree with Manzarek about the band's legacy. \"At times, I felt he was selling The Doors too much. It's for the critics to do that,\" Densmore said.",
      "Krieger said, \"He would try to spread the rumor Jim's not really dead.\"",
      "Why? \"He loved the mythology,\" Densmore replied.",

      "The band's 60th anniversary is celebrated in a new book \"Night Divides the Day.\"",

      "Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background.",
      "Where and when is the wedding?",
      "Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony scheduled to take place Saturday at an undisclosed location.",
      "The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019. Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019.",
      "The wedding ceremony is likely to be held on San Giorgio Maggiore,\u00a0according to CNN. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s.",
      "A protest group called \"No Space for Bezos\" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century\u00a0Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported.",
      "How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost?",
      "The three-day event could cost between about $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail.",
      "About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking.",
      "Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion)",
      "Who is attending?",
      "Bezos and Sanchez invited about 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports. The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests said to include\u00a0Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump.",
      "According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport.",
      "Who is Lauren Sanchez?",
      "Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023.",
      "Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight, which included \"CBS Mornings\" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the\u00a0idea for a female-led flight to Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021.",
      "Sanchez's bachelorette party in Paris last month included Perry, Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Eva Longoria, according to AFP.",
      "What are the wedding protests about?",
      "Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs.",
      "This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protestors gathered in Venice\u00a0and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates.",
      "Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the \"No Space for Bezos\" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups.",
      "Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: \"IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX.\" Local police folded up the banner and took it away.",
      "Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated. In March, the city issued a statement denying reports that there would be any major disruption to daily Venetian life, even with hundreds expected to descend on the city this week for the wedding.",
      "Venice and the surrounding metropolitan area has a population of roughly 250,000, according to Statista. But fewer than 50,000 people live in the city's historic district, which is composed over 100 islands connected by Venice's famous canals and footbridges.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 11:36:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is testifying before Congress this week, said tariffs are \"likely to push up prices.\"",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his view that the central bank should keep interest rates steady for now, citing inflation risks from U.S. tariffs.",
      "Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony\u00a0Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump\u00a0to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December.",
      "In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation \"could be short lived\" or \"could instead be more persistent.\" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates.\u00a0But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said in the testimony.",
      "He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become \"an ongoing inflation problem.\"",
      "Powell is \"unbending under pressure,\" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. \"Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations.\"",
      "Fed officials push for cut",
      "Two Fed officials \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller \u2014 have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30.",
      "On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise.",
      "\"It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,\" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. \"Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting.\"",
      "Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize.",
      "\"The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,\" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, \"We will get to a place where we cut rates.\"",
      "At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows.",
      "\"Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note. \"The most likely next date for a cut is 9/17 or 10/29.\"",

      "A poll by Bankrate found that nearly half of respondents think they need to early at least $100,00 a year to live comfortably, while a quarter said they need to make at least $150,000. To feel rich, over half said they would need annual income of at least $200,000, while 25% put the figure at $1 million, according to the personal finance firm.",
      "Bankrate researchers polled 2,260 adults across the U.S. for the survey which measures Americans' attitudes toward financial security. The upshot: Many people are increasingly unsure of whether they'll be able to get a leg up in today's economy. The share of Americans who describe themselves as not financially secure reached 77% this year, up from 75% in 2024 and 72% in 2023, according to Bankrate.",
      "\"Times have shifted,\" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster said in the analysis. \"Getting rich may have once been what many Americans fantasized about, but now simply living comfortably feels like the new aspiration, as economic challenges make financial stability a rare luxury.\"",
      "As of 2023 (the most recent data available), median U.S. income in the U.S. was just over $60,000 for a full-time worker, according to Census figures. If there's a silver lining, it's that average wage growth continues to surpass inflation, which has been on a downward trend since a pandemic-induced peak in 2022. The Consumer Price Index in May rose 2.4%, up just slightly from April's 2.3% rate.",
      "According to Bankrate's findings, Gen Xers (ages 45 to 60) were the most likely generation, at 84%, to say they're not where they want to be financially. Gen X also reported needing the highest income to feel financially comfortable, with 35% saying they need to make $150,000 or more.",
      "By comparison, 80% of Gen Z (ages 18 to 28) respondents to the survey said they don't feel financially secure.",
      "Women and men also differed in their views on financial security. Bankrate's findings reflect that women feel less confident about their financial position than men. More than 1 in 3 (35%) said they aren't financially secure and never will be, according to the survey.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roadless-rule-national-forests-logging-reversal/",
    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 07:46:50 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration plans to rescind the \"roadless rule\" that impedes logging on 59 million acres of national forests, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins says.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday.",
      "The \"roadless rule\" adopted in the last days of Bill Clinton's presidency in 2001 long has chafed Republican lawmakers, especially in the West where national forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.",
      "The rule impeded road construction and \"responsible timber production\" that would have helped reduce the risk of major wildfires, Rollins said at the annual meeting of the Western Governors Association.",
      "\"This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation's forests,\" Rollins said.",
      "Scientists say worsening wildfires are driven by a combination of climate change that warms and dries out forests, less logging and decades of fire suppression that has enabled fuels to build up.",
      "The roadless rule has affected 30% of national forest lands nationwide, or about 59 million acres, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency over the Forest Service.",
      "State roadless-area rules in Idaho and Colorado supersede the boundaries of the 2001 roadless rule, according to the USDA, meaning not all national forest land would be affected by a rescission.",
      "Rollins' announcement Monday was a first step in a process to rescind the roadless rule to be followed by a formal notice in coming weeks, the Agriculture Department said in a statement.",
      "The announcement comes amid recent talk of selling off federal lands in part to improve housing affordability, an idea criticized by Democrats as a public land grab.",
      "Selling public lands drew a mixed reception from governors at the same meeting. They expressed enthusiasm for economic development and worries about curtailing public access to shared lands.",
      "Speaking to a panel of governors and hotel-ballroom audience, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described a new \"era of abundance\" on public lands under President Trump's administration in the development of natural resources, including energy and critical minerals needed for domestic production of cellphones, computers and vehicles.",
      "Immediate opposition appears",
      "Outside the hotel entrance in downtown Santa Fe, several hundred protesters filled the street to denounce efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting \"not for sale\" and carrying signs that read, \"This land belongs to you and me\" and \"keep our public land free for future generations.\"",
      "On social media, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally, called the reversal on roadless areas \"another example of President Trump fulfilling his campaign promise to open up resources for responsible development.\"",
      "The roadless area change meanwhile marks a sharp turnaround from the Biden administration, which far from opening up more areas to timber harvesting sought to do more to restrict logging and protect old-growth forests.",
      "Environmental groups, who want to keep restrictions on logging and road-building for places such as Alaska's Tongass National Forest, criticized the possibility of rolling back the protections.",
      "\"Any attempt to revoke it is an attack on the air and water we breathe and drink, abundant recreational opportunities which millions of people enjoy each year, havens for wildlife and critical buffers for communities threatened by increasingly severe wildfire seasons,\" Josh Hicks, conservation campaigns director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement on the USDA's plans.",
      "Contrary to what Rollins said about reducing wildfire risk, logging exacerbates climate change and makes wildfires more intense, said Center for Western Priorities political director Rachael Hamby.",
      "\"This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us,\" Hamby said in a statement.",
      "In Alaska, home of the country's largest national forest, the Tongass, the roadless rule has long been a focus of litigation, with state political leaders supporting an exemption to the rule that they argue impedes economic opportunities.",
      "During the latter part of Mr. Trump's first term, the federal government lifted restrictions on logging and road-building in the Tongass, something the Biden administration later reversed.",
      "Mr. Trump in January called for reverting to the policy from his first term as part of an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at boosting oil and gas development, mining and logging in the state.",
      "The Tongass is a temperate rainforest of glaciers and rugged coastal islands. It provides habitat to wildlife such as bears, wolves, salmon and bald eagles.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 06:46:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Global crude prices jumped on Sunday but have since retreated. Here's what experts say about the outlook for oil and gas.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on supplies of oil and gas, including whether the widening conflict could result in higher energy prices for Americans.",
      "The price of the West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, jumped 4% on Sunday night shortly after the start of trading, but fell more than 7% on Monday afternoon. The decline came as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial waterway that the country partly controls and that is strategically vital for the flow of crude into global markets.",
      "Iran's parliament on Sunday approved cutting off the Strait, leaving the final decision to the country's national security council. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran announced by President Trump early Tuesday appeared to falter within a couple hours.",
      "The geopolitical crisis is sparking concerns that worsening hostilities could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would likely drive up gas and other energy costs, as well for other products refined from crude. Iran said Monday that it launched an attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.",
      "Iran, a major producer of crude, controls the northern side of the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by ships carrying roughly 20% of the world's daily supply of oil.",
      "\"In practice, Iranian efforts to 'close' the Strait could encompass a number of actions including attacking and detaining ships using the waterway, impeding navigability through the strait and, at the most extreme, laying mines in the sea,\" noted David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a report.",
      "But, he added, \"[S]o long as the conflict does not become a long-lasting war with no 'off ramp,' and disruption in the Strait remains limited to the lower-level actions seen up to now, we suspect that any initial spikes in global energy prices would dissipate before long.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Iran conflict's potential impact on oil and gas prices.",
      "What's the impact so far on oil prices?",
      "After surging in early trading on Monday, prices of Brent crude, the international standard, dipped 0.1% to $76.98 by midday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the U.S. benchmark, fell 3.8% to $71.06.",
      "Still, oil prices remain above their level before the hostilities between Israel and Iran began over a week ago, when a barrel of WTI crude was close to $68.",
      "Although Wall Street experts predict that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, they note that ongoing tensions in the region could disrupt the energy market and send prices soaring.",
      "\"Perhaps a bigger risk to the region's oil supply would be Israeli air strikes on Iran's oil production and export facilities, and/or attacks by Iranian proxy groups on oil production and export facilities in Iraq,\" Eurasia Group analysts said in a June 23 report.",
      "Israel so far has avoided targeting Iran's oil export industry. But if it were to do so, such strikes could disrupt the flow of several million barrels per day, sending Brent crude prices above $80 per barrel, according to the political risk consultancy.",
      "What would happen if the Strait of Hormuz is closed?",
      "Because the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, it's vulnerable to disruption. The channel connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.",
      "Although energy experts believe a closure of the Strait is unlikely, noting the adverse economic and geopolitical impact on Iran, they underline that a disruption to the flow of oil through the passage would send energy prices soaring.",
      "Interruptions to oil passing through the channel would severely impact markets in China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "The U.S. imports only about 7% of its oil through the Strait of Hormuz. But any interference with shipments passing through the area could impact the global oil market by stifling supplies, according to experts.",
      "\"[W]hile Iran has not yet targeted the route, even a limited disruption would severely impact global supply,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a June 20 client note. \"In a worst-case scenario, prices could spike to $130 per barrel and shave 0.8 percentage points off global GDP.\"",
      "The last time Brent crude topped $130 was in 2008, the result of a spike in energy demand and uncertainty in world energy supplies, according to the EIA. At the time, gasoline prices peaked at about $4.11 per gallon, or about $6.26 per gallon today after adjusting for inflation.",
      "What's the forecast for U.S. gas prices?",
      "American drivers are likely to see higher gas prices at the pump over the next week, with prices jumping between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon, GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan said.",
      "\"Most/all of the recent and expected rise is due to the Middle East tensions/situation,\" he said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even with that increase, U.S. drivers would still likely be paying less at the pump than they were a year ago. The average U.S. gas price now stands at $3.22 per gallon, down from $3.45 per gallon a year earlier, according to AAA.",

The airline operates only a single route into Miami International, offering one to two daily flights between the city and Boston's Logan International Airport, according to JetBlue spokesperson Derek Dombrowski. JetBlue serves over three dozen cities in the U.S., according to its route\u00a0map.",
      "For passengers heading to South Florida, JetBlue will continue to operate out of nearby Palm Beach International Airport and Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport. The latter, roughly 25 miles north of Miami, offered 70 daily flights to over 30 destinations as of April of this year.",
      "JetBlue will also suspend its year-round service between Boston and Seattle starting October 25, offering flights between the two cities solely during the summer season, according to Dombrowski.",
      "The shift in services align with changes outlined by JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty in an internal memo shared with CBS News last week. In it, Geraghty said the company would \"wind down underperforming routes\" as part of a larger effort to reduce costs amid softening demand for travel.",
      "\"We're hopeful demand and bookings will rebound, but even a recovery won't fully offset the ground we've lost this year, and our path back to profitability will take longer than we'd hoped,\" she said in the memo. \"That means we're still relying on borrowed cash to keep the airline running.\"",
      "The decision to terminate service at Miami International comes four years after JetBlue added the airport to its network. At its peak, the airline was operating as many as 14 daily flights to and from Miami International, according to the Miami Herald.",

      "Zillow's rule, announced by the company in April, took effect on May 28, with the company saying that the new standard is necessary to ensure that listings are \"marketed to every buyer\" to give house-hunters \"fair access to listings without having to get access behind a velvet rope controlled by any one company.\"",
      "But Compass, which seeks to give some clients a competitive advantage by posting homes before they appear on Zillow and other sites, is alleging that what it calls the \"Zillow ban\" violates federal antitrust laws. The real estate company claims that ZIllow is leveraging its market dominance to impose the block on listings outside of its website, and that it is aimed at hobbling competition, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"This lawsuit is about protecting consumer choice,\" Compass CEO Robert Reffkin said in a statement. \"No one company should have the power to ban agents or listings simply because they don't follow that company's business model.\"",
      "He added, \"That's not competition. It's coercion. Imagine if Amazon banned a seller for offering a product on their own website first. That's what Zillow is doing in real estate. Consumers should have the right to choose how they sell their homes.\"",
      "Compass said it has hired Ken Dintzer, a partner in the antitrust division of law firm Crowell & Moring who led the U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against Google, to represent it in the lawsuit.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, a Zillow spokesperson said Compass' claims \"are unfounded\" and that it will fight the lawsuit.",
      "The spokesperson added, \"At the heart of this issue is a simple principle: When a listing is publicly marketed, it should be accessible to all buyers \u2014 across all platforms, including Zillow. Hiding listings creates a fragmented market, limits consumer choice and creates barriers to homeownership, which is bad for buyers, sellers and the industry at large, especially in this inventory and affordability-constrained environment.\"",
      "Private exclusives",
      "With the lawsuit, Compass is defending its three-pronged marketing strategy for home listings that it says can better serve sellers. The first step in the strategy is a \"private exclusive\" listing that is available on Compass' internal platform, which allows its agents to share information about the home with possible buyers.",
      "The second step involves a \"coming soon\" listing on Compass's website, available to anyone who searches online for properties. The third element involves moving the listing to multiple listing services, or MLS, and onto aggregation sites like Zillow.",
      "\"For Zillow, every home buyer search conducted on Compass instead of Zillow is a lost opportunity for Zillow to lock that prospective home buyer into Zillow's ecosystem and make money selling her information to real estate agents for a lead fee \u2014 Zillow's central business model,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The complaint alleges that \"Zillow doesn't like the 3-phased marketing strategy because Zillow can't make money selling leads off listings in Phase 1 and Phase 2 where they don't have the listings.\"",
      "Compass, which has more than 33,000 real estate agents, said that almost half of all sellers who signed with them relied on its three-step listing strategy in the first quarter.",
      "\"In a free and competitive market, competitors' products and strategies should rise and fall on merit \u2014 not the whims of a monopolist gatekeeper like Zillow,\" Compass claims in the suit.",

    "story": [
      "UnitedHealthcare, Kaiser Permanente and other major U.S. health insurers say they want to make it faster and easier for patients to obtain care.",
      "Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), a trade association that represents the health insurance industry, announced Monday that some of its biggest members are taking steps to streamline \"prior authorization\" \u2014 industry jargon for the process by which health care providers obtain approval from patients' insurance carriers to deliver care.",
      "Prior authorization requests can be time-consuming for doctors, resulting in frustrating delays for patients in obtaining essential medical care. According to a survey from the American Medical Association, physicians' offices spend an average of 12 hours per week seeking approval for services from insurers, administrative hurdles that critics say take time away from providing care.",
      "As part of the new agreement, participating insurers have committed to a series of steps they say will speed up the sluggish process. That includes creating a standardized system for submitting prior authorization online, reducing the amount of claims subject to prior authorization and ramping up real-time responses to requests. Such changes are scheduled to take effect in 2026 and 2027.",
      "\"The health care system remains fragmented and burdened by outdated manual processes, resulting in frustration for patients and providers alike,\" AHIP CEO Mike Tuffin said in a statement. \"Health plans are making voluntary commitments to deliver a more seamless patient experience and enable providers to focus on patient care, while also helping to modernize the system.\"",
      "Shawn Martin, CEO of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said in a statement that the insurance industry initiative is a \"step in the right direction,\" but that the real test will be the impact it has on the experiences of patients and physicians.",
      "Dozens of insurers signed onto the commitment, including a number of state Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and some Medicare and Medicaid plans. In all, AHIP says the joint effort to improve prior authorization could benefit more than 250 million Americans.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-robotaxi-launch-austin-texas-elon-musk-june-22/",
    "published": "Sun, 22 Jun 2025 12:49:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Tesla is giving a select group of people the chance to try out its robotaxis this weekend in Austin, Texas.",
    "story": [
      "After years of teasing a new line of self-driving vehicles, billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk is finally making good on his promise with the rollout of Tesla's robotaxi service.",
      "When is the robotaxi event?",
      "On June 22, Tesla will give a select group of people the chance to ride in its Model Y Robotaxis \u00a0in Austin, Texas, where the EV maker moved its headquarters from California in 2021.",
      "Tesla did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's email seeking information about the launch. However, details shared on social media and past comments from Musk offer some clues as to what it will look like.",
      "Where will the robotaxi event take place?",
      "The pilot will likely involve a small number of cars and rides will take place in a \"geofenced area\" in Austin. In a CNBC interview in\u00a0May, Musk suggested there could be around 10 robotaxis in circulation during the pilot in Austin, and said Tesla would scale up the number from there.",
      "According to a note from Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives, there could be up to 20 Model Y cars circling around Austin on Sunday.",
      "It's unclear how many people were invited to participate in the pilot, although it appears \"Early Access\" invites went primarily to Tesla investors and enthusiasts. In a copy of the\u00a0invitation\u00a0shared on social media, it says these riders will be \"among the first to use our new Robotaxi App\" and that they will be able to provide \"valuable feedback.\"",
      "Those invited to Austin's pilot can hail the self-driving cars via the Robotaxi App and go anywhere except the airport from 6 a.m. to midnight on Sunday, the invitation says.",
      "What has Elon Musk said about robotaxis?",
      "Musk previewed the launch in January during an earnings call, saying the cars will be \"in the wild with no one in them, in June in Austin.\" A\u00a0video posted by the company that same month offers a glimpse of the interiors and exteriors of Tesla's autonomous vehicles.",
      "The robotaxi event comes just weeks after Musk stepped back from the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration's cost-cutting effort. With Tesla's sales tumbling amid widespread protests against his government work, some Tesla investors had asked him\u00a0to refocus on the EV carmaker.",
      "In an X post from earlier this month, Musk\u00a0teased the June 22 launch date and said the first driverless trip \"from factory end of line all the way to a customer house\" is set to take place on June 28.",
      "From there, he has said he expects services to scale rapidly. It's likely that the Tesla robotaxi could be rolled out in 25 U.S. cities over the next year, according to Ives.",
      "Are there safety concerns about robotaxis?",
      "Autonomous vehicles have drawn scrutiny from the government officials and independent groups like the Dawn Project, a computer safety advocacy company, which argues that Tesla's self-driving technology puts children in harm's way.",
      "Tesla is also under the microscope of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which\u00a0launched an investigation in October\u00a0after four vehicles with Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" system were involved in crashes.",
      "In May, the agency's investigatory arm shifted its focus to the impending pilot program in Austin, saying in a\u00a0letter\u00a0that it wants information from Tesla on how it plans to evaluate its fleet of robotaxis for use on public roads.",
      "These concerns seems to have caught the attention of Musk, who earlier this month wrote, \"We are being super paranoid about safety\" in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0discussing the rollout.",
      "On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers from Texas signed a letter asking Tesla to delay its launch until September 1, when a new law regulating the safety of autonomous vehicles takes effect. Under the laws new framework, commercial vehicles would be required to get authorization for the Department of Motor Vehicles \"before operating on public streets without a human driver.\"",
      "It's unlikely that will hobble this weekend's launch, which appears to be moving ahead, albeit with certain safety provisions built in. According to the invite\u00a0shared on social media, the robotaxis in Austin pilot will have a \"Tesla Safety Monitor\" in the front right passenger seat. Remote monitors will also be keeping track of the rides, according to\u00a0CNBC.",
      "How important are robotaxis for Tesla?",
      "The rollout of the robotaxi service, if successful, could help boost the company's fortunes after it faced intense backlash over Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's DOGE, noted Wedbush's Ives.",
      "Tesla's first-quarter results fell short of expectations, with its profit tumbling 71% and its sales sliding 9% during the three-month period. While its stock has regained some lost ground since Musk said he would return his focus to Tesla, it's still 33% below its December peak of about $480 per share.",
      "The robotaxi rollout could help Tesla reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026, or double its current valuation, according to Ives.",
      "\"The golden era of autonomous for Tesla officially kicks off on Sunday in Austin,\" Ives wrote in a research report. \"We view this autonomous chapter as one of the most important for Musk and Tesla.\"",
      "In ramping up robotaxi service, Tesla is hoping to slingshot past Waymo, another autonomous car service that operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, according to its\u00a0website. Last week, Waymo\u00a0applied for a permit to test its vehicles in New York City.",
      "\"I don't really think about competitors. I just think about making the product as perfect as possible,\" Musk has said of his robotaxi venture.",
      "Either way, Tesla will have some catching up to do. Waymo currently gets 250,000 paid trips each week for its driverless taxis service.",
      "The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

But buyers are actually paying far less than sellers' median asking price, which stood at $422,238 for the same period, the real estate company's data shows.",

As a result, the dream of home ownership, which is a meaningful way to build wealth, is becoming more distant for large swaths of the population.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:50:16 -0400",
    "summary": "This was the number one airline in the U.S. last year, based on its reliability, passenger experience and more.",
    "story": [
      "Looking to travel this summer but not sure which airline to fly for the best experience? The Points Guy (TPG), an online site dedicated to improving consumers' travel experiences while helping them save money, has revealed its annual ranking of the best airlines in the U.S.",
      "Founder and CEO Brian Kelly said the site ranks airlines based on four criteria: a carrier's reliability and performance; passenger experience; its cost and reach; and the quality of its loyalty or rewards program. Recent carrier meltdowns have travelers thinking more carefully about which airline \u2014 and through which airports \u2014 they want to fly.",
      "\"This is not just my personal decision,\" Kelly told CBS Mornings. He also explained how the company weighs each metric. \"We have a formula. We use lots of data. This isn't us just sticking our finger up in the air and kind of playing favorites. We look at reliability, first and foremost.\"",
      "\"When you buy airfare, you need to get to where you're going, so we give a huge amount \u2014 30% \u2014 to reliability,\" Kelly explained.",
      "Some airlines are going the extra mile to make flying more enjoyable for customers, from the minute they step foot in an airport through touchdown. For that reason, TPG assigned a 25% weight to an airline passenger's experience score to determine its overall ranking.",
      "An airline's cost and reach \u2014 including how expansive its network of destinations is \u2014 was assigned a 20% weight. And one-quarter of an airline's score was determined by the quality of its loyalty of rewards program.",
      "How the airlines stack up",
      "Delta Air Lines topped the list for the seventh year in a row, with its relative strength across all categories earning it the highest ranking, according to TPG. It is the most reliable on-time airline in America. It also provides passengers with free wi-fi, a wide selection of inflight entertainment options and meals from Shake Shack.",
      "United came in second place, rising from third place last year, aided by an improved onboard experience. It could continue to climb the rankings next year after announcing a partnership with JetBlue that will expand the airline's reach and improve perks for its loyalty members, TPG said.",
      "Weighing on the airline, though, is United's outsized presence at Newark Airport, which is suffering from persistent equipment and staffing issues.",
      "Southwest Airlines moved up two spots to earn the No. 3 position. Working in the airline's favor is its low flight cancellation rate, which is the best of any of its competitors. While it scored points in the cost and reach category, recent changes in fee structures could end its reign. It recently ended its popular \"bags fly free\" policy and offers a new, basic economy fare.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 11:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Unauthorized immigrants make up nearly 5% of the U.S. workforce, according to 2022 estimates, and a higher share in construction and agriculture.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration resumed more aggressive workplace immigration enforcement earlier this week after briefly pausing arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants last week.",
      "\"The message is clear now that we're going to continue doing worksite enforcement operations, even on farms and hotels, but based on a prioritized basis,\" President Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, said Thursday, adding, \"Criminals come first.\"",
      "The White House argues that undocumented workers drive down wages and take jobs from American-born workers. But some farming and hospitality industry leaders have warned the administration that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations, as many of these workers fill essential jobs that are difficult to replace with domestic labor.",
      "Undocumented immigrants make up a sizable slice of the workforce in not only hospitality and farming but also construction and manufacturing.",
      "Additionally, undocumented workers are spread across the U.S., including in blue states like California and New Jersey, and in states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, like Texas, Florida, and Nevada, which have some of the biggest shares of unauthorized workers.",
      "Here's a closer look at the industries most dependent on undocumented workers and the states where these workers are concentrated.",
      "Undocumented workers in key industries",
      "The Center for Immigration Studies estimated in 2024 that there are about 14 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.",
      "The most recent detailed breakdown by sector and state comes from the Pew Research Center's analysis of Census data from 2022. According to that study, there were an estimated 8.3 million undocumented immigrants who were part of the workforce, out of 11 million total in the country at that time.",
      "These workers made up 4.8% of the overall U.S. workforce, according to Pew, but they were a much larger share of the workforce in several essential industries.",
      "Nearly 1 in 5\u00a0 household workers and landscapers, 16% of crop workers and meat processors, 14% of apparel manufacturing workers and 13% of construction workers were undocumented immigrants, Pew estimated.",
      "The numbers were even higher depending on the occupation. One-third of roofers and workers who install drywall and ceiling tiles were undocumented, as were a quarter of maids and housekeepers, and nearly one-fifth of brickmasons.",
      "Because the U.S. Census does not directly ask about legal status, the number of unauthorized immigrants and their participation in the workforce is inexact. Pew Research Center analyzed the American Community Survey from 2022, and Goldman Sachs produced similar estimates based on the 2023 version of the survey.",
      "The share of undocumented workers in a given industry may be even higher than estimates based on the Census. A survey by the Department of Agriculture from 2021 to 2022 found that 42% of 2,600 crop workers interviewed did not have work authorization.",
      "Industry leaders have said the renewed deportation push is making it harder to operate. American Farm Bureau Federation president Zippy Duvall expressed disappointment on Tuesday in the administration's decision to restart immigration arrests on farms, forecasting that it could lead to inflated food prices for American consumers.",
      "\"Unfortunately, domestic workers do not apply for farm jobs, despite aggressive hiring efforts. Without farm workers, vegetables will be left in the fields, fruit will remain unpicked, and cows will go unmilked. The end result is a reduced food supply and higher grocery prices for all of America's families,\" Duvall said in a statement.",
      "Research also indicates that deportation can actually lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers. One study of the Obama administration's Secure Communities program, which deported nearly half a million undocumented immigrants, estimated that for every 1 million people deported, the number of jobs held by U.S.-born people would be reduced by 88,000.",
      "\"You can think about foreign-born workers taking jobs like a construction worker or a dishwasher at a local restaurant, and then once people are in those jobs employers are also able to hire construction managers and waiters and waitresses. And those are jobs typically taken by U.S.-born workers,\" economist Chloe East, the study's author, told CBS News.",
      "Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, estimate that if all of the unauthorized workers in the country were deported, U.S. GDP could fall as much as 7.4% below baseline by 2028.",
      "Share of undocumented workers by state",
      "President Trump said in a recent post on social media that his administration would focus on deportation efforts in Democrat-led cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, which he characterized as the places where \"millions upon millions of illegal aliens reside.\"",
      "But research indicates the undocumented population is spread across the country in both blue- and red-leaning states.",
      "Unauthorized immigrants make up the greatest share of both the population and workforce in Nevada and Texas \u2014 two states Mr. Trump won in 2024 \u2014 where the Pew Research Center estimates over 8% of workers were undocumented as of 2022.",
      "In California, where immigration enforcement raids sparked protests last week, Pew estimated that as of 2022, 7.2% of the workforce was undocumented. In New York, the figure was about 5%.",
      "Texas Restaurant Association CEO and president Emily Williams Knight told CBS News that some restaurants in the state are experiencing staffing issues because workers are afraid to come to work amid the crackdown.",
      "\"You have to remember, if people stop going to work in restaurants, that means restaurants can't serve their community. That means the dollar that restaurants put into each community, for a dollar spent, goes away, and then those workers are also not spending,\" Knight said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \"While the President remains focused on immediately removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from the country, including those given safe harbor in Democrat-run sanctuary cities, anyone who is here illegally is liable to be deported.\"",
      "Jackson added, \"Any suggestion that enforcing immigration law will hurt the workforce misses the forest for the trees \u2014 there is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump says the U.S. will meet with Iran next week, as a tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Iran holds for now.",
      "During a news conference Wednesday to cap off the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, the president said there may be a formal agreement at some point with Iran, but he doesn't believe one is necessary because their nuclear sites were \"blown up to kingdom come.\"",
      "\"We're going to talk to them next week, with Iran,\" the president told reporters at the press conference, adding that the U.S. is going to \"meet\" with them, although he didn't specify who will be involved in the meeting or where it will take place.",
      "\"I don't care if I have an agreement or not,\" he said. \"The only thing we'd be asking for is what we were asking for before about, 'we want no nuclear.' But we destroyed the nuclear. In other words, that's destroyed. I said, 'Iran will not have nuclear.' Well, we blew it up. It's blown up to kingdom come. And so I don't feel very strongly about it. If we got a document, it wouldn't be bad.\"",
      "The president met with other world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, amid cautious optimism about the ceasefire the Trump administration brokered. The 12-day conflict left 28 people dead in Israel and hundreds in Iran.",
      "\"It was a 12-day war. And we think it's over,\" Mr. Trump said during the press conference. \"I don't think they're going to be going back at each other, I don't think so.\"",
      "\"Because I dealt with both, and they're both tired, exhausted,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They fought very, very hard and very viciously, very violently, and they were both satisfied to go home and get out. And can it start again? I guess some day it can, it could maybe start soon.\"",
      "At the summit, Mr. Trump said Iran's enrichment efforts were set back \"basically decades.\" The U.S.\u00a0strikes\u00a0on Iranian nuclear facilities were \"very, very successful. It's called 'obliteration,'\" he said at the news conference.\u00a0An initial classified assessment\u00a0by the Defense Intelligence Agency, however, estimated the strikes only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",
      "Regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, Mr. Trump expressed optimism and said there's been \"great progress.\"",
      "\"I think great progress is being made on Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think because of this attack that we made, I think we're going to have some very good news.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who complimented the president on his efforts to boost other countries' defense spending and on his efforts in the Middle East.",
      "\"You are a man of strength and also a man of peace,\" Rutte told Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump also met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy said they discussed \"how to achieve a ceasefire and a real peace deal.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the attention and the readiness to help bring peace close,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X, adding, \"Details will follow.\"",
      "The president said of his conversation with Zelenskyy, \"I took from the meeting that he'd like to see it end. I think it's a great time to end it. I'm going to speak to Vladimir Putin and see if we can get it ended.\"",
      "A Ukrainian BBC reporter, who said her husband is a soldier in Ukraine, asked the president whether the U.S. would provide Ukraine with Patriot missile defense systems, which intercept ballistic missiles.",
      "\"They do want to have the anti-missile missiles \u2026 the Patriots,\" Mr. Trump replied, \"and we're going to see if we can make some available.\" He said the missiles\u00a0 were \"hard to get,\" and the U.S. has been providing them to Israel. \"They're very effective \u2014 100% effective.\"",
      "The president, upon learning that the reporter was living with her children in Warsaw while her husband fights in Ukraine, said, \"That's rough stuff, right?\" And after he answered her question, he wished her luck and offered his regards to her husband.",
      "NATO members, with the exceptions of Spain and Slovakia, have agreed to a dramatic increase in their defense spending, to 5% of GDP, a goal pressed by Mr. Trump, though the U.S. defense spending is short of that target. Before leaving for the summit, Mr. Trump said the U.S. shouldn't have to reach that target, since it's contributed so much to NATO in the past.",
      "\"This week, the NATO allies committed to dramatically increase their defense spending to that 5% of GDP, something that no one really thought possible,\" Mr. Trump said at his press conference, adding that it will be known as \"The Hague defense commitment.\"",
      "Asked about Spain's refusal to commit to the 5% threshold, Mr. Trump said he liked Spain and its people, \"But Spain is the only country \u2014 out of all other countries \u2014 that refuses to pay,\" and he said it was getting \"a little bit of a free ride.\" The president went on to say that the U.S. is negotiating with Spain on trade, and \"we're going to make them pay twice as much.\"",
      "It's was a whirlwind trip for Mr. Trump, who arrived in the Netherlands on Tuesday and is scheduled to fly back to Washington on Wednesday.",
      "The president said he's leaving NATO with a different perspective about Article 5 \u2014 the agreement that the allies will come to each other's aid when attacked \u2014 after hearing about it directly from fellow leaders.

    "story": [
      "An initial classified assessment found the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",
      "The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military intelligence wing, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo, to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies, two sources familiar with the report's findings said.",
      "The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, one of the sources said.",
      "\"This is a preliminary, low confidence assessment \u2014 not a final conclusion \u2014 and will continue to be refined as additional intelligence becomes available,\" a senior DIA official told CBS News on Wednesday. \"We have still not been able to review the actual physical sites themselves, which will give us the best indication.\"",
      "The official added that the agency was \"working with the FBI and other authorities to investigate the unauthorized disclosure of classified information.\"",
      "A complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Sunday.",
      "\"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Caine said.",
      "President Trump said in an address to the nation following the strikes that \"Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "He reiterated that assertion Wednesday morning in the Netherlands, where he was attending a NATO summit, telling reporters the \"they're not going to be building bombs for a long time.\"",
      "\"I think that Israel is going to be telling us very soon, because Bibi [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] is going to have people involved in that whole situation. We hear it was obliteration, it a was a virtual obliteration,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that he did not believe the Iranians \"had a chance to get anything out\" of their underground nuclear facilities before the strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump said the U.S. strikes had set back the Iranian nuclear program \"basically decades.\"",
      "Later Wednesday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement saying: \"We assess that the American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, combined with Israeli strikes on other elements of Iran's military nuclear program, has set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years. The achievement can continue indefinitely if Iran does not get access to nuclear material.\"",
      "The U.S. Air Force\u00a0joined Israel's strikes, on President Trump's orders, dropping several 30,000-pound bombs on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility early Sunday morning local time. But the DIA assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure \u2014 which is located hundreds of feet beneath a mountain \u2014 is so deep underground that it remains largely intact, one source said.",
      "The assessment provides a range of possibilities for how long it will take for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities and resume its work, ranging from a few months to less than a year, the source told CBS News. The source added that Trump administration officials were warned prior to the strike that this was a possible outcome.",
      "The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, which is gleaned from the communications of Iranian officials, one of the sources said.",
      "Current and former national security officials have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities \u2014 including access to uranium already enriched to 60% and working centrifuges \u2014 could intensify and accelerate the regime's determination to create a working weapon.",
      "Some of the details contained in the DIA assessment were previously reported by CNN.",
      "The White House has pushed back on the findings. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment \"flat-out wrong\" and said it was leaked \"by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community.\"",
      "\"The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program,\" Leavitt said. \"Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump blasted reports on the DIA assessment in a Truth Social post, writing, \"THE NUCLEAR SITES IN IRAN ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED!\"",
      "The Pentagon also stood by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's prior claim that the strikes had \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear capabilities.",
      "\"The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission,\" Hegseth said in a statement.",
      "In an interview with Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle,\" Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff called the release of the DIA report \"treasonous.\" He said \"we know for a fact\" that the Natanz site was destroyed, and said of the Fordo strike, \"there's no doubt that it was obliterated.\"",
      "Witkoff also said \"it will be almost impossible for them to resurrect that program,\" adding, \"it will take a period of years.\"",
      "A classified briefing for Congress on the administration's actions in Iran that had been scheduled for Tuesday was cancelled. Senate lawmakers are instead to be briefed by top intelligence and military officials on Thursday, one congressional aide familiar with the plan told CBS News. A similar briefing for the House will be held on Friday, according to House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered strikes Saturday on Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites, as well as a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The operation \u2014 carried out with B-2 bombers and submarine-launched cruise missiles \u2014 added to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against Iranian nuclear and military sites, drawing Iranian counterattacks. A ceasefire between Israel and Iran took effect Tuesday and appears to be holding.",
      "The strikes were aimed at stymying Iran's nuclear program. Iran has boosted its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, prompting concerns it was advancing toward a weapon.",
      "American intelligence agencies have assessed Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. On the same day that Mr. Trump authorized strikes Saturday, one U.S. agency assessed that Iran could make a nuclear weapon in as little as three to eight months, but there was no indication that the country's Supreme Leader had authorized an effort to do so, CBS News has reported. Other U.S. intelligence agencies have said Iran would need a minimum of six to eighteen months to create a weapon they could deliver with success.",

However, government employees and their family members were still restricted from traveling  outside the Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Be'er Sheva areas.",

      "The ceasefire would take hold in stages, the president said. A White House official told CBS News that Iran would halt strikes against Israel from midnight Eastern Time, and Israel was to stop striking Iran 12 hours after that, from noon ET on Tuesday. Another 12 hours after that, or at midnight ET on Wednesday morning, the war would be considered over.",
      "Tuesday morning, Israel accused Iran of launching several missiles at Israeli territory. At least one made impact in the southern city of Beersheba, killing four people. It was unclear at the time whether the missiles were fired before or after the ceasefire was due to take effect, but Israel's defense chief accused Iran of breaching the agreement, and ordered a response. Israel later said it had launched a final round of strikes on Iran, before the ceasefire began.",
      "\"In light of Iran's complete violation of the ceasefire declared by the U.S. President and the launch of missiles towards Israel, and in accordance with the Israeli government's policy as determined to respond forcefully to any violation \u2014 I have instructed the IDF, in coordination with the Prime Minister, to continue the intense activity of attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures,\" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.",
      "President Trump was quick to respond to defend his deal, saying in a message posted on his Truth Social network: \"ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!\"",
      "As he prepared to depart for a NATO summit on Tuesday, he was asked if he believed Iran or Israel had violated the ceasefire.",
      "\"I think they both violated it. I don't think, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. They couldn't rein people back,\" Mr. Trump said. But he appeared to direct particular criticism at Israel.",

      "\"Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that he would \"see if I can stop it.\"",
      "\"I'm not happy with them,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"I'm not happy with Iran either. We basically have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing, you understand that?\"",
      "Soon after, Israel said Mr. Trump had spoken by phone with Netanyahu.",
      "A White House source told CBS News that Mr. Trump was \"exceptionally firm and direct\" in the call about what needed to happen to sustain the ceasefire, and the source said Netanyahu had \"understood the severity of the situation and the concerns President Trump expressed.\"",
      "In a statement after their call, Netanyahu's office said Israel had \"refrained from further attacks\" after carrying out a limited strike on a radar site outside Tehran, in retaliation for Iran's latest missile launches.",
      "Israel's timeline of airstrikes and missile exchange with Iran",
      "In a statement, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a timeline of the events on Tuesday morning, saying the ceasefire had been due to take effect at 7 a.m. local time [midnight eastern], and Israel had launched attacks on \"the heart of Tehran\" at 3 a.m. local, \"hitting regime targets and killing hundreds of Basij and Iranian security forces.\"",
      "\"Shortly before the ceasefire went into effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, one of which claimed the lives of four of our citizens in Beersheba,\" the statement said, adding that after 7 a.m., when the ceasefire began, Iran fired additional missiles.",
      "\"At 7:06 AM, Iran launched one missile into Israeli territory and at 10:25 AM, two more missiles. The missiles were intercepted or fell in open areas without casualties or damage,\" Netanyahu's office said. \"In response to Iran's violations, the Air Force destroyed a radar array near Tehran. Following President Trump's conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel refrained from further attacks.\"",
      "At least 1,000 people killed in 12 days of Israel-Iran strikes",
      "The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13, when Israel launched its first strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes \u2014 which killed several top Iranian military officials \u2014 prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel.",
      "As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran said in a statement. The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information.",
      "Iranian authorities have not provided casualty figures since not long after the Israeli strikes began.",
      "Iran's missile attacks have killed at least 28 people in Israel since June 13, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Iran called its response \"devastating and powerful,\" but Mr. Trump called it \"very weak.\" The president said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\"",
      "Drones hit bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops",
      "Iraqi army spokesperson Sabah Al-Naaman, in a statement quoted by the AP, said Tuesday that drones had hit military bases in the country, including some where American forces are stationed.",
      "Al-Naaman said a \"treacherous and cowardly act of aggression\" had damaged radar installations at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, and at the Imam Ali Base in Dhi Qar province in southern Iraq, not far from the Iranian border.",
      "The AP cited Al-Naaman as saying Iraqi forces intercepted drones fired at other locations.",
      "The AP cited a senior U.S. military official, whom it said was not authorized to comment publicly, as saying American forces had intercepted drones targeting the Ain al-Assad base in the western Iraq desert, and a base near Baghdad airport.",

      "Ear's mother, Regina Higuera, had lived in the United States for 36 years. But on this particular morning in early June, she left her home, her children and grandchildren \u2014 all of whom are U.S. citizens \u2014 and headed back to her birthplace in Mexico.",
      "\"When the ICE raids started picking up on other states, we knew that we were going to get hit eventually,\" Ear told CBS News. \"Nobody's safe.\"",
      "Since President Trump began his second term, ICE has arrested more than 100,000 people as of early June, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News. The Trump administration has also encouraged undocumented migrants to self-deport. Last month, it announced it would offer free airline tickets and a $1,000 incentive to some migrants who chose to leave the U.S. and return to their home countries on their own accord.",

    "story": [
      "After U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained Marine Corps veteran Adrian Clouatre's wife last month, he doesn't know how to tell his children where their mother went.",
      "When his nearly 2-year-old son Noah asks for his mother before bed, Clouatre just tells him, \"Mama will be back soon.\" When his 3-month-old, breastfeeding daughter Lyn is hungry, he gives her a bottle of baby formula instead. He's worried how his newborn will bond with her mother absent skin-to-skin contact.",
      "His wife, Paola, is one of tens of thousands of people in custody and facing deportation as the Trump administration pushes for immigration officers to arrest 3,000 people a day. Earlier this month, arrests by ICE during President Trump's second term topped 100,000, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"They knew I was veteran, they just ripped her away from me and her children, from her breastfeeding, you know, newborn daughter, it's almost inhumane,\" Adrian Clouatre told CBS News.",
      "Even as Marine Corps recruiters promote enlistment as protection for families lacking legal status, directives for strict immigrant enforcement have cast away practices of deference previously afforded to military families, immigration law experts say. The federal agency tasked with helping military family members gain legal status now refers them for deportation, government memos show.",
      "To visit his wife, Adrian Clouatre has to make an eight-hour round trip from their home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to a rural ICE detention center in Monroe. Clouatre, who qualifies as a service-disabled veteran, goes every chance he can get.",
      "Paola Clouatre, a 25-year-old Mexican national whose mother brought her into the country seeking asylum more than a decade ago, met Adrian Clouatre, 26, at a Southern California nightclub during the final months of his five years of military service in 2022. Within a year, they had tattooed each other's names on their arms.",
      "After they married in 2024, Paola Clouatre sought a green card to legally live and work in the U.S. Adrian Clouatre said he is \"not a very political person\" but believes his wife deserved to live legally in the U.S.",
      "\"I'm all for 'get the criminals out of the country,' right?\" he said. \"But the people that are here working hard, especially the ones married to Americans \u2014 I mean, that's always been a way to secure a green card.\"",
      "Detained at a green card meeting",
      "The process to apply for Paola Clouatre's green card went smoothly at first, but eventually she learned ICE had issued an order for her deportation in 2018 after her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing.",
      "Clouatre and her mother had been estranged for years \u2014 Clouatre cycled out of homeless shelters as a teenager \u2014 and up until a couple of months ago, Clouatre had \"no idea\" about her mother's missed hearing or the deportation order, her husband said.",
      "Adrian Clouatre recalled that a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services staffer asked about the deportation order during a May 27 appointment as part of her green card application. After Paola Clouatre explained that she was trying to reopen her case, the staffer asked her and her husband to wait in the lobby for paperwork regarding a follow-up appointment, which her husband said he believed was a \"ploy.\"",
      "Soon, officers arrived and handcuffed Paola Clouatre, who handed her wedding ring to her husband for safekeeping.",
      "Adrian Clouatre, eyes welling with tears, said he and his wife had tried to \"do the right thing\" and that he felt ICE officers should have more discretion over arrests, though he understood they were trying to do their jobs.",
      "\"It's just a hell of a way to treat a veteran,\" said Carey Holliday, a former immigration judge who is now representing the couple. \"You take their wives and send them back to Mexico?\"",
      "The Clouatres filed a motion for a California-based immigration judge to reopen the case on Paola's deportation order and are waiting to hear back, Holliday said.",
      "On June 9, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services posted to social media about Paola Clouatre's case, writing that when Clouatre \"was apprehended by @CBP and ordered removed by a judge in 2018, she chose to defy the order and stay in the U.S. 7 years later, she had another bad idea and applied for a Green Card. @ICEgov took her into custody at our New Orleans office. @DHSgov has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "However, Paola Clouatre told CBS News of the 2018 order: \"My wife was not only a minor, but homeless when that removal order was issued. Her mom skipped the appointment, my wife was living in a homeless shelter in CPS care. And there was no way for her to know about the removal order.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre also shared with CBS News Tuesday a letter he said he wrote to Mr. Trump and submitted through WhiteHouse.gov.",
      "\"I'm aware that purely by law my wife is considered an illegal immigrant,\" he wrote in the letter. \"But she is being made to pay for the sins of her mother and has been inhumanly torn from her 2 young American children and American Veteran husband. We are married and have gone through the proper channels. We found out about her removal order about a week before we went to the USCIS interview and were honest about it hoping to have time to resolve the issue.\"",
      "Jeff Migliozzi, spokesperson for the Washington, D.C.-based migrant advocacy group Freedom for Immigrants, told CBS News in a statement: \"The scheduled ICE check-in arrest, like what happened here, has been a popular tactic under this administration in order to achieve higher numbers. The practice really underscores the cruelty and injustice of this administration's immigration policy -- here you have people doing all they can to follow the rules you gave them, and then you pull the rug out from under them. The result is separated families and shattered lives. It's appalling.\"",
      "Less discretion for military families",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that Paola Clouatre \"is in the country illegally\" and that the administration is \"not going to ignore the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Ignoring an Immigration Judge's order to leave the U.S. is a bad idea,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a June 9 post on social platform X which appeared to refer to Clouatre's case. The agency added that the government \"has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre said the agency's X post does not accurately reflect his wife's situation because she entered the country as a minor with her mother, seeking asylum.",
      "\"She was not aware of the removal order, so she was not knowingly defying it,\" he said. \"If she had been arrested, she would have been deported long ago, and we would never have met.\"",
      "Prior to the Trump administration's push to drive up deportations, USCIS provided much more discretion for veterans seeking legal status for a family member, said Holliday and Margaret Stock, a military immigration law expert.",
      "In a Feb. 28 memo, the agency said it \"will no longer exempt\" from deportation people in groups that had received more grace in the past. This includes the families of military personnel or veterans, Stock said. As of June 12, the agency said it has referred upward of 26,000 cases to ICE for deportation.",
      "USCIS still offers a program allowing family members of military personnel who illegally entered the U.S. to remain in the country as they apply for a green card. But there no longer appears to be room for leeway, such as giving a veteran's spouse like Paola Clouatre the opportunity to halt her active deportation order without facing arrest, Stock said.",
      "But numerous Marine Corps recruiters have continued to post ads on social media, geared toward Latinos, promoting enlistment as a way to gain \"protection from deportation\" for family members.",
      "\"I think it's bad for them to be advertising that people are going to get immigration benefits when it appears that the administration is no longer offering these immigration benefits,\" Stock said. \"It sends the wrong message to the recruits.\"",
      "Marine Corps spokesperson Master Sgt. Tyler Hlavac told The Associated Press that recruiters have now been informed they are \"not the proper authority\" to \"imply that the Marine Corps can secure immigration relief for applicants or their families.\"",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is holding around 59,000 detainees in facilities across the country, likely setting a record high as the Trump administration aggressively expands nationwide immigration arrests, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "On Monday, June 23, ICE's detention level was \u2014 on paper at least \u2014 at over 140% capacity, since Congress last allocated 41,500 detainee beds for the agency, the figures show.",
      "The federal statistics show nearly half \u2014 or 47% \u2014 of those currently detained by ICE lack a criminal record and fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes, a sign of the widening scope of President Trump's escalating crackdown on illegal immigration. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to expel dangerous criminal migrants, though top officials in his administration have said no one in the U.S. illegally will be immune from deportation.",
      "ICE can detain immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally \u2014 as well as foreigners whose legal status is under review for potential revocation, including in cases involving criminal offenses \u2014 while the agency attempts to deport them.",
      "As the agency spearheading federal efforts to carry out Mr. Trump's promised mass deportation campaign, ICE has garnered national headlines in recent weeks, as its operations have become more visible, expansive and, in the eyes of critics, aggressive. High-profile ICE operations at workplaces and other locations in the Los Angeles area earlier this month triggered large-scale protests, including some instances of violence, which Mr. Trump cited to activate National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to protect federal property and officers.",
      "Internal agency figures show ICE has averaged around 1,200 daily arrests so far in June, with arrests surpassing 2,000 on two days. That's nearly double the 660 daily arrest average during the first 100 days of President Trump's second administration, but it's still far below the 3,000 arrests top White House adviser Stephen Miller has said ICE should conduct every day.",
      "The 59,000 detainee population tops the previous peak in 2019, when the first Trump administration held as many as 55,000 immigrants in ICE detention, according to agency data compiled by researchers at Syracuse University. Historical data gathered by the Marshall Project suggests the 59,000 figure is the highest in the history of U.S. immigration detention. Two former senior ICE officials said they had never seen the agency holding that many detainees.",
      "\"If ICE is holding 59,000 immigrants in civil detention across the country, it would be the highest number on record that I'm aware of,\" said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who studies the U.S. immigration system.",
      "The current detention level is a 50% increase from the last days of the Biden administration, when ICE was holding around 39,000 detainees. Figures show it has mainly been driven by ICE arrests in the interior of the country, as opposed to transfers of migrants who just crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings have dropped to historic lows.",
      "Over 70% of the detainees in ICE custody were arrested in the U.S. interior, the government figures show, up from fewer than 40% when the Biden administration left office.",
      "ICE has been able to increase its arrest rate through various means, including through large-scale operations in locations across the U.S. supported by Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other federal law enforcement agencies. In addition, many of those arrested by ICE are inmates picked up at local and state jails as part of a longstanding program targeting noncitizens with criminal records.",
      "But the Trump administration has also vastly expanded who is subject to being detained by ICE, reversing limits placed by previous administration that largely required the agency to focus on arresting serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals. The administration also lifted a Biden-era pause on immigration roundups at worksites, launching arrest operations at a meat processing plant in Nebraska and a horse racetrack in Louisiana.",
      "It's unclear how the Trump administration has expanded ICE's detention capacity beyond the beds funded by Congress.",
      "Officials have been looking into converting some military bases, like Fort Bliss in Texas, into temporary immigration holding centers, though those plans have not fully materialized. The administration has also asked Congress for billions of dollars in extra funds for ICE, including to expand detention levels by tens of thousands of beds.",
      "Recently, Florida state officials offered to build several immigration detention sites to support the Trump administration, including one in the Everglades dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz.\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said\u00a0Florida would receive federal funds\u00a0to set up those facilities.",
      "Representatives for DHS and ICE did not respond to questions about whether some detention facilities are over capacity.",
      "In a statement, ICE said its effort to target a \"massive backlog of illegal criminal aliens and public safety threats from the United States\" has led to \"a significant number of arrests, requiring greater detention capacity.\"",
      "\"ICE is implementing various options to meet its current and future detention needs, but more space for apprehended illegal aliens is needed as they await deportation,\" ICE added, noting the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" backed by the president would fund 100,000 detention beds.",
      "Kocher, the Syracuse University professor, said he's worried about conditions in ICE detention deteriorating amid the rapid expansion in the detainee population.",
      "\"I am concerned about ICE's ability to comply with the basic standards of civil detention or provide appropriate due process to immigrants \u2014 both of which the administration has so far treated as optional rather than required by law,\" Kocher said.",

The agency announced last week that a part of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline dedicated to LGBTQ+ youth is being terminated.",
      "Rep. Troy Carter, a Democrat from Louisiana, questioned Kennedy on\u00a0cuts to HIV vaccine research. In May, the Trump administration moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus. But experts disagree, including Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research, who previously told CBS News it's a \"terrible time\" to cut off the research, adding that it could not \"simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding.\"",

      "Many of the Republican committee members came to Kennedy's defense, including Florida Rep. Kat Cammack, who congratulated Kennedy for disrupting the \"broken status quo,\" and Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who said restructuring is \"never an easy task.",
      "Here are some other highlights from the hearing.",
      "RFK Jr. retracts accusation against Rep. Frank Pallone",
      "Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey accused Kennedy of trying to \"defend the indefensible\" with his actions as secretary.",
      "\"There's no way that this budget or the actions you have taken thus far as secretary are going to make this country healthier,\" Pallone said. \"The science is not on your side. I just really think that people are going to die as a result of your actions.\"",
      "Pallone also criticized Kennedy for not allowing for a typical process of public comments when it comes to \"major decisions about vaccines.\"",
      "\"Are you just afraid of receiving public comments on proposals where you just think these are fringe views that are contrary to the views of most scientists and that the public comments will reflect this?\" he said. \"You say you want transparency, but there's been no public process for any of this.\"",
      "Kennedy said the ACIP committee \u2014 the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices \u2014 was the public process for regulating vaccines.",
      "\"You fired the ACIP committee,\" Pallone said.",
      "\"I fired people who had conflicts with the pharmaceutical industry,\" Kennedy replied. Earlier this month, he replaced the entire committee with\u00a0new picks, including some with ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers.",
      "Later, Kennedy accused Pallone of taking money from the pharmaceutical industry, which prompted fellow Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado to call for a point of order for \"impugning the reputation of a member of Congress.\"",
      "Chairman Buddy Carter, a Georgia Republican, asked Kennedy if he wanted to take it back, and Kennedy retracted his comments about Pallone.",
      "Earlier in the hearing, DeGette questioned Kennedy on the White House's Department of Government Efficiency's \"defend the spend\" initiative, which the Washington Post reports has caused thousands of backed-up payments to doctors and nurses. Kennedy denied knowing about it.",
      "\"Do you know anything about the 'defend the spend' initiative?\" DeGette asked.",
      "\"About what?\" Kennedy asked.",
      "\"The 'defend the spend' initiative that your agency has?\" she repeated.",
      "\"No,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Kennedy defends NIH funding cuts, talks seed oils",
      "In defense of his NIH funding cuts, Kennedy said he cut \"thousands of studies\" that were doing \"nothing to improve American health\" and instead offered other topics he thinks should be a focus of research.",
      "\"Very few of the studies that were being done by NIH were being done on chronic disease,\" Kennedy said. \"NIH should be telling us: what are seed oils doing to our children? What are \u2014 what is corn syrup doing to our children? What are food dyes doing to our children? What is the packaging and microplastics doing to our children? What are pesticides doing to our children?\"",
      "Kennedy also claimed he doesn't know about the letter to NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya earlier this month from NIH scientists criticizing the administration's deep funding cuts.",
      "COVID vaccines and pregnancy",
      "Kennedy said last month that he would remove the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19.",
      "At Tuesday's hearing, Kennedy said \"study after study shows adverse events\" after COVID-19 shots during pregnancy. Without citing where the study came from, Kennedy said one study showed \"27 adverse events during pregnancy.\"",
      "Officials at the Food and Drug Administration, however,\u00a0recently reiterated\u00a0that pregnancy was among the underlying conditions that warranted continued eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine approvals.",
      "\"We're not depriving anybody of choice,\" Kennedy said. \"If a pregnant woman wants the COVID-19 vaccine, she can get it. We're no longer recommending it because there was no science supporting that recommendation.\"",
      "\"Not true,\" Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois rebutted. \"We have a pediatrician that is on this committee. Not true.\"",
      "House Democrat Kim Schrier of Washington is a former pediatrician, who said during her allotted time that she found it \"extremely alarming\" that Kennedy announced changes to vaccine recommendations \"without consulting the customary panel of experts.\"",
      "\"You have lied to the American people\"",
      "In her line of questioning, Schrier accused Kennedy of \"lying\" to a U.S. senator about not making any changes to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and doctor, eventually voted to confirm Kennedy for HHS secretary. Kennedy denied lying to the senator about the vaccine panel.",
      "\"But then two weeks ago, you fired all 17 experts on that very committee,\" Schrier said. \"Did you lie to Sen. Cassidy when you told him you would not change this panel of experts?\"",
      "Kennedy responded by saying he \"never made that agreement.\"",
      "\"So are you saying that Senator Cassidy lied when he was on the Senate floor, lied to the American people?\" Schrier said.",
      "\"If he said that I agreed to it, it would be inaccurate,\" Kennedy said.",
      "\"It sounds to me like you gave him the answer he needed to hear in order to get his confirmation vote, and then as soon as you were secretary, you turned around and did whatever you want,\" Schrier said.",
      "\"I'm complying with all the agreements I made with Sen. Cassidy,\" Kennedy responded.",
      "\"Mr. Secretary, you're now on the record. You lied to Sen. Cassidy. You have lied to the American people, you have lied to parents about vaccines for 20 years, and I also want to be clear that I will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet,\" Schrier said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Cassidy said, \"As Senator Cassidy has said publicly, the commitment was about the ACIP process, not staffing.\"",
      "Republicans praise Kennedy",
      "Some Republicans referred to\u00a0Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\"\u00a0or \"MAHA\" motto, including Langworthy, who told the secretary, \"I appreciate your leadership and your vision and your efforts to make America healthy again.\"",
      "Dr. John Joyce, a Pennsylvania Republican and a dermatologist who serves as vice-chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, thanked Kennedy for his \"commitments to unlocking American science that we know will lead to additional breakthroughs.\"",
      "Kennedy told Joyce he was committed to ensuring incentives for innovators are put in place to pursue \"gold standard science for rare disease treatments and for their cures.\"",
      "Virginia Republican Morgan Griffith, seemingly making a comparison to Kennedy, said: \"I would remind everybody that Galileo got an 'F' during his day and age, and that sometimes people who are trying to do cutting-edge work don't get the response they expect from leading scientists of the day.\"",
      "During the hearing, Kennedy made other commitments to Republicans lawmakers, including expanding the use of the Trump administration's new FDA priority vouchers because it \"crashes through the red tape\"; speeding access to prescription psychedelics; urging all Americans to use wearables like glucose monitors; promoting non-opioid painkiller Journavx; and redoing the dietary guidelines by August.",

    "summary": "Ahead of U.S. strikes on Iran, one U.S. intel assessment concluded Iran could build a nuclear weapon in months but didn't assess it decided to do so, intel sources said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 On the same day that President Trump ordered Saturday's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, a U.S. intelligence agency assessed that Iran could make a nuclear weapon in three to eight months \u2014 but there was no indication that it had decided to do so, CBS News has learned.",
      "The intelligence summary, issued Saturday for the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, found that Iran could build a nuclear device in months if it did not run into technical or logistical delays, two American intelligence sources familiar with the document told CBS News.",
      "But at that time, the summary did not assess that Iran had made a decision to sprint toward a nuclear weapon \u2014 lining up with U.S. assessments for years.",
      "Similar assessments were made in the days leading up to the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, and in the days afterward. The U.S. airstrikes came amid a wider dayslong Israeli offensive against Iranian nuclear facilities, though Mr. Trump announced Monday that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "The intelligence summary also found that Iranian officials had discussed moving canisters of highly enriched uranium into car trunks and storing them in public parking lots to avoid destruction.",
      "Iran has increased its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium in recent months, sparking concerns among both Iran's adversaries and international watchdogs. The country has enriched uranium up to 60% purity, which is only a short step away from the 90% level generally used in nuclear weapons.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week Iran was \"very close to having\" a nuclear weapon, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Iran \"is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly.\"",
      "The head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla, testified in mid-June that if Iran were to decide to sprint to a nuclear weapon, it would be able to produce enough weapons-grade material for a simple nuclear weapon in one week and could make enough for 10 nuclear weapons in three weeks.",
      "U.S. intelligence officials have said for years that Iran formally halted its nuclear weapons development program in 2003. In March, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, still had not reauthorized the program, but \"pressure has probably built on him to do so\" \u2014 noting an \"erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public.\"",
      "Different agencies in the intelligence community may have their own assessments about what Iran's nuclear capabilities were prior to the strikes.",
      "Gabbard reiterated that assessment in testimony to Congress earlier this year. But last week, Mr. Trump told reporters Gabbard was \"wrong\" about whether Iran was building a nuclear weapon, later adding, \"I think they were very close to having one.\" Gabbard later said she and the president were on the same page, and the media was \"taking my testimony out of context.\"",
      "The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site, following\u00a0 a dayslong air campaign by Israel, which has alleged Iran is \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\" The impact of the weekend strikes by the U.S. is still not clear; the Pentagon offered a preliminary public assessment of the damage soon after the strikes.",
      "\"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said Sunday, adding that a full assessment would take time.",
      "Iran, for its part, has long denied that it intends to build nuclear weapons, and insists its uranium enrichment program is meant for peaceful purposes.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News' \"Face The Nation\" on Sunday that the Iranian sites targeted in the U.S. strikes were linked to Iran's \"nuclear weaponization ambitions.\" When asked whether the U.S. believed Khamenei had ordered the building of a nuclear weapon, Rubio called the issue \"irrelevant.\"",
      "\"They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons,\" Rubio said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"President Trump and the administration have always been right to say that if Iran chose to make a nuclear bomb, they could do so within weeks, which obviously poses an imminent threat to the US and the world.\"",
      "\"[T]hanks to President Trump's strong leadership and the incredibly successful military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, their capacity to build a nuclear bomb has been obliterated and the world can sleep easy at night,\" she added.",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement, \"The Department of Defense routinely provides resources and assessments for leaders at all levels to consider in their decision-making \u2014 especially for military combat operations and deployment.\"",
      "\"The classified intelligence report unlawfully leaked to CBS does not paint a holistic picture of Iran's nuclear ambitions \u2014which many in the national security community assessed could occur within weeks,\" Parnell said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republicans-big-beautiful-bill-postal-service-sell-new-ev-delivery-trucks/",
    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 19:18:46 -0400",
    "summary": "But the Senate parliamentarian says the Postal Service's 7,200 new EVs can't be auctioned off.",
    "story": [
      "Last September, the U.S. Postal Service debuted its long-awaited \u2014 and much litigated \u2014 electric vehicle mail delivery truck. Since then, more than 7,200 new zero-emissions vehicles have been distributed to the Postal Service.",
      "But a provision tucked inside the Senate Republican bill to enact President Trump's second-term agenda would force the USPS to sell off the brand new trucks and cancel or significantly amend the contract for the remaining 58,800 that are due to be delivered over the next 10 years.",
      "According to the text of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs portion of the bill released by Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul, chair of the committee, all electric vehicles and related infrastructure owned by the Postal Service will be sold and the proceeds will \"be deposited into the general fund of the treasury.\" Selling the EVs would \"cut unnecessary costs and focus USPS on delivering mail and not achieving the environmental initiatives pushed by the Biden Administration,\" according to the bill.",
      "Paul's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Peter Pastre, the vice president of government relations and public policy for USPS, wrote a letter to the Senate in June that said the provision to sell the EVs would \"make major and damaging changes to the U.S. Postal Service's vehicle fleet program, potentially impacting our ability to deliver to millions of Americans.\"",
      "The bill is being considered under budget reconciliation rules, which means that Republicans can pass it with a simple majority, instead of meeting the 60-vote threshold that is required to consider most Senate legislation. In order to use this approach, every item in the bill must have a budgetary impact, and the Senate parliamentarian determines whether each provision meets that standard, known as the Byrd Rule.",
      "Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough found that disposing of the USPS EVs is one of several of the bill's provisions violating the Byrd Rule, according to Senate Democrats.",
      "\"Scrapping USPS' electric vehicles is a lose-lose scenario,\" Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, ranking member of the Budget Committee, told CBS News in a statement. \"We move backwards on clean energy and have to spend even more money to replace the vehicles.\"",
      "Republicans, who would like to revoke the EVs and their related infrastructure, say this provision could potentially raise money by rescinding $1 billion allocated in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act to purchase the vehicles. But according to Pastre, it would cost more than $450 million to replace the 7,200 revoked vehicles, and the USPS has already spent more than $540 million on electrical upgrades for infrastructure to support the cars.",
      "Because the majority of the vehicles are specially designed for the Postal Service \u2014 like right-side driving for mail delivery trucks \u2014 and most of the electrical infrastructure is buried under ground, the potential for raising money at auction is \"negligible,\" according to Pastre.",
      "Pastre was direct about the harm this action would cause the Postal Service saying, \"it will seriously cripple our ability to replace an aging and obsolete delivery fleet.\"",
      "\"The Postal Service has over 200,000 vehicles in an outdated and aging fleet. Using EVs will reduce fuel and maintenance costs and help the USPS to better serve the public,\" Mark Dimondstein, president of American Postal Workers Union, said in an email to CBS News. \"Eliminating energy-efficient vehicles would be a step backward and not be in the best interest of those we serve and the communities where we live.\"",
      "Since 2015, the USPS has been looking to update and modernize its fleet of more than 200,000 vehicles. The majority of the trucks were 25 years old or more, often lacked proper heating and cooling and in some cases, would spontaneously combust in neighborhoods as workers operated the aging vehicles.",
      "When the Postal Service first announced its proposal in 2021 to replace 165,000 vehicles, it originally intended to purchase traditional gas vehicles to replace 90% of the fleet. But the gas-powered mail trucks had low fuel efficiency, guzzling fuel at under a 9-m.p.g. rate, according to filings by several environmental organizations and more than a dozen states that sued to block the plan.",
      "\"It's important that EVs be part of the mix for the USPS because it should represent the next generation,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the organizations that sued the USPS in 2021. \"The last generation of vehicles are literally dying on its wheels.\"",
      "The legal action forced the USPS to reconsider its plan, and it finalized a deal in late 2022 to purchase 106,000 new cars \u2014 and 66,000 were to be zero-emissions vehicles. It also planned to install more than 14,000 chargers to keep the fleet running. The cost to update the fleet totaled $9.6 billion, and the Biden administration allocated $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act to help cover the costs, with the rest financed by the Postal Service.",
      "\"My bet is this will survive another day,\" said Becker, given that the parliamentarian has ruled it should be stricken and it would be difficult to get 60 votes in the Senate to keep it in the bill. But Congress recently voted to revoke California's EPA waivers to enact its EV mandate under the Congressional Review Act, which the parliamentarian said was illegal. It remains to be seen if Republicans will follow her recommendations.",
      "\"Selling them off at a discount just so you don't have to say you don't have EVs for political reasons makes no sense,\" said Becker.",

      "In its latest crackdown against illegal immigration, federal agents arrested 11 Iranian foreign nationals in 48 hours, including one watchlisted individual \u2014 part of a series of targeted operations spanning eight states and nine cities nationwide.",
      "Among those arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since Sunday, June 22, is Mehran Makari Saheli, at his home near St. Paul, Minnesota. ICE officials say Saheli is a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an elite branch of Iran's armed forces. They said the detainee has \"admitted connections to Hezbollah,\" a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization backed by Iran.",
      "ICE said that five of those arrested possessed previous criminal convictions ranging from grand larceny to drug and firearm possessions.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security says Yousef Mehridehno had been living in America illegally for nearly 8 years when federal authorities determined he lied on a visa application. Roughly four months after the Iranian foreign national was added to the U.S. known or suspected terrorist list in February, he was apprehended by federal agents Sunday in central Mississippi, just outside of Jackson.",
      "Officials have not linked these arrests to any specific terrorism plots and the Department of Homeland Security has stated that there are no current, credible threats to the U.S. homeland, despite a heightened security environment following U.S. strikes\u00a0on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend.",
      "But all 11 Iranians have been charged or accused of crimes beyond civil immigration violations, according to ICE officials, who say the arrested men represent a threat to public safety.",
      "While arresting Ribvar Karmi in northern Alabama on Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security says federal agents found an Islamic Republic of Iran Army identification card on his person. According to ICE officials, Karimi purportedly served as an Iranian Army sniper from 2018 to 2021 and entered the U.S. in October 2024 on a K-1 visa, reserved for migrants engaged to be married to American citizens. Karmi is now detained in ICE custody, where officials say he will remain pending removal proceedings.",
      "In Colorado Springs on Sunday, ICE officials arrested Mahmoud Shafiei and Mehrdad Mehdipour, Iranian nationals who were living at the same home and who both had orders of removal against them. ICE said Shafiei has a criminal history that includes state and federal convictions for drug crimes and arrests for assault and child abuse.",
      "In addition to the 11 Iranian nationals who were arrested, federal agents have also arrested U.S. citizen Linet Vartaniann, who was taken into custody on federal charges of threatening a law enforcement officer and harboring an illegal alien. ICE officials contend the woman threatened to open fire if immigration enforcement officers entered her home. According to ICE, the defendant threatened federal agents during an encounter on Sunday, warning she would go outside and \"shoot officers in the head.\"",
      "ICE officials tell CBS News that the arrests since Sunday are part of the Trump administration's latest crackdown on illegal immigration. Federal officials have aimed to dramatically ramp up immigration arrests, with average daily arrests climbing from 660 in President Trump's first 100 days to 1,200 in June \u2014 and the White House says its target is 3,000 arrests per day.",
      "\"We have been saying we are getting the worst of the worst out \u2014 and we are,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CBS News. \"We don't wait until a military operation to execute; we proactively deliver on President Trump's mandate to secure the homeland.\"",
      "According to U.S. government data, last fiscal year, 68 Iranian foreign nationals were arrested by ICE \u2014 including 47 with criminal convictions. ICE arrested some 113,000 people in total over that period, most of whom were from Mexico or Central America.",
      "This weekend, the Department of Homeland Security activated its National Terrorism Advisory System just hours after the United States' attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The strikes came after a days-long Israeli campaign against Iran, resulting in Iranian attacks on Israel \u2014 though Mr. Trump said Monday\u00a0the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire.",

    "summary": "Former DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni says he was fired after pushing back on orders from top officials, including Emil Bove, to defy court rulings.",
    "story": [
      "An ousted Justice Department attorney told Congress that senior department officials, including a former acting deputy attorney general, discussed defying federal court orders and withholding information from judges to advance the Trump administration's immigration priorities, according to a whistleblower complaint filed Tuesday.",
      "The attorney, Erez Reuveni, a veteran of over 14 years at the department who had been praised and promoted for his service, was put on leave and then fired earlier this year after his attorneys say he pushed back against three different Justice Department attempts to \"defy\" immigration-related court orders \"through lack of candor, deliberate delay, and disinformation.\"",
      "While Reuveni has not spoken publicly about his departure, a whistleblower report sent to senior congressional leadership by his attorneys details how he says he was \"threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged\" in his final weeks in the department after he questioned instructions from top Justice Department officials to ignore court orders and misrepresent facts in court in three separate, high-profile standoffs between the department and federal judges over immigration cases. Among those officials was the No. 3 Justice Department official, Emil Bove.",
      "Bove nominated in May by President Trump to sit on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals and is scheduled to appear for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday. Before his stint as a top Justice Department official, Bove represented Mr. Trump in his criminal trial in Manhattan last year.",
      "Reuveni's attorneys described in his complaint a meeting with Justice Department officials about contesting possible court orders blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He alleged that Bove, who at the time was principal assistant deputy attorney general, said that the department \"would need to consider telling the courts 'f*** you' and ignore any such court order,\" and that the deportation \"planes needed to take off no matter what.\"",
      "\"Mr. Reuveni was in disbelief,\" his attorneys wrote, adding that others in the room were \"stunned\" by the suggestion that the Justice Department would tell its clients in the government to disobey court rulings against the administration.",
      "A day after the meeting, the complaint said, a Washington, D.C., federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador and ordered planes carrying the men to return back to the U.S. The Trump administration did not reroute the flights.",
      "Reuveni also said that Drew Ensign, one of his supervisors, knowingly told a judge that he didn't know if more Alien Enemies Act removals were underway \u2014 even though Ensign was present for the Justice Department meeting when Bove told his team the deportations would continue.",
      "After repeatedly voicing concerns in phone calls and emails that the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department had violated the court's orders by not returning the migrants, Reuveni said he received a phone call from a DHS attorney telling him to \"consult DOJ leadership if he had any questions\" about the decision.",
      "In a separate incident days later, Reuveni's attorneys allege that he was \"told to stop asking questions\" by senior Justice Department leaders after he attempted \"to ascertain whether DOJ had violated a court order\" in Massachusetts that blocked the removal of migrants to third-party countries with no due process, after he saw evidence that the removals were still underway.",
      "The complaint says that Yakov Roth, an assistant attorney general, called Reuveni to tell him that \"Bove was very unhappy\" that he was looking into why the removals had continued, in spite of a nationwide injunction blocking them.",
      "And in April, Reuveni unsuccessfully argued in defense of the controversial and mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, admitting in court that the man \"should not have been removed\" from the U.S. to El Salvador.",
      "In the days leading up to an initial hearing in Abrego Garcia's case, Reuveni's attorneys say he \"repeatedly and consistently requested updates on efforts to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. and assurances of his safety,\" in the Salvadoran supermax prison where he was being detained.",
      "Those efforts were stonewalled, the attorneys say, after Reuveni was told by his bosses to \"stop asking for facts supporting any possible defense of the case,\" despite raising \"concerns in multiple emails to both DHS and DOS about the sufficiency of the evidence to support Mr. Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation and the lack of action to correct his erroneous removal.\"",
      "After Reuveni conceded in court that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed, a Maryland judge ordered him to be returned to the United States. As a result, a supervisor told Reuveni that the White House had questions as to why he didn't argue that Abrego Garcia was an alleged gang member and that the removal was justified, despite a court order to the contrary.",
      "Hours later, department leadership asked Reuveni to sign an appeal brief of the Maryland judge's order.\u00a0 He says he refused, telling a supervisor that he \"didn't sign up to lie.\"",
      "Reuveni was placed on administrative leave shortly afterwards for, according to a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, \"failure to follow a directive from your superiors; failure to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States; and engaging in conduct prejudicial to your client.\"",
      "After the news that Reuveni had been put on leave became public, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement to CBS News that \"every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.\"",
      "Less than a week later, Reuveni was fired.",
      "Reuveni's attorneys said that the consequences of the Justice Department actions alleged by Reuveni \"have grave impacts not only for the safety of individuals removed from the country in violation of court orders, but also for the constitutional rights and protections of all persons \u2013 citizen and noncitizen alike \u2013 who are potential victims of flagrant, deliberate disregard of due process and the rule of law by the agency charged with upholding it.\"",
      "The whistleblower account was first reported by the New York Times.",
      "In a post on X following the article's publication, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Reuveni's account contains \"falsehoods purportedly made by a disgruntled former employee,\" and said he was in the meeting where Bove allegedly said he would not follow court orders. Blanche said that \"at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed.\"",
      "The Justice Department also defended Bove's handling of the deportation cases.",
      "\"Having entered office with a mandate to end the invasion of illegal alien criminals, Emil Bove has been a relentless advocate for the enforcement of our immigration laws and the removal of violent killers, terrorist gang leaders, and child predators, all of whom should never have been allowed to invade our borders, which is why Emil will be an outstanding federal judge to keep our country safe and uphold the rights of all Americans,\" the department said in a statement.",
      "A statement by Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Reuveni's claims \"not only speak to Mr. Bove's failure to fulfill his ethical obligations as a lawyer, but demonstrate that his activities are part of a broader pattern by President Trump and his allies to undermine the Justice Department's commitment to the rule of law.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-strikes-iran-cbs-news-opinion-poll/",
    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 17:58:09 -0400",
    "summary": "Most would see an Iranian nuclear weapon as a serious threat but also voice concern about a wider war.",
    "story": [
      "As the public assesses the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, at least three things are in play.",
      "One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be.",
      "Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however \u2014 and netting out to a majority overall \u2014 there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war.",
      "Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon.",
      "Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran.",
      "Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern.",
      "Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.",
      "Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall.",
      "A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran.",
      "Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall.",
      "Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.)",
      "The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war.",
      "Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel.",
      "Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon.",
      "Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession. That sentiment has not abated in recent months.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,720 U.S. adults interviewed between June 22-24, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The FBI is intensifying its focus and resources on counterterrorism threats after the United States\u00a0carried out strikes\u00a0on three Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend, and Iran countered with an attack of its own on an American air base in Qatar.",
      "Two sources told CBS News that a memo was distributed to FBI field office directors in the past 48 hours instructing them to focus resources on terror threats, including domestically.",
      "The memo follows a separate, unrelated internal report sent earlier this month in which the FBI forecasted that it would need to concentrate resources on Iran in the coming months. The report stated that a priority would be \"helping to apply maximum pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran and its terror proxies. This includes investigating, prosecuting, and otherwise disrupting financial and logistical networks, operatives, and front groups; targeting related foreign-based hacking operations; targeting the leaders and members of terrorist groups and terror proxies responsible for capturing, harming, or killing American citizens, and seizing illicit Iranian oil exports.\"",
      "It comes after the FBI has received multiple internal complaints from employees about being pulled off counterterrorism and counterintelligence tasks to focus on immigration enforcement, according to two other sources who spoke to CBS News. The complaints warned of pressure being placed on FBI agents to \"maximize the number of immigration arrests.\"",
      "An FBI spokesperson said the bureau \"does not comment on specific operational adjustments or personnel decisions. However, we continuously assess and realign our resources to respond to the most pressing threats to our national security and to ensure the safety of the American people.\"",
      "President Trump has made a crackdown on illegal immigration and mass deportations a focal point of his second term. He has\u00a0invoked a wartime law\u00a0known as the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport migrants,\u00a0rolled back\u00a0programs\u00a0shielding people\u00a0from the threat of deportation, and approached other countries about\u00a0accepting migrants who are not their citizens.",
      "Workplace arrests by immigration authorities in Los Angeles County earlier this month sparked protests and\u00a0led the president to call\u00a0roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard into federal service under a law known as\u00a0Title 10. His administration has also\u00a0deployed more than 700 active-duty Marines\u00a0to Los Angeles.",

      "\"Since the start of the conflict, we have seen media releases by foreign terrorist organizations ... some of which have called for violence against US assets and personnel in the Middle East,\" the advisory warned. \"Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks.\"",
      "The U.S. carried out precision strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Mr. Trump announced in an address to the nation Saturday night. He said the assault, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, aimed to cripple Iran's nuclear program.",
      "In response to the strikes, Iran\u00a0launched a ballistic missile attack\u00a0targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday. Mr. Trump indicated that the U.S. was given advance warning of the Iranian attack, and there were no American or Qatari casualties.",
      "The attack came after Israel\u00a0launched strikes\u00a0against Iranian nuclear and military targets starting June 13, which prompted missile counterattacks by Iran. As of Tuesday,\u00a0at least 974 people\u00a0have been killed in Iran, according to the organization Human Rights Activists in Iran.

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Monday the federal government will fund an effort by Florida to set up immigration detention centers, which include a proposed site in the Everglades that state officials have dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"",
      "Noem said the detention facilities in Florida will be funded \"in large part\" by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's shelter and services program, an initiative created by Congress to support groups and cities receiving migrants and asylum-seekers released from federal custody along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Primarily charged with overseeing disaster relief efforts, FEMA is an agency within the Department of Homeland Security that has faced significant cuts under the second Trump administration.",
      "\"Under President Trump's leadership, we are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens,\" Noem said in a statement to CBS News. \"We will expand facilities and bed space in just days, thanks to our partnership with Florida.\"",
      "Officials in Tallahassee first announced plans to help the federal government expand its capacity to hold detainees awaiting deportation last week.",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said a largely abandoned airfield in the Everglades would be repurposed as a detention facility to house immigrants living in the U.S. illegally with criminal records. He dubbed it \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" saying any detainees seeking to escape would face alligators and pythons in the treacherous wetlands surrounding the site.",
      "On Monday, Uthmeier announced the federal government had \"approved\" the state's plan to build \"Alligator Alcatraz\" and other facilities that he said could collectively house as many as 5,000 detainees. He said the facilities could start receiving detainees early next month, calling them temporary.",
      "\"There's really nowhere to go. If you're housed there, if you're detained there, there's no way in, no way out,\" Uthmeier said in an interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson, describing the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" facility.",

      "As the Trump administration has aggressively expanded immigration arrests throughout the country, its efforts have been aided by law enforcement officials in red states like Louisiana, Texas and Florida. In Texas, state National Guard troops have been deputized as immigration officers and given the authority to enforce federal immigration laws.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congressional Republicans are racing to meet a self-imposed Fourth of July deadline to send a massive tax and domestic policy bill to President Trump as he dials up pressure on lawmakers, even as several major disputes have yet to be resolved.",
      "On his way to The Hague on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called on lawmakers to stay in Washington until they can resolve their issues and get the bill \u2014 which extends the president's 2017 tax cuts and includes much of his second-term agenda \u2014 to his desk.",
      "\"NO ONE GOES ON VACATION UNTIL IT'S DONE,\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The last scheduled day in session for both chambers before they leave town for the holiday is Friday, leaving them with little time to reach their goal.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who met with Senate Republicans Tuesday, told reporters after the meeting that they're \"on track\" for a vote Friday on the bill, adding that he expects it can get to the president's desk by July 4.",
      "Still, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, threatened to keep senators in Washington over the recess as several Republicans cast doubt about the upper chamber's ability to finish their work before the deadline.",
      "Thune told reporters Monday that the Senate is \"on schedule\" to vote by the end of the week.",
      "The bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u00a0narrowly passed the House last month, but Senate Republicans are making changes in order to navigate the party's tight 53-47 margin in the upper chamber.",
      "On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he told House Republicans to \"keep your schedules flexible\" as the Senate looks to send the legislation back to the lower chamber for approval. The Louisiana Republican predicted the Senate could pass the bill by Friday or Saturday. The timing of a House vote would eat into next week's recess.",
      "\"There's nothing more important that we should be involved in and can be involved in than getting the one big, beautiful bill to the president's desk,\" Johnson said at his weekly news conference.",
      "Parliamentarian rulings",
      "Days before an expected vote, the Senate's final version has yet to come together. The Senate's rulekeeper has been looking through the legislation to determine whether any provisions violate the upper chamber's rules.",
      "The Senate parliamentarian advised that several controversial provisions would violate the Byrd Rule, which requires that the legislation only include provisions that have a direct impact on federal spending, according to Senate Budget Committee Democrats.",
      "Provisions that did not make the cut are subject to a 60-vote threshold, compared with the 51 votes needed under the reconciliation process.",
      "Republicans can't include language that would make it harder to challenge the government's actions in court. The provision limited the ability of federal courts to delay or halt the government's policies by requiring people suing the federal government to post a bond to cover the potential costs and damages incurred by the government.",
      "The parliamentarian determined that a provision to bar immigrants who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents from receiving food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, should also be removed.",
      "The parliamentarian also rejected a proposal championed by Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah that would have sold off millions of acres of public lands.",
      "Other provisions struck from the bill include the sale of electric vehicles used by the United States Postal Service and several immigration-related measures, including limiting certain funding for \"sanctuary cities\" and allowing states to conduct border security and immigration enforcement.",
      "But the parliamentarian did allow Republicans to keep a 10-year moratorium on state laws regulating artificial intelligence.",
      "SALT sticking points",
      "As the Senate lurches toward a vote on the bill, disagreement over the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, has persisted. But Bessent said Tuesday afternoon that he expected a solution on what's become one of the biggest sticking points will be reached in the next 24 to 48 hours.",
      "While the House measure increases the deduction from $10,000 to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000, the Senate Finance Committee's version that was unveiled last week proposes permanently extending the $10,000 cap. The chasm sparked pushback among blue-state House Republicans, who have threatened to withhold their support should the Senate approve the changes and send it back to the House.",
      "Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, who formerly served in the House and has worked as a messenger between the two chambers, told reporters Monday that \"neither side is going to love where we're at, but it's going to be acceptable.\"",
      "\"The Senate wants to go further to the right and the SALT caucus wants to go further to the left,\" Mullin said. \"We're going to find, I think, hopefully some place right in the middle that both sides can live with.\"",
      "Medicaid and the provider tax",
      "Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding by lowering provider taxes \u2014 which states use to help fund their share of Medicaid costs \u2014 from 6% to 3.5% by 2031, after the House sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes. But the move has sparked pushback, and threatened to complicate the delicate balance reached in the House.",
      "A group of 16 House Republicans penned a letter to Thune and Johnson Tuesday opposing the Senate's changes to the House-passed legislation on Medicaid. The moderates argued that the House approach \"reflects a more pragmatic and compassionate standard,\" pointing in particular to the provisions restricting the provider tax within the Senate legislation.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, has voiced opposition to the provider tax changes, and said more senators spoke up at Tuesday's lunch against the Senate's provider tax proposal.",
      "Fiscal hawks speak out",

      "Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who initially threatened to withhold their support for the House-passed legislation have suggested they would tank the Senate's changes to the bill. And a number of Senate Republicans have voiced strong opposition to the legislation's impact on the deficit.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday heads to a whirlwind NATO summit at the Hague, Netherlands, hours after he announced that Iran and Israel had reached a ceasefire agreement.",
      "Several hours after the ceasefire was to take effect, Mr. Trump told reporters as he left for the summit that both Israel and Iran had violated it. Then, after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president said Israel would not bomb Iran again, and that \"the ceasefire is in effect.\"",
      "The president hoped to secure during the summit a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense. But a day before he was to arrive, the alliance had already agreed to the boost in defense spending, according to Matthew Whitaker, U.S. ambassador to NATO. He told reporters in a briefing Monday that as a result of Mr. Trump's leadership, NATO was \"on track\" to make that \"historic commitment\" of 5%.",
      "During the flight to the Netherlands, Mr. Trump posted an effusive note from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulating him on his actions in Iran and on the new NATO defense spending levels.",
      "\"[T]hank you for your decisive action in Iran,\" Rutte wrote. He called it \"truly extraordinary\" and said it was \"something no one else dared to do. It makes us all safer.\"",
      "And of the new spending, Rutte said, \"It was not easy, but we've got them all signed onto 5 percent!\" He called it an \"important moment for America and Europe,\" and told him, \"You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.\" A NATO spokesperson confirmed that Rutte had written the text to Mr. Trump.",
      "The U.S. spent roughly 3.4% of GDP on defense in 2023, but the president has said he thinks the U.S. should not have the same 5% target.",
      "\"We've been supporting NATO so long, in many cases, I believe, paying almost 100% of the cost,\" he told reporters Friday. \"So, I don't think we should, but I think that the NATO countries should, absolutely.\"",
      "There is no clear timeline for the 5% commitment, however, and reaching that threshold could extend into the 2030s for some NATO countries, fueling criticism that the 5% promise could be an empty one.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who is at the Hague with a bipartisan group of senators, expressed optimism about the allies' efforts to raise their defense spending.",
      "\"I think everybody is united around this goal and trying to figure out how fast we can get there,\" she told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe, who is also in the Netherlands for the summit.",
      "Aside from the conflict in the Middle East, Russia's war on Ukraine continues to be a top topic of concern for NATO members. It is not yet clear whether the U.S. will support language citing Russia as the main threat to NATO in its communique \u2014 Whitaker avoided directly answering a reporter's question about this.",
      "\"Negotiations regarding the communique are still underway, so I'm not going to be able to comment directly on the specific language,\" Whitaker said, adding, \"I fully expect that the summit statement will be direct, to the point, and reflect the Allies' current threat assessment and the need for collective defense and the individual defense of all Allies.\"",
      "He said that the U.S. is \"calling for restraint and [urging] both parties to avoid escalation,\" and he went on to say that the U.S. is \"engaged at the highest levels\" and backs direct talks between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Shaheen said she'd like to see the U.S. \"put a lot more pressure on Russia and Vladimir Putin,\" and she added, \"I think we need to pass the tough sanctions bill that we have in the Senate that has 82 sponsors.\"",
      "Shortly before the summit, on Saturday, the U.S. carried out strikes targeting\u00a0three Iranian sites\u00a0believed to be key to\u00a0Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was limited.\u00a0Iran fired\u00a0more than a dozen missiles at a\u00a0U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Mr. Trump called the retaliatory strikes \"very weak,\" and he said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\" Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei also pointed out in a social media post after the Iranian strikes, \"We didn't harm anyone.\"",
      "Within hours, Mr. Trump made the announcement that Iran and Israel would implement a ceasefire and shortly bring the war to an end.",
      "The NATO summit will feature a single two-and-a-half-hour session, instead of multiple sessions. Mr. Trump also plans to meet separately with several world leaders on the sidelines, a senior U.S. official told reporters on a conference call Friday.",
      "The president left for the summit early Tuesday morning and returns Wednesday.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 12:12:28 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court agreed to pause a judge's order that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without first providing them due process.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday lifted a lower court order that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to countries that are not their places of origin without first giving them the chance to raise fears of torture, persecution or death.",
      "The order from the high court is a victory for the Trump administration, which has faced recent setbacks from the justices in its efforts to swiftly deport migrants as part of its crackdown on immigration. The Supreme Court's order clears the way for the Trump administration to resume deportations to third countries while legal proceedings continue.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the court's decision Monday regarding third country removals.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Sotomayor accused the federal government of \"flagrantly unlawful conduct\" and called the majority's decision to intervene at this stage in the case \"inexcusable.\"",
      "\"The government has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard,\" she wrote, joined by Kagan and Jackson.",
      "Sotomayor said that the court is \"rewarding lawlessness\" with a decision that will undermine the foundational principle of due process.",
      "\"Apparently, the court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in farflung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a district court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled,\" Sotomayor said. \"That use of discretion is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security called the Supreme Court ruling \"a victory for the safety and security of the American people.\"",
      "\"DHS can now execute its lawful authority and remove illegal aliens to a country willing to accept them,\" the statement read in part. \"Fire up the deportation planes.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's latest order came in a court fight over the Trump administration's efforts to swiftly deport some migrants to third countries, or countries other than the ones designated on an order of removal. As part of Mr. Trump's immigration agenda and plans for mass deportations, his administration has approached nations like Costa Rica, Panama and Rwanda about accepting migrants who are not their citizens.",
      "The administration has also already entered into an arrangement with the government of El Salvador to detain Venezuelan migrants who it claims are gang members, though a \"60 Minutes\" investigation found most have no apparent criminal records. The migrants have been confined at the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT, often under a 1798 wartime law.",
      "The Supreme Court previously said in a\u00a0pair\u00a0of\u00a0decisions\u00a0arising from other emergency appeals that migrants facing deportation under that wartime law must receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removals in court.",
      "Four migrants from Latin America filed a broader lawsuit in March on behalf of a nationwide class of all people potentially subject to third-country removals and argued they are entitled to notice and an opportunity to contest their removals on the grounds they fear persecution, torture and death.",
      "In the weeks after the suit was filed, administration officials were engaged in a simmering showdown with a Boston-based federal judge, who in April found that the government had violated migrants' due process rights and blocked immigration authorities from quickly removing them to third countries unless certain steps are first taken.",
      "The judge, Brian Murphy, said the government first had to give the affected migrants written notice of the third country to which they may be deported and a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise fears of torture, persecution or death in that country.",
      "Third-country deportations challenged in court",
      "Since Murphy issued his nationwide injunction in April, immigration lawyers have notified him that a group of migrants from Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines were being prepared to be deported to Libya and Saudi Arabia, though the deportation flights do not appear to have happened. Murphy then concluded last month that the Trump administration violated his order when it attempted to swiftly deport a group of men with criminal histories to war-torn South Sudan with less than 24 hours notice and no chance for them to raise fear-based claims.",
      "South Sudan endured a bloody years-long civil war shortly after gaining independence in 2011, and the United Nations\u00a0warns\u00a0violence has escalated in recent months. The State Department has\u00a0warned\u00a0Americans not to travel to the country due to \"crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.",
      "Murphy halted the deportations to South Sudan, and the men are being held at a U.S. naval base in nearby Djibouti, a small country on the Horn of Africa. The judge said federal immigration authorities must give six of the deportees \"reasonable fear\" interviews to determine whether they are at risk of persecution or torture.",
      "Murphy left it up to the Department of Homeland Security to either conduct the interviews within the U.S. or abroad, but said the department had to retain \"custody and control\" over the men.",
      "A U.S. immigration official revealed in a June 4 filing that the migrants are being held in a conference room in a converted shipping container on the naval base and are guarded by 11 ICE officers. The official, Mellissa Harper, described in an affidavit the conditions facing the migrants and the immigration authorities, who she said have felt ill since arriving in Djibouti, which uses burn pits to dispose of trash and human waste.",
      "The ICE officers were unable to take anti-malaria medication for up to 72 hours before arriving in Djibouti and have experienced coughing, difficulty breathing, fever and achy joints, Harper said. They were also warned by defense officials that they were in \"imminent danger\" of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen and ICE officers do not have body armor or other gear to put on in case of an attack, she said.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court last month to pause Murphy's injunction, which Solicitor General D. John Sauer said was thwarting the administration's attempts to deport what it describes as the \"worst of the worst illegal aliens.\"",
      "\"Those judicially created procedures are currently wreaking havoc on the third-country removal process,\" he wrote in a filing. \"In addition to usurping the executive's authority over immigration policy, the injunction disrupts sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts.\"",
      "He said Murphy's injunction created a \"diplomatic and logistical morass.\"",
      "But lawyers for the migrants at risk of deportation to third countries said the criteria laid out in the lower court's injunction are mandated by federal law and regulations, U.S. treaty obligations and the Constitution.",
      "The order, they said, \"simply requires defendants to comply with the law when carrying them out.\"",
      "The immigration lawyers said over the past weeks, the Trump administration \"repeatedly sought to remove people as a punitive measure, to some of the most dangerous places on the planet, and with only hours' notice.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has overseen a sweeping immigration crackdown since he returned to the White House for a second term. The president's administration has since moved to end a Temporary Protected Status program that shielded 350,000 Venezuelan migrants from the threat of deportation and to revoke the legal status of roughly 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Supreme Court has allowed him to move forward with terminating both of those programs while legal proceedings continue.",
      "Mr. Trump also has sought to use the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans who his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua, though several courts have ruled that the president cannot use the law to detain or remove certain migrants.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 11:36:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is testifying before Congress this week, said tariffs are \"likely to push up prices.\"",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his view that the central bank should keep interest rates steady for now, citing inflation risks from U.S. tariffs.",
      "Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony\u00a0Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump\u00a0to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December.",
      "In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation \"could be short lived\" or \"could instead be more persistent.\" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates.\u00a0But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said in the testimony.",
      "He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become \"an ongoing inflation problem.\"",
      "Powell is \"unbending under pressure,\" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. \"Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations.\"",
      "Fed officials push for cut",
      "Two Fed officials \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller \u2014 have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30.",
      "On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise.",
      "\"It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,\" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. \"Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting.\"",
      "Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize.",
      "\"The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,\" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, \"We will get to a place where we cut rates.\"",
      "At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows.",
      "\"Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note. \"The most likely next date for a cut is 9/17 or 10/29.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0House Democrats on Tuesday elected Rep. Robert Garcia of California as the new ranking member of the House Oversight Committee following the death of Rep. Gerry Connolly last month.",
      "\"I am incredibly honored to have been obviously elected the ranking member for the Oversight Committee,\" Garcia told reporters after the vote, saying the panel would get \"immediately to work,\" while citing an opportunity to \"continue holding the corruption of Donald Trump accountable and also doing incredible work on government reform.\"",
      "Though Democrats are currently in the minority, as the new ranking member, Garcia would be in line to chair the Oversight Committee if Democrats retake the House in 2026, halfway through President Trump's second term. During Mr. Trump's first term, the committee led numerous investigations into the Trump administration after Democrats won the House in 2018.",
      "Connolly's death\u00a0came weeks after the Virginia Democrat announced that he would not seek reelection in 2026 and would be\u00a0stepping back\u00a0from his post as the top Democrat on the committee because his cancer had returned. He was 75 years old.",
      "Connolly had been elected to the top committee post months earlier, as the committee's members rejected a push by some to tap a younger generation of lawmakers to lead the party on top panels. Connolly defeated 35-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to become the ranking member of the powerful committee.",
      "Oversight Committee Democrats vied for the ranking member post after Connolly announced his departure from the role. And though Ocasio-Cortez opted not to seek the post, having left the committee months earlier, the contest quickly became crowded.",
      "Garcia, a 47-year-old who currently serves as Democratic Caucus Leadership Representative, initially faced off against three other Democrats \u2014 Reps. Stephen Lynch of of Massachusetts, Kweisi Mfume of Maryland and Jasmine Crockett of Texas \u2014 for the post. Lynch, 70, served as the acting ranking member, while Mfume, 76, is high in the committee's ranks. And Crockett, 44, is seen as a rising star in the caucus, known for viral moments on the committee.",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters after the vote that \"all four candidates were excellent,\" saying that while all of them could have done a \"great job internally,\" the question revolved around who could most successfully share the caucus' message.",
      "\"It came down to two candidates, both excellent,\" Pelosi added.",
      "In a caucus vote Tuesday, Garcia defeated Lynch for the top post in a 150-63 vote.",
      "The selection of a new top Democrat on the committee comes after a shakeup in committee leadership assignments in the party at the beginning of this Congress illustrated tensions over a potential generational shift. Long-serving top Democrats on the Judiciary, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committees stepped away from the top spots amid challenges from younger Democrats as the party prepared to counter Republican efforts with a GOP trifecta in Washington.",
      "Garcia said he brings experience to the role, while also acknowledging the party's interest in \"expanding the tent\" and bringing in \"newer voices to the leadership and to this committee.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roadless-rule-national-forests-logging-reversal/",
    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 07:46:50 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration plans to rescind the \"roadless rule\" that impedes logging on 59 million acres of national forests, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins says.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday.",
      "The \"roadless rule\" adopted in the last days of Bill Clinton's presidency in 2001 long has chafed Republican lawmakers, especially in the West where national forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.",
      "The rule impeded road construction and \"responsible timber production\" that would have helped reduce the risk of major wildfires, Rollins said at the annual meeting of the Western Governors Association.",
      "\"This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation's forests,\" Rollins said.",
      "Scientists say worsening wildfires are driven by a combination of climate change that warms and dries out forests, less logging and decades of fire suppression that has enabled fuels to build up.",
      "The roadless rule has affected 30% of national forest lands nationwide, or about 59 million acres, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency over the Forest Service.",
      "State roadless-area rules in Idaho and Colorado supersede the boundaries of the 2001 roadless rule, according to the USDA, meaning not all national forest land would be affected by a rescission.",
      "Rollins' announcement Monday was a first step in a process to rescind the roadless rule to be followed by a formal notice in coming weeks, the Agriculture Department said in a statement.",
      "The announcement comes amid recent talk of selling off federal lands in part to improve housing affordability, an idea criticized by Democrats as a public land grab.",
      "Selling public lands drew a mixed reception from governors at the same meeting. They expressed enthusiasm for economic development and worries about curtailing public access to shared lands.",
      "Speaking to a panel of governors and hotel-ballroom audience, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described a new \"era of abundance\" on public lands under President Trump's administration in the development of natural resources, including energy and critical minerals needed for domestic production of cellphones, computers and vehicles.",
      "Immediate opposition appears",
      "Outside the hotel entrance in downtown Santa Fe, several hundred protesters filled the street to denounce efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting \"not for sale\" and carrying signs that read, \"This land belongs to you and me\" and \"keep our public land free for future generations.\"",
      "On social media, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally, called the reversal on roadless areas \"another example of President Trump fulfilling his campaign promise to open up resources for responsible development.\"",
      "The roadless area change meanwhile marks a sharp turnaround from the Biden administration, which far from opening up more areas to timber harvesting sought to do more to restrict logging and protect old-growth forests.",
      "Environmental groups, who want to keep restrictions on logging and road-building for places such as Alaska's Tongass National Forest, criticized the possibility of rolling back the protections.",
      "\"Any attempt to revoke it is an attack on the air and water we breathe and drink, abundant recreational opportunities which millions of people enjoy each year, havens for wildlife and critical buffers for communities threatened by increasingly severe wildfire seasons,\" Josh Hicks, conservation campaigns director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement on the USDA's plans.",
      "Contrary to what Rollins said about reducing wildfire risk, logging exacerbates climate change and makes wildfires more intense, said Center for Western Priorities political director Rachael Hamby.",
      "\"This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us,\" Hamby said in a statement.",
      "In Alaska, home of the country's largest national forest, the Tongass, the roadless rule has long been a focus of litigation, with state political leaders supporting an exemption to the rule that they argue impedes economic opportunities.",
      "During the latter part of Mr. Trump's first term, the federal government lifted restrictions on logging and road-building in the Tongass, something the Biden administration later reversed.",
      "Mr. Trump in January called for reverting to the policy from his first term as part of an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at boosting oil and gas development, mining and logging in the state.",

      "Update: This story was published before President Trump, on Tuesday morning, accused both Israel and Iran of violating the ceasefire he had announced just hours earlier. Then, after speaking with Israel's prime minister, Mr. Trump said Israel would not continue attacking Iran and declared, \"the Ceasefire is in effect.\"\u00a0Read more here.",
      "Israel and Iran said Tuesday they are complying with a ceasefire agreement announced by President Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump said on Truth Social just after 1 a.m. ET Tuesday that a ceasefire he announced earlier between the two countries \"IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!\"",
      "The Israeli government announced that, \"In light of achieving the objectives of the operation, and in full coordination with President Trump, Israel has agreed to the president's proposal for a bilateral ceasefire. Israel will respond forcefully to any violation of the ceasefire.\"",
      "At about the same time, Iranian state television said the ceasefire had begun.",
      "Mr. Trump posted Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed on a \"Complete and Total CEASEFIRE\", a move he said would end the more than weeklong conflict between the two countries.",
      "The ceasefire was to take hold in stages, the president said.",
      "Under the ceasefire announced by Mr. Trump Monday evening, Iran was to stop striking Israel in six hours (at midnight ET on Tuesday), and Israel was to stop striking Iran 12 hours after that (at noon ET Tuesday). Then, after another 12 hours, or at midnight ET Wednesday, the war would be considered over, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces had reported a series of missile barrages from Iran both before and after Mr. Trump's midnight deadline for Iran to halt the strikes. Israel did not specify when the missiles were launched, and it's unclear whether the latest missile strikes violated the terms laid out by Mr. Trump.",
      "Hours after Mr. Trump's initial post, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi suggested on X that Iran had stopped its strikes on Israel at 4 a.m. Tehran time (8:30 p.m. ET Monday). Iran's military operations \"continued until the very last minute,\" he wrote.",
      "But Araghchi also wrote that \"there is NO 'agreement' on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations,\" though he added that Iran didn't plan to continue strikes on Israel if Israel also ceased strikes at the same time. The timeline laid out by Mr. Trump called for Israel to stop striking about 15 hours after the time specified by Araghchi.",
      "\"The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later,\" Araghchi wrote.",
      "In another Truth Social post later Monday night, following the Iranian foreign minister's comments, Mr. Trump wrote, in part, that Israel and Iran \"came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, 'PEACE!' I knew the time was NOW.\"",
      "Prior to Araghchi's comments, a senior White House official told CBS News both sides had agreed to a ceasefire, with Israel agreeing as long as there are no further Iranian strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump communicated directly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while several other administration officials \u2014 Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff \u2014 communicated with Iran through direct and indirect channels, the White House official said.",
      "Qatar helped broker a deal, another White House official said. Mr. Trump had asked the Qatari Emir to get Iran to agree to a ceasefire. Vance coordinated with the Qatari prime minister on details, and Iran agreed to the ceasefire after speaking to the prime minister. The official said the direct talks with Iran occurred after Iran's strike on Al Udeid Air Base.",
      "The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13 with Israel launching airstrikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes \u2014 which killed several top Iranian military officials \u2014 prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel.",
      "As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran\u00a0said in a statement. The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information.",
      "Iran's attacks have killed at least 24 people in Israel, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Iran called its response \"devastating and powerful,\" but Mr. Trump called it \"very weak.\" The president said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\"",
      "Dispute over Iran's nuclear program still lingers",
      "It's not clear how the ceasefire announcement will impact a broader dispute over the fate of Iran's nuclear program.",
      "Israel's campaign was primarily aimed at Iran's nuclear program, as the country's stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium has grown rapidly in recent months, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "Israel has alleged Iran was secretly \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\" But earlier this year, U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Iran was not making nuclear weapons, though \"pressure has probably built\" for Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to reauthorize the country's nuclear weapons program.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week he believed the intelligence community was \"wrong\" about Iran's nuclear ambitions, telling reporters, \"I think they were very close to having one.\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the issue \"irrelevant\" in an interview Sunday\u00a0on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" saying Iranian officials \"have everything they need to build the weapon.\"",
      "Iran has long insisted its uranium enrichment program is peaceful.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has blocked President Trump's administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation.",
      "U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston struck down on Friday a policy change that could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars in research funding. The universities argued the move threatened critical work in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, semiconductors and other technology fields.",
      "Talwani said the change, announced by the NSF in May, was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.",
      "An email by the Associated Press on Saturday to the NSF was not immediately returned.",
      "At issue are \"indirect\" costs, expenses such as building maintenance and computer systems that aren't linked directly to a specific project. Currently, the NSF determines each grant recipient's indirect costs individually and is supposed to cover actual expenses.",
      "The Trump administration has dismissed indirect expenses as \"overhead\" and capped them for future awards by the NSF to universities at 15% of the funding for direct research costs.",
      "The University of California, one of the plaintiffs, estimated the change would cost it just under $100 million a year.",
      "Judges have blocked similar caps that the Trump administration placed on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health.",
      "In a recent interview on \"CBS Mornings Plus,\" Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors \u2014 whose organization sued the Trump administration over federal funding cuts to Columbia University \u2014 said examples of research that has been cut includes a research project that looks at discerning when AI is making fake videos or a project that examines when people start to believe lies that are repeatedly told.",

      "French scientists have discovered a new blood type in a woman from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, France's blood supply agency announced Friday.",
      "The woman is the only known carrier of a new blood type, dubbed \"Gwada negative,\" the French Blood Establishment (EFS) said. The discovery was made 15 years after researchers received a blood sample from a patient who was undergoing routine tests ahead of a surgery.",
      "\"The EFS has just discovered the 48th blood group system in the world!\" the agency said in a statement on social network LinkedIn, adding that the discovery was officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion in early June.",

    "summary": "A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during ramp-up to an expected engine test firing at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast. It's an apparent major setback for the program.",
    "story": [
      "The dramatic explosion of a SpaceX Starship upper stage rocket during a test at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf coast late Wednesday may have been triggered by the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Thursday.",
      "The sudden explosion, fueled by ignition of methane propellant, created a huge fireball, billowing clouds of smoke and brilliant arcs of flaming debris shooting out like burning chunks of lava in a volcanic eruption.",
      "The blast was reminiscent of the sudden explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fueling at Cape Canaveral in August 2016 that destroyed an Israeli communications satellite. The Falcon 9 failure was blamed on the rupture of a high-pressure helium tank, known as a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV.",
      "But the company said there is \"no commonality\" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship.",
      "\"Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,\" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. \"If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design.\"",
      "The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week.",
      "Such \"hotfire\" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th \"integrated flight test.\"",
      "But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing.",
      "The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast.",
      "The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted.",
      "\"On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,\" SpaceX said in a statement on X.",
      "\"A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials.",
      "\"There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area.\"",
      "What impact the explosion might have had on the infrastructure at the test sight was not immediately known.",
      "NASA counting on Starship for moon mission",
      "SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages.",
      "The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were mostly successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere.",
      "NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years.",
      "It will not be easy.",
      "To get the Human Landing System \u2014 HLS \u2014 Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a \"depot\" Starship, undock, and return to Earth.",
      "The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule.",
      "SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon.",
      "NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the \"high teens.\"",
      "It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it.",
      "Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space \u2014 a task never attempted at this scale \u2014 SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space.",
      "No such technology has yet been tested in the space environment.",
      "The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule.",
      "The latest mishap renews concern in some quarters about SpaceX's ability to get all of that done in just two to three years. But SpaceX has proven skeptics wrong before and NASA continues to express support for the company and the path forward to the Artemis 3 lumar landing mission.",
      "\"Testing is a critical part of a development program, and we have confidence SpaceX will investigate every aspect of what went wrong to fix the issue,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "While pointing out that the moon lander planned for its Artemis program is different from the developmental Starship currently being tested, the agency added that \"NASA fully supports SpaceX as the company prepares Starship for future missions.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/plastic-bag-bans-fees-curbs-litter-study-says/",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers conducted the first systematic review of policies around the U.S. to limit plastic bag use.",
    "story": [
      "State and local policies to regulate the use of plastic bags have significantly reduced how many of them are found littered along U.S. shorelines \u2014 potentially cutting that type of waste in half in certain places, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science found.",
      "More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes \u2013 and if they did, to what extent.",
      "Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations.",
      "\"When we found the database that had information on different shoreline cleanups, we realized we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,\" Oremus said in a statement. \"And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy.\"",
      "These results bring fresh insights to an issue that gained prominence over the last decade or so, as awareness spread about the harms of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments. Oremus said it's the first attempt to comprehensively review the effectiveness of plastic bag policies on shoreline litter, using a database of global shoreline cleanup initiatives from the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy.",
      "Since 2018, more than 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of policy to either ban or limit the use of plastic bags, according\u00a0to a report by the United Nations Environment Program. The U.S. doesn't have a federal bag policy, but individual towns, cities and states have policies of their own.",
      "Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed \"single use\" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered \"reusable\" under partial bans, \"there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use.\"",
      "In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide \"preemption\" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all.",
      "During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said.",
      "\"Our findings make clear that plastic bag policies have been broadly effective in limiting\u2014but not eliminating\u2014shoreline plastic bag debris in jurisdictions where it was previously prevalent,\" Oremus and Papp wrote in the study. They also found evidence that suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective at limiting shoreline litter than bans, especially partial bans, but understanding why would require more research.",

      "Strapped into a new SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule making its maiden flight, Whitson, test pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of India, European Space Agency astronaut S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski of Poland and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu roared away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at  2:31 a.m. EDT.",
      "Lighting up the overnight sky for miles around, the Falcon 9 first stage propelled the Crew Dragon out of the lower atmosphere along a northeasterly trajectory paralleling the East Coast of the United States.",
      "The booster then fell away and flew itself back to a pinpoint landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to close out its second flight, SpaceX's 467th successful recovery and its 64th in Florida.",
      "The Crew Dragon spacecraft, serial number C213, is the fifth and final addition to SpaceX's fleet of astronaut ferry ships built for NASA trips to the space station and for privately-funded commercial missions to low-Earth orbit.",
      "The climb to orbit went smoothly, and the capsule was released to fly on its own about nine-and-a-half minutes after liftoff. Whitson then revealed the name of the new spacecraft: Crew Dragon Grace.",
      "\"We  had an incredible ride uphill, and now we'd like to set our course for  the International Space Station aboard the newest member of the Dragon  fleet, our spacecraft named Grace. ... Grace reminds us that spaceflight  is not just a feat of engineering,  but an act of goodwill to the  benefit of every human everywhere.\"",
      "Axiom Space provides \"private astronaut missions,\" or PAMs, to the International Space Station on a commercial basis. As the company's director of human spaceflight, Whitson, a retired astronaut with three NASA flights to her credit, is making her second flight for Axiom Space.",
      "It's not known what her crew's space agencies or governments paid for their flights, but Axiom passenger seats for space station visits typically sell for around $65 million to $70 million each. That covers the cost of nearly a year of NASA-sanctioned astronaut training, launch and a two-week stay aboard the station before returning to Earth with an ocean splashdown.",
      "The crew originally hoped to begin their mission on June 10, but the flight was held up by high winds offshore and then by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It was delayed again by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module.",
      "The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port.",
      "NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it, other than saying the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the closed-off PrK compartment to about 1.9 pounds per square inch.",
      "That presumably ensures the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station creates a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the PrK, isolating it from the rest of the station. But NASA has not confirmed the reason for the pressure change.",
      "Plans for the Ax-4 mission",
      "If all goes well, Crew Dragon Grace will catch up with the space station after a  28-hour rendezvous, moving in for docking at the space-facing port or  the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday.",
      "They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim.",
      "With a doctorate in biochemistry, Whitson, 65, retired from NASA in 2018 after three flights to the space station. Going into the Ax-4 flight, she had logged 675 days in space, including one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space.",
      "She ranks ninth in the world for cumulative time in space, No. 1 in the world among female astronauts and No. 1 overall among U.S. astronauts.",
      "As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker \u2014 seventh in the world overall \u2014 with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station.",
      "\"I think I'm somewhat addicted to space,\" she said in an interview with CBS News. \"I really like being there, and it's just exhilarating living in an environment so different than what we have here on Earth. And having adapted to that environment, it is fun for me to share my experience with the rookie flyers that are going with me.",
      "\"I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,\" she added.",
      "Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying \"we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for.\"",
      "The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three private astronaut missions.",
      "Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries. They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab.",
      "\"We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,\" Whitson said. \"The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station.",

      "\"Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,\" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. \"If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design.\"",
      "The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week.",
      "Such \"hotfire\" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th \"integrated flight test.\"",
      "But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing.",
      "The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast.",
      "The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted.",
      "\"On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,\" SpaceX said in a statement on X.",
      "\"A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials.",
      "\"There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area.\"",
      "What impact the explosion might have had on the infrastructure at the test sight was not immediately known.",
      "NASA counting on Starship for moon mission",
      "SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages.",
      "The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were mostly successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere.",
      "NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years.",
      "It will not be easy.",
      "To get the Human Landing System \u2014 HLS \u2014 Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a \"depot\" Starship, undock, and return to Earth.",
      "The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule.",
      "SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon.",
      "NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the \"high teens.\"",
      "It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it.",
      "Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space \u2014 a task never attempted at this scale \u2014 SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space.",
      "No such technology has yet been tested in the space environment.",
      "The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule.",
      "The latest mishap renews concern in some quarters about SpaceX's ability to get all of that done in just two to three years. But SpaceX has proven skeptics wrong before and NASA continues to express support for the company and the path forward to the Artemis 3 lumar landing mission.",
      "\"Testing is a critical part of a development program, and we have confidence SpaceX will investigate every aspect of what went wrong to fix the issue,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "While pointing out that the moon lander planned for its Artemis program is different from the developmental Starship currently being tested, the agency added that \"NASA fully supports SpaceX as the company prepares Starship for future missions.\"",
      "\"We look forward to the company delivering their Starship Human Landing System for NASA's Artemis 3 mission.\"",

    "story": [
      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "Authors had filed suit",
      "Anthropic cheered the ruling.",
      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",
      "The authors' attorneys declined comment.",
      "Other AI companies have also come under fire over the material they use to build their language learning models. The New York Times, for example, sued Open AI and Microsoft in 2023, claiming that the tech companies used millions of its articles to train their automated chatbots.",
      "At the same time, some media companies and publishers are also seeking compensation by licensing their content to companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.",

      "During a news conference Wednesday to cap off the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, the president said there may be a formal agreement at some point with Iran, but he doesn't believe one is necessary because their nuclear sites were \"blown up to kingdom come.\"",
      "\"We're going to talk to them next week, with Iran,\" the president told reporters at the press conference, adding that the U.S. is going to \"meet\" with them, although he didn't specify who will be involved in the meeting or where it will take place.",

In other words, that's destroyed. I said, 'Iran will not have nuclear.' Well, we blew it up. It's blown up to kingdom come. And so I don't feel very strongly about it. If we got a document, it wouldn't be bad.\"",
      "The president met with other world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, amid cautious optimism about the ceasefire the Trump administration brokered. The 12-day conflict left 28 people dead in Israel and hundreds in Iran.",
      "\"It was a 12-day war. And we think it's over,\" Mr. Trump said during the press conference. \"I don't think they're going to be going back at each other, I don't think so.\"",
      "\"Because I dealt with both, and they're both tired, exhausted,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They fought very, very hard and very viciously, very violently, and they were both satisfied to go home and get out. And can it start again? I guess some day it can, it could maybe start soon.\"",
      "At the summit, Mr. Trump said Iran's enrichment efforts were set back \"basically decades.\" The U.S.\u00a0strikes\u00a0on Iranian nuclear facilities were \"very, very successful. It's called 'obliteration,'\" he said at the news conference.\u00a0An initial classified assessment\u00a0by the Defense Intelligence Agency, however, estimated the strikes only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",

      "\"You're talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that's a big deal,\" NOAA meteorologist David Roth said.",
      "These maps show daily forecast highs across the country and their departures from average temperatures.",
      "Rain and severe storms in the forecast",
      "Along with cooler temperatures, the front moving in Wednesday will bring rain \u2014 and the chance of severe storms \u2014 to the Midwest, Eastern Seaboard and Southeast.",
      "How long will the heat wave last?",
      "The heat shifted into the Midwest and Ohio Valley and then arrived in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday, where it will linger through the first half of this week. The most extreme temperatures are expected to peak on Tuesday in many areas, but highs in the 90s continue through Wednesday before it finally breaks.",
      "Parts of the Northeast face a \"High Risk\" of extreme heat through the middle of this week, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "\"I cannot emphasize this enough: extreme heat can be deadly,\" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned. \"The best way to stay safe is stay indoors, with air conditioning. This is not the time to start training for the marathon.\"",
      "What constitutes a heat wave?",
      "A heat wave is a period of unusually hot weather that lasts more than two days, according to the National Weather Service. It often, but not always, covers a wide area and can expose a large number of people to hazardous heat, which can be extremely dangerous for vulnerable people, including children and the elderly.",
      "Warmer overnight low temperatures can make a heat wave especially dangerous, since they mean the body doesn't get as much of a chance to cool down.",
      "\"Your body needs a reprieve,\" Ashley Ward, director of the Heat Policy Innovation Hub at Duke University, told The Associated Press. \"You don't get that overnight, we start the next day at a deficit.\"",
      "When overnight temperatures stay above about 75 degrees Fahrenheit, she said, \"You start to see some pretty extraordinary outcomes with respect to heat illness and heat stroke, and even mortality.\"",
      "Climate change is making extreme temperatures and heat waves more frequent and longer-lasting, with the number of days above 95 degrees expected to increase across the U.S.",
      "How to stay safe during a heat wave",
      "Heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths, and heat-related illnesses increase significantly during extreme heat and high humidity events.",
      "The simplest way to way to avoid heat-related illnesses is to stay out of the sun and avoid extended time outdoors in extreme temperatures, experts say.",
      "If strenuous outdoor activities are unavoidable, you should dress for the heat and wear lightweight, loose-fitting and light-colored clothing, the National Weather Service recommended. You should also\u00a0stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, even if you're not thirsty.",
      "It's also important to be aware of any symptoms of overheating, which include muscle cramps, unusually heavy sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, weakness or nausea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If you experience these symptoms, one major sign to seek care is if the symptoms don't improve after getting into a cooler environment or hydrating, experts say.",

    "summary": "ICE officers detained the wife of a Marine Corps veteran in Louisiana during a routine immigration appointment.",
    "story": [
      "After U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained Marine Corps veteran Adrian Clouatre's wife last month, he doesn't know how to tell his children where their mother went.",
      "When his nearly 2-year-old son Noah asks for his mother before bed, Clouatre just tells him, \"Mama will be back soon.\" When his 3-month-old, breastfeeding daughter Lyn is hungry, he gives her a bottle of baby formula instead. He's worried how his newborn will bond with her mother absent skin-to-skin contact.",
      "His wife, Paola, is one of tens of thousands of people in custody and facing deportation as the Trump administration pushes for immigration officers to arrest 3,000 people a day. Earlier this month, arrests by ICE during President Trump's second term topped 100,000, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"They knew I was veteran, they just ripped her away from me and her children, from her breastfeeding, you know, newborn daughter, it's almost inhumane,\" Adrian Clouatre told CBS News.",
      "Even as Marine Corps recruiters promote enlistment as protection for families lacking legal status, directives for strict immigrant enforcement have cast away practices of deference previously afforded to military families, immigration law experts say. The federal agency tasked with helping military family members gain legal status now refers them for deportation, government memos show.",
      "To visit his wife, Adrian Clouatre has to make an eight-hour round trip from their home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to a rural ICE detention center in Monroe. Clouatre, who qualifies as a service-disabled veteran, goes every chance he can get.",
      "Paola Clouatre, a 25-year-old Mexican national whose mother brought her into the country seeking asylum more than a decade ago, met Adrian Clouatre, 26, at a Southern California nightclub during the final months of his five years of military service in 2022. Within a year, they had tattooed each other's names on their arms.",
      "After they married in 2024, Paola Clouatre sought a green card to legally live and work in the U.S. Adrian Clouatre said he is \"not a very political person\" but believes his wife deserved to live legally in the U.S.",
      "\"I'm all for 'get the criminals out of the country,' right?\" he said. \"But the people that are here working hard, especially the ones married to Americans \u2014 I mean, that's always been a way to secure a green card.\"",
      "Detained at a green card meeting",
      "The process to apply for Paola Clouatre's green card went smoothly at first, but eventually she learned ICE had issued an order for her deportation in 2018 after her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing.",
      "Clouatre and her mother had been estranged for years \u2014 Clouatre cycled out of homeless shelters as a teenager \u2014 and up until a couple of months ago, Clouatre had \"no idea\" about her mother's missed hearing or the deportation order, her husband said.",
      "Adrian Clouatre recalled that a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services staffer asked about the deportation order during a May 27 appointment as part of her green card application. After Paola Clouatre explained that she was trying to reopen her case, the staffer asked her and her husband to wait in the lobby for paperwork regarding a follow-up appointment, which her husband said he believed was a \"ploy.\"",
      "Soon, officers arrived and handcuffed Paola Clouatre, who handed her wedding ring to her husband for safekeeping.",
      "Adrian Clouatre, eyes welling with tears, said he and his wife had tried to \"do the right thing\" and that he felt ICE officers should have more discretion over arrests, though he understood they were trying to do their jobs.",
      "\"It's just a hell of a way to treat a veteran,\" said Carey Holliday, a former immigration judge who is now representing the couple. \"You take their wives and send them back to Mexico?\"",
      "The Clouatres filed a motion for a California-based immigration judge to reopen the case on Paola's deportation order and are waiting to hear back, Holliday said.",
      "On June 9, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services posted to social media about Paola Clouatre's case, writing that when Clouatre \"was apprehended by @CBP and ordered removed by a judge in 2018, she chose to defy the order and stay in the U.S. 7 years later, she had another bad idea and applied for a Green Card. @ICEgov took her into custody at our New Orleans office. @DHSgov has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "However, Paola Clouatre told CBS News of the 2018 order: \"My wife was not only a minor, but homeless when that removal order was issued. Her mom skipped the appointment, my wife was living in a homeless shelter in CPS care. And there was no way for her to know about the removal order.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre also shared with CBS News Tuesday a letter he said he wrote to Mr. Trump and submitted through WhiteHouse.gov.",
      "\"I'm aware that purely by law my wife is considered an illegal immigrant,\" he wrote in the letter. \"But she is being made to pay for the sins of her mother and has been inhumanly torn from her 2 young American children and American Veteran husband. We are married and have gone through the proper channels. We found out about her removal order about a week before we went to the USCIS interview and were honest about it hoping to have time to resolve the issue.\"",
      "Jeff Migliozzi, spokesperson for the Washington, D.C.-based migrant advocacy group Freedom for Immigrants, told CBS News in a statement: \"The scheduled ICE check-in arrest, like what happened here, has been a popular tactic under this administration in order to achieve higher numbers. The practice really underscores the cruelty and injustice of this administration's immigration policy -- here you have people doing all they can to follow the rules you gave them, and then you pull the rug out from under them. The result is separated families and shattered lives. It's appalling.\"",
      "Less discretion for military families",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that Paola Clouatre \"is in the country illegally\" and that the administration is \"not going to ignore the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Ignoring an Immigration Judge's order to leave the U.S. is a bad idea,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a June 9 post on social platform X which appeared to refer to Clouatre's case. The agency added that the government \"has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre said the agency's X post does not accurately reflect his wife's situation because she entered the country as a minor with her mother, seeking asylum.",
      "\"She was not aware of the removal order, so she was not knowingly defying it,\" he said. \"If she had been arrested, she would have been deported long ago, and we would never have met.\"",
      "Prior to the Trump administration's push to drive up deportations, USCIS provided much more discretion for veterans seeking legal status for a family member, said Holliday and Margaret Stock, a military immigration law expert.",
      "In a Feb. 28 memo, the agency said it \"will no longer exempt\" from deportation people in groups that had received more grace in the past. This includes the families of military personnel or veterans, Stock said. As of June 12, the agency said it has referred upward of 26,000 cases to ICE for deportation.",
      "USCIS still offers a program allowing family members of military personnel who illegally entered the U.S. to remain in the country as they apply for a green card. But there no longer appears to be room for leeway, such as giving a veteran's spouse like Paola Clouatre the opportunity to halt her active deportation order without facing arrest, Stock said.",
      "But numerous Marine Corps recruiters have continued to post ads on social media, geared toward Latinos, promoting enlistment as a way to gain \"protection from deportation\" for family members.",
      "\"I think it's bad for them to be advertising that people are going to get immigration benefits when it appears that the administration is no longer offering these immigration benefits,\" Stock said. \"It sends the wrong message to the recruits.\"",
      "Marine Corps spokesperson Master Sgt. Tyler Hlavac told The Associated Press that recruiters have now been informed they are \"not the proper authority\" to \"imply that the Marine Corps can secure immigration relief for applicants or their families.\"",

    "story": [
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has issued new safety recommendations\u00a0to the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing following the 2024 incident in which a door plug flew off in the middle of an Alaska Airlines flight.",
      "\"An accident like this only happens when there are multiple system failures,\" NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said at a meeting on Tuesday, partly blaming Boeing's safety processes for the incident.",
      "Homendy led the investigation into what happened before the door panel blew out six minutes into Alaska Flight 1282 that took off from Portland on Jan. 5, 2024. The aircraft was at about 16,000 feet\u00a0over Oregon during a trip to California when it had to make an emergency landing. Four bolts meant to hold the Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug in place were missing,\u00a0the NTSB discovered after the fact.",
      "\"The safety deficiencies that led to this accident should have been evident \u2026 to Boeing and to the FAA \u2026 and were therefore preventable,\" Homendy said at the meeting Tuesday.",
      "The accident left a gaping hole in the plane that had 177 people on board; eight of them suffered minor injuries.",
      "In the NTSB's report, investigators said the incident's probable cause was in the in-flight separation of the left mid exit door plug, blaming \"Boeing's failure to provide adequate training, guidance, and oversight necessary to ensure that manufacturing personnel could consistently and correctly comply with its parts removal process, which was intended to document and ensure that 4 the securing bolts and hardware that were removed to facilitate rework during the manufacturing process were properly reinstalled.\"",
      "Investigators also faulted the FAA for the agency's oversight.",
      "\"Contributing to the accident was the FAA's ineffective compliance enforcement surveillance and audit planning activities, which failed to adequately identify and ensure that Boeing addressed the repetitive and systemic nonconformance issues associated with its parts removal process,\" the report said.",
      "In a statement, the FAA said it is taking the NTSB's safety recommendations seriously and will carefully evaluate the ones issued Tuesday.",
      "\"The FAA has fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing since the Alaska Airlines door-plug accident and we will continue this aggressive oversight to ensure Boeing fixes its systemic production-quality issues,\" the FAA's statement said. \"We are actively monitoring Boeing's performance and meet weekly with the company to review its progress and any challenges it's facing in implementing necessary changes.\"",
      "The FAA also said its safety inspectors are in Boeing's facilities conducting more targeted audits and inspections. However, the agency said it has not lifted the 737 monthly production cap it has placed on Boeing until the FAA can confidently say Boeing can maintain the safety and quality of its aircraft.",
      "\"We at Boeing regret this accident and continue to work on strengthening safety and quality across our operations. We will review the final report and recommendations as we continue to implement improvements,\" a spokesperson for Boeing said Tuesday following the NTSB meeting.",
      "When the 737 Max involved in the accident was being manufactured, Boeing removed the door panel to make repairs to rivets nearby, according to the NTSB's report. Paperwork that would have triggered additional inspections was never created and the panel was reinstalled without its bolts \u2014 and the team that did the work had never opened that type of door panel.",
      "When asked whether all of it can be blamed on human error on the manufacturing floor at Boeing, Homendy told CBS News there needed to be a design change or a better process.",
      "\"It is due to a process issue, a process failure. A lot of people have focused on one or two Boeing personnel or door plug personnel. I think we have to really step back and look at the entire process was reliant on humans to set to put in a record that the door needed to be removed and put back in place,\" she said.",
      "Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later.",
      "\"All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,\" she recalled. \"As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Brewer is among a group of 35 passengers who have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and Alaska Airlines in King County, Washington, where Boeing is headquartered. The companies have previously declined to comment on other lawsuits over the incident.",
      "\"The NTSB confirmed what we already suspected \u2013 Boeing's quality control was woefully sloppy, and the FAA failed as a watchdog,\" Brewer's lawyer, Mark Lindquist, told CBS News in a statement. \"Now it's time for Boeing to accept responsibility, fix their issues, and move forward. We all want to feel safe when we board a Boeing plane.\"",
      "Despite the failure, Homendy said she feels like Boeing airplanes are safe, adding that she has \"no concerns\" about that. However, she said there are ways to improve safety.",
      "\"We found that in our investigation and we hope to help them close any gaps that remain,\" Homendy said.",

    "summary": "Bobby Sherman was a teen idol in the 1960s and '70s with bubblegum pop hits like \"Little Woman\" and \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me.\"",
    "story": [
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and '70s with bubblegum pop hits like \"Little Woman\" and \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" has died, his wife said in a statement posted to social media. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light.\"",
      "Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech\u00a0on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",

To feel rich, over half said they would need annual income of at least $200,000, while 25% put the figure at $1 million, according to the personal finance firm.",
      "Bankrate researchers polled 2,260 adults across the U.S. for the survey which measures Americans' attitudes toward financial security. The upshot: Many people are increasingly unsure of whether they'll be able to get a leg up in today's economy.

      "According to Bankrate's findings, Gen Xers (ages 45 to 60) were the most likely generation, at 84%, to say they're not where they want to be financially. Gen X also reported needing the highest income to feel financially comfortable, with 35% saying they need to make $150,000 or more.",

      "Women and men also differed in their views on financial security. Bankrate's findings reflect that women feel less confident about their financial position than men. More than 1 in 3 (35%) said they aren't financially secure and never will be, according to the survey.",

      "President Trump says the U.S. will meet with Iran next week, as a tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Iran holds for now.",
      "During a news conference Wednesday to cap off the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, the president said there may be a formal agreement at some point with Iran, but he doesn't believe one is necessary because their nuclear sites were \"blown up to kingdom come.\"",
      "\"We're going to talk to them next week, with Iran,\" the president told reporters at the press conference, adding that the U.S. is going to \"meet\" with them, although he didn't specify who will be involved in the meeting or where it will take place.",
      "\"I don't care if I have an agreement or not,\" he said. \"The only thing we'd be asking for is what we were asking for before about, 'we want no nuclear.' But we destroyed the nuclear. In other words, that's destroyed. I said, 'Iran will not have nuclear.' Well, we blew it up. It's blown up to kingdom come. And so I don't feel very strongly about it. If we got a document, it wouldn't be bad.\"",
      "The president met with other world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, amid cautious optimism about the ceasefire the Trump administration brokered. The 12-day conflict left 28 people dead in Israel and hundreds in Iran.",
      "\"It was a 12-day war. And we think it's over,\" Mr. Trump said during the press conference. \"I don't think they're going to be going back at each other, I don't think so.\"",
      "\"Because I dealt with both, and they're both tired, exhausted,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They fought very, very hard and very viciously, very violently, and they were both satisfied to go home and get out. And can it start again? I guess some day it can, it could maybe start soon.\"",
      "At the summit, Mr. Trump said Iran's enrichment efforts were set back \"basically decades.\" The U.S.\u00a0strikes\u00a0on Iranian nuclear facilities were \"very, very successful. It's called 'obliteration,'\" he said at the news conference.\u00a0An initial classified assessment\u00a0by the Defense Intelligence Agency, however, estimated the strikes only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",

    "story": [
      "An initial classified assessment found the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",
      "The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military intelligence wing, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo, to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies, two sources familiar with the report's findings said.",
      "The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, one of the sources said.",
      "\"This is a preliminary, low confidence assessment \u2014 not a final conclusion \u2014 and will continue to be refined as additional intelligence becomes available,\" a senior DIA official told CBS News on Wednesday. \"We have still not been able to review the actual physical sites themselves, which will give us the best indication.\"",
      "The official added that the agency was \"working with the FBI and other authorities to investigate the unauthorized disclosure of classified information.\"",
      "A complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Sunday.",
      "\"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Caine said.",
      "President Trump said in an address to the nation following the strikes that \"Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "He reiterated that assertion Wednesday morning in the Netherlands, where he was attending a NATO summit, telling reporters the \"they're not going to be building bombs for a long time.\"",
      "\"I think that Israel is going to be telling us very soon, because Bibi [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] is going to have people involved in that whole situation. We hear it was obliteration, it a was a virtual obliteration,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that he did not believe the Iranians \"had a chance to get anything out\" of their underground nuclear facilities before the strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump said the U.S. strikes had set back the Iranian nuclear program \"basically decades.\"",
      "Later Wednesday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement saying: \"We assess that the American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, combined with Israeli strikes on other elements of Iran's military nuclear program, has set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years. The achievement can continue indefinitely if Iran does not get access to nuclear material.\"",
      "The U.S. Air Force\u00a0joined Israel's strikes, on President Trump's orders, dropping several 30,000-pound bombs on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility early Sunday morning local time. But the DIA assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure \u2014 which is located hundreds of feet beneath a mountain \u2014 is so deep underground that it remains largely intact, one source said.",
      "The assessment provides a range of possibilities for how long it will take for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities and resume its work, ranging from a few months to less than a year, the source told CBS News. The source added that Trump administration officials were warned prior to the strike that this was a possible outcome.",
      "The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, which is gleaned from the communications of Iranian officials, one of the sources said.",
      "Current and former national security officials have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities \u2014 including access to uranium already enriched to 60% and working centrifuges \u2014 could intensify and accelerate the regime's determination to create a working weapon.",
      "Some of the details contained in the DIA assessment were previously reported by CNN.",
      "The White House has pushed back on the findings. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment \"flat-out wrong\" and said it was leaked \"by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community.\"",
      "\"The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program,\" Leavitt said. \"Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump blasted reports on the DIA assessment in a Truth Social post, writing, \"THE NUCLEAR SITES IN IRAN ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED!\"",
      "The Pentagon also stood by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's prior claim that the strikes had \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear capabilities.",
      "\"The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission,\" Hegseth said in a statement.",
      "In an interview with Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle,\" Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff called the release of the DIA report \"treasonous.\" He said \"we know for a fact\" that the Natanz site was destroyed, and said of the Fordo strike, \"there's no doubt that it was obliterated.\"",
      "Witkoff also said \"it will be almost impossible for them to resurrect that program,\" adding, \"it will take a period of years.\"",
      "A classified briefing for Congress on the administration's actions in Iran that had been scheduled for Tuesday was cancelled. Senate lawmakers are instead to be briefed by top intelligence and military officials on Thursday, one congressional aide familiar with the plan told CBS News. A similar briefing for the House will be held on Friday, according to House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered strikes Saturday on Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites, as well as a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The operation \u2014 carried out with B-2 bombers and submarine-launched cruise missiles \u2014 added to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against Iranian nuclear and military sites, drawing Iranian counterattacks. A ceasefire between Israel and Iran took effect Tuesday and appears to be holding.",
      "The strikes were aimed at stymying Iran's nuclear program. Iran has boosted its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, prompting concerns it was advancing toward a weapon.",
      "American intelligence agencies have assessed Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. On the same day that Mr. Trump authorized strikes Saturday, one U.S. agency assessed that Iran could make a nuclear weapon in as little as three to eight months, but there was no indication that the country's Supreme Leader had authorized an effort to do so, CBS News has reported.

    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv\u00a0\u2014 There was cautious optimism in Israel on Wednesday that the ceasefire with Iran would hold, at least for now. The 12-day conflict left 28 people dead in Israel and hundreds in Iran. The ceasefire brokered by the Trump administration \u2014 and enforced by President Trump personally on Tuesday as it looked perilously close to failing before it even took hold \u2014 led Israel's Home Front Command to lift restrictions on movement in the country, with Ben Gurion International Airport reopening for commercial flights.",
      "Shops and restaurants were open, and Israelis were out on the beach in Tel Aviv, which had been largely empty for days as Israel pounded Iranian nuclear, military, and other targets and Iran responded with volleys of missiles launched at Israel.",
      "Both Israel and Iran were quick to claim victory. An Israeli military spokesman said Wednesday that the strikes on Iran had set the country's nuclear program back by \"many years,\" while President Trump told reporters at a NATO summit in the Netherlands that Iran's enrichment work was put back \"basically decades.\"",
      "Those claims come despite an initial, classified U.S. military intelligence assessment that shows, according to three sources familiar who spoke with CBS News on Tuesday, that Iran's nuclear capability was only set back by months, and not completely destroyed.",
      "While both Israeli and U.S. officials have said publicly that a full assessment of the damage inflicted on Iran will take some time to compile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called it an historic victory.",
      "\"We have removed the threat of annihilation by nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said in a video address on Tuesday evening. He made no specific mention of the damage believed to have been inflicted on Iran's nuclear capabilities.",
      "Iran is \"not going to have a bomb and they're not going to enrich,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday.",
      "Iran, meanwhile, has tried to present its limited retaliatory attack targeting the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, home to thousands of U.S. forces, as a victory, despite none of the missiles hitting their target.",
      "Officials in the Islamic Republic have made it clear that, regardless of the damage actually caused to Iran's nuclear program, the country's theocratic rulers intended to not only resume, but accelerate its enrichment work \u2014 and without any oversight by the United Nations' atomic watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "Iran's parliament voted on Wednesday to fast-track a proposal that would effectively halt all cooperation with the IAEA \u2014 cooperation that expanded under the previous international nuclear agreement with Iran, and which has continued despite serious challenges since Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact during his first term. The IAEA's board of governors voted, to Iran's annoyance, just before Israel launched its attacks almost two weeks ago to censure the Islamic Republic for the first time in 20 years for not working with its inspectors.",
      "Iranian Parliamentary Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf criticized the IAEA ahead of the vote on Wednesday, saying the agency \"refused to even pretend to condemn the attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.\" He said for that reason, Iran's domestic atomic energy agency \"will suspend cooperation with the IAEA until security of nuclear facilities is ensured, and Iran's peaceful nuclear program will move forward at a faster pace.\"",
      "Iran's top clerics and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the ultimate say on all matters, did not immediately sign the measure voted on by lawmakers on Wednesday, which is required to make the move final.",
      "The conflicting information about the degree to which Iran's nuclear program has been degraded left some Israelis unsure about what comes next on Wednesday, including medical student Roy Meiri.",
      "Asked if he felt safer, Meiri told CBS News, \"I still don't know, because I don't really know the real harm that we did to them over there.\"",
      "But life in Israel, with the ceasefire holding, at least looked more like it did two weeks earlier. All of the country's war-time restrictions were lifted by the military, and parents brought their children back to schools across the country.",
      "After being cooped up at home for days, Alma Rustamov couldn't wait to get her seven-year-old son Aaron to the beach.",
      "\"After they say there is no more war with Iran, first thing, we came here,\" she told CBS News.",
      "It was a hit to Israel's economy, too. Chaim Ashkenazy's restaurant in Tel Aviv usually does a non-stop trade in shawarmas, and he said the security lockdown meant a lot of lost money.",
      "The Israeli military has said it will now turn its attention back to the decimated Gaza Strip, where Israeli forces have been accused of mass killings, many of them near aid distribution sites as desperate Palestinians seek food, almost every day in recent weeks. The IDF has said the incidents are under review.",
      "Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health said Wednesday that at least 49 people had been killed over the previous 24 hours alone, trying to access aid. Body after body was brought into Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The head of the United Nations agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, on Tuesday slammed a controversial new aid distribution group backed by the U.S. and Israel as \"a death trap costing more lives than it saves.\"",

Another 12 hours after that, or at midnight ET on Wednesday morning, the war would be considered over.",

      "Washington \u2014 On the same day that President Trump ordered Saturday's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, a U.S. intelligence agency assessed that Iran could make a nuclear weapon in three to eight months \u2014 but there was no indication that it had decided to do so, CBS News has learned.",
      "The intelligence summary, issued Saturday for the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, found that Iran could build a nuclear device in months if it did not run into technical or logistical delays, two American intelligence sources familiar with the document told CBS News.",
      "But at that time, the summary did not assess that Iran had made a decision to sprint toward a nuclear weapon \u2014 lining up with U.S. assessments for years.",
      "Similar assessments were made in the days leading up to the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, and in the days afterward. The U.S. airstrikes came amid a wider dayslong Israeli offensive against Iranian nuclear facilities, though Mr. Trump announced Monday that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "The intelligence summary also found that Iranian officials had discussed moving canisters of highly enriched uranium into car trunks and storing them in public parking lots to avoid destruction.",
      "Iran has increased its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium in recent months, sparking concerns among both Iran's adversaries and international watchdogs. The country has enriched uranium up to 60% purity, which is only a short step away from the 90% level generally used in nuclear weapons.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week Iran was \"very close to having\" a nuclear weapon, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Iran \"is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly.\"",
      "The head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla, testified in mid-June that if Iran were to decide to sprint to a nuclear weapon, it would be able to produce enough weapons-grade material for a simple nuclear weapon in one week and could make enough for 10 nuclear weapons in three weeks.",
      "U.S. intelligence officials have said for years that Iran formally halted its nuclear weapons development program in 2003. In March, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, still had not reauthorized the program, but \"pressure has probably built on him to do so\" \u2014 noting an \"erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public.\"",
      "Different agencies in the intelligence community may have their own assessments about what Iran's nuclear capabilities were prior to the strikes.",
      "Gabbard reiterated that assessment in testimony to Congress earlier this year. But last week, Mr. Trump told reporters Gabbard was \"wrong\" about whether Iran was building a nuclear weapon, later adding, \"I think they were very close to having one.\" Gabbard later said she and the president were on the same page, and the media was \"taking my testimony out of context.\"",
      "The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site, following\u00a0 a dayslong air campaign by Israel, which has alleged Iran is \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\" The impact of the weekend strikes by the U.S. is still not clear; the Pentagon offered a preliminary public assessment of the damage soon after the strikes.",
      "\"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said Sunday, adding that a full assessment would take time.",
      "Iran, for its part, has long denied that it intends to build nuclear weapons, and insists its uranium enrichment program is meant for peaceful purposes.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News' \"Face The Nation\" on Sunday that the Iranian sites targeted in the U.S. strikes were linked to Iran's \"nuclear weaponization ambitions.\" When asked whether the U.S. believed Khamenei had ordered the building of a nuclear weapon, Rubio called the issue \"irrelevant.\"",
      "\"They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons,\" Rubio said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"President Trump and the administration have always been right to say that if Iran chose to make a nuclear bomb, they could do so within weeks, which obviously poses an imminent threat to the US and the world.\"",
      "\"[T]hanks to President Trump's strong leadership and the incredibly successful military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, their capacity to build a nuclear bomb has been obliterated and the world can sleep easy at night,\" she added.",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement, \"The Department of Defense routinely provides resources and assessments for leaders at all levels to consider in their decision-making \u2014 especially for military combat operations and deployment.\"",
      "\"The classified intelligence report unlawfully leaked to CBS does not paint a holistic picture of Iran's nuclear ambitions \u2014which many in the national security community assessed could occur within weeks,\" Parnell said.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred any questions to the Defense Department.",

    "summary": "Most would see an Iranian nuclear weapon as a serious threat but also voice concern about a wider war.",
    "story": [
      "As the public assesses the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, at least three things are in play.",
      "One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be.",
      "Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however \u2014 and netting out to a majority overall \u2014 there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war.",
      "Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon.",
      "Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran.",
      "Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern.",
      "Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.",
      "Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall.",
      "A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran.",
      "Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall.",
      "Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.)",
      "The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war.",
      "Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel.",
      "Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon.",
      "Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession. That sentiment has not abated in recent months.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,720 U.S. adults interviewed between June 22-24, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "summary": "The NATO summit follows a U.S. operation striking Iranian nuclear sites \u2014 and the announcement by President Trump of a ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday heads to a whirlwind NATO summit at the Hague, Netherlands, hours after he announced that Iran and Israel had reached a ceasefire agreement.",
      "Several hours after the ceasefire was to take effect, Mr. Trump told reporters as he left for the summit that both Israel and Iran had violated it. Then, after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president said Israel would not bomb Iran again, and that \"the ceasefire is in effect.\"",
      "The president hoped to secure during the summit a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense. But a day before he was to arrive, the alliance had already agreed to the boost in defense spending, according to Matthew Whitaker, U.S. ambassador to NATO. He told reporters in a briefing Monday that as a result of Mr. Trump's leadership, NATO was \"on track\" to make that \"historic commitment\" of 5%.",
      "During the flight to the Netherlands, Mr. Trump posted an effusive note from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulating him on his actions in Iran and on the new NATO defense spending levels.",
      "\"[T]hank you for your decisive action in Iran,\" Rutte wrote. He called it \"truly extraordinary\" and said it was \"something no one else dared to do. It makes us all safer.\"",
      "And of the new spending, Rutte said, \"It was not easy, but we've got them all signed onto 5 percent!\" He called it an \"important moment for America and Europe,\" and told him, \"You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.\" A NATO spokesperson confirmed that Rutte had written the text to Mr. Trump.",
      "The U.S. spent roughly 3.4% of GDP on defense in 2023, but the president has said he thinks the U.S. should not have the same 5% target.",
      "\"We've been supporting NATO so long, in many cases, I believe, paying almost 100% of the cost,\" he told reporters Friday. \"So, I don't think we should, but I think that the NATO countries should, absolutely.\"",
      "There is no clear timeline for the 5% commitment, however, and reaching that threshold could extend into the 2030s for some NATO countries, fueling criticism that the 5% promise could be an empty one.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who is at the Hague with a bipartisan group of senators, expressed optimism about the allies' efforts to raise their defense spending.",
      "\"I think everybody is united around this goal and trying to figure out how fast we can get there,\" she told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe, who is also in the Netherlands for the summit.",
      "Aside from the conflict in the Middle East, Russia's war on Ukraine continues to be a top topic of concern for NATO members. It is not yet clear whether the U.S. will support language citing Russia as the main threat to NATO in its communique \u2014 Whitaker avoided directly answering a reporter's question about this.",
      "\"Negotiations regarding the communique are still underway, so I'm not going to be able to comment directly on the specific language,\" Whitaker said, adding, \"I fully expect that the summit statement will be direct, to the point, and reflect the Allies' current threat assessment and the need for collective defense and the individual defense of all Allies.\"",
      "He said that the U.S. is \"calling for restraint and [urging] both parties to avoid escalation,\" and he went on to say that the U.S. is \"engaged at the highest levels\" and backs direct talks between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Shaheen said she'd like to see the U.S. \"put a lot more pressure on Russia and Vladimir Putin,\" and she added, \"I think we need to pass the tough sanctions bill that we have in the Senate that has 82 sponsors.\"",
      "Shortly before the summit, on Saturday, the U.S. carried out strikes targeting\u00a0three Iranian sites\u00a0believed to be key to\u00a0Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was limited.\u00a0Iran fired\u00a0more than a dozen missiles at a\u00a0U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Mr. Trump called the retaliatory strikes \"very weak,\" and he said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\" Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei also pointed out in a social media post after the Iranian strikes, \"We didn't harm anyone.\"",
      "Within hours, Mr. Trump made the announcement that Iran and Israel would implement a ceasefire and shortly bring the war to an end.",
      "The NATO summit will feature a single two-and-a-half-hour session, instead of multiple sessions. Mr. Trump also plans to meet separately with several world leaders on the sidelines, a senior U.S. official told reporters on a conference call Friday.",
      "The president left for the summit early Tuesday morning and returns Wednesday.",
      "NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is the largest defense alliance in the world, with 32 members, including the U.S. It was formed in the aftermath of World War II, and has grown since, with its latest additions being Finland in 2023 and Sweden in 2024.

      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0The head of the United Nations agency supporting Palestinian refugees has condemned a controversial U.S. and Israeli-backed humanitarian organization operating in Gaza, calling it \"an abomination\" and \"a death trap costing more lives than it saves.\"",
      "The statement from Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general for UNRWA, criticizing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) came as the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said 79 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory over the previous 24 hours, 51 of whom it said had died near GHF sites.",
      "\"There is no food. The people have starved to death, and nobody gives a damn about Gaza. Nobody talks about what's happening in Gaza,\" one man at Gaza's Nasser hospital, where injured people were being brought for care, told CBS News. \"Young men in their prime are dying. What brings these youngsters to go to the aid sites? It's hunger. The fire of hunger has ravaged the people.\"",
      "Another man at Nasser hospital said: \"I send this message to the mothers and fathers, not to send their children. Youngsters who are barely 17 are dying in vain, just to get some hummus or a bag of flour to feed their families. The Israeli army lies in wait to kill them as you can see here. Look at the victims here. Most of them have been shot in their heads. This American charity is a trap of those youngsters. Young people in their prime are dying. This is a trap.\"",
      "\"Humanitarian principles must be reinstated,\" Lazzarini said in his statement. \"The humanitarian community, including UNRWA, has the expertise and must be allowed to do their jobs and provide assistance with respect and dignity.\"",
      "\"In Gaza, atrocities continue while global attention shifts elsewhere,\" Lazzarini said after 12 days of air and missile strikes between Israel and Iran. \"A confined and captive population is bombarded, besieged and constantly displaced. More than 55,000 people are reported killed, most of them women and children. Two million people are being starved, among them 1 million children. We have said it several times and I say it once again: no place is safe in Gaza, and no one is spared.\"",
      "CBS News' team in Gaza reported a decrease in the intensity of Israeli bombardments on Monday, with drones and fighter jets seen in the skies, but most of the violence affecting people approaching GHF aid distribution points.",
      "GHF said in a statement on Tuesday that distribution \"at all sites proceeded without incident. However, today GHF formally raised complaints with the IDF regarding instances of possible harassment by Israeli soldiers directed at our convoys\" headed to one of its aid hubs.",
      "The group also pushed back, as it does in all of its daily statements, against what it called \"false allegations of attacks near aid distributions sites,\" and it added that the \"Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry is not a credible source of information, as it fails to report any UN convoys or distribution sites that are linked to violent incidents.\"",
      "GHF sent an additional statement to CBS News in response to this story, saying in part: \"It is unfortunate that both organizations, especially the UN [and the Gaza Ministry of Health], continue to push false information regarding our operations. We understand the UN is also trying to deliver aid into Gaza, but yet are unaccountable about the percentage of their deliveries that are being looted versus making their final destination.\"",
      "The U.N.'s aid agencies and private organizations have refused to work with GHF, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, causing yet more mass displacement in the Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"Bottomline, our aid is getting securely delivered. Instead of bickering and throwing insults from the sidelines, we would welcome the UN and other humanitarian groups to join us and feed the people in Gaza. We are ready to collaborate and help them get their aid to people in need,\" GHF said.",
      "Israel and the United States have said the new GHF-organized system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid, which the U.S.-designated terrorist organization denies doing. The funding for and management of GHF have remained unclear since it began operations in mid-May, but it is staffed by private, well-armed American security contractors.",
      "Meanwhile, a limited number of trucks carrying humanitarian aid for the U.S.-based World Central Kitchen nonprofit group were reported to have entered the Gaza Strip.",
      "COGAT, the agency that coordinates Israel's operations in the Palestinian territories under the authority of the country's Ministry of Defense, said over half a million pounds of baby food had entered Gaza Monday. The Israel Defense Forces said 79 trucks from various aid organizations carrying food and medical supplies had entered Gaza on Monday.",
      "Before and during much of the ongoing war in Gaza, UNRWA provided education, health care, humanitarian relief and social services to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in multiple countries across the Middle East, but the group has long been accused by Israeli authorities of links to terrorism.",
      "In January, two Israeli laws came into effect banning UNRWA operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.",
      "Israeli officials accused a dozen UNRWA staff members in Gaza of being complicit in the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that sparked the war. UNRWA's Lazzarini, following an internal U.N. investigation, fired nine staff members, but said the agency's priority remained \"to continue lifesaving and critical services for Palestine refugees in Gaza and across the region.\"",
      "UNRWA later said the Israeli government had not provided any evidence for its accusations, a position which was supported by a later independent U.N. review. However, the allegations against UNRWA prompted the U.S. government to temporarily pause its funding for the agency, and President Trump, earlier this year, made the end of American support for the agency indefinite.",
      "In March, UNRWA issued a public appeal for a resumption of the American funding.",
      "\"UNRWA's financial situation is dire,\" Lazzarini said Tuesday. \"Cash flow is managed now on a weekly basis instead of monthly let alone yearly. Without additional funding, I will soon have to take unprecedented decisions affecting our services to Palestine Refugees across the region. The loss of UNRWA's stabilising effect on a region increasingly in turmoil will also be consequential.\"",
      "Lazzarini stressed that UNRWA provides a range of services to Palestinian refugees that a functioning Palestinian state, if one were to be created, could take over, including education and medical care.",
      "\"A genuine, time-bound political process would allow the Agency to finally transition its government-like services to empowered and prepared public institutions serving Palestinians,\" he said. \"In the absence of an orderly transition, the sudden loss or reduction of UNRWA's services will only deepen suffering and despair across the occupied Palestinian territory. It might spark unrest in the neighbouring countries. This is something that the region cannot afford, especially now.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 03:15:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump, Israel and Iran say a ceasefire he announced earlier between the two nations has begun.",
    "story": [
      "Update: This story was published before President Trump, on Tuesday morning, accused both Israel and Iran of violating the ceasefire he had announced just hours earlier. Then, after speaking with Israel's prime minister, Mr. Trump said Israel would not continue attacking Iran and declared, \"the Ceasefire is in effect.\"\u00a0Read more here.",
      "Israel and Iran said Tuesday they are complying with a ceasefire agreement announced by President Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump said on Truth Social just after 1 a.m. ET Tuesday that a ceasefire he announced earlier between the two countries \"IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!\"",
      "The Israeli government announced that, \"In light of achieving the objectives of the operation, and in full coordination with President Trump, Israel has agreed to the president's proposal for a bilateral ceasefire. Israel will respond forcefully to any violation of the ceasefire.\"",
      "At about the same time, Iranian state television said the ceasefire had begun.",
      "Mr. Trump posted Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed on a \"Complete and Total CEASEFIRE\", a move he said would end the more than weeklong conflict between the two countries.",
      "The ceasefire was to take hold in stages, the president said.",
      "Under the ceasefire announced by Mr. Trump Monday evening, Iran was to stop striking Israel in six hours (at midnight ET on Tuesday), and Israel was to stop striking Iran 12 hours after that (at noon ET Tuesday). Then, after another 12 hours, or at midnight ET Wednesday, the war would be considered over, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces had reported a series of missile barrages from Iran both before and after Mr. Trump's midnight deadline for Iran to halt the strikes. Israel did not specify when the missiles were launched, and it's unclear whether the latest missile strikes violated the terms laid out by Mr. Trump.",
      "Hours after Mr. Trump's initial post, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi suggested on X that Iran had stopped its strikes on Israel at 4 a.m. Tehran time (8:30 p.m. ET Monday). Iran's military operations \"continued until the very last minute,\" he wrote.",
      "But Araghchi also wrote that \"there is NO 'agreement' on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations,\" though he added that Iran didn't plan to continue strikes on Israel if Israel also ceased strikes at the same time. The timeline laid out by Mr. Trump called for Israel to stop striking about 15 hours after the time specified by Araghchi.",
      "\"The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later,\" Araghchi wrote.",
      "In another Truth Social post later Monday night, following the Iranian foreign minister's comments, Mr. Trump wrote, in part, that Israel and Iran \"came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, 'PEACE!' I knew the time was NOW.\"",
      "Prior to Araghchi's comments, a senior White House official told CBS News both sides had agreed to a ceasefire, with Israel agreeing as long as there are no further Iranian strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump communicated directly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while several other administration officials \u2014 Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff \u2014 communicated with Iran through direct and indirect channels, the White House official said.",
      "Qatar helped broker a deal, another White House official said. Mr. Trump had asked the Qatari Emir to get Iran to agree to a ceasefire. Vance coordinated with the Qatari prime minister on details, and Iran agreed to the ceasefire after speaking to the prime minister. The official said the direct talks with Iran occurred after Iran's strike on Al Udeid Air Base.",
      "The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13 with Israel launching airstrikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes \u2014 which killed several top Iranian military officials \u2014 prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel.",
      "As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran\u00a0said in a statement. The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information.",
      "Iran's attacks have killed at least 24 people in Israel, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Iran called its response \"devastating and powerful,\" but Mr. Trump called it \"very weak.\" The president said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\"",
      "Dispute over Iran's nuclear program still lingers",
      "It's not clear how the ceasefire announcement will impact a broader dispute over the fate of Iran's nuclear program.",
      "Israel's campaign was primarily aimed at Iran's nuclear program, as the country's stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium has grown rapidly in recent months, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "Israel has alleged Iran was secretly \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\" But earlier this year, U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Iran was not making nuclear weapons, though \"pressure has probably built\" for Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to reauthorize the country's nuclear weapons program.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week he believed the intelligence community was \"wrong\" about Iran's nuclear ambitions, telling reporters, \"I think they were very close to having one.\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the issue \"irrelevant\" in an interview Sunday\u00a0on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" saying Iranian officials \"have everything they need to build the weapon.\"",
      "Iran has long insisted its uranium enrichment program is peaceful.",
      "For weeks, Mr. Trump has sought a broader deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program, but even before Israel began striking Iran, administration officials had grown frustrated with what they viewed as Iran's unwillingness to actually negotiate, a U.S. official told CBS News. Mr. Trump has suggested Iran should abandon all uranium enrichment, but Iran rejected that demand.",
      "Mr. Trump said over the weekend the U.S.'s strikes had \"obliterated\" three Iranian nuclear sites, including two subterranean uranium enrichment facilities, though Iran has downplayed the damage.",
      "This is a developing story. Check back for updates.",

      "Bezos, who is the billionaire founder and CEO of Amazon, has been married once before; so has S\u00e1nchez. Bezos didn't have a prenup with his first wife MacKenzie Scott, and the\u00a0separation left her with a 4% stake in the online shopping giant, or around $36 billion at the time.",
      "\"Bezos handled his first divorce as fast as an Amazon delivery,\" Christopher Melcher, an attorney and partner at Walzer Melcher & Yoda LLP, told Fox News Digital of Bezos' first marriage. \"It was quick but not painless. Billions of dollars were at stake, which were earned during marriage and had to be split because there was no premarital agreement.\"",

      "\"A prenuptial agreement destroys romance and can make a prospective spouse feel unequal,\" Melcher, who is not representing Bezos or Sanchez, said. \"The negotiation of a prenup looks like a divorce, just done in advance of marriage. The desire to protect assets could end up destroying the marriage before it started by creating resentment.",
      "\"Because Bezos has children [four children with Scott] and other uses for his money, there is a legitimate need to create some guardrails around his premarital estate,\" he continued. \"This can be done while also creating a partnership with Lauren. For example, there could be a large upfront payment at date of marriage, like a signing bonus, or a large payment on separation, like a severance.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former federal prosecutor Mark Chutkow told Fox News Digital that Diddy trial jurors will likely focus on Cassie testimony for conviction.",
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' legal team rested their case Tuesday without calling one witness to the stand, and more than seven weeks after a jury was seated in the rapper's federal trial for sex crimes.",
      "The government presented 34 witnesses to the jury in an attempt to prove their case, with jurors hearing explosive testimony from Diddy's ex-girlfriends, rapper Kid Cudi, former assistants and escorts who allegedly participated in \"freak offs\" arranged by the disgraced music mogul.",
      "With closing arguments scheduled to begin Thursday following a charge conference where both sides will finalize jury instructions, former federal prosecutor Mark Chutkow believes Cassie Ventura's testimony may be the most compelling evidence for the jury to hand down a conviction.",
      "Chutkow told Fox News Digital that the government argued their case by planning ahead and providing enough evidence to support the charges against the Bad Boy Records founder.",
      "DIDDY SAYS NOT TESTIFYING IS \u2018SOLELY MY DECISION,\u2019 BOTH SIDES REST IN SEX CRIMES TRIAL",
      "Both sides rested their cases Tuesday in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial, where Cassie Ventura may prove to be the most important testimony, a legal expert told Fox News Digital. (Getty Images)",
      "\"When you look at the indictment, it's very long. It's a speaking indictment, and they have ticked off all of the various facts that they had presented to the jury in that indictment,\" Chutkow said. \"They brought in evidence of violence. They brought in evidence of guns, of drugs, of sex acts. And so they really came through with what they said that they were going to do in this case.\"",
      "Diddy was charged with racketeering conspiracy (RICO); sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution in a federal indictment unsealed Sept. 17.",
      "\"It was savvy to bring this as a racketeering case in some ways because it allowed them to bring in a lot more evidence of his bad acts that they wouldn't have otherwise been able to do if this was a very narrowly tailored case,\" Chutkow said. \"And so in that respect, I mean, the case really rises and falls with the testimony of Cassie Ventura.\"",
      "Chuktow added, \"If the jury believes it, if they believe that she really couldn't get away from him, and she had to do the things that he had requested, then the prosecution has gone a long way toward a conviction in this case.\"",
      "DIDDY DEFENSE'S COURTROOM STRATEGY IS A \u2018CALCULATED RISK\u2019: EXPERT",
      "Jurors heard allegations of \"freak off\" parties involving male escorts and Diddy's ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. The \"Me & U\" singer testified that drugs, including ecstasy, ketamine and cocaine, were in regular circulation during the \"freak offs\" for her to disassociate during the sessions.",
      "Jurors saw photo evidence of injuries Cassie Ventura allegedly sustained. (SDNY)",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office provided photo evidence of alleged abuse Cassie Ventura endured. (SDNY)",
      "Cassie admitted that ecstasy made her feel euphoric and aroused, while ketamine would make her dissociative. She said cocaine made her heart race, mushrooms made her see things and GHB, also known as the date rape drug, made her feel drunk.",
      "She also claimed it was commonplace for Diddy to become \"physical\" with her in their relationship. She defined\u00a0\"physical\"\u00a0as punishment, beatings and kicking.",
      "Cassie testified that Diddy raped her on the living room floor in 2018, then left. At the time, she had been dating Alex Fine, who is now her husband. Cassie admitted to seeing Combs again after the alleged rape, telling the jury they had been together for 10 years and had a connection. Diddy and Cassie dated on-and-off from 2007 until 2018.",
      "Another ex, who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" told prosecutors there were times she felt coerced into hotel nights with Diddy and that he also still pays for both her legal fees and rent.",
      "Former federal prosecutor Anthony M. Capozzolo admitted that it will be difficult to predict what the jury may decide in this case.",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"The trial seems like it will come down to one central question: Were the women coerced or did they voluntarily participate in the prodigious sexual escapades called 'freak offs?'\" Capozzolo told Fox News Digital. \"It would seem that if the jury believes that Cassie Ventura and the other women were coerced, then Combs may likely face a conviction on one or more of the charges.",
      "Cassie Ventura gave emotional testimony while on the stand for nearly a week in the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs federal trial. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Cassie and Diddy dated for nearly a decade before ending their relationship in 2018. (Amanda Edwards)",
      "\"Given that Combs\u2019 presented no real substantive defense in the case, his fate may depend on how well his attorneys were able to attack the credibility of the women who testified and how well the defense is able to persuade the jury that their claims of coercion are unreliable.\"",
      "He added, \"Defense attorneys will certainly argue that the fact that two of the women who were described as victims did not testify is a lack of evidence the jury can consider in determining if the government proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\"",
      "For the racketeering charges, Capozzolo questioned if there was an \"actual agreement among the co-conspirators\" to prove the necessary elements of racketeering conspiracy charges.",
      "\"In most racketeering cases, like mob cases, the government calls several co-conspirators, usually cooperators, who get on the stand and admit that they are part of a racketeering conspiracy \u2014 in that they agreed to participate in an ongoing \u2018enterprise\u2019 understanding that its purpose was to commit certain crimes,\" Capozzolo said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "\"But here, none of the witnesses at trial have testified to participating in a racketeering conspiracy. And some of the people whom the government identifies as key co-conspirators have never been charged, nor have they testified, such as Combs\u2019 former chief of staff, Kristina Khorram.\"",
      "Still, Capozzolo clarified that the government provided compelling evidence to support their case \u2014 which included testimony, videos, photos and text messages \u2014 and will likely \"take great care to marshal the evidence\" when closing arguments begin.",
      "Diddy listened to testimony from an ex-girlfriend, who testified under the nickname Jane. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Even if prosecutors fail to convict on the top racketeering charge, the sex trafficking charges carry significant penalties, including a mandatory minimum 15-year sentence,\" Capozzolo said. \"So even a 'compromise' verdict, rather than a straight acquittal, may prove costly to Combs.\"",
      "A federal RICO violation can result in a 20-year sentence per charge, the U.S. Code 2421 transportation charge can carry a sentence of up to 10 years, while U.S. Code 2422 Coercion and enticement may carry a 20-year sentence. Each of the violations may also include monetary fines.",
      "Criminal defense and civil attorney\u00a0Adant\u00e9 Pointer of Lawyers for the People LLC told Fox News Digital that while the prosecution may not be able to convince a jury of all charges, even one conviction will cost Diddy.",
      "\"Keep in mind, the prosecution only needs to prove a single charge about one of the several alleged victims in this case for Diddy to be facing significant prison time,\" Pointer told Fox News Digital. \"So essentially, the prosecution only needs to win on a single charge, while Diddy needs to run the table on all the charges to avoid prison time.\"",

      "He added, \"If the defense successfully sows seeds of doubt in a single juror\u2019s mind, then the jury will be unable to reach a unanimous verdict, which is required to convict someone. However, he still faces a substantial challenge on the counts of transportation to engage in prostitution as it relates to the male prostitutes, since federal prosecutors have ample evidence, which appears to be mostly uncontroverted, that Diddy paid and arranged for the sex workers to fly to different locations to engage in sexual activity for money.\"",

      "During opening statements of Diddy's trial, which began on May 5, Teny Geragos asked the jury to consider the federal charges, not the choices of an at-times violent man.",
      "\"Sean Combs is a complicated man, but this is not a complicated case,\" Teny told the court. \"This case is about love, jealousy, infidelity and money. This case is about voluntary adult choices made by capable adults and consensual relationships. This case is about those real-life relationships, and the government is trying to turn those relationships into a racketeering case, a prostitution case and a sex trafficking case. It will not work.\"",
      "She noted that Diddy \"has a bad temper\" and at times gets \"so angry or so jealous that he is out of control,\" but she emphasized that the \"Victory\" rapper was not charged with \"being mean.\"",
      "\"He is not charged with being a jerk. He's charged with running a racketeering enterprise,\" Teny said. \"And though there was violence that you are going to hear about, you already have, that violence is not part of any RICO. That violence is not connected to sex trafficking, and that violence is not prostitution.\"",

      "The decision by Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' lawyers to not call any witnesses to testify in his federal trial for sex crimes comes down to the prosecution's burden of reasonable doubt, according to legal experts.",
      "Diddy's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, indicated Monday in court that the defense plans to review evidence with the jury, and won't require witnesses to testify on the rapper's behalf. The rapper's legal team expects to rest its case Wednesday, with closing arguments expected to begin the following day.",
      "\"The decision whether or not to call witnesses during the defense case is a calculated risk,\" criminal defense and civil attorney\u00a0Adant\u00e9 Pointer of Lawyers for the People LLC told Fox News Digital.",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs won't testify in his federal trial for sex crimes. (Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images)",
      "\"Not calling any witnesses means the defense is essentially telling the jury there is no one they know in the whole universe who can speak on Diddy's behalf to aid his defense. On the other hand, calling a witness can open that person up to questioning and perhaps elicit damaging testimony against Diddy, depending upon their interactions with him and their knowledge of these women.\"",
      "Pointer likened the defense's decision not to call any witnesses to a \"Pandora's box.\"",
      "\"Given the defense is signaling they do not intend to call a single witness, they do not think any potential defense-friendly witnesses will result in a net gain for Diddy. His lawyers have essentially determined the juice is not worth the squeeze.\"",
      "MISSING WITNESSES AND LINGERING QUESTIONS PLAGUE PROSECUTION AS DIDDY TRIAL NEARS CONCLUSION: EXPERT",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian will likely ask Diddy to confirm his decision not to take the stand.",
      "\"Diddy testifying would just allow the prosecution to retell their case and put the previous items of evidence in front of the jury for a second or third time,\" Pointer explained. \"The prosecution would have a field day going through each and every video, text and witness statement made at trial against him and force Diddy to admit the authenticity of the videos, the receipts and invoices, items recovered at his homes and hotel rooms, and that he was present during the events described in prior testimony.",
      "Diddy's defense won't call any witnesses in his federal trial. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"In light of the evidence already presented at trial, this would most likely be an excoriating and humiliating cross-examination, the kind prosecutors wait their whole career to conduct.\"",
      "Closing arguments for the trial, which began May 5 with jury selection, are expected to begin Thursday after Diddy's lawyers explained they would only need two days to defend their client.",
      "Trial attorney\u00a0Tre Lovell told Fox News Digital that the defense likely wants to double down on reasonable doubt, and that Diddy's \"exotic lifestyle\" does not equal what the prosecution has proposed, which is that \"Diddy formed a criminal enterprise to pleasure himself, the Tony Soprano of baby oil.\"",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"The only reason to not call witnesses in your defense is if you absolutely believe there is reasonable doubt, and you don\u2019t want to do anything to take away from this, including calling your own witnesses,\" Lovell said. \"It would make sense to call a psychiatrist to explain that the behavior of Cassie and Jane is more reflective of a consensual relationship, based upon the autonomy each woman had, the benefits they received and the love they had for Diddy.",
      "Duddy's federal trial began May 5 and the case is expected to rest this week. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Further, calling executives at Bad Boy Entertainment would be helpful to distance the corporations from Diddy\u2019s more personal behavior, to dispel the criminal enterprise element. Finally, possibly an industry or legal expert to distinguish the aspects of \u2018sex workers\u2019 versus \u2018prostitution,\u2019 to counter the prostitution charge.\"",
      "Lovell added, \"However, the defense felt even calling witnesses such as these would have the potential of adversely affecting reasonable doubt, and chose not to.\"",
      "Mark Chutkow, who previously led the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit, believed Diddy's decision not to testify was \"a smart one.\"",
      "\"It's a real big gamble to testify in a case like this where the prosecution has brought racketeering charges, which allows them to bring this wealth of bad acts evidence there,\" Chutkow said. \"By taking the stand, he would just subject himself to even more bad acts that were prohibited by the court. And so that was probably the right call.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "\"Diddy's decision not to testify can also be considered savvy, as well, because he can say in closing, \u2018Look, to the jury, the prosecution had six weeks of time to show you, to try and prove their case.\u2019 The defense lawyers are going to say this: 'We showed the reasonable doubt through our cross-examination, and we don't want to waste any more of your time. You have enough now to know that there's reasonable doubt in this case, and that's why we didn't bring a case.' And to remind the jury that the presumption of innocence always goes to Diddy as the defendant in this case.\"",
      "Cassie Ventura testified in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial for sex crimes. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Chutkow noted how the burden of proof is on the government, not on the Bad Boy Records founder or his team.",
      "\"When you present a case, if you're on the defense side, you better be good, because if it falls flat, then you kind of move back the marker, and you might be in a worse position,\" the lawyer said. \"So sometimes less is more. I know that some people are suggesting that, 'Well, wow, doesn't he have something he could put on?' It may be in some ways an opportunity for the defense to say, 'No, we didn't need to.'\"",
      "WATCH: LEGAL EXPERT EXPLAINS DIDDY'S DEFENSE MOVES",
      "With the case nearing its close more than seven weeks after it began, and nine months after Diddy was arrested and charged, Chutkow thought both sides did \"what they sought to accomplish.\"",
      "\"The prosecution has put in all the evidence. It wasn't excluded. The defense, though, has done a nice job in the cross-examinations,\" he said. \"They've brought in a lot of additional communications between Diddy and these other women to show that the relationship is a lot more complex.",
      "\"One of the things I think the prosecution is going to have to do at the closing argument is to basically say, 'Look, this is not like a trafficking case that you would see on television. It's not, you don't have a situation of someone being kidnapped and chained on a basement radiator. It's, in essence, it's a golden cage. It is one with luxury and glamor, but it's still a cage.'\"",

      "Chutkow added, \"The other area that I think that they would want to emphasize is the blackmail in this case. That the use of the tapes and threat of exposure of those tapes to get the women to comply with what Diddy wanted to do is an element of coercion in and of itself. And if I was on the prosecution side, I would look to that as compelling evidence.\"",

      "With a standard or traditional facelift \u2014 also known as a SMAS facelift, or a Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System facelift \u2014 the surgeon makes incisions behind the hairline and around the front of the ear, lifting and tightening the deeper tissues and muscles and then removing excess skin.",

At the end of it, Trump was convicted by a jury of 34 counts of falsifying business records, marking the lone case out of Trump\u2019s four to lead to a conviction.",
      "Blanche said that behind the scenes, Bove was critical to their defense work and wrote the vast majority of their legal briefs.",
      "In letters to the Senate, a group of Republican state attorneys general said Bove was courageous for representing Trump \"when few other attorneys would step up.\" Attorney Gene Schaerr called Bove\u2019s brief writing \"superb.\" One of Bove\u2019s past law firms said he was \"eminently qualified.\"",
      "Nearly three dozen retired law enforcement officials praised Bove as a \"trusted and respected partner,\" saying he had a profound understanding of the Drug Enforcement Administration and was responsible for breaking apart transnational criminal networks.",
      "\"His efforts have directly contributed to high-impact cases that have saved lives and protected vulnerable populations,\" the retired officials wrote. Others heaped similar praise.",
      "The rosy picture that Blanche and Bove's supporters paint is drastically different from the one presented by a handful of DOJ officials who left the department because of Bove and defense lawyers who observed him in action during his time as a New York prosecutor.",
      "While Bove was serving as acting deputy attorney general ahead of Blanche's confirmation in March, two top lawyers in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and five officials in the DOJ\u2019s Public Integrity Section chose to abruptly leave their jobs instead of complying with Bove\u2019s order to drop New York Mayor Eric Adams\u2019s federal corruption charges.",
      "During the debacle, a judge dismissed the Democratic mayor's charges with prejudice, instead of without prejudice as Bove had requested, meaning the Trump administration could not bring the case again.",
      "The judge's decision came after the ousted lawyers blasted Bove for engaging in a dishonest quid pro quo with the mayor. The chain of events left some conservative legal analysts harshly questioning the wisdom of Bove's actions, saying it undermined the DOJ's work.",
      "Trump's mass deportation plan involved the unprecedented move of invoking a wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act. Bove indicated during an internal meeting in March that he anticipated judges would attempt to shut down the operation, according to attorney Erez Reuveni.",
      "Reuveni, a 15-year DOJ veteran who was fired after struggling to defend one of the Trump administration's deportations during a Maryland court hearing, said in a whistleblower complaint published Tuesday that Bove shocked meeting attendees by telling them they would \"need to consider telling the courts \u2018f*** you\u2019 and ignore any such court order.\"",

      "Reuveni said Bove\u2019s remarks were far afield of anything he had heard at DOJ during his tenure there and that court defiance and misleading judges were a hallmark of the department during some of the most controversial immigration cases that arose in March.",
      "DOJ attorneys have been admonished by judges for appearing to flout court orders, but they have, thus far, avoided being held in contempt of court and other sanctions.",
      "Bove was known by some of his peers as a zealous prosecutor during his SDNY days, but defense lawyers were alarmed by his ruthlessness. Some viewed him as vicious, rude and power-hungry, according to interviews with attorneys and media reports.",
      "One longtime defense lawyer who crossed paths with Bove in New York told Fox News Digital the nominee was an arrogant \"bully\" and browbeat people.",

      "In 2018, a band of defense lawyers said in emails reported by the Associated Press that Bove needed \"adult supervision\" and could not \"be bothered to treat lesser mortals with respect or empathy.\"",
      "A retired New York City FBI agent told the Associated Press that Bove\u2019s perceived turnabout on Jan. 6 riot cases was \"almost like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\" Bove showed no outward concerns while in New York when he helped with prosecuting the cases, the retired agent said.",
      "When Bove stepped into his role at Trump's DOJ, he warned the FBI in a formidable memo that leadership would take \"personnel action\" against FBI agents who participated in Jan. 6 cases, which Trump \"appropriately described as a \u2018grave national injustice\u2019 that has been perpetrated upon the American people,\" Bove wrote. The notion that thousands of employees who interacted in some way with a Jan. 6 case would see their jobs at risk prompted Bove to issue a follow-up note clarifying that employees who merely followed orders had no reason to worry.",

      "But Tanden, who said she had limited interactions with Biden, described an approval process that left her in the dark about who specifically was giving final approval on the decisions to use the automatic signature tool, sources told Fox News.",
      "Tanden testified that to get approval for the use of autopen signatures she would send decision memos to members of Biden's inner circle. However, she added that she was not aware of what actions or approvals took place between the time she sent the decision memo and the time she received it back with the necessary approval.",
      "When Tanden was asked whether she ever discussed Biden's health or his fitness to serve as president during her time as a top aide, including during the period of the former president's widely criticized debate performance last summer, Tanden said she did not. Lawmakers laid out a list of names of officials she could have potentially discussed it with, and Tanden said \"no\" to each name, according to a source familiar with her closed-door testimony.",

      "Just last month, I reported on how attackers were using fake CAPTCHA prompts to\u00a0trick Windows users into installing malware themselves.",

      "SPOT FAKE ONLINE STORES, AVOID FACEBOOK SUBSCRIPTION SCAMS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ClickFix malware, and how does it work?",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0CloudSEK have identified a new threat targeting macOS users through imitation and deception. The campaign uses a technique known as ClickFix to lure victims through fake online verification prompts. This time, attackers are spoofing Spectrum, a major telecom provider in the United States. They use fraudulent domains that closely resemble Spectrum\u2019s real support portals. These include misleading addresses like panel spectrum net and spectrum ticket net.",
      "Visitors to these sites are shown a standard-looking CAPTCHA box, asking them to verify their identity. When they do, the site displays a fake error message that says the CAPTCHA failed. Users are encouraged to click a button labeled \"Alternative Verification.\" This triggers a command to be copied silently to their clipboard. What happens next depends on the user\u2019s operating system. On macOS, instructions guide the user to paste and run the command in Terminal. That command is actually a shell script designed to steal information and download malware.",
      "The script is particularly dangerous because it uses legitimate macOS system commands. It asks for the system password, harvests credentials and disables security protections. It then downloads AMOS. This is a known information stealer with a history of targeting Apple devices. The malware collects sensitive data like passwords, cryptocurrency wallet keys, browser autofill data and saved cookies.",
      "Researchers believe the campaign was created by Russian-speaking attackers. Clues include comments written in Russian found within the malware\u2019s code. Analysts also noted that the delivery infrastructure was poorly assembled. Mismatched instructions appeared across devices. For example, Linux users were shown Windows commands. Mac users were told to press keys that only exist on Windows machines.",

      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Why ClickFix attacks are so effective",
      "ClickFix is a social engineering method that has rapidly gained popularity among cybercriminals. It relies on users trusting what they see and blindly following simple instructions. In this campaign, the attacker\u2019s goal is to make the victim execute the infection process themselves. Once the user follows through, the system is compromised without needing a traditional exploit.",
      "Researchers believe ClickFix has been active since at least March 2024. I first reported on it in June 2024, when\u00a0attackers used fake error messages from Google Chrome, Microsoft Word and OneDrive to push their payloads. Victims were shown prompts offering a \"fix,\" which copied a malicious PowerShell command to their clipboard. They were then instructed to paste and run it in PowerShell or through the Run dialog.",
      "By November 2024, the method had evolved further. A\u00a0new wave of attacks targeted Google Meet users, beginning with phishing emails that mimicked internal meeting invites. These emails contained links that redirected to fake Meet landing pages designed to look like they came from the victim\u2019s own organization.",

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of ClickFix malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures:",
      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks also start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser, and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email, or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets, or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

The attack didn't just exploit a vulnerability in macOS, but also your familiarity with verification flows. As long as security instructions look like part of the usual experience, people will continue to run malicious code themselves.

There is a growing shortage of drivers, rising costs, and relentless demand for faster deliveries. Plus's SuperDrive software is designed to address these pain points by enabling safe, scalable autonomous trucking. The technology is not just theoretical.

      "Founded in Silicon Valley in 2016 by engineers and entrepreneurs with deep roots in AI and machine learning, Plus has always aimed to do things differently. Instead of relying on hand-coded rules, Plus uses advanced AI models to create a \"driving intelligence\" that learns and adapts from every mile on the road. This AV 2.0 approach helped Plus achieve a major safety milestone in April 2025, when its SuperDrive system successfully completed \"driver-out\" validation. The truck operated autonomously without a human behind the wheel. Plus is currently running public road tests in Texas and Sweden, with more fleet trials coming soon.",

      "The numbers tell a compelling story. The U.S. and Europe together face a shortage of over 300,000 truck drivers every year, and that gap is only expected to widen as the workforce ages. Autonomous trucks offer a real solution by reducing operating costs, increasing truck utilization, and helping fleet operators keep up with demand. Plus's SuperDrive system is purpose-built for these challenges. With ongoing fleet trials and partnerships, the company is well-positioned to deliver a safe, scalable alternative to traditional trucking.",

      "What's next for Plus and the industry?",
      "Looking ahead, Plus is targeting the commercial launch of its SuperDrive-enabled trucks in 2027, starting in the U.S. and expanding into Europe. With operations in California, Texas, and Germany, Plus is ready to support customers on both sides of the Atlantic. The company's long-term vision is to empower fleet operators to run global freight networks with autonomous vehicles that improve safety, boost efficiency, and cut costs.",
      "Illustration of\u00a0 SuperDrive-enabled trucks\u00a0 (Plus Automation)",
      "Not everyone is onboard: Skepticism and industry pushback",
      "While Plus Automation's vision is ambitious, it is not without critics. The autonomous trucking industry continues to face scrutiny from regulators, labor unions, and some logistics professionals who question whether the technology is truly ready for wide-scale deployment.",
      "Regulatory uncertainty remains one of the biggest obstacles. Fully autonomous, driver-out operations like\u00a0Plus is testing raise complex questions about safety, liability, and insurance. Many policymakers are cautious, arguing that current oversight and laws have not yet adapted to the fast-moving landscape of vehicle automation.",
      "Labor organizations, particularly the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, have voiced strong opposition. They warn that the widespread adoption of autonomous trucks could displace tens of thousands of human drivers and impact job security across the freight industry. These groups are pushing for more transparency, safety assurances, and legal protections for workers as automation expands. In a public statement opposing the rapid rollout of autonomous trucks, Sean M. O'Brien, General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said this:",
      "\"We are not going to sit back and watch as automation threatens the livelihood of millions of truck drivers across America.\"",
      "This quote underscores the growing tension between innovation and labor rights. For many in the workforce, autonomous trucking is seen less as a technological leap forward and more as a potential disruption to long-standing jobs and livelihoods.",
      "Even within the logistics industry itself, some operators remain skeptical about the pace of adoption. Questions remain about how autonomous systems will handle unpredictable real-world conditions such as bad weather, complex intersections, and rural roadways where sensor performance can vary.",
      "In response, Plus emphasizes its phased approach to automation. Rather than replacing drivers overnight, the company positions its SuperDrive system as a way to augment human capabilities, improve safety, and reduce fatigue. Its deep partnerships with trusted manufacturers and logistics providers are also aimed at easing the transition and building confidence across the industry.",
      "As Plus prepares to go public, how it addresses these concerns from regulators, workers, and industry stakeholders will be critical. Earning trust may prove just as important as advancing the technology itself.",

      "The long road to autonomous safety",
      "According to Linda Garner-Bunch, managing editor of The\u00a0Trucker Media Group:",
      "\"The idea of developing viable \u2014 and safe \u2014 autonomous Class 8 trucks has been around since the 1990s, with lots of tech firms tossing their hats in the ring. Many of those firms have failed, often because of a lack of funding. In addition, both the general public and the trucking industry have expressed concerns about the safety of current autonomous technology. After all, an 80,000-pound driverless truck can do a lot more damage than a 6,000-pound passenger car if something goes wrong!",
      "To address this, legislation has been introduced requiring that a qualified human operator be present in autonomous heavy-duty trucks to take over manual control as needed. Even so, autonomous tech is becoming increasingly common in both commercial and private vehicles \u2014 think anti-lock brakes, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane assist, camera systems \u2026 the list goes on and on.",
      "Autonomy may be the future of the trucking industry, but it\u2019s not ready for full deployment at this time. Adequate funding is needed to ensure that the development and testing of autonomous technology is done properly and safely. The merger between Plus and Churchill Capital Corp IX will help ensure the company has the necessary capital to conduct research, development, and testing while ensuring the safety of everyone on the road.\"",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Autonomous trucking might still sound futuristic to some, but companies like Plus Automation are proving it's already becoming a reality. With real-world testing, major industry partnerships, and a smart approach to scaling, Plus is putting itself in a strong position to lead this next chapter in logistics. That said, the journey won't be without its challenges. From regulatory roadblocks to concerns about the impact on jobs, there's still a lot to figure out. But if Plus can keep building trust and showing that its tech really does make trucking safer and more efficient, it could help reshape how freight moves across the U.S. and beyond.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "It's easy to brush off an unexpected password reset message, especially if nothing else seems out of place. But these alerts are often the digital equivalent of a knock at the door when you weren't expecting anyone. Whether it's a hacker probing for a way in or a scammer trying to bait you, the smartest move is to treat every unexpected security message as a wake-up call. Taking just a few minutes to check your login history, secure your accounts and update your passwords can make all the difference. Cybersecurity isn't just for experts anymore. It's an integral part of everyday life. And the more proactive you are now, the less likely you'll be dealing with damage control later.",

      "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses Elon Musk's possible priorities as he exits his role with the White House and explains the urgent warning for iPhone users to update devices after a 'massive security gap.'",
      "Cyberattacks on financial service providers are no longer isolated events. In recent years, tax preparation companies, accounting software vendors and data brokers have all found themselves in the crosshairs of increasingly aggressive ransomware gangs. These attacks don\u2019t just disrupt operations but also expose deeply personal financial information that can fuel identity theft, fraud and long-term reputational damage.",
      "Now, Optima Tax Relief, one of the most prominent tax resolution firms in the U.S., has joined that growing list. A ransomware group called Chaos claims to have breached Optima\u2019s systems, stealing 69 GB of data before encrypting internal servers.",

      "The data stolen in the attack includes what appears to be corporate documents and sensitive customer case files. Tax documents are especially valuable to cybercriminals. They often contain Social Security numbers, home addresses, phone numbers and other identifiers that can be used to commit financial fraud or impersonation.",
      "Sources familiar with the incident told\u00a0BleepingComputer this was a double-extortion attack. That means Chaos not only stole the data but also encrypted Optima\u2019s systems, presumably demanding a ransom in exchange for access and non-disclosure. The firm has not yet commented publicly on whether it plans to pay the ransom or notify affected individuals.",

      "6 ways you can stay safe from Optima data breach",
      "If your information was part of the Optima breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Optima data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Optima data breach might have revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud. To report identity theft, visit the FTC\u2019s\u00a0IdentityTheft.gov.",
      "3. \u00a0Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Optima hackers might have obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies \u2014 Equifax, Experian or TransUnion \u2014 and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you. One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Optima hackers most likely have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. Two-factor authentication requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Optima breach is not an isolated event, but part of a larger failure to adapt to the sophistication of modern ransomware groups. When companies with access to tax and identity data are compromised, it\u2019s not just an internal issue; it becomes a national one. For an industry built on trust, breaches like this erode public confidence in systems that are already strained. Attacks like these raise fresh concerns about the cybersecurity preparedness of companies that handle tax and financial data. Unlike login credentials or email addresses, stolen tax information cannot be easily reset. For victims, the consequences of such a breach could stretch across years.",

      "Every time you ask ChatGPT a question, to generate an image or let artificial intelligence summarize your email, something big is happening behind the scenes. Not on your device, but in sprawling data centers filled with servers, GPUs and cooling systems that require massive amounts of electricity.",
      "The modern AI boom is pushing our power grid to its limits. ChatGPT alone processes roughly 1 billion queries per day, each requiring data center resources far beyond what\u2019s on your device.",
      "In fact, the energy needed to support artificial intelligence is rising so quickly that it has already delayed the retirement of several coal plants in the U.S., with more delays expected. Some experts warn that the AI arms race is outpacing the infrastructure meant to support it. Others argue it could spark long-overdue clean energy innovation.",
      "AI isn't just reshaping apps and search engines. It's also reshaping how we build, fuel and regulate the digital world. The race to scale up AI capabilities is accelerating faster than most infrastructure can handle, and energy is becoming the next major bottleneck.",

      "ChatGPT on a computer\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI uses so much power, and what drives the demand",
      "Running artificial intelligence at scale requires enormous computational power. Unlike traditional internet activity, which mostly involves pulling up stored information, AI tools perform intensive real-time processing. Whether training massive language models or responding to user prompts, AI systems rely on specialized hardware like GPUs (graphics processing unit) that consume far more power than legacy servers. GPUs are designed to handle many calculations in parallel, which is perfect for the matrix-heavy workloads that power generative AI and deep learning systems.",
      "To give you an idea of scale: one Nvidia H100 GPU, commonly used in AI training, consumes up to 700 watts on its own. Training a single large AI model like GPT-4 may require thousands of these GPUs running continuously for weeks. Multiply that across dozens of models and hundreds of data centers, and the numbers escalate quickly. A traditional data center rack might use around 8 kilowatts (kW) of power. An AI-optimized rack using GPUs can demand 45-55 kW or more. Multiply that across an entire building or campus of racks, and the difference is staggering.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Cooling all that hardware adds another layer of energy demand. Keeping AI servers from overheating accounts for 30-55% of a data center's total power use. Advanced cooling methods like liquid immersion are helping, but scaling those across the industry will take time.",
      "On the upside, AI researchers are developing more efficient ways to run these systems. One promising approach is the \"mixture of experts\" model architecture, which activates only a portion of the full model for each task. This method can significantly reduce the amount of energy required without sacrificing performance.",
      "How much power are we talking about?",
      "In 2023, global data centers consumed about 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. That is enough to power every home in California, Texas and Florida combined for an entire year. By 2030, the number could triple, with AI as the main driver.",
      "To put it into perspective, the average home uses about 30 kilowatt-hours per day. One terawatt-hour is a billion times larger than a kilowatt-hour. That means 1 TWh could power 33 million homes for a day.",
      "Data center\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 AI TERMS YOU KEEP HEARING AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY MEAN",
      "AI\u2019s energy demand is outpacing the power grid",
      "The demand for AI is growing faster than the energy grid can adapt. In the U.S., data center electricity use is expected to surpass 600 TWh by 2030, tripling current levels. Meeting that demand requires the equivalent of adding 14 large power plants to the grid. Large AI data centers can each require 100\u2013500 megawatts (MW), and the largest facilities may soon exceed 1 gigawatt (GW), which is about as much as a nuclear power plant or a small U.S. state. One 1 GW data center could consume more power than the entire city of San Francisco. Multiply that by a few dozen campuses across the country, and you start to see how quickly this demand adds up.",
      "To keep up, utilities across the country are delaying coal plant retirements, expanding natural gas infrastructure and shelving clean energy projects. In states like Utah, Georgia and Wisconsin, energy regulators have approved new fossil fuel investments directly linked to data center growth. By 2035, data centers could account for 8.6% of all U.S. electricity demand, up from 3.5% today.",
      "Despite public pledges to support sustainability, tech companies are inadvertently driving a fossil fuel resurgence. For the average person, this shift could increase electricity costs, strain regional energy supplies and complicate state-level clean energy goals.",
      "Power grid facility\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can big tech keep its green energy promises?",
      "Tech giants Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta all claim they are working toward a net-zero emissions future. In simple terms, this means balancing the amount of greenhouse gases they emit with the amount they remove or offset, ideally bringing their net contribution to climate change down to zero.",
      "These companies purchase large amounts of renewable energy to offset their usage and invest in next-generation energy solutions. For example, Microsoft has a contract with fusion start-up Helion to supply clean electricity by 2028.",
      "However, critics argue these clean energy purchases do not reflect the reality on the ground. Because the grid is shared, even if a tech company buys solar or wind power on paper, fossil fuels often fill the gap for everyone else.",
      "Some researchers say this model is more beneficial for company accounting than for climate progress. While the numbers might look clean on a corporate emissions report, the actual energy powering the grid still includes coal and gas.\u00a0Microsoft,\u00a0Google and\u00a0Amazon have pledged to power their data centers with 100% renewable energy, but because the grid is shared, fossil fuels often fill the gap when renewables aren\u2019t available.",
      "Some critics argue that voluntary pledges alone are not enough. Unlike traditional industries, there is no standardized regulatory framework requiring tech companies to disclose detailed energy usage from AI operations. This lack of transparency makes it harder to track whether green pledges are translating into meaningful action, especially as workloads shift to third-party contractors or overseas operations.",
      "A wind energy farm\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI CYBERSECURITY RISKS AND DEEPFAKE SCAMS ON THE RISE",
      "The future of clean energy for AI and its limits",
      "To meet soaring energy needs without worsening emissions, tech companies are investing in advanced energy projects. These include small nuclear reactors built directly next to data centers, deep geothermal systems and nuclear fusion.",
      "While promising, these technologies face enormous technical and regulatory hurdles. Fusion, for example, has never reached commercial break-even, meaning it has yet to produce more energy than it consumes. Even the most optimistic experts say we may not see scalable fusion before the 2030s.",
      "Beyond the technical barriers, many people have concerns about the safety, cost and long-term waste management of new nuclear systems. While proponents argue these designs are safer and more efficient, public skepticism remains a real hurdle. Community resistance is also a factor. In some regions, proposals for nuclear microreactors or geothermal drilling have faced delays due to concerns over safety, noise and environmental harm. Building new data centers and associated power infrastructure can take up to seven years, due to permitting, land acquisition and construction challenges.",
      "Google recently activated a geothermal project in Nevada, but it only generates enough power for a few thousand homes. The next phase may be able to power a single data center by 2028. Meanwhile, companies like Amazon and Microsoft continue building sites that consume more power than entire citie.",
      "SCAMMERS CAN EXPLOIT YOUR DATA FROM JUST ONE CHATGPT SEARCH",
      "Will AI help or harm the environment?",
      "This is the central debate. Advocates argue that AI could ultimately help accelerate climate progress by optimizing energy grids, modeling emissions patterns and inventing better clean technology. Microsoft and Google have both cited these uses in their public statements. But critics warn that the current trajectory is unsustainable. Without major breakthroughs or stricter policy frameworks, the energy cost of AI may overwhelm climate gains. A recent forecast estimated that AI could add 1.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide to global emissions between 2025 and 2030, roughly 4% more than the entire annual emissions of the U.S.",
      "Water use, rare mineral demand and land-use conflicts are also emerging concerns as AI infrastructure expands. Large data centers often require millions of gallons of water for cooling each year, which can strain local water supplies. The demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements \u2014 used in servers, cooling systems and power electronics \u2014 creates additional pressure on supply chains and mining operations. In some areas, communities are pushing back against land being rezoned for large-scale tech development.",
      "Rapid hardware turnover is also adding to the environmental toll. As AI systems evolve quickly, older GPUs and accelerators are replaced more frequently, creating significant electronic waste. Without strong recycling programs in place, much of this equipment ends up in landfills or is exported to developing countries.",
      "The question isn\u2019t just whether AI can become cleaner over time. It\u2019s whether we can scale the infrastructure needed to support it without falling back on fossil fuels. Meeting that challenge will require tighter collaboration between tech companies, utilities and policymakers. Some experts warn that AI could either help fight climate change or make it worse, and the outcome depends entirely on how we choose to power the future of computing.",
      "HOW TO LOWER YOUR CAR INSURANCE COSTS IN 2025",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "AI is revolutionizing how we work, but it is also transforming how we use energy. Data centers powering AI systems are becoming some of the world\u2019s largest electricity consumers. Tech companies are betting big on futuristic solutions, but the reality is that many fossil fuel plants are staying online longer just to meet AI\u2019s rising energy demand. Whether AI ends up helping or hurting the climate may depend on how quickly clean energy breakthroughs catch up and how honestly we measure progress.",

      "The\u00a0Crocodilus malware was first documented by ThreatFabric cybersecurity researchers in late March 2025. They highlighted its extensive data theft and remote control capabilities.",
      "Crocodilus uses Facebook to infect devices. It appears in ads that look normal, but once clicked, the malware installs itself on your device. In some cases, it mimicked banking and e-commerce apps in Poland, promising users free points in exchange for downloading an app. The link led to a fake site that delivered the malware. Although the ad was only live for a few hours, it still reached thousands of users, most of whom were over 35, a group more likely to have money in the bank.",
      "Smaller but growing campaigns have also been reported in the United States, where Crocodilus disguised itself as crypto wallet tools, mining apps and financial services. These fake apps are often distributed through social media ads or phishing links, targeting Android users who are less likely to question a \"legit-looking\" financial app. While not yet widespread, the presence of Crocodilus in the U.S. underscores its global reach and rapidly evolving tactics.",

      "The Trojan has also been spotted in Spain, where it disguised itself as a browser update, targeting nearly every major Spanish bank. In Turkey, it posed as an online casino app. And the threat doesn't stop there.",
      "One of the biggest concerns with Crocodilus is its ability to add fake contacts to your phone, inserting entries like \"Bank Support\" into your contact list. So, if an attacker calls pretending to be from your bank, your phone may not flag it because it appears to be a trusted number, making social engineering scams much more convincing.",

      "1. Avoid downloading apps from ads or unknown sources: Crocodilus often spreads through ads on social media platforms like Facebook. These ads promote apps that look like banking tools, e-commerce platforms or even crypto wallets. If you click and install one, you might be unknowingly downloading malware. Always search for apps directly on trusted platforms like the Google Play Store. Do not install anything from random links, especially those shared through ads, messages or unfamiliar websites.",
      "2. Avoid suspicious links and install strong antivirus protection: Crocodilus spreads through deceptive ads and fake app links. These can look like legitimate banking tools, crypto apps or browser updates. Clicking on them may quietly install malware that hijacks your contacts, monitors your screen or steals login credentials. To stay safe, avoid clicking on links from unknown sources, especially those that promise rewards or warn of urgent problems. Installing strong antivirus software on your Android device adds another layer of protection. It can scan downloads, block malicious behavior and warn you about phishing attempts before they become a bigger issue.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully before and after installation: Before you install an app, take a moment to look at the permissions it asks for. If a shopping app wants access to your contacts, messages or screen, that is a red flag. After installing, go to your phone settings and double-check what permissions the app actually has. Malware like Crocodilus relies on overreaching permissions to steal data and gain control. If anything seems unnecessary, revoke the access or uninstall the app entirely.",
      "4. Keep your Android device updated at all times: Security patches are released regularly to block known vulnerabilities. Crocodilus is designed to take advantage of outdated systems and bypass newer Android restrictions. By\u00a0updating your phone and apps regularly, you reduce the chances of malware slipping through. Set your device to install updates automatically when possible and check manually every so often if you are not sure.",
      "5. Consider using a data removal or monitoring service:\u00a0While not a direct defense against malware, data removal services can help minimize the damage if your information has already been leaked or sold. These services monitor your personal data on the dark web and offer guidance if your credentials have been compromised. In a case like Crocodilus, where malware may harvest and transmit banking info or crypto keys, knowing your data exposure early can help you act before scammers do.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "6. Turn on Google Play Protect: Google Play Protect is a built-in security feature on Android phones that scans your apps for anything suspicious. To stay protected, make sure it\u2019s turned on. You can check this by opening the Play Store, tapping your profile icon and selecting Play Protect. From there, you can see if it's active and run a manual scan of all your installed apps. While it may not catch everything, especially threats from outside the Play Store, it\u2019s still an important first layer of defense against harmful apps like Crocodilus.",
      "7. Be skeptical of unfamiliar contacts or urgent messages: One of the newer tricks Crocodilus uses is modifying your contact list. It can add fake entries that look like customer service numbers or bank helplines. So, if you receive a call from \"Bank Support,\" it might not be real. Always verify phone numbers through official websites or documents. The same applies to messages asking for personal details or urgent logins. When in doubt, do not respond or click any links. Contact your bank or service provider directly.",

      "Crocodilus is one of the most advanced Android banking Trojans seen so far. It spreads through social media ads, hides inside apps that look real and collects sensitive data like banking passwords and crypto seed phrases. It can also add fake contacts to your phone to trick you during scam calls. If you use Android, avoid downloading apps from links in ads or messages. Only install apps from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. Keep your phone updated, and be careful if something looks too good to be true because it probably is.",

      "Getting the robot's legs and arm to work together smoothly is a major challenge. Most robots handle these tasks separately, but this limits agility.

Why has the regime consistently targeted gatherings and representatives of the resistance abroad in its terrorist plots and operations?",

      "The Monday evening announcement took effect 12 hours later, following a timeline designed to allow final military maneuvers on both sides. However, a barrage of Iranian missile fire in the hours that followed left many Israelis questioning whether the truce had already been violated.",
      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, John Spencer, executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, said such delayed implementation is not unusual. \"It\u2019s hard to turn things off on a switch. You have aircraft in flight. You have forces in position,\" he explained.",

      "\"What\u2019s historic is that the U.S. carried out a limited operation on nuclear targets with zero losses\u2014no pilot, no equipment\u2014and helped Israel in a way only America could. Nuclear proliferation is nonpartisan, and this was an apolitical win.\" Even after Iran struck a U.S. base in Qatar, he added, \"the President showed immense restraint and kept focus on the broader goal: preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and continuing its terror campaign.\"",
      "Despite the violence that followed the announcement \u2014 including an Iranian strike that killed four civilians in Israel \u2014 Spencer believes the ceasefire will hold. \"Both countries have now said we\u2019re absolutely going to do it,\" he said. \"And yes, President Trump is very atypical in the way he communicates with the ceasefire\u2026 with the \u2018don\u2019t drop a single bomb.\u2019\"",

      "Even more recently, during the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, ceasefires were often brief and symbolic. \"Putin said, \u2018I want three days so I can do my parade,\u2019\" Spencer remarked, highlighting how temporary pauses can serve both strategic and political needs.",

      "Despite the lack of formal terms or international enforcement, Spencer believes the agreement created a new precedent. \"This established a new doctrine,\" he said, citing Israel\u2019s ability to dominate Iranian skies and the U.S. response to nuclear proliferation threats. \"If Iran decides to rebuild some sites somewhere, the threats will be more present than ever.\"",

Amid concerns that he could be assassinated, Khamenei has cut off all electronic communications to his commanders, relying on a trusted aide to relay orders, the New York Times reported.",
      "Pahlavi, whose father was the last monarch overthrown during the 1979 Iranian Revolution, said Monday that Iran currently stands at a crossroads, warning that the West handing the current regime a lifeline would only result in more bloodshed.",
      "\"The difference in these two roads depends on one factor and one factor alone: whether the current regime in Iran is allowed to survive,\" he said. \"If the West throws the regime a lifeline there will be more bloodshed and chaos \u2013 because this regime will not submit or surrender after it has been humiliated. It will lash out. As long as it is in power, no country and no people are safe: whether on the streets of Washington, Paris, Jerusalem, Riyadh or Tehran.\"",
      "He argued for a \"peaceful and democratic transition\" and said the only way to achieve peace was through \"a secular, democratic Iran.\"",
      "\"I am here today to submit myself to my compatriots to lead them down this road to peace and a democratic transition,\" Pahlavi said. \"I do not seek political power, but rather to help our great nation navigate through this critical hour toward stability, freedom, and justice.\"",
      "Pahlavi accused Khamenei of using the Iranian people as \"human shields\" by hiding out in his bunker.",
      "\"Seeing the images of the people of Tehran forced to flee our beautiful capital, the explosions in Isfahan, the fires along the Persian Gulf, all fill me with pain. But more than pain, I am filled with anger because this war is the result of the selfishness, hatred, and terror of one man: Ali Khamenei,\" he said. \"While he directs this war from the safety of his hidden bunker, he uses our people as human shields. It is time to end the suffering.\"",
      "In a direct message to Khamenei, Pahlavi said, \"Step down. And if you do, you will receive a fair trial and due process of law. Which is more than you have ever given any Iranian.\"",

      "\"To those of you who are loyal to the Iranian nation, and not the Islamic Republic: there is a future for you in a democratic Iran, if you join the people now,\" Pahlavi said. \"The choice is yours to make. I know these officers, these soldiers, these brave men exist because they are reaching out to me and telling me they want to be part of this national salvation. But now, greater coordination is needed.\"",
      "Pahlavi announced that he is establishing \"a formal channel for military, security, and police personnel to reach out directly to me, my team, and our expanding operation.\" He promised that it was a \"secure platform to efficiently manage the growing volume of inbound communications and requests from those breaking with the regime and seeking to join our movement.\"",
      "He said the international community was right to be concerned about stopping nuclear weapons and securing regional stability. Although the destruction of the three nuclear sites at Natanz, Isfahan and Fordow has \"diminished the regime\u2019s domestic nuclear enrichment,\" Pahlavi warned that the U.S. strikes did \"not diminish the regime\u2019s intent to acquire and use nuclear weapons.\"",

      "Reza Pahlavi holds a press conference in Paris on June 23, 2025. (JOEL SAGET/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Pahlavi said he was \"stepping forward to lead this national transition \u2013 not out of personal interest but as a servant of the Iranian people.\" He said he has a \"clear plan for transition and national renewal\" based on three core principles: Iran\u2019s territorial integrity; individual liberties and equality of all citizens; and separation of religion and state. Pahlavi proposed convening a \"national unity summit\" of activists, dissidents, business leaders, professionals, experts and other groups outside of politics.",
      "The goal would be for them to together develop a roadmap to democratic transition, and he said the \"final form of this future democracy we seek will be for the Iranian people to decide in a national referendum.\"",
      "Pahlavi also said he developed a three-phase, comprehensive plan for the \"economic reconstruction and social stabilization\" of the country. He promised that his team of experts \"will publish the plans for the first 100 days after the collapse of the Islamic Republic based on this work.\"",

      "In a statement released one week ahead of the summit, NATO said the \"Heads of State and Government are expected to agree [to] a new defense investment plan\" after months of speculation the alliance could increase its spending commitments from 2% of a nation\u2019s GDP to 5%.",
      "The notion was first pushed by Trump after he won the election, and despite the sticker shock of what that could mean for not only the eight nations not yet hitting the 2% commitment, but also the U.S. which currently spends 3.38%, many European leaders got on board.",

    "published": "Wed, 25 Jun 2025 09:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Iran has suffered a series of humiliating defeats brought on by the regime\u2019s own diplomatic miscalculations and strategic blunders, former officials say.",
    "story": [
      "Less than two years ago, Iran\u2019s government sounded triumphant.",
      "It was November 2023, just weeks after Hamas\u2019 deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and a senior Iranian general was predicting that the regime and its proxy forces in Gaza and Lebanon were poised to vanquish Israel, the United States and other enemies.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting America, Zionism and all those who are targeting the greatness and honor of the Islamic Revolution of Iran,\u201d Gen. Hossein Salami, commander of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said in a speech in the city of Kazvin.",
      "\u201cWe are on the verge of conquering great heights. ... We are completely overcoming the enemies.\u201d",
      "Now Iran is in its most precarious position since the early 1980s.",
      "Its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon have been devastated, Hamas has been eviscerated in Gaza, Tehran\u2019s nuclear sites have been heavily bombed, and Israel\u2019s military now owns the skies over Iran.",
      "As for Salami, he was killed in an Israeli airstrike this month.",
      "How Iran got here can be traced to a series of miscalculations and strategic blunders, experts and former officials say, a result of decisions made both decades and only months ago.",
      "Tehran\u2019s often obstinate diplomacy, overreliance on regional militants and shoddy security left it vulnerable to adversaries with much more powerful militaries. And at a crucial moment, the regime\u2019s leaders failed to grasp the intentions and capabilities of its arch foes in Jerusalem and Washington, with no foreign partner ready to come to its aid.",
      "\u201cIran was too inflexible when it had to be less stubborn,\u201d said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank. \u201cIt never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Among its more recent missteps, Iran failed to learn from how other countries managed their relations with President Donald Trump or how the ground had shifted after Israel devastated Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, Vaez said.",
      "But perhaps Iran\u2019s biggest mistake was counting on those Hezbollah proxies in Lebanon in the first place to serve as a \u201cforward defense\u201d against any possible attack by Israel. That approach worked for years, and it dealt Israel a blow when it sent ground troops into Lebanon.",
      "But everything changed when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Iran had armed, trained and financed Hamas, and the group\u2019s onslaught set off a chain of events that has left the regime in Tehran severely weakened and its regional power diminished.",
      "\u201cI think there is a direct line from Oct. 7 to today,\u201d said Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence official.",
      "While Israel hammered away at Hamas militants in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza after Oct. 7, Iran and its Hezbollah allies prepared for an eventual ground attack from Israel into Lebanon. Instead, Israel took a different tack, targeting Hezbollah\u2019s commanders and its top leader through airstrikes and booby-trapped pagers used by Hezbollah\u2019s members. Israeli forces staged only a small incursion into southern Lebanon.",
      "Alex Plitsas, a former Defense Department official with the Atlantic Council think tank, said, \u201cThe dominoes that fell after Oct. 7th left Iran\u2019s proxy network in shambles, eroded deterrence and reduced its counterstrike capabilities.\u201d",
      "But he said Iran failed to adapt and refused diplomatic overtures from Washington despite its increasingly vulnerable position.",
      "Seth Jones, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that after the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, Tehran invested heavily in arming and training militias in the region through its Revolutionary Guard Corps, with Hezbollah as the anchor of an \u201caxis of resistance.\u201d",
      "The scheme worked for decades, Jones said, but it neglected the country\u2019s armed forces, which have fallen far behind.",
      "\u201cWhat it means is that your conventional forces don\u2019t get the same level of focus,\u201d Jones said.",
      "During Israel\u2019s air campaign, \u201cthe Iranians were fighting an enemy that\u2019s got fifth-generation F-35 stealth aircraft.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey just don\u2019t have an answer to that,\u201d Jones added.",
      "Iran has also faltered on the diplomatic front.",
      "In talks over its nuclear program, Iran\u2019s leaders stuck to an uncompromising stance mistakenly believing they could buy more time and secure more concessions from Trump, as well as his predecessor, Joe Biden, experts said.",
      "Over four years, Iran dragged its feet and delayed talks with the Biden administration, which had expressed a willingness to revive and revise the 2015 nuclear deal, which Trump had abandoned in 2018, Western officials say.",
      "When Trump returned to the White House, his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, offered Iran a way to continue to enrich uranium for a period of years, while other countries in the region would help it develop a civilian nuclear energy program. The Israeli government and Republican hawks were worried that Trump\u2019s offer was too generous. But Iran appeared to misread Trump, calculating that it could extend the talks over a longer period, experts and Western officials say.",
      "In the end, the billions of dollars and decades of effort Iran devoted to its nuclear program \u201cprovided the nation neither nuclear energy nor deterrence,\u201d Karim Sadjadpour, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on social media.",
      "Relying on Russia",
      "Apart from its regional network of proxy forces stretching from Lebanon to Yemen, Iran had long relied on the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad as its only genuine ally. But Sunni rebels ousted Assad in December, and Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers are no longer welcome in Damascus.",
      "Iran also had portrayed its increasing cooperation with Russia as a \u201cstrategic\u201d partnership, with Tehran providing thousands of Shahed drones for its war on Ukraine, as well as technical advice to help Moscow build the unnamed aircraft on Russian territory. In return, Iran acquired some Russian air defense systems, but promised fighter jets and other hardware never materialized.",
      "Over the past two weeks, Israel\u2019s air force destroyed Iran\u2019s radars and Russian anti-aircraft weaponry, with Tehran losing control over its airspace.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin made no mention of providing military assistance to Iran when he met Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, in Moscow on Monday.",
      "Despite Iran\u2019s hard-line rhetoric about conquering its enemies and its extensive intelligence and security apparatus, Israel has repeatedly carried out sabotage and assassinations of top military officers, nuclear scientists, the leaders of Hezbollah in Lebanon and the leaders of Hamas in Gaza. The operations have humiliated Iran\u2019s regime and shown that the country\u2019s intelligence services are unable to protect top-ranking officers or other key figures.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s entire investments in its forward defense, missiles program and nuclear capabilities evaporated in the course of 12 months of regional war and 12 days of war on its own territory,\u201d said Vaez, of the International Crisis Group. \u201cJudging by that outcome, there is no question that Iran miscalculated at every turn.\u201d"

      "But human rights groups including Amnesty International have sounded the alarm over the latest round of executions and arrests, warning that there could be more sweeping arrests and executions without any evidence of wrongdoing provided by the regime.",
      "Those concerns were echoed by Kenneth Roth, the former executive director of Human Rights Watch, who said that while Israel\u2019s early attacks on Iran had suggested local collaborators,  \u201cthere is deep reason for concern that people will be accused, convicted, and sentenced for helping Israel on the basis of flimsy if any evidence,\u201d given the country\u2019s \u201cnotorious lack of due process.\u201d",
      "The Iranian Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a  request for comment.",
      "Human rights groups have also warned that near-total internet blackouts across Iran can be used as a tool of repression, blocking the population from sharing information with the outside world.",
      "The Iranian Communications Ministry said this was enforced to prevent Israeli cyberattacks, although the government had in the past shut down or reduced internet access in times of civil unrest.",
      "The crackdown could be \u201cused as a pretext to pre-empt any signs of dissent or public protest against Iranian government and military officials for their failure to protect civilians and key infrastructure from being targeted,\u201d according to Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow for Middle East security at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "She added that the \u201cmanhunt\u201d for spies would also \u201clikely deflect attention away from the higher level officials in Iran who may be responsible for Israel\u2019s successful intelligence penetration inside Iran.\u201d",
      "After several senior military leaders and nuclear scientists were killed by Israel, talk of \"regime change\" by Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will likely have fueled paranoia within the Iranian leadership, although the president has since said he doesn't \"want it.\"",

Delivered at the alliance\u2019s summit in The Hague, it was exactly the kind of machismo that Trump is known to value.",
      "Even beforehand, Rutte was widely criticized for addressing Trump in a message as \u201cMr. President, dear Donald\u201d and lavishing praise for his part in raising European military spending.",

      "Abrego, 29, a legal permanent resident of the U.S. who lives in Maryland, was deported in March to a high-security prison in the Central American nation, in what the government called an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d After months of debate in court, Abrego was brought back to the U.S. earlier this month.",
      "Upon his return, he was charged with two federal felonies: conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain. Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to both charges.",
      "At Wednesday's hearing, which is expected to be brief, Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes will discuss the conditions of release she believes should be imposed on Abrego.",
      "As she explained in her ruling ordering his release on Sunday night, Holmes may restrict Abrego's travel to necessary trips to the Middle District of Tennessee for court appearances and attorney meetings, and within his home state.",
      "She also suggested she may impose anger management counseling, regulate his contact with his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, and his children. Abrego's wife filed two protective orders against him in years past, but they have since reconciled.",
      "Abrego is likely to be detained and placed into Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody for deportation proceedings shortly after he is formally released from federal custody.",
      "Although officials facilitated Abrego\u2019s return to the U.S. pursuant to court order, he still initially entered the country illegally and is likely to be subject to deportation proceedings, separate from his federal case.",
      "Abrego's case is a high-profile example of the Trump administration taking unprecedented steps to implement the president\u2019s campaign promise to curb immigration.",
      "Those efforts have included apprehending foreign students en masse, most of whom are Muslim, citing an obscure provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify their detainment. The provision allows for the secretary of state to \"personally determine\" if certain foreign nationals pose a threat to U.S. foreign policy.",

      "But human rights groups including Amnesty International have sounded the alarm over the latest round of executions and arrests, warning that there could be more sweeping arrests and executions without any evidence of wrongdoing provided by the regime.",
      "Those concerns were echoed by Kenneth Roth, the former executive director of Human Rights Watch, who said that while Israel\u2019s early attacks on Iran had suggested local collaborators,  \u201cthere is deep reason for concern that people will be accused, convicted, and sentenced for helping Israel on the basis of flimsy if any evidence,\u201d given the country\u2019s \u201cnotorious lack of due process.\u201d",
      "The Iranian Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a  request for comment.",
      "Human rights groups have also warned that near-total internet blackouts across Iran can be used as a tool of repression, blocking the population from sharing information with the outside world.",
      "The Iranian Communications Ministry said this was enforced to prevent Israeli cyberattacks, although the government had in the past shut down or reduced internet access in times of civil unrest.",
      "The crackdown could be \u201cused as a pretext to pre-empt any signs of dissent or public protest against Iranian government and military officials for their failure to protect civilians and key infrastructure from being targeted,\u201d according to Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow for Middle East security at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "She added that the \u201cmanhunt\u201d for spies would also \u201clikely deflect attention away from the higher level officials in Iran who may be responsible for Israel\u2019s successful intelligence penetration inside Iran.\u201d",
      "After several senior military leaders and nuclear scientists were killed by Israel, talk of \"regime change\" by Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will likely have fueled paranoia within the Iranian leadership, although the president has since said he doesn't \"want it.\"",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s comments shortly after he ordered the strikes that the Iranian public should use the attacks as an \u201copportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard,\u201d were \u201cfelt misguided,\u201d Vakil of Chatham House said.",
      "Under aerial bombardment, \u201cmost people shelter in place,\u201d rather than attempting \u201cto bring down an institutionalized bureaucratized and repressive system of government,\u201d she said.",

      "The state of Maine, often associated with breathtaking nature and lobster rolls, is about to be front and center at this year\u2019s NBA draft, as Cooper Flagg is expected to make history as the first No. 1 pick from the Pine Tree State.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really cool feeling, really cool for me to go through and kind of have all the support of Maine behind me,\u201d Flagg told NBC News at the AT&T Flaggship Experience event in New York City ahead of the draft, which begins Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cI actually got to go home for a little bit this summer so far, and just seeing all the support and seeing everybody was really good for me, and it\u2019s just such a cool feeling knowing that I have the whole state behind me, and it\u2019s kind of history that I\u2019m being able to do.\u201d",
      "Flagg is from Newport (pop. 3,133), a town 30 minutes west of Bangor, known not for its basketball players but for its natural beauty. And regardless of where he\u2019s drafted, Flagg will become just the third person born in Maine to play in the NBA, and the first one to be drafted in 41 years. Illinois and North Carolina currently lead the way with seven No. 1 picks each since the draft began in 1947.",
      "\u201cMore than just my family, my village of people back home in Maine and my supporters who have kind of carried me through everything, and my supporters are really important to me and who I am today,\u201d Flagg said.",
      "The Dallas Mavericks have the first pick in the draft, but no matter where he ends up, Flagg will remain a Mainer to his core \u2014 ordering his lobster rolls chilled with mayo (as opposed to the competing Connecticut version of warm with butter).",
      "\u201cI attribute so much to where I come from and it\u2019s who I am. That sense of loyalty has always been with me,\u201d he told \"TODAY\" co-anchor Craig Melvin. \u201cI think just being able to put on for the state has been something that\u2019s been really important to me the whole time, and feeling like I\u2019m representing something bigger than myself.\u201d",
      "Maine basketball runs through the Flagg family. Flagg\u2019s mother, Kelly Bowman Flagg, played at Nokomis Regional High School, the same school both Cooper and his twin brother, Ace, won a state championship with, and she captained the team at the University of Maine. Cooper\u2019s father, Ralph, played at Eastern Maine Community College. Ace currently plays for University of Maine.",
      "He even played against his mother, Kelly, who, as Cooper told Melvin, never let him win \u2026 outright. During their last game, Cooper was up 7-6, and Kelly fell, tearing her meniscus.",
      "\u201cI count it as a win, because she forfeited, and I was up. But she won\u2019t give me the win,\u201d  he told Melvin.  \u201cI was winning, so it should count either way.\u201d",
      "Cooper\u2019s basketball career started with one-on-one games against Ace and older brother Hunter in the family\u2019s driveway in Newport. Those games sometimes ended in fistfights.",
      "Cooper, now 18 and 6-foot-9, says those games and his upbringing are at the root of his competitive drive.",
      "\u201cThey taught us from a young age, and just playing 100% you know, as hard as you can every single time, playing and giving your all to the game. So I think it\u2019s kind of how you\u2019re raised. And then you kind of get that as you play more more in the driveway, and you just never want to lose to your brothers.\u201d",
      "According to Ace, Cooper was just like every other shy kid growing up in Maine. \u201cBut when you have a tight-knit community, like we did in Maine, that\u2019s when you can really see him open up,\u201d  he said. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by our friends and family, and he really comes out of his shell.\u201d",
      "Ace recalls when he and Cooper played in a game at the Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, a year after they had moved to Florida to finish high school. Their friends, family and members of the community drove three to four hours from Maine, filling up the top section of the bleachers. \u201cIt was the loudest section in the building. So that was incredible to see just support when we hadn\u2019t even been able to see most of them for a year at that point, and they still showed complete support.\u201d",
      "Flagg has maintained his connection to Maine throughout his career, especially off the court. Last August, he signed with New Balance because of the company\u2019s presence in the state, including a manufacturing plant 25 miles from his hometown.",
      "\u201cThe connection with New Balance as a family company and a company with Maine roots means a lot to me,\u201d Flagg said at the time. \u201cThat makes this really different and special. My mom used to go to the tent sale for back-to-school shopping there when we were kids. That really aligns the brand with my roots. It\u2019s a perfect fit.\u201d",
      "The AT&T Flaggship Experience leaned into Flagg\u2019s ties to Maine in an attempt to connect fans to his entire career \u2014 starting in his home state. They featured his jerseys from Nokomis H.S. and AAU team Maine United, displayed photographs and newspaper clips from his time in Maine and branded the activation as the \u201cMaine Event,\u201d referring to the \u201cvillage\u201d of support his mother, Kelly, often refers to.",
      "But it\u2019s not just Maine that is behind Cooper \u2014 the fandom has spread to all of New England.",
      "Former Celtics player Brian Scalabrine, now a commentator for the Boston Celtics \u2014 said fans throughout the region constantly ask him about Flagg.",
      "\u201cThe whole state of Maine is behind him. New England is behind him,\u201d Scalabrine told NBC News. \u201cThey love the fact that this kid is out of the middle of nowhere.\u201d",
      "Scalabrine notes that Flagg\u2019s rise in the game gives hope to young players around the country who are in remote places. \u201cEvery kid, white, Black, a kid from Europe, wherever, is looking at like this kid from the middle of nowhere, and he\u2019s becoming the No. 1 pick in the draft,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s giving other people the opportunity to think you can come from anywhere and make it. You can come from the middle of Maine and develop yourself into the No. 1 pick in the draft.\u201d",
      "Maine native and Boston Celtics fan James Little, 37, who was at the AT&T event said: \u201cHe has the hopes of the entire state riding on his shoulders. This is one of the biggest things to ever happen for our state in a while.\u201d",
      "Portland resident Marisa Veroneau, 43, also at the Flagg event on Monday, noted that even nonbasketball fans are excited about Flagg. \u201cThere is quite a bit of buzz around town, Mainers are excited to see one of our hometown kids at the top of the draft. I expect Maverick jerseys to spike in these parts soon.\u201d"

Vice President JD Vance outlined a foreign policy doctrine he dubbed \"the Trump doctrine\" at the Ohio Republican Party dinner last night. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the attacks \"obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons,\" echoing language used by the president.",
      "But an initial assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency concludes that the strikes were not as effective as Trump has suggested. Actually, the strikes on Iran's nuclear enrichment sites set the country's program back by only three to six months, according to three people with knowledge at the report. \"This assessment is already finding that these core pieces are still intact,\" one source said of the facilities. \"That's a bad sign for the overall program.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the findings of the intelligence assessment, first reported by CNN, were \"flat-out wrong\" and leaked by \"an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community.\" She added, \"Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000-pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.\"",

The FBI said it does not confirm or deny operational changes.",

      "Eric Marter, who was 11 when his mother was killed, said neither he, his brother, nor his father will attend the execution, but other family members will be there.",
      "\"It should have happened a long time ago,\" he said of the execution. \"I'm not really interested in giving him the benefit of the doubt.\"",
      "Mississippi Supreme Court records show that in January 1976, Jordan called the Gulf National Bank in Gulfport, Mississippi, and asked to speak with a loan officer. After he was told Charles Marter could speak to him, he hung up. He then looked up the Marters' home address in a telephone book and kidnapped Edwina Marter. According to court records, Jordan took her to a forest and shot her to death before calling her husband, claiming she was safe and demanding $25,000.",
      "\"He needs to be punished,\" Eric Marter said.",
      "The execution ends Jordan's decades-long court process that included four trials and numerous appeals. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a petition that claimed he was denied due process rights.",
      "\"He was never given what, for a long time, the law has entitled him to, which is a mental health professional that is independent of the prosecution and can assist his defense,\" said lawyer Krissy Nobile, the director of Mississippi's Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel, who represents Jordan. \"Because of that, his jury never got to hear about his Vietnam experiences.\"",
      "A recent petition asking Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves for clemency echoed Nobile's claim. It argues Jordan developed PTSD after serving three back-to-back tours in the Vietnam War, which could have been a factor in his crime.",
      "\"His war service, his war trauma, was considered not relevant in his murder trial,\" said Franklin Rosenblatt, the president of the National Institute of Military Justice, who wrote the petition on Jordan's behalf. \"We just know so much more than we did 10 years ago, and certainly during Vietnam, about the effect of war trauma on the brain and how that affects ongoing behaviors.\"",
      "Eric Marter said he doesn't buy that argument.",
      "\"I know what he did. He wanted money, and he couldn't take her with him. And he \u2014 so he did what he did,\" he said."

    "story": [
      "Mariska Hargitay was 25 years old when she learned the stunning truth about her biological father from a man she had never met.",
      "The \"Law & Order: SVU\" star spoke with Alex Cooper on the June 25 episode of Cooper's \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast about how she found out her biological father is Italian singer Nelson Sardelli, not Hungarian bodybuilder and actor Mickey Hargitay.",
      "Hargitay had journeyed to the home of Sabin Gray, a diehard fan of her late mother, actor and 1950s sex symbol Jayne Mansfield, to see his collection of Mansfield memorabilia. Hargitay, whose  HBO documentary, \"My Mom Jayne,\" comes out on June 27, ended the visit with a shocking realization.",
      "\"It was a little overwhelming for me because there were life-size cutouts, and it was truly like a museum or a shrine to her,\" Hargitay said. \"That was hard for me at that age to sort of understand. ... I\u2019m seeing all this stuff that I had never seen and kind of grew up away from all of that.\"",
      "\"He\u2019s showing me all these photos. He\u2019s showing me whatever it is, dresses that she had that he\u2019d collected, earrings that she wore, things from movies from the movie set, props or whatever, and then he says to me, 'Do you want to see a picture of Nelson?'\" she recalled.",
      "The question immediately unnerved Hargitay, who was 3 years old when her mother died in a car accident in 1967.",
      "\"I just looked at him, and this jolt went through my body, and I said, 'Who's Nelson?'\" she said. \"And then I knew in one second.\"",
      "Hargitay remembered the blood draining out of Gray's face after asking her about Sardelli.",
      "\"He sort of panicked and turned white, and he said, 'Oh, it\u2019s probably not true, it\u2019s probably not true,' and that\u2019s when I knew,\" Hargitay said. \"And I think that (Gray) couldn\u2019t believe that I didn\u2019t know. I was 25, how could I not know?\"",
      "Hargitay was then shown a picture of Sardelli.",
      "\"On a cellular level, it was just like DNA talking to DNA,\" she said. \"I knew it was true, and I just really thought my life was over.\"",
      "Hargitay was distraught as she departed Gray's home.",
      "\"I remember leaving and driving to my brother\u2019s house, and I thought I was going to crash my car because I was so not present,\" she said. \"I was totally dissociated and out of my body, and I got to my brother\u2019s house. I didn\u2019t even know how I got there, but I knew that I shouldn\u2019t be driving. It was crazy.\"",
      "Hargitay's world was upended. She was very close with Mickey Hargitay, who had raised her after Mansfield was killed in an accident in which Mariska and her two brothers, Zoltan and Mickey Jr., were also in the car.",
      "\"The one thing I did have, the one thing that I was rooted in, the one thing that was my constant, was no longer mine,\" she said about realizing Mickey Hargitay was not her biological father. \"And my identity was just smashed. It was like it broke in two.\"",
      "She struggled to deal with a \"thousand pellets of hard truth.\"",
      "\"(I'm) going, 'My brothers aren\u2019t my brothers, I\u2019m not Hungarian, I'm not related to all my family that I grew up with in Hungary,'\" she said.",
      "It started to make sense to her why during her childhood \"everyone asked me if I was Italian.\"",
      "Once she drove to the home of one of her brothers, she asked him if he knew about Sardelli being her biological father.",
      "\"I\u2019m very, very, very, very close with my brother, and he didn\u2019t (know), so then that was also confusing,\" she said. \"And then I went up to my dad\u2019s house, and I was hysterically crying and in a state.\"",
      "She said Mickey Hargitay was in the process of physically building her a home when she asked him about Sardelli.",
      "\"So I drive up to the house that he is building me and confront him, and he was like, 'What? What are you talking about? Are you crazy? That\u2019s so not true,'\" she said.",
      "\"He kept saying, 'You look like my father, you look exactly like my father, you're a Hargitay to the end,'\" she continued. \"The irony is that I'm more like my dad than anyone in our whole family. Like, I am mini-Mickey, right? And so it was just a very extraordinarily painful moment. I say that this is the moment that I became an adult, and it's so visceral for me because I was in so much pain, I was so overwhelmed.\"",
      "Despite finding out the stunning truth about her bloodline, she did not press Mickey Hargitay on the issue.",
      "\"I was so overwhelmed and I was in the 'me, me, me, me, oh, my gosh, my life is over,' and then looking at this man who\u2019s been nothing but loving to me and nothing but this amazing father to me, and I saw his pain,\" she said. \"And I said, 'It doesn\u2019t matter what I feel. I love him. We're done here.'",
      "\"And so I said, 'OK, thank you for telling me,' and I pretended that I believed him, and we never spoke of it again,\" she continued. \"And then he used to say, even before he died, 'Remember when you thought that crazy thing?' And I go, 'I know, wasn't that nuts?'\"",
      "Hargitay told Cooper she\u2019ll \u201cnever know\u201d the extent of Mickey\u2019s knowledge on the matter.",
      "\u201cI think that he integrated it in, \u2018This is my new reality,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cHe made a choice and that was his new truth. And whether it\u2019s true or not emotionally, it was his truth.\u201d",
      "While she was managing her emotions with Mickey, Hargitay also was reeling at the thought that Sardelli had not acknowledged her as his daughter.",
      "\"That was where the injury was,\" she said, \"is, why wasn\u2019t I claimed? He must have known. He didn\u2019t care, he didn\u2019t love me, I wasn\u2019t worth it, I was nothing to him. He knew, he had to know that I was his daughter, and I wasn\u2019t worth it. I wasn\u2019t valuable enough, and that\u2019s what I lived with, is that I wasn\u2019t enough.\"",
      "\"So having that feeling of, my mother left me and then again my father abandoned me was so hard to integrate or make sense out of,\" she added.",
      "At 61 years old, Hargitay said she now has the benefit of being able to view the situation with more wisdom.",
      "\"I'm so grateful for this life to grow into the miracle of my story, and having this comprehensive understanding and getting the full perspective and now seeing that I had such a limited, teeny, teeny, teeny sliver of the truth (at the time),\" she said."

    "story": [
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and '70s with bubblegum pop hits like \"Little Woman\" and \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" has died. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace.\" Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky-clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunchboxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified medical emergency technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "A life-changing Hollywood party",
      "Sherman, with sky blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high-school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "From music to medicine",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "The teen idols grow up",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon wrote: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health, and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",
      "\"Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was \u2014 brave, gentle, and full of light,\" Poublon wrote."

      "In a follow-up video Puryear shared to TikTok in June 2024, she explained that, when she was on the team, the cheerleaders were paid a flat fee for games, in addition to an hourly rate.",
      "For public appearances, cheerleaders were also paid an hourly rate and flat fee, but tenure played a role in that amount, she said in the video. Because many of the women work another job, Puryear said the public appearances were not required. She added that for practices, the athletes are solely compensated an hourly rate.",

      "NBC Sports Boston reported in 2022 that NFL cheerleaders make, on average, about $150 per game. The athletes were reportedly also making about $50 to $75 for public appearances at the time, which altogether equated to about $22,500 per year.",
      "However, pay differs among teams. The outlet reported that Dallas\u2019 cheerleaders in 2022 were making about $15-20 per hour, which, with game and public appearance fees, totaled to about $75,000 a year.",
      "Per old footage in the Netflix docuseries, the cheerleaders were, at one point, making $15 per game. However, in interviews with former cheerleaders, some said they were \u201csurprised (the Cowboys) paid anything,\u201d calling their job an \u201chonorary position.\u201d",

      "When it comes time to sign contracts for the year, a group consisting of several veteran DCC members unites to push for change.",
      "While some DCC members are hesitant to confront management, saying they \u201ccan see both sides,\u201d others opened up about financial difficulties like being unable to pay rent and \u201cexhaustion\u201d from working multiple jobs.",
      "In the show, the group pushing for change consults with outside legal sources and meets with management, neither of which initially lead to changes. The team considers a walkout to protest the pay, which falls through. Many still debate not turning in their contracts unless changes are made.",
      "In the season finale, however, the athletes receive great news: management has approved a 400% pay increase.",
      "Before performing on TODAY June 23 with her fellow cheerleaders, DCC Jada Mclean, who helped lead the push for fair wages, reacted to the achievement.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m super proud of all of us,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it was a moment of unity for our team. We all came together. I think we were very inspired by the women before us and we wanted to inspire the women who come after us.\u201d",

      "What has DCC said about pay?",
      "In regards to the increased salaries revealed at the end of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d Season 2, the Cowboys told NBC News in a statement June 18, \u201cWe\u2019re pleased, as you\u2019ll see in the series, that the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders were happy with the outcome.\u201d",
      "Charlotte Jones, Cowboys\u2019 chief brand officer and daughter of team owner Jerry Jones, addressed the cheerleaders\u2019 pay in Season 1 of the docuseries.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cynicism around pay for NFL cheerleaders \u2014 and as it should be. They\u2019re not paid a lot,\u201d Jones said in the first season. \u201cBut the facts are that they actually don\u2019t come here for the money. They come here for something that\u2019s actually bigger than that to them.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey have a passion for dance,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere are not a lot of opportunities in the field of dance to get to perform at an elite level. It is about being a part of something bigger than themselves. It is about a sisterhood that they were able to form, about relationships that they have for the rest of their life.\u201d",
      "In 2018, former Cowboys cheerleader Erica Wilkins, who danced from 2014 to 2017, sued the organization for allegedly working over 40 hour weeks, making less than $7.25 per hour. The lawsuit, obtained by TODAY.com, also alleged that the team\u2019s mascot made more than the cheerleaders.",
      "At the time, Wilkins claimed in the lawsuit that she was making $200 per game. During her time on the team, Wilkins also claimed that her gross wages ranged from about $5,800 to $16,500 annually.",

      "The Dallas Cowboys declined to comment at the time on cheerleader pay and Wilkins\u2019 lawsuit.",
      "The Cowboys aren\u2019t the only team to face lawsuits from cheerleaders. In 2017, more than 20 organizations with cheerleading teams were named in an antitrust lawsuit filed by a Jane Doe representing cheerleaders across the NFL, NBC News reported. The suit alleged the NFL conspired to keep cheerleader wages as low as possible.",
      "The NFL teams\u2019 motion to dismiss the lawsuit was granted in May 2017, per court documents."

      "\u201cIn classic Atlanta fashion, we couldn\u2019t find a parking space, so my husband, my daughter and I blow in probably 10 minutes late,\u201d Shores says. \u201cI don\u2019t think Meredith\u2019s ever been 10 minutes late to anything in her life. She\u2019s there, her son is seated, my daughter sits down next to him, I\u2019m sweating.\u201d",

      "It was at a book fair where Shores mustered up the strength to ask Lavender about her career in writing and producing for TV, and a few months later, she approached her with an idea for a book.",
      "\u201cI had an idea in mind, sort of loosely inspired by the way that we, at the time, were all obsessed with the Murdaugh murders,\u201d Shores says. \u201cAnd you could see the way that, in a small town in South Carolina, the way that lore and history and lineage in that community shapes a crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor me, growing up in Winter Park, which has its own lore and its own kind of energy, I just couldn\u2019t stop picturing what would it would be like if that happened in Winter Park,\u201d she adds.",

      "\u201cI think it was just lightning in a bottle, you know? It\u2019s that moment in time where, like, right idea, right person and then right moment,\u201d Lavender says. \u201cSo I think for us, it was a really fun process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d crack each other up. We\u2019d text each other, she would send me, like, a copy of the chapter, and I would be reading, texting her, like, \u2018Ha ha, this line!\u2019 or, like, screengrabs of it,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd I think we both did that for each other all the way through.\u201d",
      "The pair wrote the book together over the course of a few months. Shores summarizes the book: \u201cA young woman falls in love with a man who is older than her and his friends don\u2019t approve of the courtship or the marriage, so she throws a party in the hopes of winning them over, and the morning after the party, he\u2019s missing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis book, too, is about choice. These are people who just keep choosing their choice, doing it. I think that\u2019s the fascinating thing,\u201d Shores adds.",

It\u2019s possible to make whatever you want,\u2019\u201d Shores says. \u201cAnd so for Jenna to see it and like it and to give it this extra platform is like, \u2018What?\u2019\u201d",

    "summary": "Iran has suffered a series of humiliating defeats brought on by the regime\u2019s own diplomatic miscalculations and strategic blunders, former officials say.",
    "story": [
      "Less than two years ago, Iran\u2019s government sounded triumphant.",
      "It was November 2023, just weeks after Hamas\u2019 deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and a senior Iranian general was predicting that the regime and its proxy forces in Gaza and Lebanon were poised to vanquish Israel, the United States and other enemies.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting America, Zionism and all those who are targeting the greatness and honor of the Islamic Revolution of Iran,\u201d Gen. Hossein Salami, commander of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said in a speech in the city of Kazvin.",
      "\u201cWe are on the verge of conquering great heights. ... We are completely overcoming the enemies.\u201d",
      "Now Iran is in its most precarious position since the early 1980s.",
      "Its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon have been devastated, Hamas has been eviscerated in Gaza, Tehran\u2019s nuclear sites have been heavily bombed, and Israel\u2019s military now owns the skies over Iran.",
      "As for Salami, he was killed in an Israeli airstrike this month.",
      "How Iran got here can be traced to a series of miscalculations and strategic blunders, experts and former officials say, a result of decisions made both decades and only months ago.",
      "Tehran\u2019s often obstinate diplomacy, overreliance on regional militants and shoddy security left it vulnerable to adversaries with much more powerful militaries. And at a crucial moment, the regime\u2019s leaders failed to grasp the intentions and capabilities of its arch foes in Jerusalem and Washington, with no foreign partner ready to come to its aid.",
      "\u201cIran was too inflexible when it had to be less stubborn,\u201d said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank. \u201cIt never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Among its more recent missteps, Iran failed to learn from how other countries managed their relations with President Donald Trump or how the ground had shifted after Israel devastated Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, Vaez said.",
      "But perhaps Iran\u2019s biggest mistake was counting on those Hezbollah proxies in Lebanon in the first place to serve as a \u201cforward defense\u201d against any possible attack by Israel. That approach worked for years, and it dealt Israel a blow when it sent ground troops into Lebanon.",
      "But everything changed when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Iran had armed, trained and financed Hamas, and the group\u2019s onslaught set off a chain of events that has left the regime in Tehran severely weakened and its regional power diminished.",
      "\u201cI think there is a direct line from Oct. 7 to today,\u201d said Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence official.",
      "While Israel hammered away at Hamas militants in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza after Oct. 7, Iran and its Hezbollah allies prepared for an eventual ground attack from Israel into Lebanon. Instead, Israel took a different tack, targeting Hezbollah\u2019s commanders and its top leader through airstrikes and booby-trapped pagers used by Hezbollah\u2019s members. Israeli forces staged only a small incursion into southern Lebanon.",
      "Alex Plitsas, a former Defense Department official with the Atlantic Council think tank, said, \u201cThe dominoes that fell after Oct. 7th left Iran\u2019s proxy network in shambles, eroded deterrence and reduced its counterstrike capabilities.\u201d",
      "But he said Iran failed to adapt and refused diplomatic overtures from Washington despite its increasingly vulnerable position.",
      "Seth Jones, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that after the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, Tehran invested heavily in arming and training militias in the region through its Revolutionary Guard Corps, with Hezbollah as the anchor of an \u201caxis of resistance.\u201d",
      "The scheme worked for decades, Jones said, but it neglected the country\u2019s armed forces, which have fallen far behind.",
      "\u201cWhat it means is that your conventional forces don\u2019t get the same level of focus,\u201d Jones said.",
      "During Israel\u2019s air campaign, \u201cthe Iranians were fighting an enemy that\u2019s got fifth-generation F-35 stealth aircraft.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey just don\u2019t have an answer to that,\u201d Jones added.",
      "Iran has also faltered on the diplomatic front.",
      "In talks over its nuclear program, Iran\u2019s leaders stuck to an uncompromising stance mistakenly believing they could buy more time and secure more concessions from Trump, as well as his predecessor, Joe Biden, experts said.",
      "Over four years, Iran dragged its feet and delayed talks with the Biden administration, which had expressed a willingness to revive and revise the 2015 nuclear deal, which Trump had abandoned in 2018, Western officials say.",
      "When Trump returned to the White House, his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, offered Iran a way to continue to enrich uranium for a period of years, while other countries in the region would help it develop a civilian nuclear energy program. The Israeli government and Republican hawks were worried that Trump\u2019s offer was too generous. But Iran appeared to misread Trump, calculating that it could extend the talks over a longer period, experts and Western officials say.",
      "In the end, the billions of dollars and decades of effort Iran devoted to its nuclear program \u201cprovided the nation neither nuclear energy nor deterrence,\u201d Karim Sadjadpour, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on social media.",
      "Relying on Russia",
      "Apart from its regional network of proxy forces stretching from Lebanon to Yemen, Iran had long relied on the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad as its only genuine ally. But Sunni rebels ousted Assad in December, and Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers are no longer welcome in Damascus.",
      "Iran also had portrayed its increasing cooperation with Russia as a \u201cstrategic\u201d partnership, with Tehran providing thousands of Shahed drones for its war on Ukraine, as well as technical advice to help Moscow build the unnamed aircraft on Russian territory. In return, Iran acquired some Russian air defense systems, but promised fighter jets and other hardware never materialized.",
      "Over the past two weeks, Israel\u2019s air force destroyed Iran\u2019s radars and Russian anti-aircraft weaponry, with Tehran losing control over its airspace.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin made no mention of providing military assistance to Iran when he met Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, in Moscow on Monday.",
      "Despite Iran\u2019s hard-line rhetoric about conquering its enemies and its extensive intelligence and security apparatus, Israel has repeatedly carried out sabotage and assassinations of top military officers, nuclear scientists, the leaders of Hezbollah in Lebanon and the leaders of Hamas in Gaza. The operations have humiliated Iran\u2019s regime and shown that the country\u2019s intelligence services are unable to protect top-ranking officers or other key figures.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s entire investments in its forward defense, missiles program and nuclear capabilities evaporated in the course of 12 months of regional war and 12 days of war on its own territory,\u201d said Vaez, of the International Crisis Group. \u201cJudging by that outcome, there is no question that Iran miscalculated at every turn.\u201d"

      "Both reports came after a day of relative calm between Israel and Iran after President Donald Trump demanded they cease hostilities, which began when Israeli struck Iranian nuclear facilities and other targets on June 13.",
      "\u201cThis crackdown was inevitable,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based Chatham House think tank, told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be quite extensive and quite prolonged,\u201d she said, adding that it's \u201ca relatively predictable outcome\u201d for a regime that \u201cremains heavily repressive.\u201d",
      "Having been locked in a simmering conflict with Israel for decades, Iran has long been known to put people to death over allegations of spying for Mossad.",
      "Suspicions of infiltration are not without basis, after several Israeli media outlets published footage released by Mossad that appeared to show covert agents launching missiles from within Iran during the recent attacks. NBC News could not independently verify this footage.",
      "The head of Iran\u2019s judiciary, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, on Saturday also called for cases of alleged collaborators with Israel to be expedited so they could face sentencing \u201cas quickly as possible,\u201d according to the Iranian state media outlet ISNA.",
      "But human rights groups including Amnesty International have sounded the alarm over the latest round of executions and arrests, warning that there could be more sweeping arrests and executions without any evidence of wrongdoing provided by the regime.",
      "Those concerns were echoed by Kenneth Roth, the former executive director of Human Rights Watch, who said that while Israel\u2019s early attacks on Iran had suggested local collaborators,  \u201cthere is deep reason for concern that people will be accused, convicted, and sentenced for helping Israel on the basis of flimsy if any evidence,\u201d given the country\u2019s \u201cnotorious lack of due process.\u201d",
      "The Iranian Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a  request for comment.",
      "Human rights groups have also warned that near-total internet blackouts across Iran can be used as a tool of repression, blocking the population from sharing information with the outside world.",
      "The Iranian Communications Ministry said this was enforced to prevent Israeli cyberattacks, although the government had in the past shut down or reduced internet access in times of civil unrest.",
      "The crackdown could be \u201cused as a pretext to pre-empt any signs of dissent or public protest against Iranian government and military officials for their failure to protect civilians and key infrastructure from being targeted,\u201d according to Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow for Middle East security at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "She added that the \u201cmanhunt\u201d for spies would also \u201clikely deflect attention away from the higher level officials in Iran who may be responsible for Israel\u2019s successful intelligence penetration inside Iran.\u201d",
      "After several senior military leaders and nuclear scientists were killed by Israel, talk of \"regime change\" by Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will likely have fueled paranoia within the Iranian leadership, although the president has since said he doesn't \"want it.\"",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s comments shortly after he ordered the strikes that the Iranian public should use the attacks as an \u201copportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard,\u201d were \u201cfelt misguided,\u201d Vakil of Chatham House said.",
      "Under aerial bombardment, \u201cmost people shelter in place,\u201d rather than attempting \u201cto bring down an institutionalized bureaucratized and repressive system of government,\u201d she said.",
      "But, she added, it was unclear what lies ahead for a population living under a regime likely to \u201charden and consolidate.\""

      "\u201cIt\u2019s far too soon for the United States or Israel to claim that Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been destroyed,\u201d Kelsey Davenport of the Arms Control Association told NBC News on Monday.",
      "Too soon to tell",
      "While President Donald Trump claimed over the weekend that the U.S. had \u201ccompletely and fully obliterated\u201d Tehran\u2019s key nuclear sites, including Fordo, buried deep under a mountain, Isfahan and Natanz, the full impact of the strikes remains unclear.",
      "Meanwhile, nearly 400 kilograms, or 880 pounds, of uranium enriched to 60% purity is still publicly unaccounted for.",
      "Follow along for live coverage.",
      "Iran has maintained that it does not seek to build nuclear weapons, but its rapid acceleration in uranium enrichment, as reported by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), sparked alarm before Israel\u2019s and the U.S.\u2019 strikes. Power plants require the radioactive metal to be enriched to only 3%-5%, whereas 90% is required to build a nuclear warhead.",
      "Rafael Grossi, director general of the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, on Sunday said that damage was visible at the Fordo and Natanz sites after American B-2 Spirit bombers dropped 14 GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator munitions, also known as \u201cbunker busters.\u201d Submarine-fired Tomahawk cruise missiles hit targets at Isfahan.",
      "But he said \u201cno one\u201d including his agency was \u201cin a position to assess the underground damage at Fordo\u201d as he called for inspectors to be allowed to visit Iran\u2019s nuclear sites to account for the stockpiles of uranium and, in particular, \u201cthe 400kg enriched to 60%.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Israel declared its operation against Iran a success as it said it had agreed to a shaky ceasefire announced earlier by Trump.",

      "Was enriched uranium moved?",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the enriched uranium might have been moved before the U.S. launched its strikes on Saturday.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., suggested Monday in an interview with CNBC that U.S. intelligence had found that Iran did not move nuclear material from its Fordo facility before the U.S. attack.",

      "According to Chinese Customs data, Myanmar\u2019s rare earth exports to China significantly picked up in 2018 and reached a peak of nearly 42,000 metric tons by 2023.",
      "Baskaran added that the imports from Myanmar are also particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents, which are generally less abundant in the earth\u2019s crust, elevating their value and scarcity.",
      "\u201cMyanmar\u2019s production has significantly strengthened China\u2019s dominant position, effectively giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain \u2014 and much of the leverage it wields today.\u201d",

      "Why Myanmar?",
      "Myanmar is home to deposits that tend to have higher heavy rare earth content, David Merriman, research director at Project Blue, told CNBC.",
      "These \u201cionic adsorption clay,\u201d or IAC, deposits are exploited through leaching methods that apply chemical reagents to the clay \u2014 and that comes with high environmental costs.",
      "According to Merriman, the vast majority of the world\u2019s IAC operations were in Southern China in the early to mid-2010s. But, as Beijing began implementing new environmental controls and standards in the rare earths industry, many of these projects began to close down.",
      "\u201cMyanmar, particularly the north of the country, was seen as a key region which had similar geology to many of the IAC deposit areas within China,\u201d Merriman said.",
      "\u201cYou started to see quite a rapid buildout of new IAC-type mines within Myanmar, essentially replacing the domestic Chinese production. There was a lot of Chinese business involvement in the development of these new IAC projects.\u201d",
      "The rare earths extracted by these IAC miners in Myanmar are then shipped to China mostly in the form of \u201crare earth oxides\u201d for further processing and refining, Yue Wang, a senior consultant of rare earths at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC.",
      "In 2024, a report from Global Witness, a nonprofit focused on environmental and human rights abuses, said that China had effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar \u201cat a terrible cost to the environment and local communities.\u201d",

      "China\u2019s reliance on Myanmar for rare earths has also opened it up to supply chain risks, experts said.",
      "According to Global Witness\u2019s research, most of the heavy rare earths from Myanmar originate from the Northern Kachin State, which borders China. However, following Myanmar\u2019s violent military coup in 2021, the military junta has struggled to maintain control of the territory amid opposition from the public and armed groups.",
      "\u201cMyanmar is a risky jurisdiction to rely on, given the ongoing civil war. In 2024, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), a group of armed rebels, seized sites responsible for half the world\u2019s heavy rare earths production,\u201d said CSIS\u2019 Baskaran.",
      "Since the seizure, there have been reports of supply disruptions causing spikes in the prices of some heavy rare earths. According to a Reuters report, the KIA was seeking to use the resources as leverage against Beijing.",
      "Chinese customs data shows imports of rare earth oxides from Myanmar fell by over a third in the first five months of the year compared with the same period last year.",
      "\u201cIf Myanmar were to cease all exports of rare earth feed stocks to China, China would struggle to meet its demand for heavy rare earths in the short term,\u201d said Project Blue\u2019s Merriman.",
      "Not surprisingly, Beijing has been looking to diversify its sources of heavy rare earths.",
      "According to Merriman, there are IAC deposits in nearby countries, including Malaysia and Laos, where some projects have been set up with Chinese involvement.",
      "Still, he notes that environmental standards are expected to be higher in those countries, which will present challenges for rare earth miners.",
      "China\u2019s decision to cut back on its own extraction of heavy rare earth elements may serve as a warning to other countries about the costs of developing such projects. A report by Chinese media group Caixin in 2022 documented how former IAC operation sites in Southern China had left behind toxic water and contaminated soil, hurting local farmers\u2019 livelihoods."

    "story": [
      "Last winter, a study startled the running world when a team of researchers concluded that, under the right circumstances, Kenyan superstar Faith Kipyegon could break a barrier long thought impossible \u2014 becoming the first woman to run 1 mile in less than four minutes.",
      "In the coming days, under a worldwide spotlight, that theory will be put to the test.",
      "Kipyegon on Thursday will line up in Paris in a Nike-sponsored race called Breaking4, just four laps \u2014 and 1,609 meters, to be exact \u2014 from history.",
      "If there were ever a runner to make such an attempt, it would be the 31-year-old Kipyegon. A three-time Olympic gold medalist in the 1,500 meters, who holds the world record in the 1,500 meters and formerly held the record at 5,000 meters, as well, she has come closer to the four-minute barrier than anyone. In 2023, racing in Monaco, Kipyegon smashed the previous world record for the mile by running 4:07.64.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s really stretching your imagination and acceptance of how women can excel in sport,\u201d said Rodger Kram, an associate professor emeritus at the University of Colorado who co-authored the study published in February in the Royal Society of Open Science.",
      "Yet speed alone won\u2019t make up the 7.64-second difference between her personal best and a barrier-breaking achievement \u2014 a lifetime in a race as short as the mile. The big variable is how exactly Kipyegon will \u201cdraft\u201d off pace-setters around her, thus reducing her aerodynamic drag. How many pacers Nike will use, and what formation they will employ, remains a mystery.",
      "Kipyegon told The Associated Press that \u201cbreaking four will really cement my legacy.\u201d Yet breaking four minutes could lead to a wider effect. Half-marathons and marathons have enjoyed a post-pandemic participation boom, but Kram wonders whether Kipyegon\u2019s example could inspire more women to run middle distances.",
      "\u201cTo see that, one, we actually want to go after a female record, that\u2019s exciting,\u201d said Shalaya Kipp, a former Olympic distance runner and NCAA champion who co-authored the study. \u201cIt\u2019s going to not only draw more females to the sport, but it\u2019s also going to help draw more attention to female physiology and get more research done on females too.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not the runner in me, but that\u2019s the scientist in me that gets really excited if we have this. Scientists are going to start working with more female athletes, and that is a big gap we have right now,\u201d Kipp added.",
      "As experts in physiology and kinesiology, Kram, Kipp and their study\u2019s co-authors, Edson Soares da Silva and Wouter Hoogkamer, were already fans of running. But their pursuit of whether a female sub-four mile was possible began in earnest in 2023 while watching Kipyegon run her 4:07 world record while using pacers for only half the race.",
      "\u201cIt really stood out to us that this was a very fast race \u2014 a world record, of course \u2014 but she had terrible drafting,\u201d said Kipp, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWe\u2019re track nerds, and we watched that, and we\u2019re like, \u2018Well, what if? What if?\u2019 And then we were like, \u2018We actually could do that math.\u2019\u201d",
      "The researchers\u2019 sub-four findings were modeled on a scenario in which Kipyegon would draft off a team of all-female pacers, in part for the gender-breaking symbolism it would represent, Kipp said. In that scenario, the study found that if Kipyegon could stay within about 40 inches behind a pacer in front of her, and 40 inches in front of another behind her \u2014 with a new pacing team swapping in halfway through \u2014 it would create an aerodynamic \u201cpocket\u201d in which she would face the least wind resistance.",
      "Under those conditions, Kipyegon could run 3:59.37, the paper concluded \u2014 the exact time run by Roger Bannister in 1954 when he, using pacers for more than 80% of the race, became the first person to ever break the sub-four barrier.",
      "Less remembered is that also in 1954, Diane Leather became the first woman to break the five-minute barrier in the mile. It took more than half a century for the idea of a woman running a sub-four mile to enter the realm of possibility, however, as training, times and technology all improved.",
      "An inflection point arrived in 2016.",
      "That year, Nike became the first shoe company to combine an exceptionally bouncy new foam with rigid \u201cplates\u201d in its shoes and spikes. Studies have determined such \u201csupershoes\u201d require less effort to run at a given pace by absorbing the impact from each foot strike, allowing runners to rebound more quickly. The breakthrough led Nike to design a different moon shot race, dubbed \u201cBreaking2,\u201d in which Kenyan superstar Eliud Kipchoge attempted to become the first person to run a marathon in less than two hours. He came up 25 seconds short during his first try, in 2017. In his second attempt, three years later, Kipchoge ran 1:59.40. The times do not count as an official world record because the carefully tailored attempt did not meet the standards of the sport\u2019s global governing body, but it represented a seismic shift in what was possible all the same.",
      "It was also a sign of things to come.",
      "\u201cWe opened the 2016 floodgates,\u201d Kipp said, \u201cand we saw these times dropping.\u201d",
      "Of the 50 fastest miles run by women all time, 33 have been run since 2016, including 10 of the top 11. The world record of 4:12.56 had stood since 1996 until Sifan Hassan ran 0.23 seconds faster in 2019. Four years later, Kipyegon shattered Hassan\u2019s world record by a stunning 4.69 seconds in Monaco.",
      "In Paris this week, Kipyegon will wear custom-made Nike supershoe spikes as well as a speed suit and custom bra designed to reduce drag. Kipyegon is unique in that her stride appears effortless, as if floating, Kipp said. Yet what matters most, Kram and Kipp said, is whether Kipyegon has improved at staying tucked in behind her pacers.",
      "Nike did not consult with Kram, Kipp or their research team on the technical details of Kipyegon\u2019s attempt. How the sportswear giant will handle the number and gender of the pacers has led to significant intrigue. Stadiums hosting professional meets feature a metal \u201crail\u201d on the inside of the first lane, separating the track from the infield. Because Paris\u2019 Stade Charlety has little rubberized track surface inside of the rail, it\u2019s unlikely it will have the space needed to use the type of \u201cfull arrowhead\u201d formation it employed in its attempt to help Kipchoge break two hours in the marathon. Kram wonders if Nike will employ a \u201chalf arrowhead\u201d or perhaps even the model the researchers studied, with one in front and one behind.",
      "He and Kipp will also be watching for how Kipyegon and her pacers line up at the start; how relaxed she appears while pushing an unprecedented pace; and, nearing the finish, when the pacers will peel away to allow Kipyegon to finish alone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be watching to make sure that she\u2019s in the pocket, and that the pacers don\u2019t get too excited,\u201d Kram said. \u201cIn the first 200 [meters] you can ruin your chances for the mile. If she goes out and runs 27 [seconds], she\u2019s cooked. She\u2019s got to go out in 29, 29-high.",
      "\u201cIf she comes through 1,200 in three minutes, I think she\u2019s going to get it. Other people are saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s when she\u2019s going to die.\u2019 But I believe in our numbers and our calculations.\u201d",
      "Kipchoge and his training partners wore T-shirts featuring \u201cBreaking4\u201d and Kipyegon\u2019s image during training recently.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an honor for us to support [Kipyegon] as she prepares to achieve the unthinkable and to break down the barriers of human performance,\u201d Kipchoge wrote on Instagram. \u201cFaith is a true inspiration for our world. If there\u2019s one person to do it, it is you. Go for it!\u201d",
      "The race also comes at a significant moment for Nike itself. The company\u2019s roots are in running \u2014 it was founded by a middle-distance runner, Phil Knight, and his collegiate track coach \u2014 and more runners finished distance races in 2024 wearing the brand than any other, according to an industry group survey. In recent years, however, Nike\u2019s shelf space and market share among running shoes has been challenged by newcomers such as Hoka and On. Kipyegon\u2019s sub-four attempt will come on the same day that Nike is scheduled to host a quarterly earnings call.",
      "In the days before Kipyegon\u2019s race, Kram acknowledged having nerves over how the study\u2019s findings would fare in a real-life test. Many of his previous studies had received scant attention from the wider public, he said. February\u2019s sub-four paper, by comparison, had drawn global attention.",
      "\u201cEven if we don\u2019t go below four, how exciting is it just to have this attempt?\u201d Kipp said. \u201cIs it really going to be a failure if she runs, you know, 4:01, 4:02? It\u2019s still going to be a big deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how Eliud Kipchoge\u2019s first sub-two [marathon] attempt was. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it lowered the standard, and it made us realize if we can get closer, we can do it.\u201d"

      "From navigating tough weather in Australia to being questioned by police in Egypt, Ian Andersen has faced many challenges in his journeys biking across continents and documenting them on social media.",
      "But the American creator, known as \u201cridewithian\u201d to his 43,300 followers on TikTok, never had war on his list of possible hurdles \u2014 until last week. Amid his 29-day trek across Iran, Andersen found himself stuck just after Israeli forces began a \u201cpre-emptive\u201d strike on the country.",
      "As Iran and Israel continue to trade attacks, visitors like Andersen have scrambled to find ways to safely exit the Middle East. He was among several people to document how he was able to depart the country, and he shared his journey with followers.",
      "Andersen said that at first, he was determined to continue his Iran trip \u201cas intended.\u201d But then his guide, Reza, told him something that made him change course. \u201cI can no longer protect you,\u201d Reza said, according to Andersen. \u201cIf you\u2019re stopped by police, I should just wave goodbye, because there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d",
      "As of Wednesday, the State Department had advised citizens to \u201cleave Iran now\u201d and to have plans that do \u201cnot rely on U.S. government help.\u201d Other governments have also warned their citizens to leave the region as the conflict unfolds and airspace closes. The United Kingdom has advised against \"all travel to Iran.\" Similarly, Australia has said its citizens should not travel to Israel. Major U.S. carriers like Delta and American have offered rebooking options.",
      "Some Americans in Israel have also been able to leave the region after the state of Florida and a nonprofit organization arranged a flight to bring evacuees home.",
      "Andersen said his departure was possible only because of Reza, whose last name he did not share to protect his safety, and help from the State Department.",
      "\u201cI had a couple weeks there in country of really positive good experiences,\" he said in a phone interview. \"Experiencing Iran as it should be experienced.\u201d",
      "His first vlog from Iran, posted June 2, recorded him crossing into the country from Turkey. Not unlike other influencers whose content focuses on travel, Andersen also posted himself trying different local cuisines \u2014 including a fermented yogurt drink, a Persian omelet and kaleh pacheh, a stew made with goat head \u2014 and showing the hospitality of the Iranian people.",
      "\"They tried to give us for free and said we are their guests, but we had to insist,\" Andersen says in one video, which Reza explains is an example of the \"ta\u2019arof,\" a form of etiquette practiced by Iranians worldwide.",
      "As he biked around the country, he also captured the landscape and talked to viewers about the impact of sanctions, asking in one video, \"What happens when a country is cut off from the global economy for decades?\"",
      "The lighthearted, fun tone of his videos began to shift one week ago while he was in Chalus. Many of his followers began commenting, sharing concerns about his safety.",
      "\"Actually all of us are sad because this is happening,\" Reza says in one video after they heard news of the attack. \"But hope for world without war. ... Everybody needs a peaceful world.\"",
      "The two were headed toward Tehran to try to sort out a visa for Afghanistan, which was the next country on Andersen's itinerary.",
      "\"It's amazing that even after such an event, you know, an emergency, that people are so friendly,\" Andersen says after two people eating near them bring them a meal and insist they share with them.",
      "The information that was available in Iran was initially unclear, and it left Andersen with questions. Iran plunged into a near-total internet blackout this week, limiting Iranians\u2019 ability to access and share information with the outside world.",
      "The situation soon became \u201ctoo dangerous,\" Andersen says in another video, and he and Reza decided not to go to Tehran.",
      "\u201cIt ended up being a good call, \u2019cause there was just more and more attacks as the days went by,\u201d Andersen told NBC News as he reflected on his past week.",
      "\u201cThere was lots of rumors flying around about what borders might be open,\" he added. \"Like, what, like one of the requirements once you get to the border? Like if you\u2019re able to get a visa, if you can just go through. A lifeline came through via an email from the State Department about getting into Azerbaijan.\"",
      "He ultimately was able to exit through Azerbaijan with help from Reza, who drove them to the border. He said he \"probably wouldn\u2019t be here talking\" if it weren't for Reza.",
      "\"I\u2019m out, and truly grateful for all your prayers, messages, and support,\" Andersen wrote in a recent video update. \"It\u2019s an honor to have you following this journey and caring about my wellbeing out here in the Middle East. ... And finally, to my Iranian guide Reza\u2014there\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather have had by my side.\"",
      "Andersen said that since he left the country, his thoughts continue to be with the people of both Iran and Israel and that he is also \u201cthinking about all the people who don\u2019t have the option to leave, like I did.\u201d",
      "U.K.-based influencers Nadia Akhtar and Irfan Aziz, who go by the handle \"fieldofvisions\" on TikTok, where they have 60,000 followers, were also in Iran when the strikes began.",
      "The couple, who were unavailable for an interview, were traveling with their young son, Zakariya. They quickly realized they were among the last to enter the country on an incoming flight and soon had a front-row seat for the attacks from their balcony.",
      "\"Iranian forces were intercepting Israeli drones right above us,\" Aziz says in a video. \"That night, we realized this wasn't normal and it's nothing like what has happened before. We needed to start thinking about an exit plan.\"",
      "The advice they got from officials was simple: \u201cGet out now.\" Like Andersen, they said they leaned on help from their guide, Ali, to help them get out.",
      "Aziz said that at 1:30 a.m. that night, they drove with Ali \"through the night despite getting zero sleep\" to get to the Turkish border.",
      "\"It was when we approached Tabriz, seven hours from Tehran, the reality of the situation kicked in,\" Aziz says in the video, adding that they saw smoke rising in different areas around them.",
      "\"Locals told us five fighter jets had bombed a cement factory at 5 in the morning. Nowhere was truly safe,\" he added.",
      "Akhtar and Aziz described their goodbyes with their guide when they finally reached Turkey\u2019s border as \u201cemotional.\u201d",
      "\"Even though we had just met, he sacrificed his own family's safety, leaving them behind in Tehran to help us,\" Aziz says in part two of his video series about the experience. \"And for this, we will forever be grateful to him. But not everyone has the privilege of leaving like we did. Millions of people just like Ali are at the receiving end of the war that has nothing to do with them.\""

At the core of it, she said, the focus is \u201cself-determination for the people of Iran.\u201d",

      "\u201cAnd historically, regime change from the skies has not gone well.

      "What she\u2019s also concerned about abroad, Nia said, are reports surrounding alleged terrorist sleeper cells in the U.S. giving rise to the type of racial profiling that proliferated after the 9/11 terror attacks.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that Iranians inside Iran have led successive protest movements to get rid of their regime,\u201d Nia said. \u201cThe Iranian people should not be conflated with a regime that is unelected and has been wielding power through oppression for decades.\u201d"

      "But he said that \u201cno one\u201d including his International Atomic Energy Agency, was \u201cin a position to assess the underground damage at Fordo,\u201d and he called for inspectors to be allowed back \u201cto Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and account for the stockpiles of uranium, including, most importantly, the 400kg enriched to 60%.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration and Israel appear confident they know the location of the highly enriched uranium. Speaking to CBS News' \u201cFace the Nation\u201d before Grossi made his assessment, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that he doubted Iran had been able to move the enriched the uranium and that \u201cwe have to assume that there\u2019s a lot of 60% enriched uranium buried deep under the ground there in Isfahan.\u201d"

      "Iran may be threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz, but experts told CNBC that it\u2019s also the one with the most to lose.",
      "In a major move after U.S. struck Iranian nuclear sites, the country\u2019s parliament on Sunday reportedly approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, risking alienating its neighbors and trade partners.",
      "The decision to close the waterway now rests with the the country\u2019s national security council, and its possibility has raised the specter of higher energy prices and aggravated geopolitical tensions, with Washington calling upon Beijing to prevent the strait\u2019s closure.",

      "Russia watches on as ally Iran is pummeled \u2014 and it\u2019s unlikely to go to Tehran\u2019s rescue",
      "Dollar surge could be short-lived after U.S. strike on Iran",
      "Oil at $100 a barrel? U.S. role in Iran-Israel fight fuels market jitters",
      "Vandana Hari, founder of energy intelligence firm Vanda Insights, told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box Asia\u201d that the possibility of closure remains \u201cabsolutely minimalistic.\u201d",
      "If Iran blocks the strait, the country risks turning its neighboring oil-producing countries into enemies and risks hostilities with them, she said.",
      "Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration revealed that Iran had shipped 1.5 million barrels per day via the Strait of Hormuz in the first quarter of 2025.",
      "Furthermore, a closure would also provoke Iran\u2019s market in Asia, particularly China, which accounts for a majority of Iranian oil exports.",
      "\u201cSo very, very little to be achieved, and a lot of self-inflicted harm that Iran could do,\u201d Hari said.",
      "Her view is supported by Andrew Bishop, senior partner and global head of policy research at advisory firm Signum Global Advisors.",
      "Iran will not want to antagonize China, he said, adding that disrupting supplies will also \u201cput a target\u201d on the country\u2019s own oil production, export infrastructure, and regime \u201cat a time when there is little reason to doubt U.S. and Israeli resolve in being \u2018trigger-happy.\u2019\u201d",
      "Clayton Seigle, senior fellow for Energy Security and Climate Change at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that as China is \u201cvery dependent\u201d on oil flows from the Persian Gulf, not just Iran, \u201cits national security interest really would value stabilization of the situation and a de-escalation enabling safe flows of oil and gas through the strait.\u201d",
      "There are currently no indications of threats to commercial shipping passing through the waterway, according to the Joint Maritime Information Center. \u201cU.S. associated vessels have successfully transited the Strait of Hormuz without interruption, which is a positive sign for the immediate future.\u201d",
      "Impact of potential disruptions",
      "The Strait of Hormuz is the only sea route from the Gulf to the open ocean, and about 20% of the world\u2019s oil transits the waterway. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has described it as the \u201cworld\u2019s most important oil transit chokepoint.\u201d",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s operations in and around Hormuz are unlikely to be \u2018all or nothing\u2019 \u2014 but instead move along a sliding scale from total disruption to none at all,\u201d said Signum\u2019s Bishop.",
      "\u201cThe best strategy [for Iran] would be to rattle Hormuz oil flows just enough to hurt the U.S. via moderate upward price movement, but not enough to provoke a major U.S. response against Iran\u2019s oil production and export capacity,\u201d he added.",
      "On Sunday, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said in a post on X that pump prices in the U.S. could climb to $3.35-$3.50 per gallon in the days ahead, compared with the national average of $3.139 for the week of June 16.",
      "Should Iran decide to close the strait, it would most likely use small boats for a partial blockade, or for a more complete solution, mine the waterway, according to David Roche, strategist at Quantum Strategy.",
      "In a Sunday note, S&P Global Commodity Insights wrote that any Iranian closure of the strait would affect not only Iran\u2019s own exports, but also those of nearby Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar.",
      "That would potentially remove over 17 billion barrels of oil from global markets, and affect regional refineries by causing feedstock shortages, the research firm said. The disruption to supply would impact Asia and Europe as well as North America.",
      "Besides oil, natural gas flows could also be \u201cseverely impacted,\u201d S&P said, with Qatar\u2019s gas exports of about 77 million metric tons per year potentially unable to reach key markets in Asia and Europe.",
      "Qatar\u2019s LNG exports represent about 20% of global LNG supply.",
      "\u201cAlternative supply routes for Middle Eastern oil and gas are limited, with pipeline capacity insufficient to offset potential maritime disruptions through the Persian Gulf and Red Sea,\u201d S&P added.",
      "The Commonwealth Bank of Australia pointed out that \u201cthere is limited scope to bypass the Strait of Hormuz.\u201d Pipelines in Saudi Arabia and the UAE have only a spare capacity of 2.6 million barrels a day between them, while the strait oversees the transport of an estimated 20 million barrels of oil and oil products per day, the bank said in a note.",
      "All these present upside risk to energy prices, with Goldman Sachs estimating that the market is pricing in a geopolitical risk premium of $12.",
      "If oil flows through the strait were to drop by 50% for one month and then were to remain down by 10% for another 11 months, Brent is forecast to \u201cbriefly jump\u201d to a peak of around $110, Goldman said.",
      "Brent oil futures currently stand at $78.95 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate futures were trading at $75.75."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats are seizing on Donald Trump\u2019s surprise attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities to make the case that the world is becoming more dangerous on his watch, not less, and that he is reneging on a promise to avoid foreign military interventions.",
      "The argument strikes at Trump\u2019s contention that his blend of negotiating skills and toughness is enough to keep the United States safe.",
      "In the space of a few days, Trump has made the United States a combatant in another Middle East war that exposes soldiers to potential deadly reprisals, Democrats contend.",
      "In a statement, Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin pointed to Trump's inaugural address, in which he said he would measure his success by \u201cthe wars we never get into.\u201d",
      "Yet, Martin said, \u201cagainst his own words, the president sent bombers into Iran. Americans overwhelmingly do not want to go to war. Americans do not want to risk the safety of our troops abroad.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Several lawmakers said Sunday that they will press the Trump administration for clarity about the attack on Iran and the endgame he envisions. But they are also using the moment to try to undercut Trump's standing with those who voted for him in the hope he would not get entangled in foreign wars.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, said Trump's commitment was \"to get us out of foreign wars.\"",
      "\"Say what you want about Joe Biden, Joe Biden didn\u2019t start any wars,\" Smith said. \"He got us out of the one war that we were in [in Afghanistan]. Trump has now started a war with Iran.\u201d",
      "Justifying the strike, Trump administration officials said the United States has crippled an Iranian nuclear program that poses a worldwide threat.",
      "But the attack could also invite retaliatory strikes against U.S. service members and assets in the region and perhaps even the homeland.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week\" that while he hopes for the best after the attacks, \u201chistory suggests that you better be well aware of the fact that the best-case scenario almost never happens.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that the Iranians have a lot more missiles than we think they do and we end up with dead soldiers and sailors in the region,\u201d he added.",
      "Before Trump ordered the strike, Iran had sent a private message warning him that the regime could unleash terrorist attacks in the United States by activating sleeper cells inside the country, according to two U.S. officials and a person with knowledge of the threat.",
      "What's more, Trump\u2019s State Department put out a warning to Americans worldwide Sunday that they face heightened risk due to the Iranian conflict.",
      "Democrats are also condemning Trump's methods in carrying out the attack, saying he should have sought congressional authorization under the War Powers Act.",
      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Trump's unilateral actions are grounds for impeachment.",
      "\"He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations,\" she wrote on X.",
      "In an interview, Darin Selnick, a former senior Defense Department official under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said he trusted that Trump acted because there was no other choice.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a world of classified and secret information that we don\u2019t know about but the president does,\u201d Selnick said. \u201cKnowing the president, I know he did not make this decision lightly, he did not make it quickly, and he tried every other option before he went down this road and wouldn\u2019t have gone down this road unless he felt he absolutely had to do it.\u201d",
      "A handful of Democrats have voiced support for the strikes, including Reps. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, as well as Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Jacky Rosen of Nevada.",
      "Whether Trump sees the bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities as a one-off or a precursor to deeper U.S. involvement is unclear. He and his senior officials put out conflicting messages Sunday about Iran\u2019s fate.",
      "After Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance said they had no interest in ousting Iran\u2019s leadership in favor of a more palatable regime, Trump suggested that his goal may be more far-reaching. He wrote on social media that he might want to see new leadership in Iran and floated potential \"regime change.\"",
      "\u201cMake Iran Great Again,\u201d he wrote in a twist on his campaign slogan.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said: \u201cThere needs to be a classified briefing of Congress and a public explanation to the American people about the strategy for protecting American troops and personnel, as well as seeking peace and stability in the region.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk about conquering danger, but so far it seems to be his fantasy, not reality. The way to really surmount danger would be to stand up to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, the White House leaned on Vance, who has long been a skeptic of foreign intervention, to defend Trump's decision.",
      "\u201cI certainly empathize with Americans who are exhausted after 25 years of foreign entanglements in the Middle East,\u201d Vance said Sunday on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cI understand the concern, but the difference is that back then, we had dumb presidents, and now we have a president who actually knows how to accomplish America\u2019s national security objectives.\u201d",
      "He also insisted the current conflict \"is not going to be some long, drawn-out thing.\"",
      "As a candidate, Trump said Biden\u2019s fecklessness had contributed to global instability. He often says the pair of wars that started under Biden \u2014 Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel \u2014 would not have happened had he been president.",
      "\u201cThe war between Russia and Ukraine is Biden\u2019s war, not mine. I just got here and for four years during my term had no problem in preventing it from happening,\u201d Trump said in April. \"President Putin and everyone else respected your president!\u201d",
      "Yet Trump\u2019s efforts to broker peace deals in Gaza and Ukraine have faltered, a point that Democrats are quick to note.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that wars have escalated,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who is helping lead the push for Trump to seek approval for military action. \"The war in Gaza continues. The war in Ukraine continues. And now we\u2019re at war with Iran. This is a complete abdication of Trump\u2019s promise to end wars abroad and focus on investing in American communities.\u201d",
      "Democrats, he continued, need to sweep aside leaders who have tolerated such conflicts and develop \u201ca changed message around not having more of these endless wars of choice in the Middle East.\u201d",

      "\"I fear deeply we're being misled about this, just as we were before we tragically got into a war with Iraq,\" he said on \"Fox News Sunday,\" invoking a war that is now deeply unpopular with much of Trump's base.",
      "A successful military operation reflects well on the commander in chief. In his nationwide televised address Saturday night, Trump declared that the strike \"obliterated\" Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities. If that judgment proves premature \u2014 if Iran restores its nuclear program \u2014 his triumphalism could boomerang.",
      "A Republican president from another era, George W. Bush, learned the hard way that it is best to be circumspect before proclaiming \"mission accomplished\" in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThe business about \u2018obliterated,\u2019 that\u2019s Trump,\" said Elliott Abrams, who was a special representative for Iran in the State Department during Trump\u2019s first term and who also worked in the Bush White House. \"Somebody wrote that line for him or it came from him naturally.\"",
      "\u201cWe may well have [destroyed Iran's nuclear facilities], but there\u2019s no way to know that yet,\u201d added Abrams, who is now senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations."
