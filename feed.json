      "LOS ANGELES -- NBC is continuing its strategy of infusing the Olympics with pop culture and celebrity appeal to generate momentum ahead of the Milan-Cortina Winter Games in Italy next year.",
      "This time, Italian American comedians Ray Romano and Sebastian Maniscalco will make their debut during a comical promotion, the network said on Wednesday. The commercial will air during NBC\u2019s Kentucky Derby coverage on Saturday.",
      "In the spot, Romano and Maniscalco stand atop the Italian Alps with snowboards in hand, attempting to discuss thrilling winter sports like skiing, snowboarding and luge. But their discussion is repeatedly sidetracked by their shared obsession with Italian food.",
      "\u201cRay and I teamed up for the Olympics, two Italian guys trying to figure out winter sports,\u201d Maniscalco said in a statement. \u201cLet\u2019s just say, we thought \u2018luge\u2019 was a type of pasta.\u201d",
      "Romano and Maniscalco filmed the commercial in Los Angeles, with the mountaintop backdrop brought to life by Industrial Light & Magic, the visual effects company founded by George Lucas and recently known for its work on \u201cThe Mandalorian.\u201d",
      "The network said Romano and Maniscalco were an easy choice to start building anticipation for the Winter Games.",
      "\u201cBoth are instantly recognizable, deeply beloved, and naturally funny,\u201d said Joseph Lee, senior vice president of creative marketing, sports and entertainment at NBC. He said the network is using the same playbook of enlisting entertainers and athletes.",
      "Last year, popular figures who appeared in promo spots included Snoop Dogg, Megan Thee Stallion, Simone Biles, Peyton Manning, Cardi B, SZA and Lily Collins.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re running the same playbook across the campaign: pairing entertainment personalities with the Olympics (and often Olympians) in fun, unexpected ways,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s how we\u2019ll continue to keep the Games culturally relevant \u2014 and genuinely entertaining.\u201d",

      "Black style will have its moment as the biggest night in fashion gets underway",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Fashion icons like Dapper Dan, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and the late Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley are known for their distinctive approaches to sartorial style \u2014 bold splashes of color, luxurious fabrics, playful construction, capes \u2014 but fashion savants and historians agree that a common thread weaves their tailored looks together: dandyism.",
      "The history-laden style movement will be front and center as part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute spring exhibit, \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d kicking off with the biggest night in fashion, Monday's Met Gala.",
      "Inspired by Monica Miller\u2019s book \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d the exhibit focuses on Black style and specifically menswear from the 18th century to present day, with dandyism as a unifying theme.",
      "Once used to describe the aristocratic style and leisurely pursuits of figures like Regency England's Beau Brummell, dandyism has been recontextualized over the years to embody liberation and resistance through exuberant self-expression.",
      "This evolution of the term began with the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Miller, guest curator of the Met exhibit, writes how, in the 18th century, young, dandified Black servants in England were forced to wear gold, brass or silver collars with padlocks and fine livery \u2014 uniforms for slaves and servants \u2014 that signaled their owners' wealth.",
      "\u201cThey wanted the enslaved person to stand out almost as if they were a luxury item,\u201d said Jonathan Square, Parsons School of Design assistant professor and one of the advisers on the Met exhibit.",
      "Slaves arrived in America with few or no belongings. What they had left, they treasured, be it beads or small precious objects, Miller writes.",
      "\u201cThis is as true for those who were deliberately dressed in silks and turbans, whose challenge was to inhabit the clothing in their own way, as for those who were more humbly attired, who used clothing as a process of remembrance and mode of distinction (and symbolic and sometimes actual escape from bondage) in their new environment,\u201d Miller explains in her book.",
      "Stripped of their identities, enslaved people often added their own flair to their tailored Sunday best looks for church or on holidays.",
      "Post-Emancipation, Black Americans had the chance to reclaim their autonomy and carve out new lives for themselves, paving the way for the Harlem Renaissance.",
      "Black Americans fled the South for cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York in a period dubbed the Great Migration. From the 1920s to the 1930s, New York's Harlem neighborhood became an influential and fertile landscape for Black cultural expression. From Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston to Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, its prominent minds reshaped the fabric of American culture and challenged prejudiced beliefs.",
      "The Harlem Renaissance gave fashion a soul, said Brandice Daniel, founder of Harlem's Fashion Row, an agency that connects designers of color with retailers and brand opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt was this birthplace of this visual identity that spoke to what we now call Black excellence,\u201d she said.",
      "The renaissance meant living and dressing boldly for Black Americans, pushing past societal confines and making themselves visible. Adding their own twist on mainstream looks, women donned furs and beaded dresses while men experimented with tailored fabrics, pristine fedora hats, two-toned oxfords and billowing silhouettes.",
      "\u201cMany of us have a photo of our grandfather decked out with the suiting, but it\u2019s also the stance and the kind of posture and the assertion of presence,\u201d said Tara Donaldson, co-author of \u201cBlack In Fashion: 100 Years Of Style, Influence, and Culture.\u201d",
      "W.E.B. Du Bois, a pivotal figure of the era who often appeared in a three-piece suit, a frock coat and top hat, understood the power of self-fashioning, said Valerie Steele, director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, Du Bois mounted a photographic exhibit centered on showcasing Black Americans\u2019 economic, social and cultural contributions to combat stereotypes.",
      "\u201cThat kind of self-fashioning is very much a way of reclaiming a sense of self-respect that had been denied by a society that aggressively was saying, \u2018No, no you can\u2019t have that,\u2019\u201d Steele said.",
      "One style that arose out of the Harlem Renaissance, directly linked to dandyism, was the zoot suit. The suit, defined by high-waisted draped pants and oversized jackets with exaggerated shoulders and large lapels, was subversive simply by taking up space. Because of fabric rations during World War II, owning a zoot suit, with its excessive use of fabric, was an act of protest, Square said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a provocation,\u201d Square said. \u201cBut also, it\u2019s a form of protection, covering a part of your body, sort of saying, \u2018You don\u2019t have access to this.\u2019\u201d",
      "The style was quickly adopted by Mexican American and Filipino American men in Los Angeles. In 1943, servicemen and police officers attacked Black, Mexican and Filipino men in what was labeled the Zoot Suit Riots. The zoot suit lives on today in the gender-fluid designs of Willy Chavarria.",
      "Dandyism was not limited to men. Following World War I, women began breaking down fashion's gender norms. With her tuxedo and top hat, blues singer and entertainer Gladys Bentley epitomized how women in the Harlem Renaissance blurred gender lines and adopted more masculine styles of dress.",
      "Singer and actor Mon\u00e1e, who sits on this year\u2019s Met Gala\u2019s host committee, is not shy about standing out on a red carpet in her tailored, playful looks. Mon\u00e1e's distinct style and flourishes with oversized hats, whimsically tailored suits and ornate bow ties personify the dandy style.",
      "As Mon\u00e1e and the rest of the starry guest list arrive in their glamorous \u201cTailored for You\u201d looks, Monday will be a night to remember all the dandies who styled out before.",
      "\u201cBlack people, Black men are finally getting their flowers for being true style icons,\u201d said designer Ev Bravado, co-founder of Who Decides War. \u201cIt is amazing to see the ancestral work being put on display.\u201d",

      "In a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d T",
      "NEW YORK -- One of the toughest things about appearing on Broadway might not be the acting or the hours. It's squeezing your resume to under 100 words for your bio in Playbill. T.R. Knight tried to include all of it, initially.",
      "\u201cI was getting angry at myself for getting precious about what to include and what not to include,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, 'You are being ridiculous.'\u201d",
      "So instead of trying to fit in a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey's Anatomy,\u201d a David Mamet play and \u201c The Flight Attendant, \u201d Knight changed direction.",
      "\u201cThere once was an actor named Knight,\u201d his Playbill blurb now reads. \u201cWho knew his stage-left from stage-right/He went to do some TV/But now he's happy to be/Back in front of the glowing footlights.\u201d",
      "What has lured him back on Broadway is the jaw-dropping prequel to the Netflix hit show \u201cStranger Things,\u201d a play with levitating cats, shattered mirrors and Vegas showgirls.",
      "Set in Hawkins, Indiana, 20 years before the events of the first season, \u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d focuses on the creation of a monster, the villainous Vecna, played by \u2014 Louis McCartney. Knight portrays his father.",
      "We are introduced to a shy, awkward teen Henry Creel \u2014 who later will be Vecna \u2014 as he moves to Hawkins and goes to high school. He has strange powers and worries a lot.",
      "His father is not in a great place, suffering from PTSD and drinking too much. \u201cI think he desperately wants to be a good husband and a good father, and I think he knows that he is failing at both,\u201d says Knight. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the tools to stop it.\u201d",
      "Knight was a \u201cStranger Things\u201d fan even before he joined the play, looking forward to every season. He was asked to audition for a different character but was drawn to the father after reading the script.",
      "\u201cAlthough our damage is different, I felt that I understood that damage in a way that I did not understand this other character,\u201d he says. \u201cI just felt it strong enough in my gut that it felt like it could be a better match.\u201d",
      "\u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d co-director Justin Martin says Knight is constantly changing his approach and always surprising, calling him a \u201cRenaissance man in terms of his acting\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always about the work. He\u2019s very much interested in very, very different characters and different styles of acting. And so he constantly is pushing himself. Every time he does the scene it\u2019s slightly different,\u201d says Martin. \u201cHe\u2019s going, \u2018What else can I find? What else could I mine?\u2019 which I love in an actor.\u201d",
      "The \u201cStranger Things\u201d play was also attractive to Knight because of its director: Stephen Daldry, the three-time Tony Award-winner who helmed \u201cBilly Elliot: The Musical.\u201d",
      "Knight recalls being blown away by the way Daldry told the story without sentimentality of an 11-year-old boy who just wants to dance.",
      "\u201cThe way he was able to distill that down in such a brutally beautiful, honest way left me \u2014 when I left that theater \u2014 I remember being both empty and filled up at the same time if that\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "Knight and his husband have moved back to the New York area after years in Los Angeles, wanting to do more theater, something he calls \u201chome.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still so challenging, still immensely challenging, maddeningly challenging to me \u2014 theater \u2014 but I love it,\u201d he says. \u201cI just missed it.\u201d",
      "Knight grew up in Minneapolis and spent two years at the city\u2019s storied Guthrie Theater before moving to New York at 25. He became a household name in the hit ABC medical drama \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d which he left after five seasons.",
      "He feels like a new chapter is opening, one with confidence and maturity. The move coincides with a change in his creative work and life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time and maybe it\u2019s a time where I can let go of a lot of the nonsense that I have maybe worried about \u2014 maybe? Do you like the way I said, maybe worried about in the past? The nonsense has kind of plagued me.\u201d",

      "In 2019, David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly where he said his \u201cpie in the sky ambition\u201d was to play Superman",
      "In true Clark Kent form, the new Superman would like to correct the record.",
      "David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly in 2019 where he said his \u201cpie in the sky ambition\u201d was to play Superman.",
      "At that point, the role was not on the market. And Corenswet, a Julliard graduate and Philadelphia native, was just making a name for himself in the industry, with plum breakout roles in two Ryan Murphy Netflix series: \u201cThe Politician\u201d and \u201cHollywood.\u201d Tall, dark, and you know, handsome, people had told him that he looked like Superman for a long time. He did not, he told The Associated Press in a recent interview, think that he was going to get the chance to play him.",
      "But a few years later he was actually cast to lead James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d which will begin a new, hopefully high-flying, era for the DC universe of films when it hits theaters on July 11. And that once innocent quote took on a life of its own. Many headlines and stories misinterpreted the phrase and wrote that he said it was his dream role, as though he'd manifested it into existence.",
      "\u201cI said it was my pie in the sky ambition, which I meant to mean that there was no (expletive) way it was ever going to happen,\u201d Corenswet, 31, said. \u201cI sort of was thinking of it as, \u2018Oh, who wouldn\u2019t love to get to play an iconic role like that? Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing and impossible if we lived in a universe where that could even be considered?\u2019\u201d",
      "Right around the time when Gunn was starting to think about casting his new Superman movie, he decided to watch his friend Ti West\u2019s movie \u201cPearl.\u201d In that darkly comedic horror, Corenswet stood out to him as an interesting and charismatic presence. He played a projectionist at a local movie theater who catches Pearl\u2019s attention (and, later, faces her wrath). West had nice things to say about him too.",
      "\u201cDavid was one of the very first auditions that I got,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cInstantly, it was a relief because he had a playful charm about him that was not evident in \u2018Pearl.' He had a sense of humor. That made me go, \u2018Ooh, this might be a really good match.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was just the beginning of the long casting process. Even Nicholas Hoult, who was ultimately cast as Lex Luthor, was up for the part. And though it was \u201cextensive,\u201d Corenswet said it was one of the most \u201csatisfying audition processes\u201d he\u2019s ever gone through \u2014 not because he booked the role, but because he felt he got the opportunity to show them what he had to offer.",
      "Gunn laughed that Corenswet actually has a lot of Superman in him.",
      "\u201cSuperman is a square and David is a square,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cHe listens to American Songbook. Like Dean Martin and Cole Porter. That\u2019s what he listens to on his iPad. That\u2019s weird. But oh, so Superman.\u201d",
      "When Gunn called him with the good news, the first person he told was his wife. The second was his sister, who couldn\u2019t pick up the phone because she was on a golf course.",
      "\u201cShe texted, \u2018Is it possible that was a phone call with super good news?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes. Super good news.\u2019\u201d",
      "It may be something of a Superman tradition to try on your predecessor\u2019s costume during a screen test. Henry Cavill did it with Christopher Reeve\u2019s, and Corenswet did it with Cavill\u2019s, which he called a \u201cmarvel of engineering.\u201d",
      "But the first time Corenswet put on his own Superman costume was not some magical, transportive moment. In fact, he said, it was \u201cwonderfully mundane.\u201d The suit was still in its beginning stages, not totally put together and even a little small, as he\u2019d already started putting on weight for the role.",
      "\u201cI remember the feeling of kind of growing into the suit and the suit growing around me fitting by fitting,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cWe had such an amazing costume team and they built the suit around me over the course of many weeks and months and it started to feel just a little bit like home for me.\u201d",
      "The first time he felt the impact of it was through the eyes of other people. To him, it was old hat, but when he walked onto set the first time in the suit he noticed something different from the cast and crew.",
      "\u201cI saw their faces sort of light up and I went, \u2018Wait a minute, these people aren\u2019t that fond of me,\u2019\u201d he laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s when it hits you.\u201d",
      "There are almost three roles involved in playing Superman. There\u2019s the person he is with his parents and the people he grew up with. There\u2019s Clark Kent of the Daily Planet. And then there\u2019s Superman.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a public facing character, he\u2019s a symbol,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cThere\u2019s a presentational element to it, because he does want to present an image of calm and authority. While he doesn\u2019t always feel that way, he always wants to make other people feel that way as Superman.\u201d",
      "To prepare for Clark Kent, Corenswet looked at the All-Star Superman comic and how Christopher Reeve changed his posture when Lois left the room, but he also drew inspiration for the voice and demeanor way outside of the canon: His brother-in-law, who is 6\u20198\u201d and 270 pounds, but is the \u201cquietest, most wonderful man.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where I sort of took the spirit of Clark,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cHe\u2019s this big presence, but he\u2019s desperately trying to be as small as possible and as quiet as possible.\u201d",
      "Gunn has promised that the film is \u201ca personal journey for Superman that\u2019s entirely new.\u201d He\u2019s a character who is \u201cpretty damn good, but flawed.\u201d And anyone who has seen the trailer knows there will be romance with Rachel Brosnahan\u2019s Lois Lane \u2014 but there\u2019s even a different spin on that.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in love with her,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one that needs the convincing in the relationship. It\u2019s not him. You really see where he needs her in his life.\u201d",
      "Corenswet said that in addition to the action and thrills, the movie also has a Preston Sturges quality to it with \u201clonging romance and witty comedy.\u201d Fitting for their reporter characters, \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d was also a big reference with \u201cthe rhythm, the patter and the feeling of two people in love who really are an equal match for the other.\u201d",
      "The movie is the start of a new era for DC films, and will raise Corenswet\u2019s profile immeasurably. He\u2019s been in big movies before, including \u201cTwisters.\u201d But being Superman is different.",
      "\u201cThe thing that it changed about my life immediately was that I had this amazing mission that I got to go on of playing the part and getting to be a piece of making this awesome film,\u201d he said. \"I have so many new friends now. James brings together such a familial cast and crew. And shooting the film is sort of like an extended summer camp.\u201d",
      "Adding to the summer camp vibes: On the last day they even gathered to watch a little blooper reel that Gunn had put together. But what will happen come release is not really something he can fathom at this point.",
      "\u201cI expect some things will change when the film comes out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, one still has to wake up and eat breakfast.\u201d",

Now a new Apple TV+ period drama, \u201cCar\u00eame,\u201d argues that he was the very first celebrity chef. There's even a \u201cTop Chef\u201d style cooking contest in front of a panel of judges.",

      "The series, which drops its first two episodes Wednesday, also shows how Car\u00eame wasn\u2019t just a cook, or master pastry maker, or, well, sex god. We watch as he's pulled into political intrigue by his boss, the cunning diplomat Talleyrand, and used as a spy.",
      "Still, his goal was to be the best chef in the world. The show\u2019s first season ends with an extraordinary outdoor coronation banquet that Car\u00eame creates for thousands of people. When he places, in triumph, a tall white chef\u2019s hat on his head for the first time, it's as if he's crowning himself \u2014 and marking his ascent to celebrity.",

      "\u201cWhen you find the right actor for the right part, 80% of the job is done,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were very impressed with his youthful attitude but also his rock \u2018n\u2019 roll attitude. He is absolutely Car\u00eame in real life \u2014 very attractive for everyone, a young man who is maybe sometimes a bit insouciant, or careless. \u201c",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly, the show plays up the sex factor. The first scene sets the tone with Car\u00eame and his lover, Henriette, in a food-tasting session that morphs immediately into sex, but then duty calls: Napoleon\u2019s soldiers are coming for dinner.",
      "Bourboulon says that first scene was very intentional, establishing in a few minutes the three main themes of the series: food, sex and politics. Did we mention sex?",
      "Of course, he wasn\u2019t an accomplished chef, so Voisin was given intensive lessons.",
      "\u201cI spent two months in the kitchen to learn the customs of the great French tradition,\u201d the actor says. He focused on learning how to realistically convey what Car\u00eame did best: invent dishes of wild whimsy, especially flamboyant dessert creations like a huge pyramid, or the \u201ccroquembouche\u201d tower \u2014 a cascade of cream puffs. Car\u00eame is also known for inventing the vol-au-vent, an airy French pastry shell.",
      "But even so, this master pastry maker can't even chop an onion correctly when he arrives for work at his first big kitchen job. The job of teaching him falls to the talented sous-chef in Talleyrand's kitchen, Agathe (Alice Da Luz).",
      "Da Luz trained alongside Voisin on the kitchen brigade at the Ferrandi culinary school in Paris \u2014 and vastly improved her skill set. \u201cWe really learned the choreography of a kitchen, we really learned technique,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd today I can boast that I cut onions at a crazy speed.\u201d",
      "The actors had a dream workspace: The production spent six weeks building a huge, airy kitchen where they work for Talleyrand \u2014 unlike the cramped, smoky kitchens that would be more historically accurate.",
      "Viewers may feel the need to brush up on their history. The show takes place shortly after Napoleon seized political power in 1799 and became first consul, on his way to later declaring himself emperor.",
      "The actors had to brush up, too.",
      "Voisin says he knew about \u201cthe victories and defeats of Bonaparte,\u201d but had to learn from scratch the story of Car\u00eame.",
      "Lyna Khoudri, who plays mysterious Henriette \u2014 who may or may not be on her lover\u2019s side \u2014 notes: \u201cWe\u2019re making a series about the heritage of French culinary art, a story I didn\u2019t know. I found out why we\u2019re so famous for our cuisine in France.\u201d",
      "Da Luz had studied the period at school but dove into it more deeply once she was cast. There was not a lot to read about Agathe, but she read everything she could find. And then, she says, \u201cI let my imagination go,\u201d inspired to bring a woman out of the shadows of history.",
      "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier, who plays Talleyrand (actual name Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord), also engaged in extensive research. \u201cIt\u2019s a character who has led a thousand lives,\u201d he said, \u201cwho lived through almost a century of history, at a time when people were guillotined for not much. So ... he must have been very clever.\u201d",
      "The show, for Renier, is in large part about ambition. \u201cAll these characters have a goal, a dream to achieve,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question is, what are we ready to win or lose to achieve this dream?\u201d",
      "The production is lush throughout the whole season, beginning with the gorgeous country homes \u2014 filmmakers scouted 60 of them, and chose 12. They created new dinner services to dress the tables, and made 3,000 candles to light all the candelabras \u2014 different hues for different rooms. There were 96 vases of fresh flowers at all times in Talleyrand\u2019s home, according to production notes.",
      "As for costumes, some 1,000 of them were made from scratch, because the filmmakers had a specific vision of clothing that was not period-accurate but also not completely modern.",
      "Then there was that crazy banquet that ends the season. Filming at the Parc de Saint-Cloud, which boasts dramatic fountains, the production created a giant tent covered with \u201can extraordinary amount of velvet,\u201d and loaded down the tables with food, including a 60 kilo (132 pound) leg of lamb and a 50 kilo (110-pound) tuna.",
      "They also made 5,000 cream puffs, which were assembled into grand, towering structures \u2014 befitting not only a new emperor but the world\u2019s first celebrity chef.",

      "Tardy photographers",
      "NEW YORK -- Like all brides, Elana Goldin had high hopes for her wedding photos and video.",
      "\u201cI loved their images,\u201d she said of the company picked by her dad and future mother-in-law. \u201cThey were award-winning. They were in a ton of magazines. I really liked the vibe of the owner.\u201d",
      "The feeling didn't last.",
      "The photographer, who showed up 45 minutes late with a team of two, wasn't the owner, as the company had promised. She was someone Goldin had never spoken to. The fill-in had a bad attitude from the start, said Goldin, who lives in Chicago and got married last May in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.",
      "Among other things, the photographer criticized Goldin's bridal shoes, jewelry and perfume as second rate for traditional close-up shots, and she picked apart the bouquets without permission to get images before the ceremony.",
      "\u201cShe and the florist got into a fight. There was friction from the moment she walked in,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "Looking back, Goldin said she would have done a few things differently.",
      "We asked wedding planners and photographers to also weigh in on how they think photo disaster can be averted.",
      "Goldin wishes she had been more assertive. She had provided a shotlist ahead of time, but the photographer assigned to the bride and bridesmaids started making demands on where she wanted Goldin to pose.",
      "\u201cI'm in my dress and she said let\u2019s take a picture in the shower, because it was a very big, glamorous shower. My sister was like, absolutely not. Not happening,\u201d Goldin recalled.",
      "At the venue, the photographer insisted on taking photos outside. The weather was rainy and windy, and the lighting was dreary.",
      "\u201cIt was disgusting outside. My dress got all dirty at the bottom. My hair starts frizzing. The bridesmaids came out and our hair was blowing everywhere. The pictures were awful,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "You love them dearly. But New Jersey-based wedding planner Danielle Rothweiler of Rothweiler Event Design advises against it.",
      "\u201cI always tell my couples, stop hiring your friends and family because if something goes wrong, think of that conversation that you\u2019re going to have. No one wants that,\u201d she said.",
      "One client took up an uncle on his offer to shoot her wedding as his gift. He missed half the shots and didn't understand the importance of timing. He also spent a good amount of time just being a guest and not taking pictures at all.",
      "\u201cShe never said anything. The pictures weren't great,\u201d Rothweiler said. \u201cI have a wedding coming up this year and half the vendor list is friends and family and I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m so scared about it.\u201d",
      "Michelle Jackson, who owns the photo vendor Bambino International based in Cincinnati, Ohio, said some basic questions about equipment can go a long way.",
      "Make sure your photographers have back up camera bodies and other crucial equipment of the same quality as their primary gear, she said. Cameras with dual slots for SD cards or XQD cards are optimal.",
      "\u201cEverything's being copied onto two cards,\u201d she said. \u201cThe worst disaster for a photographer is you have no pictures at all because of equipment failure. Couples don't think about that.\u201d",
      "In the same vein, San Francisco wedding photographer Oscar Urizar, the proprietor of Red Eye Collection in San Francisco, said couples should ensure they have the rights to personal use of their photos. That allows them to print, share and display them for non-commercial purposes.",
      "\u201cI started in the film industry. If you didn\u2019t get your negatives, you couldn\u2019t print your photos. It's kind of that same thinking,\u201d he said.",
      "There's nothing more chaotic than organizing group shots at weddings. The larger the wedding, the more chaotic it can be.",
      "Wedding planner Tirusha Dave, founder of the luxury market Bravura Brides, serves South Asian couples around the world with guest lists up to 300 or more.",
      "She puts together a shareable document and asks couples to list every person expected in each group shot, but she doesn't stop there. She has them designate one person to serve as wrangler. The wrangler must know every person in the group by sight so they can be chased down if necessary.",
      "\u201cI tell my couples, I\u2019m really great at what I do but I don't know your second cousins, your extended aunts and uncles,\u201d Dave said.",
      "Each group is assigned a number that's announced when it's time to gather.",
      "Dallas-area photographer April Pinto, founder and co-owner of April Pinto Photography, has a stable of shooters. They can juggle up to four weddings a week.",
      "They sink or swim by how well the timeline is observed. Not an easy task, Pinto said, \u201cwhen you have a coordinator timing you and the mother of the groom who wasn\u2019t on the Zoom call making her own agenda and stressing out the bride. We're in the middle of all of that.\u201d",
      "But that's just part of the challenge. The other part?",
      "The rowdy bridesmaid, Pinto said. She's somebody who might have had a bit too much Champagne and feels like she should be in charge.",
      "\u201cIf a bridesmaid is feeling a little too spicy, we try to give her tasks,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cI find that keeping people in general engaged and involved can go a long way. You can turn all that stress into a happy time.\u201d",

      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders",
      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders. It seems unfair to add the fate of the summer movie season to his list. But he's not alone \u2014 Marvel Studios is also returning to theaters in a big way with two movies this summer, \u201cThunderbolts\u201d and \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps.\u201d",
      "Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic brought the movie business to a halt, and two years after the strikes, the industry has yet to fully recover. Critics may have complained of superhero fatigue, but after several summers of depleted offerings, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re a vital part of the mix.",
      "Superheroes alone don't make for a healthy marketplace, however, and this year studios have set a full slate for every kind of moviegoer, with over 40 wide releases spanning genres.",
      "\u201cThis is the summer where all this product that we\u2019ve all been working on for the last few years is finally coming into the marketplace, so I\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d says Joseph Kosinski, who directed \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt.",
      "Summer begins early in Hollywood, on the first weekend in May and that kick-off can make or break that pivotal 123 day corridor that has historically accounted for around 40% of the annual box office.",
      "After the strikes upended the 2024 summer calendar, this year Disney is back in that familiar first weekend spot with \u201cThunderbolts.\" Memorial Day weekend could also be a behemoth with the live action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning.\" With a new \u201cJurassic World,\u201d a live action \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d and the Formula One movie also on the schedule through June and July, the summer season has the potential to be the biggest in the post-COVID era.",
      "There are also family pics (\u201cSmurfs,\u201d \u201cElio\"); action and adventures (\u201cBallerina,\u201d \u201cThe Karate Kid: Legends\u201d); horrors, thrillers and slashers (\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d \u201cM3GAN 2.0\"); romances (\u201cMaterialists,\u201d \u201cJane Austen Wrecked My Life\u201d); dramas (\u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d); a new Wes Anderson movie (\u201cThe Phonecian Scheme\u201d); and comedies (\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d \u201cBride Hard,\u201d \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d).",

It\u2019s taking a very real person and putting them in the middle of this outrageous situation and outrageous world and playing with that. I think it\u2019s a lot of fun because of that.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working on an incredibly large scale in terms of world building, but it\u2019s also no different from all of the great comedies and dramas that I\u2019ve done,\u201d says \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d director Matt Shakman. \u201cIn the end, it comes down to character, it comes down to relationships, it comes down to heart and humor.\u201d",

Even with increased ticket prices, theatrical movies remain the most affordable entertainment outside of the home and attendance tends to increase during recession years. The annual domestic box office crossed $10 billion for the first time in 2009.",

      "The first of three accusers involved in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial has taken the witness stand",
      "NEW YORK -- When Harvey Weinstein' s landmark 2020 #MeToo conviction was overturned, accuser Miriam Haley was frank about her feelings about participating in a retrial: \u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to actually go through that again.\u201d",
      "But on Tuesday, Haley became the first of the former movie tycoon\u2019s accusers to take the witness stand as prosecutors seek to convict him again. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "As Haley started what are expected to be multiple days of testimony, she walked quickly to the witness stand without looking at Weinstein. The ex-studio boss, sitting between his lawyers, looked at her as she passed by and again when prosecutors asked her to identify him from the stand.",
      "Haley told the jury that when she went to meet Weinstein on the sidelines of the 2006 Cannes film festival, all she wanted was work.",
      "But Weinstein commented on her legs, asked for a massage and, when she balked, asked her to give him one, she recalled.",
      "\u201cDid you have any interest whatsoever in the defendant, Harvey Weinstein, romantically or sexually?\u201d prosecutor Nicole Blumberg asked Haley, 48.",
      "\u201cNo, I did not, and I was there to try and find work,\u201d said Haley, who\u2019d been an assistant to another producer.",
      "Her testimony so far closely echoes what she told the prior jury, though she hasn't yet gotten to the July 2006 date when she has said Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. She recounted earlier interactions with Weinstein that alternated between being personally off-putting and professionally encouraging for her.",
      "Haley said she left the Cannes meeting crying and feeling humiliated. But she accepted when Weinstein arranged a basic assistant job for her on his company's reality show \u201cProject Runway\u201d in June 2006.",
      "After the roughly three-week gig ended and Haley thanked him by email, Weinstein communicated that he'd heard good things about her work and invited her to meet at a Manhattan hotel lobby, she said as prosecutors displayed her 2006 calendar with the meeting noted.",
      "She and Weinstein talked business, and he was \u201cvery respectful and quite charming\u201d and talked about other potential job opportunities, she recalled.",
      "\u201cWere you flirty or suggesting anything sexual between you and the defendant at that meeting?\" the prosecutor asked.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Haley replied.",
      "She said another meeting in Weinstein's office also went pleasantly and professionally, and so did a ride with him, his assistant and his driver back to her apartment \u2014 and then the Hollywood honcho suddenly suggested she accompany him to Paris fashion shows.",
      "Haley said she had no interest in going but gave a vague response, \u201ctrying to be polite.\u201d They said goodbye.",
      "Yet Weinstein repeatedly asked her to come to Paris with him for fashion shows, even showing up uninvited and barging into her apartment to try to persuade her, she said.",
      "Haley told jurors she again declined, but Weinstein was \u201cinsistent and overwhelming,\u201d so she told him: \u201cI heard about your reputation with women.\u201d",
      "Weinstein took a step back, seeming offended, and quizzed her about what she meant, she recalled. She told jurors she actually hadn't heard much about Weinstein at that point but was just trying to avoid the Paris trip.",
      "Eventually, Weinstein left the apartment and backed off, she said.",
      "Almost two decades later, a series of sexual assault and sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein would energize the #MeToo movement's demands to hold powerful men accountable for misconduct toward women.",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, is expected to continue testifying Wednesday.",
      "The retrial is happening because New York's highest court found the original trial was tainted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Steven Spielberg proclaimed \u201cThe Godfather\u201d the \u201cgreatest American film ever made,\u201d Robert De Niro teasingly bemoaned being cast in the sequel and not the original and Harrison Ford fought back tears reflecting on his role in the 1974 film, \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all was Francis Ford Coppola, who on Saturday received the AFI Life Achievement Award at a ceremony at Dolby Theatre that brought together legendary stars from a seemingly bygone era of cinema,",
      "A founding AFI trustee, Coppola\u2019s recognition from the organization was a kind of full circle moment for the \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d director.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a kid there was the Oscars and that was it. Now they\u2019re going to have an award show for the best award show,\u201d the 86-year-old said on the red carpet ahead of the show. \u201cBut this is a little different because it\u2019s a personal recognition of the people that you\u2019ve known all your life and your colleagues over many years, so it\u2019s like a homecoming in a way.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou, sir, are peerless. You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film,\u201d Spielberg said.",
      "Coppola sat between Spielberg and George Lucas, as actors and fellow filmmakers like Spike Lee, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Morgan Freeman took turns gushing over the Oscar winner.",
      "\u201cDreamer of dreams on a dime, teller of tales that cost and lost millions. But tonight, (expletive) the bankers and the bank,\u201d Freeman said to laughs and cheers.",
      "Lucas, Coppola\u2019s longtime friend and colleague, presented him with the award. The pair have known each other for decades and cofounded their own production company, American Zoetrope, in 1969.",
      "\u201cYou rounded up a bunch of young film students, gathered us together. We moved to San Francisco, hoping to beat the system. And we did. Like the filmmakers from the dawn of the art form, we had no rules. We wrote them, and you were holding the pen,\u201d Lucas said.",
      "Coppola was mostly stoic throughout the ceremony as Hollywood sang his praises \u2014 until he accepted the award at the end of the night. He beamed as he approached the stage and thanked the room, which was filled with some of his family members as well as multigenerational A-listers.",
      "\u201cNow I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn\u2019t really a place at all, but you \u2014 friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,\u201d he said. \u201cI am and will always be nothing more than one of you.\u201d",
      "Coppola was the 50th recipient of the award first handed out to John Ford in 1973.",
      "Guests were served wine from the Francis Ford Coppola Winery and after dinner \u2014 true to his Italian heritage \u2014 a trio of cannolis. Actors who have worked with Coppola painted a unified picture of him as a director, reminiscing on how they were invited to participate and educated about film in a way that empowered them.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very professorial. He talks about history and things and even older movies in the scene he\u2019s inspired by,\u201d said \u201cThe Godfather III\u201d star Andy Garcia. \u201cYou go into working with him in a movie, and you go in seeking an associate\u2019s degree and you would walk out with a master\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Coppola last year released his long-in development \u201cMegalopolis,\u201d a Roman epic set in a modern New York. The film drew mixed reviews from critics and flopped with audiences. Coppola, though, has maintained he was compelled to make \u201cMegalopolis\u201d as an artist, not as a businessman. He self-financed the film.",
      "\u201cFor a year in our culture when the importance of the arts is minimized, and our industry is seemingly out in the open that the only metric to judge a film\u2019s success is by how much money it makes, I hang on to individuals like Francis for inspiration, who live through their convictions,\u201d said Adam Driver, who starred in the film.",

      "\u201cMe love you long time,\u201d a Vietnamese sex worker tells the U.S. troops, swiveling her hips as she hawks her services. \u201cYou party?\u201d The first female character in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Vietnam War classic \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d she appears for just a moment \u2014 and halfway through the film.",
      "Likewise, it\u2019s an hour into Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d when a helicopter suddenly deposits three women onto a stage. They're scantily clad Playboy Bunnies, choppered in to rile up the troops. They, too, appear for just a few minutes.",
      "The Vietnam War produced some of the most unforgettable films of the late 1970s and 1980s, as top Hollywood filmmakers like Kubrick, Coppola, Oliver Stone and others grappled with its painful legacy. Few, however, had classic, or even three-dimensional, female characters \u2014 with the notable exception of \u201cComing Home,\u201d which won Jane Fonda an Oscar.",
      "But while these films were almost exclusively about how war dehumanized men \u2014 with female characters mere devices to tell that story \u2014 the opposite was often true of Vietnamese films about the conflict. Many of these were told from a female viewpoint \u2014 the stories of brave and loyal women, for example, left to hold families together.",
      "Here are some ways that classic Vietnam War films used female characters to tell their stories:",
      "Michael Cimino\u2019s multi-Oscar-winning \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d focuses on three lifelong buddies from a Pennsylvania steel town who go off to fight, with traumatic results.",
      "Since the 1978 drama starts and ends at home, there\u2019s room for a female character in Meryl Streep\u2019s Linda, girlfriend of Nick (Christopher Walken) who also connects with Michael (Robert De Niro). An early-career Streep was such a magnetic presence as Linda \u2014 earning an Oscar nomination \u2014 that it disguised a fairly thin role that mainly advanced the men's narrative.",
      "A rare contrast was Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d the same year, in which Fonda and Jon Voight both won Oscars for the tale of a Marine wife embroiled in an intense affair with a wounded veteran at the rehab center where she volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is the only Hollywood film set during the Vietnam War that\u2019s told from the point of view of a female character,\u201d says filmmaker Tony Bui, who also teaches Vietnam War cinema at Columbia University. \u201cThat's really saying something.\u201d",
      "Its tortured journey to the screen is a drama in itself, but 1979's \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d with Martin Sheen as an army captain tasked with assassinating a renegade U.S. colonel (Marlon Brando), is considered a masterpiece of the genre. As in many Hollywood Vietnam films, women are extras in villages, screaming and running from gunfire and deadly explosions \u2014 or killed brutally for no reason at all.",
      "Then there are the Playboy Bunnies, who gyrate to \u201cSuzy Q\u201d as the troops become increasingly frenzied with erotic excitement and eventually storm the stage.",
      "Lan Duong, assistant professor of cinema studies at the University of Southern California, sees Coppola trying to make a connection between sex, warfare and masculinity.",
      "\u201cWith American white women in particular, they\u2019re seen as part of the American mythology around manhood,\u201d Duong says. Full-blooded manhood with raging hormones, she says, is \u201cas American as apple pie.\u201d",
      "In 1986's \u201cPlatoon,\u201d Stone's Oscar-winning depiction of jungle warfare, representation of women comes in a horrific scene in which U.S. troops kills hundreds of innocent villagers, evoking the real-life My Lai massacre. During the slaughter, idealistic soldier Chris (Charlie Sheen) comes upon soldiers raping young women. \u201cShe\u2019s a human being!\u201d he screams. They reply: \u201cYou don\u2019t belong in \u2019Nam, man.\u201d",
      "These women are given no voice. They appear \u201conly in relation to the violence inflicted by men,\u201d Bui says.",
      "In Brian de Palma\u2019s \u201cCasualties of War\u201d (1989), the tragic rape victim actually becomes a central character in the plot. This does not mean, however, that we learn much of anything about this Vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Le).",
      "Based on a real event, the film follows five soldiers whose leader (Sean Penn) devises a sickening plan: The group will kidnap a young girl for \u201crecreation\u201d during a mission.",
      "Only Pvt. Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) objects. The four others not only rape the girl, but eventually pump her with bullets. Eriksson takes the case to superiors, who advise him to drop it. But Eriksson persists, and the men earn punishment.",
      "Though important, this brutalized girl is again voiceless. \u201cShe goes from suffering, to suffering more, and then gets killed \u2014 that\u2019s her arc,\u201d says Bui, who includes the movie in a Criterion Channel collection he has curated on Vietnam films.",
      "Kubrick\u2019s memorable 1987 \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d contains two brief, stereotypical scenes involving sex workers. But the most interesting scene involving a female character comes during battle, where a sniper targeting U.S. troops turns out to be a terrified girl in pigtails. As she lies mortally wounded, she begs quietly, \u201cShoot me.\u201d The soldiers oblige.",
      "The stereotypical nature of the sex worker scenes is, for Bui, redeemed somewhat by the character of the sniper (Ngoc Le), whose courage is acknowledged.",
      "In Bui's own \u201cThree Seasons,\u201d a 1999 Vietnamese-American production, sex worker Lan (Diep Bui) is central to the story, an exploration of postwar life in Ho Chi Minh City. A cyclo driver falls in love with Lan and trails her around the city, trying to help her find a better life.",
      "Bui says his research has found that more than half of Vietnamese films about the conflict have female protagonists. One of the most famous, H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d (1974), follows a young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searching for her family in bombed-out Hanoi.",
      "Another, \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh\u2019s \u201cWhen the Tenth Month Comes\u201d (1984), tells the story of Duyen (L\u00ea V\u00e2n), a young wife and mother in the rural north whose husband goes to war. Her ailing father-in-law asks frequently why the soldier has not written home. Duyen learns one day that her husband's been dead for a year and enlists a local schoolteacher to help her hide that by forging eloquent letters.",
      "The character is emblematic of the way Vietnamese culture has long portrayed the woman: fierce, loyal and resilient in the face of adversity, argues Duong.",
      "\u201cShe is beautiful. She\u2019s suffering. She\u2019s loyal to the memory of her dead husband,\u201d notes Duong. \u201cIt\u2019s been argued by \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh himself ... that she's a symbol for the nation itself. So it becomes a really rich metaphor for filmmakers.\u201d",
      "The risk, she adds, is that such characters, serving as symbols, can also lack dimension.",
      "Stone is one of the only directors to have explicitly addressed the minimal role of women in his Vietnam works, saying \u201cPlatoon\u201d was deliberately a male-driven narrative.",
      "But with his third and last Vietnam War film, \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d (1993), Stone shifted to the perspective of a real-life Vietnamese woman: Le Ly (Hiep Thi Le), who endures rape and torture as a young woman, then moves to California with her troubled American military husband (Tommy Lee Jones).",
      "\u201cThere is some truth to the criticism of my treatment of women,\u201d Stone said while making the film. \u201cI have a lot to learn about everything, not just women.\u201d",
      "Making his point crystal clear, Stone dedicates the film at the end to his mother, Jacqueline Stone.",

      "But everyone inside the club's historic Racecourse Ground knew what was coming, and within seconds of the whistle the field was a sea of red as Wrexham supporters celebrated wildly.",
      "The Welsh soccer team's remarkable rise under Hollywood owners Reynolds and Rob McElhenney has hit a new high \u2014 returning to the second tier for the first time since the 1981-82 campaign.",
      "It means that from next season it will be playing one level below the Premier League, something that was unthinkable just four years ago when it was a struggling non-league team.",
      "Reynolds and McElhenney were part of a full house of nearly 13,000 fans.",
      "\u201cThe stadium and atmosphere is incredible, it\u2019s a massive club and a big project, it will be a special week now,\u201d said striker Sam Smith, who scored two goals in the win.",
      "Who knows what's next for a team that has defied the odds since the actors bought it for $2.5 million in 2021 and turned it into a household name around the world.",
      "\u201cThe owners have come in and done an amazing job. I\u2019m so pleased for them because they deserve it,\u201d manager Phil Parkinson said. \u201cThey\u2019re invested in all the decisions, but they trust us in in our decision making and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had success over the last three years.\u201d",
      "While celebrations greeted the final whistle, the party began much earlier after promotion rival Wycombe lost to Leyton Orient 1-0.",
      "Wrexham just needed victory then to clinch the second promotion place in League One.",
      "Reynolds posed for selfies with fans outside and served drinks behind the bar in a marquee set up outside the nearby Turf pub, which has earned world renown from the docuseries \u201cWelcome to Wrexham.\u201d",

      "Wrexham just needed to finish the job off against fourth-placed Charlton and eased nerves with two goals in the space of three minutes in the first half. Oliver Rathbone\u2019s long shot in the 15th minute was followed by Smith\u2019s volley.",
      "When Smith headed in a third in the 81st the outcome was in no doubt and Wrexham's fans serenaded the players with chants of \u201cWe are going up.\u201d",

      "Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D",
      "WASHINGTON -- Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D.C., amid a shift in priorities and the ousting of leadership at one of the nation\u2019s premier cultural institutions.",
      "Multiple artists and producers involved in the center\u2019s Tapestry of Pride schedule, which had been planned for June 5 to 8, told The Associated Press that their events had been quietly canceled or moved to other venues. And in the wake of the cancellations, Washington\u2019s Capital Pride Alliance has disassociated itself from the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe are a resilient community, and we have found other avenues to celebrate,\u201d said June Crenshaw, deputy director of the alliance. \u201cWe are finding another path to the celebration \u2026 but the fact that we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.\u201d",
      "The Kennedy Center\u2019s website still lists Tapestry of Pride on its website with a general description and a link to the World Pride site. There are no other details.",
      "The Kennedy Center did not respond to a request from the AP for comment.",
      "The move comes on the heels of massive changes at the Kennedy Center, with President Donald Trump firing both the president and chairman in early February. Trump replaced most of the board with loyalists, who then elected him the new Kennedy Center chairman.",
      "The World Pride event, held every two years, starts in just under a month \u2014 running from May 17 through June 8 with performances and celebrations planned across the capital city. But Trump administration policies on transgender rights and comments about Kennedy Center drag performances have sparked concern about what kind of reception attendees will receive.",
      "\u201cI know that D.C. as a community will be very excited to be hosting World Pride, but I know the community is a little bit different than the government,\u201d said Michael Roest, founder and director of the International Pride Orchestra, which had its June 5 performance at the Kennedy Center abruptly canceled within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Roest told the AP he was in the final stages of planning the Kennedy Center performance after months of emails and Zoom calls. He was waiting on a final contract when Trump posted on social media Feb. 7 of the leadership changes and his intention to transform the Kennedy Center\u2019s programming.",
      "Immediately the Kennedy Center became nonresponsive, Roest said. On Feb. 12, he said, he received a one-sentence email from a Kennedy Center staffer stating, \u201cWe are no longer able to advance your contract at this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey went from very eager to host to nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not since heard a word from anybody at the Kennedy Center, but that\u2019s not going to stop us.\u201d",
      "In the wake of the cancellation, Roest said he managed to move the International Pride Orchestra performance to the Strathmore theater in nearby Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Crenshaw said some other events, including a drag story time and a display of parts of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, would be moved to the World Pride welcome center in Chinatown.",
      "Monica Alford, a veteran event planner with a long history of working with the Kennedy Center, was scheduled to organize an event June 8 as part of Tapestry of Pride, but said she also saw communication abruptly end within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Alford organized the first ever drag brunch on the Kennedy Center rooftop in 2024, and said she regarded the institution \u2014 and its recent expansion known as The Reach \u2014 as \u201cmy home base\u201d and \u201ca safe space for the queer community\u201d",
      "She said she was still finalizing the details of her event, which she described as \u201cmeant to be family-friendly, just like the drag brunch was family-friendly and classy and sophisticated.\u201d",
      "She said she mourns the loss of the partnership she nurtured with the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing our community a disservice \u2014 not just the queer community but the entire community,\u201d she said.",
      "Roest said he never received an explanation as to why the performance was canceled so late in the planning stages. He said his orchestra would no longer consider performing at the Kennedy Center, and he believes most queer artists would make the same choice.",
      "\u201cThere would need to be a very, very public statement of inclusivity from the administration, from that board, for us to consider that,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise it is a hostile performance space.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- More U.S. women died around the time of childbirth last year, reversing two years of decline, according to provisional data posted Wednesday.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 688 people died last year during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. That\u2019s up from 669 deaths in 2023, but down from 2022 and 2021, when it was the highest level in more than 50 years.",
      "The maternal mortality rate rose to 19 deaths per 100,000 live births, up from 18.6 the year before.",
      "The CDC counts women who die while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth from conditions related to pregnancy. Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes.",
      "Such deaths spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the coronavirus was particularly dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",
      "The waning of COVID-19 is considered a major reason for the declines in maternal deaths in 2022 and 2023, experts say.",
      "But those improvements are now being offset by other factors that may reduce access to medical care, experts say. They say the list includes the closure of rural hospitals and the U.S. Supreme Court decision that did away with the federally established right to abortion, which caused some doctors to feel constrained about providing care during pregnancy-related medical emergencies.",
      "The U.S. has one of the highest maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations. Past research has found wide racial disparities in such deaths, with Black women dying at a far higher rate than white women.",

    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to change the language in the state's abortion laws in an effort to clarify when doctors are allowed to perform an abortion during a medical emergency",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The Texas Senate approved changes Tuesday to the state\u2019s strict abortion ban that both Republicans and Democrats say would clarify medical exceptions and has drawn support from women who were told they could not end their pregnancies despite life-threatening complications.",
      "The unanimous passage of the bill in the GOP-controlled Senate \u2014 by a 31-0 vote \u2014 marked a rare moment of bipartisanship on an issue that for years has roiled the state Capitol as Texas Republicans have defended one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans and launched criminal investigations into alleged violations.",
      "Under Senate-passed changes, Texas' ban would specify that doctors are allowed to perform an abortion if a patient is experiencing a \u201clife-threatening\u201d condition capable of causing death, and \"not necessarily one actively injuring the patient.\u201d The bill would also require doctors to receive training on the revised law.",
      "If approved by the state House and signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, the revisions would mark the first time Texas lawmakers have modified language in the near-total abortion ban since it took effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe know there are cases where moms who should have been treated were denied treatment,\u201d Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes said on the floor of the chamber before the vote, urging lawmakers to adopt changes that make the law \"crystal clear.\u201d",
      "Texas' ban would still have no exception in cases of rape or incest and the law would not spell out specific medical exceptions, which Senate Democrats noted even as they said they would support it and predicted it would save lives.",
      "\u201cI will vote for it, but this policy is no less cruel for being made clear,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt said.",
      "Republican lawmakers in Kentucky passed a similar bill in March that added specific medical exceptions to the state's ban, which also prohibits all abortions except in medical emergencies. Last year, South Dakota released an instructional video for doctors to clarify the state's abortion restrictions.",
      "The Texas bill comes following years of the state's abortion ban successfully navigating court challenges and scrutiny from doctors and abortion rights advocates. The advocates say the state's laws are too vague when defining what is considered a \u201clife-threatening condition.\u201d",
      "Hughes, who is one of the architects of the state's stringent abortion ban, said he introduced the bill to \u201cremove any doubt\u201d that doctors can perform an abortion when the mother's life is at risk.",
      "Texas law currently prohibits all abortions, including in cases of rape or incest, except in instances to save the life of the mother. Physicians can face up to 99 years in prison and be fined up to $100,000 if they perform an illegal abortion.",
      "Several women challenged existing medical exceptions under Texas law as too narrow. They called the new legislation a small step in the right direction and would allow doctors to act more urgently. Kaitlyn Kash, who was denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications, said at a news conference this month that she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the bill.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court in 2024 said that the state's abortion laws were not too vague, ruling against several women who were denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications. The Texas Medical Board also declined to list specific medical exceptions allowed under the law.",
      "In March, Texas filed criminal charges against a Houston midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions, and the state is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida is poised to ban fluoride in public drinking water, over the concerns of dentists and public health advocates who say the mineral is a safe, effective way to protect people of all ages from developing cavities.",
      "Florida lawmakers gave final approval to the bill Tuesday. The measure now goes to the desk of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose administration has advocated against the fluoridation of community water systems, arguing high levels could pose a risk to children\u2019s intellectual development.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water is considered among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "\u201cAs dentists, we see the direct consequences fluoride removal has on our patients and it\u2019s a real tragedy when policymakers\u2019 decisions hurt vulnerable kids and adults in the long term,\u201d Brett Kessler, president of the American Dental Association, said in a statement earlier this month. \u201cBlindly calling for a ban on fluoridated water hurts people, costs money, and will ultimately harm our economy.\u201d",
      "While Florida's bill doesn't specifically reference fluoride, it will require the mineral and some other additives be removed from water sources across the state, said bill sponsor Republican state Rep. Kaylee Tuck.",
      "\u201cAnything that relates to water quality, removing contaminants, things like that, we're not touching that,\" Tuck said. \"It's anything that has to do with health. So fluoride, vitamins, whatever else it is.\u201d",
      "Utah became the first state to pass a ban last month, approving legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.",
      "Fluoride has come under increased scrutiny under the influence of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is setting the gears of government in motion to stop fluoridating water.",
      "Some local officials in Florida have already voted to remove the mineral from their community water systems, ahead of state lawmakers' push to ban fluoride.",
      "Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Tuesday she is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the passage of the bill, adding that it disregards \u201cthe overwhelming consensus of dentists, doctors and medical experts and will end a practice that has been in place for decades to protect our health.\u201d",
      "Levine Cava said that ending fluoridation, which is a safe and cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay, will have \u201clong-lasting health consequences, especially for our most vulnerable families.\u201d",
      "The mayor said the decision should be left to local communities.",
      "About one-third of community water systems, serving more than 60% of the U.S. population, fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 analysis by the CDC.",

      "Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska overwhelmingly approved paid sick leave laws last year",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska were asked last year whether they wanted to require employers to provide paid sick leave to their workers. They overwhelmingly said yes.",
      "Now some lawmakers in each of those states are trying to roll back the benefits, citing concerns from businesses about costs.",
      "The efforts mark the latest attempt by legislators to alter laws backed by the voters they represent. In February, for example, Michigan enacted revisions to a paid sick leave law initiated by voters seven years ago, delaying the date when small businesses must comply and allowing a longer period before new employees are eligible.",
      "Though some voters are outraged, some lawmakers contend that citizen activists who crafted the initiatives overlooked the realities of running a business.",
      "Restaurant owner Tim Hart, who employs about two dozen workers at his steakhouse in Hannibal, Missouri, said the paid sick leave requirement imposes a double financial hit because he must pay one person to stay home and another to fill the shift.",
      "\u201cWhen this goes into effect, we very likely won\u2019t survive,\u201d said Hart, who has urged the state Senate to halt the law.",
      "The paid sick leave laws are set to kick in Thursday in Missouri, July 1 in Alaska and Oct. 1 in Nebraska.",
      "McDonald's restaurant worker Richard Eiker is among those who stand to benefit. He signed a petition putting the initiative on the Missouri ballot and traveled recently from Kansas City to the state Capitol to lobby lawmakers to let the law stand.",
      "In 40 years on the job, Eiker has never received paid sick leave \u2014 not even when he was struggling with a kidney stone.",
      "\u201cI just took some pain medication and just went into work anyway and just worked past the pain,\u201d Eiker said. \u201cIt would have been nice to have stayed home.\u201d",
      "Federal law requires many employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for personal or family medical issues. But there is no federal mandate to pay for sick days.",
      "Nonetheless, 79% of private-sector employees received paid sick leave last year, according to the Department of Labor. Part-time workers were significantly less likely to receive the benefit than their full-time counterparts. And just 58% of employees in the bottom quarter of income earners received paid sick leave, compared with 94% in the top quartile.",
      "Though still discretionary for many employers, the number of states mandating paid sick leave has grown significantly since Connecticut enacted the first such law in 2012. Last year's ballot measures raised the total to 18 states and the District of Columbia. Three additional states require paid leave for any reason, without specifying sickness.",
      "Many paid sick leave laws, including the ones in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska, apply to any employer with at least one worker. But some states exempt the smallest businesses, with cutoffs ranging from five to 25 employees. The number of annual paid sick days also varies.",
      "On Tuesday the state Supreme Court upheld Missouri's paid sick leave law against a challenge from business groups. But efforts to revise it continue.",
      "In March, Republican House members passed legislation to repeal the paid sick leave requirement. That was then blocked by minority-party Democrats in the Senate. So Republicans are pushing an alternative that would delay the law until later this year, exempt smaller businesses and take away workers' ability to sue over alleged violations.",
      "The intent is to \u201cjust make it a little less onerous on employers,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a small business owner who is backing the bill.",
      "But many workers already have it tough, Democratic lawmakers said.",
      "\u201cWhen there\u2019s people living paycheck to paycheck, just missing a little bit of work can really put them behind,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Patty Lewis said.",
      "Legislation pushed by Republican lawmakers in Nebraska state would carve out exceptions from paid sick leave for 14- and-15-year-old employees, temporary and seasonal agricultural workers and businesses with 10 or fewer employees.",
      "The legislation also would strip workers of the ability to sue employers who retaliate against them for using paid sick leave.",
      "Supporters of the revisions say they aim to protect small businesses from higher costs. Opponents say they are essentially gutting the law.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about just whole swaths of the ballot language being stricken by this,\u201d state Sen. John Cavanaugh said during recent debate. \u201cThat is a huge overstep by this Legislature to say that we know better than the people who voted for this.\u201d",
      "A bill by state Rep. Justin Ruffridge would exempt seasonal workers and businesses with fewer than 50 employees from the sick leave requirement. That could exclude many catering to Alaska's summer tourists.",
      "Ruffridge, a member of the House\u2019s Republican minority, said small business owners should be able to choose whether to spend money on sick leave benefits or other measures to grow their businesses.",
      "Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska AFL-CIO, which supported the ballot measure, doubts Ruffridge\u2019s bill will gain traction in the final weeks of this year's session.",
      "But, she said, \u201cI believe this is the beginning of a long battle to protect the voters\u2019 wishes from the wills and the whims of the businesspeople who don\u2019t want to pay sick days.\u201d",

      "Other U.S. communities \u2014 often near military bases or industrial sites \u2014 did the same when test results were frightening and public pressure, local leadership or state law forced PFAS-laden wells offline or prompted installation of expensive filtering systems, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "The EPA said the PFAS found in North Carolina, often called GenX chemicals, can be toxic to the kidney. While other types of PFAS may raise kidney cancer risk, little research has focused on the link between kidney cancer and GenX, according to Sue Fenton, director of the Center for Human Health and the Environment at North Carolina State University. Chemours said evidence doesn't support arguments that GenX at low levels is a health threat. The company has sharply reduced PFAS discharges.",
      "So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the recently set EPA limits, but most aren't above by much. Forcing this group to reduce PFAS more than doubles the rule\u2019s health benefits but roughly triples its costs, the EPA has said.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s rule set standards for two common types of PFAS at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. Standards for several other PFAS chemicals were set, too, and utilities must meet those levels by 2029.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -\u2013 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has championed fossil fuels and the rollback of major clean air and water rules. His history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals in drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that touches people in a very tangible way across the political spectrum, including in Lee Zeldin\u2019s former district,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Zeldin has offered clues about what the EPA could do. The agency estimated the rule would cost about $1.5 billion annually and Zeldin said recently that communities struggling to afford a fix for PFAS that are just above the standard might be handled differently than wealthy places with lots of it.",
      "\u201cWhat we are going to have to be is extremely thoughtful in figuring this out,\u201d he said.",
      "On Monday, the EPA said it will establish an agency lead for PFAS, develop wastewater limits for PFAS manufacturers and investigate sources that pose an immediate danger to drinking water, among other actions.",
      "Soon, the EPA must tell a federal appeals court in Washington whether the rule should stand or be rewritten, although weakening it could be complicated because the Safe Drinking Water Act prevents new rules from being looser than previous ones. The agency could, however, encourage exemptions and deadline extensions, according to Erik Olson, an attorney with the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council supporting the current standards in the court case.",
      "Consider Avondale, Arizona, outside of Phoenix, which produces PFAS results modestly above the limits. Officials have done detailed testing and are planning to enhance water treatment. All told, lowering PFAS may cost Avondale more than $120 million, according to Kirk Beaty, the city\u2019s public utility director.",
      "That\u2019s money a city like Avondale \u201cjust doesn\u2019t have sitting in a back room somewhere,\" Beaty said, adding he\u2019ll defer to federal experts to dictate what\u2019s acceptable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we\u2019re a little further ahead of everybody else. If the regulation changes, well you know, we may let off the gas a little bit, we may not,\u201d he said, adding that it is hard to justify spending extra money to do more than what\u2019s required when the cost falls on residents.",
      "If the government decides higher amounts of PFAS are acceptable, that could confuse people, especially in areas where the public is already concerned.",
      "\u201cIf we enter into a gray area over what\u2019s healthy and what\u2019s not healthy, then utilities are at risk of being caught up in a debate for which they have no real responsibility nor expertise to decide on,\u201d said Karine Roug\u00e9, CEO for municipal water at Veolia North America, a water operations company.",
      "The American Water Works Association, an industry group, filed the court challenge to the new rule. It agrees that certain PFAS should be regulated but argues the EPA\u2019s standards go too far, underestimate costs and are \u201cneither feasible nor cost-effective.\u201d There are serious consequences for residents' water bills, it says.",
      "The burden of complying will fall heavily on small utilities that can least afford it. Many water providers already struggle to maintain their existing infrastructure, some experts say. On top of everything else, they face new requirements to replace lead pipes. The AWWA wants the EPA to extend the PFAS and lead deadlines by two years.",
      "There is money available to help. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that help as well.",
      "Meek, who successfully recovered after surgery from cancer and is now 59, is planning to sue over his illness. He once didn\u2019t second-guess using tap water. Now he reaches for bottled water.",
      "Donovan, who introduced Meek to PFAS and helped start Clean Cape Fear, says if the government\u2019s standards are weakened, it\u2019ll relieve pressure on utilities to effectively treat the water.",
      "Previously, \u201cour local utilities could tell us publicly that the water met or exceeded all state and federal guidelines because there weren\u2019t any,\u201d she said.",

      "A woman pleaded not guilty Monday to fatally stabbing a Kansas City, Missouri, paramedic as she was being taken to a hospital in an ambulance.",
      "Shanetta Bossell, 39, was arrested Sunday after trying to drive off in the ambulance as others were tending to paramedic Graham Hoffman's chest wound, according to court records. She has been jailed on $1 million bond on charges of first-degree murder, armed criminal action, assault and resisting arrest. No attorney is listed for her in online court records.",
      "The 29-year-old paramedic had worked for the Kansas City Fire Department for three years and was remembered for his commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cOur community grieves his loss at such a young age with his entire life ahead of him,\u201d Clay County prosecuting attorney Zachary Thompson said at a news conference Sunday night.",
      "Police spotted Bossell walking along the shoulder of a highway early Sunday, her finger cut and bleeding, according to the probable cause affidavit. She had been freed on bond just two days earlier in a resisting arrest case that Thompson said involved an assault on a law enforcement officer.",
      "While en route to the hospital, the driver heard Hoffman frantically call for help, saying Bossell had a knife. The driver stopped and then rushed to the back. As he flung open the door, he heard Hoffman say, \"She stabbed me in the heart,\u201d the affidavit said.",
      "An officer who was following the ambulance then witnessed Bossell get into the vehicle's cab and attempt to put it into drive, according to the affidavit. The officer ultimately was able to wrestle her to the ground. But during the fray, she bit his arm, and he hit her in the head with his firearm to get her to let go, the affidavit said.",
      "A second ambulance arrived and the crew rushed Hoffman to the hospital, where he died later that afternoon.",
      "Thompson said any conviction on the murder charge could draw a life sentence without possibility of parole \u2014 or even a death sentence. But he did not elaborate on prosecution plans and said police continue to investigate what he described as a \u201chorrific\u201d crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet me be perfectly clear,\" he said. \"Our office will use all legal, moral, and ethical tools at our disposal to ensure justice for Graham, his family and the entire community.\u201d",

      "The Vietnam War ended 50 years ago but the disaster unleashed by American use of Agent Orange continues unabated",
      "DA NANG, Vietnam -- The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975, when the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon fell to Communist forces. But millions of people still face daily battles with its chemical legacy.",
      "Nguyen Thanh Hai, 34, is one of millions with disabilities linked to Agent Orange. Born with severe developmental challenges, it's a struggle for him to complete tasks others take for granted: buttoning the blue shirt he wears to a special school in Da Nang, practicing the alphabet, drawing shapes or forming simple sentences.",
      "Hai grew up in Da Nang, the site of a U.S. air base where departing troops left behind huge amounts of Agent Orange that have lingered for decades, leeching into food and water supplies in areas like Hai's village and affecting generations of residents.",
      "Across Vietnam, U.S. forces sprayed sprayed 72 million liters (19 million gallons) of defoliants during the war to strip the enemy's cover. More than half was Agent Orange, a blend of herbicides.",
      "Agent Orange was laced with dioxin, a type of chemical linked to cancer, birth defects and lasting environmental damage. Today, 3 million people, including many children, still suffer serious health issues associated with exposure to it.",
      "Vietnam has spent decades cleaning up the toxic legacy of the war, in part funded by belated U.S. assistance, but the work is far from complete. Now, millions in Vietnam are worried that the U.S. may abandon Agent Orange cleanup as President Donald Trump slashes foreign aid.",
      "When the war ended, the U.S. turned its back on Vietnam, eager to turn the page on a painful chapter in its history.",
      "But Vietnam was left with dozens of dioxin hotspots spread across 58 of its 63 provinces.",
      "Vietnam says the health impacts last generations, threatening the children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren of people exposed to the chemicals with health complications ranging from cancer to birth defects that affects the spine and nervous system.",
      "But the science about the human health impact \u2014 both to those exposed to Agent Orange and the generations that follow \u2014 remains unsettled. This is partly because when the two countries finally started working together in 2006, they focused on finding dioxin in the environment and clearing it instead of studying the still-contentious topic of its impact on human health, said Charles Bailey, co-author of the book \u201cFrom Enemies to Partners: Vietnam, the U.S. and Agent Orange.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe science of causality is still incomplete,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "Vietnam identifies Agent Orange victims by checking family history, where they lived, and a list of health problems linked to the poison. And Hai's disabilities were very likely linked to the spraying of the defoliant, added Bailey.",
      "The 34-year-old dreams of becoming a soldier like his grandfather, was unable to leave home for years, waiting alone while his family went out to work. It was only five years ago that he began attending a special school. \u201cI am happy here because I have many friends,\u201d he said. Other students at the school hope to become tailors or makers of incense sticks.",
      "The contamination also denuded Vietnam\u2019s natural defenses. Nearly half of its mangrove trees, which shield shores from strong storms, were destroyed. Much of its tropical forest was irrevocably damaged, while the herbicide also leached the soil of nutrients in some of Vietnam\u2019s most climate-vulnerable areas.",
      "In the decades after the war ended, the recovering country fenced off heavily contaminated sites like Da Nang airport and began providing support to impacted families.",
      "But the U.S. largely ignored growing evidence of health impacts \u2014 including on its own veterans \u2014 until the mid-2000s, when it and began funding cleanup in Vietnam. In 1991, the U.S. recognized that certain diseases could be related to exposure to Agent Orange and made veterans who had them eligible for benefits.",
      "Since 1991, it has spent over $155 million to aid people with disabilities in areas affected by Agent Orange or littered by unexploded bombs, according to the U.S. State Department. The two countries have also cooperated to recover war dead, with the U.S. aiding Vietnam\u2019s search for its own missing.",
      "Cleaning up Agent Orange is expensive and often dangerous. Heavily polluted soil needs to be unearthed and heated in large ovens to very high temperatures, while less contaminated soil can be buried in secure landfills.",
      "Despite years of work, large sites still need to cleared. In Da Nang, where an air base was contaminated during storage and transportation of Agent Orange, the U.S. completed a $110 million cleanup in 2018 but an area the size of 10 soccer fields still remains heavily contaminated.",
      "Cooperation on war legacy issues also laid a foundation for growing U.S.-Vietnam ties, culminating in 2023 when Vietnam elevated the U.S. to its highest diplomatic status of comprehensive strategic partner.",
      "\u201cThe United States considers Vietnam a key partner in advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in Vietnam in 2023.",
      "But Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to USAID stalled key projects in Vietnam, and while many have resumed, doubts remain about U.S. reliability.",
      "Vietnam now has to negotiate a new reality where the U.S. president says the country can no longer afford to help other countries.",
      "The country can\u2019t handle the toxic chemicals that still persist without help, said Nguyen Van An, the chairman of Association for Victims of Agent Orange in Danang. \u201cWe always believe that the U.S. government and the manufacturers of this toxic chemical must have the responsibility to support the victims,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he hoped that any stoppages to ongoing projects due to shifting politics in Washington would be temporary.",
      "Insufficient data means that experts can't definitely say when the risk to human health will end. But the more urgent problem is if that cleanup efforts are interrupted, the now-exposed contaminated soil could get into waterways and harm more people.",
      "A 10-year project to clear the some 500,000 cubic meters (650,000 cubic yards) of dioxin-contaminated soil \u2014 enough to fill 40,000 trucks \u2014 at Bien Hoa airbase was launched in 2020. It stopped for a week in March and then restarted.",
      "But Bailey, who worked on issues related to the Agent Orange in Vietnam for years, said future USAID funding for the cleanup and a $30 million program for people with disabilities was uncertain.",
      "With federal cuts to USAID, most staffers in Vietnam are expected to be gone by later this year, leaving nobody to administer funding for remediation programs, even if it is not cut itself.",
      "\u201cThis basically leaves a very large mountain of contaminated soil. Only 30% of which has been dealt with and that is less contaminated,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "He added that less than half of the soil at Bien Hoa had been treated and much of the remaining soil was heavily contaminated and needed to be treated in an as-yet unbuilt incinerator.",
      "Tim Rieser, who was retired Sen. Patrick Leahy\u2019s foreign policy aide when the Vermont Democrat secured the original funding for Vietnam War remediation projects and is now a senior advisor to Sen. Peter Welch, said Congress still supports the programs but it would be hard for them to continue without staff.",
      "\"For more than 30 years, the U.S. and Vietnam have worked together to rebuild relations by dealing with the worst legacies of the war, like Agent Orange,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the Trump administration is mindlessly shutting everything down, with no concern for the impact of their actions on relations with an important partner in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d",
      "The U.S. embassy in Hanoi didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Chuck Searcy, an American Vietnam War veteran who has worked on humanitarian programs in the country since 1995, said he worries that trust built over years could erode very rapidly. He pointed out that those who benefit from U.S. funded projects to address war legacies are \u201cinnocent victims.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been victimized twice, once by the war and the consequences that they\u2019ve suffered. And now by having the rug pulled out from under them,\u201d he said.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- The left arm of Christian Camilo Amaya is tattooed with a skull pierced by a syringe, which he says represents the use of cocaine and heroin. He frequently shot up on streets of Bogota, but he has recently switched to South America's only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses.",
      "Non-profit organization Accion Tecnica Social runs the supervised room named Cambie (or Change in English) in Colombia's capital. Since it opened in June 2023, 14 users had their overdoses treated with injections of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses. The last such case was a year ago.",
      "Amaya often carries a black plastic bag with more than a dozen used syringes, which he puts in a red container for biological waste, as protocols for using the room dictate. He denies being addicted to heroin, but argues the supervised room gives him syringes and training on hygienic injections and overdose prevention.",
      "\u201cI know what substances do to me, so I know I shouldn\u2019t be a frequent user for that very reason, to avoid becoming addicted,\u201d Amaya told The Associated Press in the unmarked drug use room in one of the city\u2019s impoverished neighborhoods.",
      "The initiative is one of the topics of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which started Sunday in Bogota. It is the first time the conference has been held in Latin America in the past three decades, as the leftist administration of President Gustavo Petro pushes for a revision in the international drug control system of the United Nations.",
      "The supervised consumption room currently has 87 registered users, 26% of whom are Venezuelan migrants, who come to inject themselves or receive syringes, food, guidance on lower-risk injection techniques, or overdose management.",
      "Of the users who come to the room, 91% use heroin, 7% inject cocaine, and less than 2% use speedballs, a mixture of cocaine and heroin. Official data on heroin use in Colombia is scarce.",
      "The project was born in 2022 when organizers started contacting users directly to identify their needs. It received technical advice from other countries, especially Mexico.",
      "For David Moreno, who works at Cambie, the most difficult part of reversing an overdose is not injecting the naloxone but avoiding a follow-up overdose.",
      "\u201cOnce I had a user who would get very violent when she came back from an overdose. She would start hurting herself, then she would take off my jacket and tie it, and I\u2019d have to restrain her,\u201d said Moreno.",
      "\u201cWhen it happens, I am calm. But when the user leaves... Wow, my adrenaline rushes.\u201d",
      "Sam Rivera, the executive-director of OnPoint, a nonprofit organization in New York City that operates supervised injection centers, toured the small, nearly 65-foot room with three patient cubicles before AP's visit.",

When you hear about it, it sounds dangerous or it sounds bad because it sounds like you\u2019re enabling people to use,\" he added. \u201cThese are people who are going to use.

      "U.S. health officials are pushing to get artificial colors out of the nation's food supply",
      "ST. LOUIS -- As pressure grows to get artificial colors out of the U.S. food supply, the shift may well start at Abby Tampow\u2019s laboratory desk.",
      "On an April afternoon, the scientist hovered over tiny dishes of red dye, each a slightly different ruby hue. Her task? To match the synthetic shade used for years in a commercial bottled raspberry vinaigrette \u2014 but by using only natural ingredients.",
      "\u201cWith this red, it needs a little more orange,\u201d Tampow said, mixing a slurry of purplish black carrot juice with a bit of beta-carotene, an orange-red color made from algae.",
      "Tampow is part of the team at Sensient Technologies Corp., one of the world\u2019s largest dyemakers, that is rushing to help the salad dressing manufacturer \u2014 along with thousands of other American businesses \u2014 meet demands to overhaul colors used to brighten products from cereals to sports drinks.",
      "\u201cMost of our customers have decided that this is finally the time when they\u2019re going to make that switch to a natural color,\u201d said Dave Gebhardt, Sensient\u2019s senior technical director. He joined a recent tour of the Sensient Colors factory in a north St. Louis neighborhood.",
      "Last week, U.S. health officials announced plans to persuade food companies to voluntarily eliminate petroleum-based artificial dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called them \u201cpoisonous compounds\u201d that endanger children\u2019s health and development, citing limited evidence of potential health risks.",
      "The federal push follows a flurry of state laws and a January decision to ban the artificial dye known as Red 3 \u2014 found in cakes, candies and some medications \u2014 because of cancer risks in lab animals. Social media influencers and ordinary consumers have ramped up calls for artificial colors to be removed from foods.",
      "The FDA allows about three dozen color additives, including eight remaining synthetic dyes. But making the change from the petroleum-based dyes to colors derived from vegetables, fruits, flowers and even insects won\u2019t be easy, fast or cheap, said Monica Giusti, an Ohio State University food color expert.",
      "\u201cStudy after study has shown that if all companies were to remove synthetic colors from their formulations, the supply of the natural alternatives would not be enough,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cWe are not really ready.\u201d",
      "It can take six months to a year to convert a single product from a synthetic dye to a natural one. And it could require three to four years to build up the supply of botanical products necessary for an industrywide shift, Sensient officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s 150 million pounds of beet juice sitting around waiting on the off chance the whole market may convert,\u201d said Paul Manning, the company's chief executive. \u201cTens of millions of pounds of these products need to be grown, pulled out of the ground, extracted.\u201d",
      "To make natural dyes, Sensient works with farmers and producers around the world to harvest the raw materials, which typically arrive at the plant as bulk concentrates. They\u2019re processed and blended into liquids, granules or powders and then sent to food companies to be added to final products.",
      "Natural dyes are harder to make and use than artificial colors. They are less consistent in color, less stable and subject to changes related to acidity, heat and light, Manning said. Blue is especially difficult. There aren't many natural sources of the color and those that exist can be hard to maintain during processing.",
      "Also, a natural color costs about 10 times more to make than the synthetic version, Manning estimated.",
      "\u201cHow do you get that same vividness, that same performance, that same level of safety in that product as you would in a synthetic product?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complexity associated with that.\u201d",
      "Companies have long used the Red 3 synthetic dye to create what Sensient officials describe as \u201cthe Barbie pink.\u201d",
      "To create that color with a natural source might require the use of cochineal, an insect about the size of a peppercorn.",
      "The female insects release a vibrant red pigment, carminic acid, in their bodies and eggs. The bugs live only on prickly pear cactuses in Peru and elsewhere. About 70,000 cochineal insects are needed to produce 1 kilogram, about 2.2 pounds, of dye.",
      "\u201cIt's interesting how the most exotic colors are found in the most exotic places,\u201d said Norb Norbrega, who travels the world scouting new hues for Sensient.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. About 1 in 5 food products in the U.S. contains added colors, whether natural or synthetic, Manning estimated. Many contain multiple colors.",
      "FDA requires a sample of each batch of synthetic colors to be submitted for testing and certification. Color additives derived from plant, animal or mineral sources are exempt, but have been evaluated by the agency.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that the approved dyes are safe when used according to regulations and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "But critics note that added colors are a key component of ultraprocessed foods, which account for more than 70% of the U.S. diet and have been associated with a host of chronic health problems, including heart disease, diabetes and obesity.",
      "\u201cI am all for getting artificial food dyes out of the food supply,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert. \u201cThey are strictly cosmetic, have no health or safety purpose, are markers of ultraprocessed foods and may be harmful to some children.\u201d",
      "Color is powerful driver of consumer behavior and changes can backfire, Giusti noted. In 2016, food giant General Mills removed artificial dyes from Trix cereal after requests from consumers, switching to natural sources including turmeric, strawberries and radishes.",
      "But the cereal lost its neon colors, resulting in more muted hues \u2014 and a consumer backlash. Trix fans said they missed the bright colors and familiar taste of the cereal. In 2017, the company switched back.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s a product you already love, that you\u2019re used to consuming, and it changes slightly, then it may not really be the same experience,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cAnnouncing a regulatory change is one step, but then the implementation is another thing.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, the health secretary, said U.S. officials have an \u201cunderstanding\u201d with food companies to phase out artificial colors. Industry officials told The Associated Press that there is no formal agreement.",
      "However, several companies have said they plan to accelerate a shift to natural colors in some of their products.",
      "PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said most of its products are already free of artificial colors, and that its Lays and Tostitos brands will phase them out by the end of this year. He said the company plans to phase out artificial colors \u2014 or at least offer consumers a natural alternative \u2014 over the next few years.",
      "Representatives for General Mills said they\u2019re \u201ccommitted to continuing the conversation\u201d with the administration. WK Kellogg officials said they are reformulating cereals used in the nation\u2019s school lunch programs to eliminate the artificial dyes and will halt any new products containing them starting next January.",
      "Sensient officials wouldn\u2019t confirm which companies are seeking help making the switch, but they said they\u2019re ready for the surge.",
      "\u201cNow that there\u2019s a date, there\u2019s the timeline,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt certainly requires action.\u201d",

      "The European Court of Human Rights says that Serbia must prevent any potential use of sound devices for crowd control following reports that a sonic weapon was directed at peaceful demonstrators during a huge anti-government rally on March 15",
      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- The European Court of Human Rights said on Wednesday that Serbia \"should prevent the use of sonic weapons or similar devices\" for crowd control following claims that a sound cannon was directed at protesters during a huge anti-government rally on March 15.",
      "The court in Strasbourg, France, said its interim measure did not mean it had taken \"any position as to whether use of such weapons had occurred\u201d at the demonstration that was part of months-long anti-corruption protests in the Balkan country.",
      "Serbian authorities have repeatedly have denied claims by opposition parties and several experts that a sonic weapon broke a commemorative silence during the March protest causing people to suddenly run in panic while experiencing an array of symptoms and huge discomfort.",
      "The authorities initially said Serbian security agencies did not possess any sonic devices but later admitted they do own several.",
      "The European court said 47 Serbian nationals had filed complaints over the incident while up to 4,000 people reported their experiences in the application collected by a group of Serbian civil society groups. The court rejected requests to investigate the incident or prevent legal proceedings against people who publicly alleged some kind of a device was used.",
      "\u201cAllegedly, the applicants experienced intense instinctive fear, panic, shock, accelerated heartbeat, trembling, hearing problems, vomiting, nausea, tachycardia, and similar symptoms,\u201d a court statement said. \u201cSome allegedly sustained physical injuries due to the panic.\u201d",
      "Footage from the rally show people standing peacefully before a sudden panic erupts and a brief stampede. An Associated Press photographer at the scene said people started scrambling for cover, leaving the middle of the downtown street almost empty as they started falling over each other.",
      "\u201cThe State should prevent the use of sonic weapons or similar devices at future protests by the State and/or non-state actors,\u201d the ECHR said. \u201cAny use of sound devices for crowd control (other than for communication purposes) must be prevented in the future.\u201d",
      "The court \u201cnoted that use of such weapons for crowd control was unlawful in Serbia and, in particular, potentially serious health effects that could be caused to a large number of persons.\u201d",
      "Protests in Serbia started after a train station canopy collapsed in the northern city of Novi Sad, killing 16 people. Many in Serbia blamed the tragedy on alleged rampant government corruption that fueled disrespect of safety regulations and negligence during the station building renovation.",
      "The protests have developed into a nationwide movement demanding justice for the victims and the rule of law in Serbia, a Balkan nation that is seeking European Union membership but whose populist President Aleksandar Vucic has been accused of stifling democratic freedoms while boosting ties with Russia and China.",

      "As the couple paused for a snack in its lush Pahalgam meadow surrounded by snow-capped Himalayan peaks, a man approached them from behind. He didn't look threatening at first, Aishanya told The Associated Press. She thought he might be a local guide.",
      "She said the man looked at the couple with piercing eyes and asked one question: \u201cAre you a Hindu or a Muslim?\u201d If they were Muslim, he said, they should recite the Islamic declaration of faith.",
      "The couple froze. Aishanya thought it was perhaps some local performance. \u201cWe are Hindus,\" her husband said.",

      "Authorities with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government have shared few details of last week's attack in Kashmir in which gunmen killed 26 people, most of them local Hindu tourists. It was one of the deadliest assaults in years targeting civilians in the restive region claimed by both India and Pakistan.",
      "The AP spoke with survivors for some of the first witness accounts of the killings that were claimed by a previously unknown militant group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance. India has blamed Pakistan for supporting the massacre. Pakistan denies it. Both warn of imminent military action.",
      "Most of the dead were Indians drawn to Kashmir, its beauty often captured in Bollywood films. In 2019, India revoked the region\u2019s semiautonomous status, a decision the government said would help spur development in Kashmir and integrate it more fully. Since then, violence had largely declined.",
      "Survivors said the horror of the attack is unshakable. They also question how authorities allowed it to occur in one of the militarized places on earth, where Indian soldiers are nearly ubiquitous.",

      "North Korea last week unveiled the 5,000-ton destroyer equipped with what it called the most powerful weapons built in its warship industry. During Friday's launching ceremony at the western port of Nampo, Kim called the ship's construction \u201ca breakthrough\u201d in modernizing North Korea's naval forces.",
      "Outsider experts say it's North Korea's first destroyer and that it was likely built with Russian assistance. They say North Korea's naval forces lag behind South Korea's but still view the destroyer as a serious security threat as it could bolster North Korea's attack and defense capabilities.",
      "The official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday that Kim watched the tests of the destroyer's supersonic and strategic cruise missiles, anti-aircraft missile, automatic guns and electronic jamming guns earlier this week.",
      "He appreciated the ship's combination of powerful strike weapons and conventional defenses and set tasks to speed the nuclear-arming of his navy, the report said.",
      "During the ship's launching ceremony, Kim said the destroyer will be deployed early next year. He said the acquisition of a  nuclear-powered submarine would be his next big step in strengthening his navy. He underscored the need to beef up North Korea's deterrence capability to cope with what he called escalating U.S.-led hostilities targeting the North.",
      "An analysis of photos of the warship shows that its anti-air radar system is likely from Russia, said Lee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea. He said the warship's engine system and some of its anti-air weapons systems also likely came from Russia.",
      "North Korea and Russia have been sharply expanding military and other cooperation in recent years, with the North supplying troops and conventional weapons to support Russia's war efforts against Ukraine. The U.S., South Korea and their partners worry Russia will likely in return provide North Korea with high-tech weapons technologies that can enhance its nuclear program as well as shipping other military and economic assistance.",
      "Lee said the deployment of a warship with an advanced radar system off North Korea's west coast could sharply bolster its air defense capabilities for Pyongyang, the capital. Lee said South Korea, which has 12 destroyers, still vastly outpaces North Korea's naval forces. But he said the North Korean destroyer, which can carry about 80 missiles, can still pose a serious threat, as South Korea's navy hasn't likely braced for such an enemy warship.",
      "Animosities on the Korean Peninsula are running high as North Korea continues its weapons testing activities meant to enlarge its nuclear and missile arsenals. On Monday, North Korea confirmed for the first time that it has sent combat troops to Russia to support its war efforts against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked North Korea and promised not to forget the sacrifices of North Korean soldiers for Russia.",

      "The cybersecurity agency said other targets included those involved in aerospace, finance, national government ministries and local governments. It didn't name them.",
      "More than a dozen reports in 2023 and 2024 pointed to an intensifying effort from Russia to undermine France through disinformation campaigns, particularly the Paris Olympics.

      "A global human rights watchdog is urging the United States and other governments to bolster their support for people seeking democratic change in Venezuela",
      "MEXICO CITY -- A global human rights watchdog on Wednesday urged the United States and other governments to bolster their support for people seeking democratic change in Venezuela and to hold President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro accountable for the crackdown on dissent he intensified after the country\u2019s presidential election last year.",
      "Human Rights Watch specifically called on the U.S. to consider imposing additional sanctions on Venezuelan government officials and members of state security forces. HRW also called for sanctions on ruling party-loyal armed groups linked to the widespread rights violations that followed the July 28 vote that Maduro claims to have won despite credible evidence to the contrary.",
      "At the same time, the organization recommended the U.S. rescind an executive order President Donald Trump signed in February imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court over investigations of Israel. The order, according to the watchdog, could affect an ongoing investigation by the court\u2019s prosecutor into possible crimes against humanity committed in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cWhile the Trump administration has not specifically objected to the Court\u2019s engagement with the situation in Venezuela, the sanctions program appears designed in part to chill broader cooperation with the ICC and intimidate Court officials, and will likely affect the rights of victims globally,\u201d Human Rights Watch said in a report published Wednesday.",
      "The report is the latest work from human rights advocates documenting Venezuela\u2019s post-election repression campaign against members of the political opposition, protesters, bystanders and others. Their findings have implicated state security forces and ruling party-loyal armed groups in killings, torture and other abuses across the country during and after demonstrations that followed the election.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner of the July 28 election. But unlike in previous contests, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts to back the announced result.",
      "The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines and posted them online \u2014 showing its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, had won by a more than a 2-1 margin.

      "Medin, a journalist with the daily Dagens ETC, was detained March 27 as he arrived at Istanbul airport to cover last month\u2019s nationwide protests that erupted following the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s popular mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. The journalist was jailed days later on charges of insulting Erdogan and membership of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK.",
      "No trial date has been set for his second trial, where he could face maximum nine years in prison.",
      "Medin, who is being held in Istanbul\u2019s high-security Marmara Prison, joined Wednesday\u2019s hearing in the capital Ankara via a video conference system.",
      "The charges against him were based on an investigation launched by the Ankara Public Prosecutors\u2019 Office into a rally in Stockholm on Jan. 11, 2023, that was attended by supporters of the PKK, and included an effigy of Erdogan hanging by his feet.",
      "According to the Turkish Presidency\u2019s Communications Department, the prosecutors\u2019 office identified 15 suspects, including Medin, who had organized, participated or covered the event. It said Medin also allegedly facilitated communication between the PKK and media outlets.",
      "During the opening hearing, Medin reported multiple violations of his basic rights during the initial stages of his detention, including the right to access to a translator, to a lawyer and consular services, according to the Media and Law Studies Association, or MLSA, which observed the proceeding.",
      "He denied that he was present at the rally.",
      "\u201cThe indictment begins with a protest I did not attend and includes (social media) posts I did not share,\u201d the MLSA cited Medin as telling the court.",
      "\u201cOn Jan. 11, 2023, a small group of activists held a protest in front of the city hall, hanging an effigy of Erdogan upside down,\u201d the journalist continued. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there \u2014 I was working in Germany at the time.

    "story": [
      "Six months after the United States gave a green light to import avocados from Guatemala, the Central American country has yet to send any of the fruit north, but expectations are running high",
      "SAN MIGUEL DUE\u00d1AS, Guatemala -- Standing outside a massive new avocado packing plant recently and with the U.S. ambassador in attendance, Guatemala President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo connected the high-demand fruit with rural development and said the facility signaled a new chapter in the trajectory of the cash crop.",
      "But six months after the United States gave a green light to import avocados from Guatemala, the Central American country has yet to send any of the fruit north. Still, expectations are running high.",
      "For decades, Mexico has been the main source of imported avocados to the U.S. along with small amounts from a few South American nations. Guatemala expects to similarly begin small, but hopes to seize on its proximity and experience exporting to Europe to rapidly expand and meet the increasing U.S. demand.",
      "\u201cRight now there are 17,300 acres (7,000 hectares) planted with the fruit, but in the next 10 years it could reach nearly 75,000 acres (30,000 hectares),\u201d said Francis Bruderer, president of the Guatemala Avocado Producers Association.",
      "When the U.S. announced the import permission last November, Guatemala\u2019s agricultural ministry estimated that the country could initially send 1,700 tons to the U.S., but reach 15,000 tons by 2030. It's unclear how those expectations could be affected by a 10% tariff that U.S President Donald Trump announced this month on dozens of trade partners, including Guatemala.",
      "Standing in his own avocado orchard with the fruit individually bagged on the trees to protect from pests, Bruderer said that more and more avocado trees are being planted each year and now trail only rubber and African palm trees in land coverage.",
      "The new avocado packing facility, complete with its own heliport, sits at the end of a dirt road. When it opens in August it is expected to employ hundreds in Barberena about an 1 \u00bd-hour drive south of the capital and surrounding areas.",
      "It was built by California-based Mission Produce, one of the world\u2019s largest avocado suppliers.",
      "\u201cGuatemala is an emerging power in the international avocado industry, and Mission Produce leads the region\u2019s development for worldwide avocado production,\u201d said Juan Rodolfo Wiesner, Mission Produce\u2019s president for South and Central America.",
      "The company\u2019s executive director, Steve Barnard, said it was a \u201cstrategic investment\u201d to reinforce the company\u2019s position as a world leader in avocados.",
      "At the dedication of the facility last week, Ar\u00e9valo applauded the quality of Guatemala\u2019s avocados and said their production already employed some 6,000 people.",
      "\u201cFor us it is a concrete opportunity, it means promoting rural development and sustainable economic growth,\u201d Ar\u00e9valo said, noting the presence of the United States ambassador.",
      "Still standing in the way is U.S. government approval for Guatemala\u2019s avocado export protocols, Guatemala\u2019s agriculture ministry said. Inspectors will have to ensure the avocados shipped to the U.S. are pest-free.",
      "The other challenge could be the U.S. tariffs on imports.",
      "As Guatemala tries to break into a U.S. market dominated by Mexico \u2013 1.4 million tons exported annually \u2014 Mexico\u2019s avocados do not currently face a tariff, putting Guatemala at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of caution and fear among economic actors, because things aren\u2019t well-defined, they\u2019re waiting for the government\u2019s negotiation (with the U.S.),\u201d said economist Ricardo Barrientos.",
      "But Guatemala could have other advantages.",
      "In recent years, the U.S. has temporarily suspended avocado imports from Mexico and inspections of the fruit in Michoacan state after inspectors received threats or were assaulted.",
      "The profitable fruit long ago attracted the attention of Mexico\u2019s powerful organized crime groups that extort avocado growers and packers. In September, the U.S. announced it would be passing inspection duties to the Mexican government.",
      "Those security threats could happen in Guatemala too as the industry grows. The country will also have to monitor closely deforestation as forests are chopped down to plant avocado orchards and the water the trees require, both of which have become sensitive issues in Mexico.",
      "Currently there are no regulations governing water use for avocado orchards, but the agriculture ministry says that \u201cbig companies use drip irrigation to optimize water resources.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo produce and export avocado good agricultural practices that contribute to good management of the fruit and the environment have to be implemented,\u201d the ministry said.",

    "story": [
      "France is banning activist groups on the edges of the political spectrum as it tries to portray itself as the guardian of democracy against extremism",
      "PARIS -- The French government is banning activist groups on the edges of the political spectrum as it tries to portray itself as the guardian of democracy against extremism. That\u2019s prompting accusations of Islamophobia from rivals on the left, and of plagiarism from the far right.",
      "And like much of French politics right now, the latest moves are intertwined with jockeying by political rivals ahead of 2027 presidential elections.",
      "Emmanuel Macron won\u2019t be able to stand for re-election in 2027 after serving as president for the maximum two terms, and presidential hopefuls are trying to make the most of a highly inflammatory political context, both on the domestic and international stages.",
      "As extreme political forces made significant gains in recent parliamentary elections, leaving a fractured legislature, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau \u2014 a senior member of the government who is eager to succeed Macron \u2014 is hitting out at various groups to show his credentials.",
      "On Wednesday, Retailleau confirmed plans for the dissolution of the Urgence Palestine group, a collective calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza which has accused Israel of genocide. During an interview with Europe 1-CNews, Retailleau said that banning the group was a blow to \u201cIslamism.\u201d",
      "\u201cIslamism is an ideology that tries to use a religion as a tool,\" he said. \"We need to hit Islamism so that we can protect our Muslim compatriots.\u201d",
      "The planned dissolution of Urgence Palestine is the latest move in the French government's strategy to bring down groups deemed as extremists. Retailleau told the lower house of the Parliament this week that he started a similar procedure against a left-wing movement called the antifascist Young Guard.",
      "That group, which is supported by political figures from the hard left, was created in Lyon in response to the growing presence of far-right activists in the city. Retailleau said he is also seeking the dissolution of a group close to the \"ultra-right\" movement called Lyon Populaire.",
      "The interior minister is a hardline conservative working within the centrist government of Prime Minister Francois Bayrou. Retailleau is bidding to become the leader of Les R\u00e9publicains and represent his party at the 2027 presidential election.",
      "Retailleau's announcements came on the eve of the May Day celebrations, which are often marred by violence on the sidelines of events marking International Workers\u2019 Day, and amid a surge in antisemitic and islamophobic incidents in Europe against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "France\u2019s National Consultative Commission on Human Rights last year reported a 32% spike in racist incidents in 2023, and an \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in antisemitic acts, up 284% from 2022. The report said the numbers were likely an undercount, given that many victims of racism don\u2019t file complaints.",
      "In this context, presidential contenders, including leftist challenger Jean-Luc Melenchon and far-right stalwarts Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, are all playing their cards.",
      "Melenchon attended a rally in Paris last week after a man suspected of killing a Muslim worshipper in a French mosque in an attack that was described by Bayrou as described by Bayrou as Islamophobic. Melenchon was moved to tears after a woman told him how Muslims no longer feel safe in France and that a red line had been crossed.",
      "\u201cThat's for sure,\u201d replied Melenchon, who accused Retailleau of nurturing \u201ca climate of Islamophobia.\u201d",
      "Melenchon in recent years has taken a clear stance in defense of Muslims, with many political rivals accusing him and his hard-left France Unbowed party of antisemitism. He strongly denies the accusations.",
      "On the other side of the spectrum, fearing that the current government\u2019s hardline stance on immigration and the fight against extremism could lead to a siphoning off of its voters, far-right leaders have accused Retailleau of just pretending to be tough.",
      "In February, after one person was killed and police officers injured in a knife attack in the eastern French city of Mulhouse conducted by a 37-year-old Algerian man, Bardella said Retailleau should either \u201cact or step down.\u201d",
      "The suspect had arrived in France without papers and was arrested and convicted of glorifying terrorism in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. After several months in prison for that conviction, the suspect was confined to house arrest as authorities sought to expel him to Algeria.",
      "\u201cPerhaps in order to please the National Rally electorate and right-wing voters, (Retailleau) is making more and more statements, except that the same things are happening over and over again,\u201d Bardella said.",
      "Retailleau, who will likely face stiff competition from rivals including former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin in his 2027 bid, has clearly made the fight against Islamism his rallying cry.",
      "His strategy of overtaking the far-right on its themes bears many similarities to Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s successful presidential campaign in 2007, when he beat a Socialist rival in the second round of ballot to succeed Jacques Chirac after the far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen was eliminated in the first round with just 10% of votes.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Rebel groups in Colombia are using apps like Facebook and Tik Tok to recruit children and young adults, and social media companies must do more to moderate content, the United Nations says.",
      "The U.N.'s top human rights official in Colombia, Scott Campbell, in an interview with The Associated Press said more investment is needed in both automated tools and human moderators to take down videos posted by gangs and rebel groups that are targeting youth from marginalized communities.",
      "Colombian rebel groups such as the FARC-EMC are increasingly posting videos that glamorize life in their ranks and urge youth to enlist.",
      "\u201cThese companies are not putting enough resources into online content moderation in the global south,\u201d Campbell said, calling Colombia an example of how \u201cgrave\u201d the threat can be for children and Indigenous communities. He said companies take more action in the global north, where they feel the most political pressure.",
      "Campbell, who previously served as a human rights and technology specialist at the U.N.\u2019s Geneva office, said he recently met with representatives from Meta, which owns Facebook, to discuss how rebel groups and gangs can be stopped from using the company\u2019s platforms to recruit young people.",
      "He said the company pledged to work on the problem, and is also seeking a meeting with TikTok representatives. Tik Tok did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In an email, Meta said the company has a policy of banning terrorist organizations from using its platforms and that it is collaborating with law enforcement to fight efforts to recruit children.",
      "\u201cWe also collaborate with other companies to share information and take actions against these evolving threats across the internet,\u201d Meta said.",
      "The recruitment of children has become a major problem in rural areas of Colombia that are disputed by the military, drug gangs and rebel groups.",
      "According to Colombia\u2019s Human Rights Ombudsman, 409 children under 18 were recruited into rebel groups in the South American nation last year, twice as many as in 2023.",
      "The U.N. recorded 216 cases of forced recruitment of minors in Colombia last year.",
      "The problem has been particularly striking in Cauca province in the southwest, where fighting has intensified as rebel groups try to fill a power vacuum left by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the guerrilla group that made peace with the government in 2016.",
      "Anyi Zapata, a humans rights specialist with ACIN, an Indigenous association in Cauca, said rebel groups there have long targeted vulnerable children, offering them money to do small favors and gifts like cellphones.",
      "Now they are posting videos on social media that show members with motorcycles, SUVs and adventurous lifestyles. One TikTok account recently featured a video of a man on a motorcycle wearing camouflage, with the caption: \"Join me and you will know friendship without hypocrisy.\u201d",
      "The images often show logos of rebel groups.",
      "Campbell said that even when accounts are taken down, they can be replaced by others. He said social media companies need to share their information on such accounts with Colombian prosecutors, who can file charges against people posting the content.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get the balance right between freedom of expression and legitimate speech, while pulling down content that is clearly illegal and can cause harm,\u201d Campbell said.",

      "The explosion that rocked an Iranian port had its epicenter at a facility ultimately owned by a charitable foundation overseen by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s office",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The explosion that rocked an Iranian port, killing at least 70 people and injuring more than 1,000 others, had its epicenter at a facility ultimately owned by a charitable foundation overseen by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's office.",
      "That foundation, known as Bonyad Mostazafan, faces American sanctions over it helping the 86-year-old Khamenei \u201cto enrich his office, reward his political allies and persecute the regime\u2019s enemies,\u201d the U.S. Treasury has said. Its top personnel also have direct ties to Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which oversees Tehran's ballistic missile arsenal and operations abroad targeting the Islamic Republic's enemies.",
      "Those associations come as authorities still haven't offered a cause for the blast Saturday at the Shahid Rajaei port near Bandar Abbas. The port reportedly took in a chemical component needed for solid fuel for ballistic missiles \u2014 something denied by authorities though local reports now increasingly point toward a mysterious, highly explosive cargo being delivered there.",
      "A bonyad, the Farsi word for \u201cfoundation,\u201d wields tremendous power in Iran. The bonyads take their root in foundations set up by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi during his rule.",
      "After the 1979 Islamic Revolution toppled the shah, Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini set up the bonyads to manage those assets, as well as companies seized from supporters of the shah and religious minorities, like the Baha\u2019i and Jews.",
      "Bonyad Mostazafan, or the \u201cFoundation of the Oppressed,\u201d is believed to be the largest in the country by assets, with a 2008 U.S. Congressional Research Service report suggesting it represented 10% of Iran's entire gross domestic product at the time. The Treasury in 2020 put its worth into the billions of dollars. Its network includes interests in mining, railroads, energy, steel and shipping through its Sina Port and Marine Services Development Co.",
      "Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show the epicenter of Saturday's explosion struck just next to Sina's terminal at the port, shredding the facility and the containers stacked nearby.",
      "Late Sunday, Iran\u2019s semiofficial ILNA news agency quoted Saeed Jafari, the CEO of Sina, as saying there had been false statements about the cargo that detonated, which he called \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe incident happened following a false statement about the dangerous goods and delivering it without documents and tags,\u201d Jafari said. He didn't elaborate and access to the site has been restricted by authorities since the blast.",
      "Since its creation, Bonyard Mostazafan has been linked to the Guard. Its current president, Hossein Dehghan, reached the rank of general in the Guard and serves as a military adviser to Khamenei. Other leaders in the foundation's history have had direct and indirect ties back to the Guard.",
      "The U.S. Treasury separately describes the foundation as having business relationships or cash transactions with the country's police, the Defense Ministry and the Guard as well.",
      "\u201cMostazafan has de-facto been functioning as the IRGC\u2019s \u2018money box,\u2019 whereby its financial assets and resources are made available to senior IRGC commanders, not least to fund terrorist activities,\u201d alleges United Against Nuclear Iran, a New York-based pressure group, using an acronym for the Guard.",
      "In sanctioning Bonyad Mostazafan in 2020, the first Trump administration described the foundation as being used by Khamenei to \u201cline the pockets of his allies.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite its outsized influence in the Iranian economy, Bonyad Mostazafan operates outside of government oversight and, due to a 1993 decree by the Supreme Leader, is exempt from paying taxes on its multibillion-dollar earnings,\u201d the U.S. Treasury said. The foundation says its affiliated companies pay taxes.",
      "On Tuesday, the Treasury issued new sanctions on China and Iran over the transshipment of sodium perchlorate and dioctyl sebacate to the Islamic Republic. Sodium perchlorate is used to produce ammonium perchlorate, a key ingredient to make solid fuel for ballistic missiles. The Treasury identified one individual from an Iranian firm as being linked to the Guard.",
      "The Financial Times in January first reported that two loads of sodium perchlorate were coming to Iran from China. Tracking data showed that one of the ships identified as carrying the load was near Shahid Rajaei in recent weeks. The private security firm Ambrey separately said that the port received the sodium perchlorate, which is described as a white, sand-like solid.",
      "Iranian Defense Ministry spokesperson Gen. Reza Talaeinik denied earlier this week that missile fuel had been imported through the port. Iranian Cabinet spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani separately described the explosion Wednesday as coming from \"human error, probably.\u201d",
      "However, no official in Iran has offered any explanation for what material detonated with such incredible force at the site.",
      "A reddish cloud could be seen in surveillance camera footage before the blast Saturday. That suggests a chemical compound like ammonia being involved in the blast, like the 2020 Beirut port explosion, in which ammonium nitrate caught fire and exploded.",
      "That cloud also resembled one seen in footage from a 1988 massive explosion in Nevada at the PEPCON plant that killed two people and injured hundreds. PEPCON, or the Pacific Engineering and Production Company of Nevada, made rocket fuel for NASA and had accumulated ammonium perchlorate that went unused after the Challenger disaster, leading to the blast.",
      "Similar reddish smoke could be seen just before a 2013 explosion at a Texas fertilizer plant filled with ammonium nitrate that killed 15 people.",
      "Separately, a health warning issued by authorities after the blast warned the public that pollutants like ammonia, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide likely were in the air.",

      "The United Kingdom offered a detailed explanation for launching the strike, in a departure from the U.S., which has offered few details about what it says are more than 1,000 targets it has hit since beginning its campaign on March 15.",

      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered an inquiry to establish whether previous governments led by his party intentionally blocked investigations and prosecutions of apartheid-era crimes",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- South African President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered an inquiry Wednesday to establish whether previous governments led by his party intentionally blocked investigations and prosecutions of apartheid-era crimes.",
      "The landmark move, which survivors and families of those who were killed have demanded for more than 20 years, will address allegations of \u201cimproper influence in delaying or hindering\u201d investigations that have been levelled against post-apartheid governments led by the African National Congress party, Ramaphosa's office said in a statement.",
      "The ANC was the organization at the forefront of the battle against the system of white minority rule and led South Africa to democracy. Apartheid ended in 1994.",
      "Ramaphosa's announcement of a judicial commission of inquiry came after 25 survivors and relatives of victims of apartheid-era crimes launched a court case against his government in January seeking damages. They alleged that successive South African governments since the late 1990s had failed to properly investigate unresolved killings, disappearances and other crimes during the time of forced racial segregation despite recommendations made by the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission.",
      "The new inquiry was part of a settlement agreement in the January court case, Ramaphosa's office said.",
      "\u201cPresident Ramaphosa appreciates the anguish and frustration of the families of victims, who have fought for so many years for justice,\u201d it said.",
      "The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was set up in 1996 by then-president Nelson Mandela under the chairmanship of fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu. Its mission was to expose and record apartheid-era crimes and give some of those responsible an opportunity to confess their role, including members of the apartheid government's state security forces that were implicated in many killings.",
      "Some were granted amnesty from prosecution, but others didn't come forward and thousands were denied amnesty.",
      "One of the most prominent unresolved cases is that of the Cradock Four, a group of Black anti-apartheid activists who were abducted and murdered by security forces in 1985. Their bodies were burned and security officers are suspected of torturing them.",
      "Six former police officers appeared before the commission in 1999 over the murders of Fort Calata, Matthew Goniwe, Sicelo Mhlauli, and Sparrow Mkonto, but none of them were granted amnesty.",
      "No one has been prosecuted for the killings and the circumstances of the deaths have never been fully revealed. They are among the thousands of crimes during apartheid where victims and families still haven't seen justice.",
      "Lukhanyo Calata, whose father Fort was one of the Cradock Four, is part of the group that took the current South African government to court in January. He said at the start of that court case that successive South African governments since the administration of President Thabo Mbeki from 1999-2008 had failed to act on the commission's recommendations and had denied victims and their families justice. He and other relatives say that government ministers intervened to prevent the investigation and prosecution of crimes.",
      "While the majority of the victims of apartheid-era crimes were Black, whites have also sought justice decades later. The joint case against the government included Neville Beling and Karl Weber, who are survivors of the Highgate Hotel Massacre, where five white people were killed by gunmen who burst into a bar and shot customers in 1993.",
      "A new inquest into those shootings began earlier this year in an effort to shed light on who the killers were. A separate inquest into what happened to the Cradock Four is due to start in June, 40 years to the month after they were killed.",

      "Videos posted on social media showed people balancing their belongings on their head or holding them aloft as they crossed the Artibonite River. A couple of boats ferried the few who could afford one.",
      "Horace blamed the Gran Grif gang for the ongoing attack, adding that the Viv Ansanm gang coalition was providing reinforcements.",
      "Gunmen first attacked Petite Rivi\u00e8re on April 24, and they have seized full control of the town\u2019s northern region, she said.",

      "Gran Grif was formed after Prophane Victor, a former member of Parliament who represented Petite Rivi\u00e8re, began arming young men in the region, according to a U.N. report.",

      "The U.N. mission said in a report released Wednesday that while the attacks began on March 21, prompting residents to call for help on social media, the government did not deploy specialist police units until March 31.",
      "At least 15 people were killed in Mirebalais, including two Catholic nuns. Most people were shot inside their homes or on the street as they tried to flee, according to the report.",

      "The mission said gangs struck to dismantle a barricade that a self-defense group had erected to stop gunmen from entering the heart of Mirebalais and to block the smuggling of weapons and drugs, presumably from the neighboring Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.",
      "Overall, more than 1,600 people were killed from January to March in Haiti, including at least 35 children. Another 850 people were injured, according to the U.N. report. Most of the killings and injuries were reported in the capital, Port-au-Prince, with 85% of it controlled by gangs.",

      "Catholic cardinals have acknowledged the definitive word is still out about the Vatican trial that convicted Cardinal Angelo Becciu of financial crimes",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Catholic cardinals acknowledged Wednesday the definitive word is still out about the Vatican trial that convicted Cardinal Angelo Becciu of financial crimes, in the latest twist to a drama that has dominated conversations leading up to the May 7 conclave to elect Pope Francis\u2019 successor.",
      "Becciu, 76, is the once-powerful Italian cardinal who formally withdrew his participation in the conclave on Tuesday, after days of uncertainty about his status.",
      "The Vatican\u2019s criminal court convicted Becciu in 2023 of embezzlement and other finance-related charges at the end of the so-called \u201ctrial of the century.\u201d",
      "But the convictions are being appealed and there are lingering questions about the integrity of the trial, which the College of Cardinals appeared to refer to in a statement Wednesday. As in Italy, convictions in the Vatican criminal court are not considered definitive until all appeals are exhausted.",
      "In their statement Wednesday, the college thanked Becciu for withdrawing and for \u201ccontributing to the communion and serenity of the conclave.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Congregation of Cardinals expresses its appreciation for the gesture he has made and hopes that the competent organs of justice will be able to definitively ascertain the facts,\u201d said a statement from the cardinals who are meeting in pre-conclave discussions.",
      "Francis in 2020 forced Becciu\u2019s resignation as head of the Vatican\u2019s saint-making office and forced him to renounce the rights of the cardinalate after receiving allegations of financial misconduct against him. Those allegations were the basis of the subsequent trial.",
      "Becciu denied wrongdoing but said at the time that he wouldn't be able to vote in a future conclave. After Francis died April 21, Becciu had asserted his right to participate. But he backed down Tuesday after being presented with letters from Francis, penned before his death, saying he couldn't take part.",
      "During the Vatican trial, which focused on the Vatican\u2019s bungled 350 million euro investment in a London property, defense lawyers discovered that Francis had secretly issued four decrees during the investigation to benefit prosecutors, allowing them to conduct intercepts and detain suspects without a judge\u2019s warrant.",
      "Defense lawyers argued such interference by an absolute monarch in a legal system where the pope exercises supreme legislative, executive and judicial power violated their clients\u2019 fundamental rights and robbed them of a fair trial.",
      "Also during the trial, it emerged that the prosecution\u2019s prime witness against Becciu was coached, threatened and manipulated by outsiders to persuade him to turn on the cardinal.",
      "The tribunal rejected the defense objections at the time and the trial went ahead. But in recent weeks even more evidence has emerged about the outside manipulation of the witness and apparent collusion with Vatican prosecutors and gendarmes to target Becciu. The Domani newspaper has published previously redacted WhatsApp chats and an audio suggesting that Vatican gendarmes and prosecutors were involved indirectly in coaching the witness, Monsignor Alberto Perlasca, to turn on Becciu.",
      "Becciu has responded to the reports with outrage, saying they prove that his prosecution was manipulated from the start.",
      "\u201cFrom the very first moment I spoke of a machination against me: an investigation built on falsehoods, which five years ago unjustly devastated my life and exposed me to a pillory of worldwide proportions,\u201d he said in a statement April 14, when the first chats were published.",
      "The appeal is scheduled to begin in September.",
      "The trial uncovered evidence of gross financial mismanagement that cost the Holy See tens of millions of euros at a time when the Vatican's finances were precarious at best.",
      "The Vatican hasn't released a consolidated budget for over two years, but previous estimates have pointed to a structural deficit of more than 50 million euros and a pension fund that is so poorly resourced that Francis warned last year that it couldn't guarantee its obligations in the medium term.",
      "Cardinals attending pre-conclave meetings heard reports Wednesday about the dire financial picture, which the next pope will have to confront. They heard from top cardinals in charge of the Vatican's economics council, the Vatican bank and Vatican investments committee. But two officials in charge of two other key financial organs of the Holy See were not there since they're not cardinals.",
      "They are Maximino Caballero Ledo, the prefect of the secretariat for the economy, and Sister Raffaella Petrini, president of the Vatican City State, which controls the main revenue source for the Holy See, the Vatican Museums.",

      "\u201cWe had a $13 billion tragedy in Maui and we lost 102 people. These kind of dollars will help us prevent that next disaster,\u201d Green said in an interview.",
      "Green said Hawaii was the first state in the nation to do something along these lines. Andrey Yushkov, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization, said he was unaware of any other state that has set aside lodging tax revenue for the purposes of environmental protection or climate change.",
      "The increase will add to what is already a relatively large duty on short-term stays. The state's existing 10.25% tax on daily room rates would climb to 11%. In addition, Hawaii's counties each add their own 3% surcharge and the state and counties impose a combined 4.712% general excise tax on goods and services including hotel rooms. Together, that will make for a tax rate of nearly 19%.",
      "The only large U.S. cities that have higher cumulative state and local lodging tax rates are Omaha, Nebraska, at 20.5%, and Cincinnati, at 19.3%, according to a 2024 report by HVS, a global hospitality consulting firm.",
      "The governor has long said the 10 million visitors who come to Hawaii each year should help the state's 1.4 million residents protect the environment.",
      "Green believes travelers will be willing to pay the increased tax because doing so will enable Hawaii to \u201ckeep the beaches perfect\u201d and preserve favorite spots like Maui's road to Hana and the coastline along Oahu's North Shore. After the Maui wildfire, Green said he heard from thousands of people across the country asking how they could help. This is a significant way they can, he said.",
      "Jerry Gibson, president of the Hawaii Hotel Alliance, which represents the state's hotel operators, said the industry was pleased lawmakers didn't adopt a higher increase that was initially proposed.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anybody in the tourism industry that says, \u2018Well, let\u2019s go out and tax more.\u2019 No one wants to see that,\" Gibson said. \"But our state, at the same time, needs money.\u201d",
      "The silver lining, Gibson said, is that the money is supposed to beautify Hawaii\u2019s environment. It will be worth it if that\u2019s the case, he said.",
      "Hawaii has long struggled to pay for the vast environmental and conservation needs of the islands, ranging from protecting coral reefs to weeding invasive plants to making sure tourists don't harass wildlife, such as Hawaiian monk seals. The state must also maintain a large network of trails, many of which have heavier foot traffic as more travelers choose to hike on vacation.",
      "Two years ago, lawmakers considered requiring tourists to pay for a yearlong license or pass to visit state parks and trails. Green wanted to have all visitors pay a $50 fee to enter the state, an idea lawmakers said would violate U.S. constitutional protections for free travel.",
      "Boosting the lodging tax is their compromise solution, one made more urgent by the Maui wildfires.",
      "An advocacy group, Care for Aina Now, calculated a $561 million gap between Hawaii's conservation funding needs and money spent each year.",
      "Green acknowledged the revenue from the tax increase falls short of this, but said the state would issue bonds to leverage the money it raises. Most of the $100 million would go toward measures that can be handled in a one-to-two year time frame, while $10 to $15 million of it would pay for bonds supporting long-term infrastructure projects.",
      "K\u0101wika Riley, a member of the governor's Climate Advisory Team, pointed to the Hawaiian saying, \u201cA stranger only for a day,\u201d to explain the new tax. The adage means that a visitor should help with the work after the first day of being a guest.",
      "\u201cNobody is saying that literally our visitors have to come here and start working for us. But what we are saying is that it\u2019s important to be part of of the solution,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be part of caring for the things you love.\u201d",

      "Premium coffee roasters in the U.S. are reeling from the sharp price increases of coffee beans, which nearly doubled last year after record drought in Brazil",
      "ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- With her purple-and-pink hair swaying, Rene\u00e9 Col\u00f3n stands on a stepladder in the rented corner of a warehouse, pouring Brazilian coffee beans into her groaning old roasting machine.",
      "The beans are precious because they survived severe drought in a year when environmental conditions depressed coffee production globally, doubling the price of raw beans in just months.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, coffee is going to become more scarce,\u201d said Col\u00f3n, founder and roaster at Fuego Coffee Roasters. \u201cSeeing that dramatic loss of the Brazilian crop is a perfect example.\u201d",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This story is a collaboration between Rochester Institute of Technology and The Associated Press.",
      "___",
      "Losses from heat and drought have cut production forecasts in Brazil and Vietnam, the world's largest coffee growers. Global production is still expected to increase, but not as much as commodity market investors had expected. That's sent coffee prices up, largely because of continued high demand in Europe, the U.S., and China.",
      "Prices peaked in February but have remained high, forcing roasters like Col\u00f3n to weigh how much of that cost to absorb and how much to pass on to consumers.",
      "The beans Col\u00f3n was roasting cost her $5.50 per pound in early March, more than double what they cost in September. And that was for mixed, midrange beans. Specialty coffees \u2014 grown in delicate climates to slow growth and add flavor \u2014 can cost even more.",
      "President Donald Trump's current 10% tariffs cover most coffee-producing countries, including Brazil, Ethiopia and Colombia, and are expected to drive up costs for Americans. Amid his chaotic tariff pronouncements \u2014 at one point he threatened 46% tariffs on Vietnam imports and 32% on Indonesia imports before pausing them \u2014 American coffee roasters are rethinking their supply chains.",
      "\u201cWith all these changes in coffee maybe we should open our own damn farm,\u201d Col\u00f3n muses.",
      "Rural New York isn't an option, of course. The world\u2019s best coffee thrives near the equator, where seasons are long, and in high altitudes, where slow growing allows beans to gather flavor. But Puerto Rico, where Col\u00f3n and her husband have roots, isn't a serious option, either \u2014 labor costs are too high and she worries about the increasing risk of crop-damaging hurricanes.",
      "She shrugs off buying coffee from Hawaii and California, which she says is either poor quality, overpriced or both.",
      "In February, global coffee green exports were down 14.2% from a year earlier, according to the International Coffee Organization\u2019s market report. The shortage led to the highest price ever for raw coffee in February, breaking the record set in 1977 when severe frost wiped out 70% of Brazil\u2019s coffee plants.",
      "Climate isn\u2019t the only thing driving up prices, said Daria Whalen, a buyer for San Francisco-based Ritual Coffee Roasters. Inflation is driving up the cost of labor, fertilizers, and borrowing, she said.",
      "She described being in Mexico in April seeking to finalize contracts between Trump\u2019s fits and starts on tariffs. It reminded her of being in Colombia a month earlier as Trump threatened and then backed away from tariffs that would have affected coffee prices.",
      "\u201cIt was kind of like roller coaster day, because at the end of the day it didn\u2019t exist,\u201d Whalen said.",
      "Some of the recent rise in coffee prices may be from importers buying extra in anticipation of the tariffs. Col\u00f3n believes prices will go still higher as import taxes begin being paid. And with consumer confidence hitting a 12-year low, Col\u00f3n could see a decrease in demand for her premium coffee.",
      "\u201cIt is tough on our end because it drives the price up, tough on the consumer end because they have to pay more and tough on the farmers' end because they may be experiencing really significant losses,\u201d Col\u00f3n said.",
      "Yet she's committed to expanding.",
      "In December, she and her husband took out a $50,000 loan to buy a custom coffee roaster from Turkey that will triple capacity. They\u2019re trying to increase sales by adding new wholesale clients like coffee shops, and selling directly to homes via a beans-of-the-month-style subscription service.",
      "The Col\u00f3ns have raised the wholesale price on a pound of roasted beans by 25 cents. They're considering doing the same for pour-overs and espresso drinks at their two retail locations.",
      "At one of those, called Melo, one couple said they don't look at the coffee's price on the receipt. For them, it's a treat.",
      "\u201cWe know we could go find coffee cheaper somewhere else,\u201d said Rob Newell, a high school biology teacher, as he held a cooing infant daughter alongside his wife, who is also a teacher. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just because we\u2019re new parents, but you get, like, cabin fever staying in the house all day.\u201d",
      "Col\u00f3n is also seeking to cut costs.",
      "The warehouse where she roasts has some extra space, so she's weighing stacking up more bags of raw beans there to save as much as $500 on monthly storage costs in port cities.",
      "She's tried to cultivate relationships with farmers to minimize price spikes and control bean quality. She described working with a farmer in Colombia as coffee prices were spiking in February to lock in a one-year contract that avoided the worst of the increase.",
      "And like many small business owners, she's had to get used to the complexity of tariffs.",
      "In January, she turned down a pitch from a Montreal coffee importer who suggested the U.S. dollar's strength in Canada would allow her to save money by importing through their warehouse. She feared that tariffs on Canada could increase prices. Plus, the coffee would have to cross an extra border, risking delays. And the value of the dollar has been up and down.",
      "\u201cI want things to be less complicated instead of more,\" she said.",

      "Romanians are preparing to cast their ballots in a critical presidential vote redo after last year\u2019s election was annulled",
      "SASCHIZ, Romania -- In a picturesque village in central Romania, 83-year-old Zoica Roth bemoans the lack of opportunities for young people and says she's not convinced that an upcoming presidential election can help stem the desertion of the countryside.",
      "\u201cI have two girls and two boys. I only see them once in the summer and once at Christmas because they\u2019re all abroad,\u201d she told The Associated Press in the courtyard of her farmstead in Saschiz, in Mures county. \u201cThe only solution is to leave ... I miss them.\u201d",
      "Anger toward Romania\u2019s political establishment in recent years has fueled a surge in support for far-right figures in the European Union and NATO member country, reflecting a broader pattern seen across Europe.",
      "In last year\u2019s election, the far-right front-runner Calin Georgescu \u2014 who is now under investigation and is barred from the rerun \u2014 won strong support among rural communities as well as 43% of the vote in Romania\u2019s large diaspora, with his calls to patriotism and emphasis on faith resonating.",
      "Georgescu\u2019s policy proposals included supporting local farmers, reducing import dependence, and ramping up domestic energy and food production. \u201cHe was a good one,\u201d Roth said, adding that a top court\u2019s decision to cancel the election on Dec. 6 was \u201cpretty messed up.\u201d",
      "She also feels let down by the choice of the 11 candidates in Sunday's election rerun. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to choose from, they\u2019re all the same,\" she added.",
      "A communist country until 1989, development across rural Romania has lagged behind that of cities. In a country of about 19 million people, some 45% of Romanians live in the countryside, which often lacks jobs and basic infrastructure.",
      "After joining the EU in 2007, millions of Romanians \u2014 including Roth's family \u2014 moved abroad in search of better opportunities, tearing apart countless families. Like many older generation Romanians, Roth now fondly remembers life during communism.",
      "\u201cIt was good back then, we had places to work, we had jobs,\u201d Roth said. \u201cNow I have my pension, but the young ones coming up have no jobs, nowhere to work. They leave with their bags on their backs \u2026 to foreign countries.\u201d",
      "Monica Rosalea, 41, works the land at home in Saschiz to make ends meet and periodically works in Germany.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard because there\u2019s no work \u2026 we all go abroad,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have children, how are we supposed to raise them? We\u2019re forced to leave them at home. The little money you bring from abroad, you spend it all here \u2026 everything is so expensive.\u201d",
      "Rosalea voted for Georgescu last year. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose him alone \u2026 everyone voted for him. But then look what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know who I\u2019d vote for now. There are no real options.\u201d",
      "In 2023, employment in Romania's rural areas was the lowest in the EU, with just 61% of working-age people in work, according to the EU\u2019s statistics agency Eurostat. Over the past decade, youth unemployment has fallen across most of the EU, but it has also risen in Romania\u2019s rural areas.",
      "For 23-year-old Alexandra Todea, who works as a logistics administrator at a local preserves factory in Saschiz, Georgescu\u2019s messages resonated because he saw the \u201cpotential of rural areas,\u201d which offered people hope that things could improve.",
      "\u201cIf the Romanian state supported us young people more \u2026 then there would be no need to leave and go to another country to make something of ourselves,\" she said. \"We do have potential, it\u2019s just that no one invests.\u201d",
      "Like many Romanians for whom Georgescu\u2019s messages struck a chord, Todea questions the legitimacy of cancelling the election and feels robbed of her previous vote. \u201cUnfortunately, that right was taken from me,\u201d she added.",
      "Her colleague, Aliz Alamorean, 23, bucked the trend by moving back to Romania this year after living in Spain since she was five. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like a stranger, but I didn\u2019t feel at home either,\u201d she said, adding she would vote for Georgescu if he were allowed to run again.",
      "\u201cThe same people always have to win, and when they saw the \u2018wrong\u2019 one was winning \u2014 they canceled it,\u201d she said, listing the economy as her main concern. \u201cIf I see it\u2019s not working out, I\u2019ll pack my bags and go back,\u201d she added.",
      "Life in rural Romania is often shaped by traditions, faith, and community ties \u2014 but the challenges are stark. A lack of opportunities, underdeveloped schools, and poor access to healthcare can deepen a sense of abandonment by the political class.",
      "A week after the Nov. 24 presidential first round, Alamorean voted for the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, in a parliamentary election. AUR proclaims to stand for \u201cfamily, nation, faith, and freedom,\" and doubled its support.",
      "The party's leader, George Simion, came fourth in last year\u2019s race and later backed Georgescu, and is widely viewed as his successor in the upcoming ballot. A median of polls suggests he will enter a runoff on May 18.",
      "Across the countryside, many Romanians still work the land tending to their crops and animals. But in rural communities \u2014 where 90% of households rely on firewood to heat their homes \u2014 not everyone will exercise their right to vote.",
      "\u201cI only have three years of school,\u201d said shepherd Attila Agostun, 46, who has never voted, as he watched over his flock grazing the verdant pastures near the village of Cund. \u201cAll my life has been with animals \u2026 that\u2019s where I grew up.\u201d",
      "The risk of poverty or social exclusion in Romania\u2019s rural communities is 45%, 26 percentage points higher than in cities, according to Eurostat.",
      "However, the Orthodox Church plays a central role in rural communities and offers hope.",
      "In the remote village of Floresti on a bright spring day, birdsong fills the courtyard of Liliana Cosurean, 54, as she lays out a spread of local cheese and homemade jam. She says she is happy living among forests and rolling hills, which she calls \u201ca little corner of paradise,\u201d where slow tourism has brought some positive change.",
      "But she acknowledges that the recent political turmoil has divided people. \u201cThere seems to be a certain tension in the air, and I hope it settles down for the sake of the young people,\u201d she said. \u201cI sincerely hope things will remain peaceful and won\u2019t fall apart.\u201d",
      "She did not want to say who she voted for in the previous race, and isn\u2019t sure if she\u2019ll vote on Sunday. She described Georgescu as \u201ca man with a kind heart and a fear of God,\u201d and believes he inspired trust because he spoke openly about faith.",
      "\u201cThat might be the thing that could unite us,\u201d she said. \u201cFaith can move mountains \u2026 a person who has faith can do anything.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump got worrisome news on Wednesday about how the U.S. economy is battening down for potential fallout from his tariffs \u2014 and he was quick to try to pin the blame on his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.",
      "The government reported that the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.3% during the first three months of the year. Behind the decline was a surge in imports as companies tried to front-run the sweeping tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum and almost every country. And even positive signs of increased domestic consumption indicated that purchases might be occurring before the import taxes lead to price hikes.",
      "Trump pointed his finger at Biden as the stock market fell Wednesday morning in response to the gross domestic product report.",
      "\u201cThis is Biden\u2019s Stock Market, not Trump\u2019s,\u201d the Republican president, who took office in January, posted on his social media site. \u201cTariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden \u2018Overhang.\u2019 This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS.\u201d",
      "But the GDP report gives Democrats ammunition to claim that Trump\u2019s policies could shove the economy into a recession.",
      "\u201cTrump has been in office for only 100 days, and costs, chaos and corruption are already on the rise,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. \u201cThe economy is slowing, prices are going up, and middle-class families are feeling the pinch.\u201d",
      "The report landed as Trump is trying to put the focus on new corporate investments in the U.S. as he spends the week celebrating his 100th day in office. He planned remarks later in the day on the subject.",
      "Trump's economic message contains some clashing arguments and dismisses data that raises red flags.",
      "He wants credit for an aggressive first 100 days back in the White House that included mass layoffs of federal workers and the start of a trade war with 145% in new tariffs against China. He also wants to blame the negative response of the financial markets on Biden, who left office months ago. He's also saying his tariffs are negotiating tools to generate trade deals but at the same time banking on hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff revenues to help cover his planned income tax cuts.",
      "Trump highlighted the positive aspects of the GDP report at a Wednesday Cabinet meeting. But that meeting inadvertently revealed how his administration is also trying to take credit for policies that involve the Biden administration as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick talked about his recent trip to Arizona to see the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s computer chip factories.",
      "TSMC notes on its website that it announced plans in May 2020, during Trump's first presidency as the coronavirus pandemic disrupted the global economy, to build its first plant in Arizona. It announced a second factory in December 2022, when Biden was in office. After getting up to $6.6 billion in commitments in 2024 from the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, TSMC announced plans for a third plant.",
      "Trump dismissed the importance of the government support that Biden made possible for computer chip factories to open domestically.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re building because of the tariffs,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Asked about his tariffs causing inflation, Trump told ABC News in a Tuesday interview that the economy would have eventually imploded if he didn't impose import taxes on allies including the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Japan, South Korea and India.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s gonna be just fine,\u201d Trump assured.",
      "Democrats' statements after the GDP report noted how quickly the economy, which still has a healthy 4.2% unemployment rate, appears to lose momentum within weeks of Trump returning.",
      "\u201cIn just 100 days, President Trump has taken the U.S. economy from strong, stable growth to negative GDP,\" said Heather Boushey, a former member of Biden's White House Council of Economic Advisers. \"This astonishing turn of fortune is directly due to the incoherence of his economic policy and his mismanagement of federal policy more generally.\u201d",
      "But White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters that the GDP drop was a \u201cone-shot deal\u201d because of the increased imports, which mathematically subtract from the measure of economic activity. Navarro said that the individual and business income tax cuts planned by Trump would help growth in the months ahead.",
      "\u201cAll we\u2019re seeing is good, strong news,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cSo the idea that there\u2019s a recession coming should be heavily discounted.\u201d",

      "Senate Democrats are forcing a vote on whether to block global tariffs announced by President Donald Trump earlier this month",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats are forcing a vote Wednesday evening on whether to block global tariffs announced by Donald Trump earlier this month, a potentially tough vote for some Republicans who have expressed concerns about the policy but are wary of crossing the president.",
      "Trump announced the far-reaching tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners April 2 and then reversed himself a few days later after a market meltdown, suspending the import taxes for 90 days. Amid the uncertainty for both U.S. consumers and businesses, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S. economy shrank 0.3% from January through March, the first drop in three years.",
      "It is unclear whether the resolution will pass the Senate, and House passage is even less likely. But Democrats say they want to put Republicans on the record either way and try to reassert congressional powers.",
      "\u201cThe Senate cannot be an idle spectator in the tariff madness,\u201d said Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the lead sponsor of the resolution.",
      "All 47 Senate Democrats are expected to support the resolution, which means they would need four Republican votes for passage. A similar resolution that would have thwarted Trump\u2019s ability to impose tariffs on Canada passed the Senate earlier this month with the support of Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. All but McConnell have indicated that they will vote for the broader resolution Wednesday.",
      "Wary of a rebuke to Trump, Republican leaders have encouraged their conference not to vote for the resolution, even as many of them remain wary of the tariffs. Vice President JD Vance attended a Senate GOP luncheon Tuesday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who assured senators that the administration is working on trade deals with individual countries.",
      "Republicans who have been skeptical of the tariffs said they won\u2019t vote with Democrats, arguing it is a political stunt. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said he backs separate legislation by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley that would give Congress increased power over determining tariffs but would vote no on the resolution, which he said is only about \u201cmaking a point.\u201d",
      "Democrats say the Republicans\u2019 failure to stand up to Trump could have dire consequences. \u201cThe only thing Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have succeeded in is raising the odds of recession and sending markets into a tailspin,\u201d said Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \u201cToday, they have to choose \u2013 stick with Trump or stand with your states.\u201d",

      "The explosion that rocked an Iranian port had its epicenter at a facility ultimately owned by a charitable foundation overseen by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s office",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The explosion that rocked an Iranian port, killing at least 70 people and injuring more than 1,000 others, had its epicenter at a facility ultimately owned by a charitable foundation overseen by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's office.",
      "That foundation, known as Bonyad Mostazafan, faces American sanctions over it helping the 86-year-old Khamenei \u201cto enrich his office, reward his political allies and persecute the regime\u2019s enemies,\u201d the U.S. Treasury has said. Its top personnel also have direct ties to Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which oversees Tehran's ballistic missile arsenal and operations abroad targeting the Islamic Republic's enemies.",
      "Those associations come as authorities still haven't offered a cause for the blast Saturday at the Shahid Rajaei port near Bandar Abbas. The port reportedly took in a chemical component needed for solid fuel for ballistic missiles \u2014 something denied by authorities though local reports now increasingly point toward a mysterious, highly explosive cargo being delivered there.",
      "\u201cIt's known that Iran has been doing all kinds of sanctions busting and so on in order to supply their weapons program,\u201d said Andrea Sella, a professor of chemistry at the University College London. \u201cThe surprising thing is the fact that this cargo, given that it's a highly energetic material ... was sitting right in the middle of the port warehousing area.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThat strikes me as nuts.\u201d",
      "A bonyad, the Farsi word for \u201cfoundation,\u201d wields tremendous power in Iran. The bonyads take their root in foundations set up by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi during his rule.",
      "After the 1979 Islamic Revolution toppled the shah, Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini set up the bonyads to manage those assets, as well as companies seized from supporters of the shah and religious minorities, like the Baha\u2019i and Jews.",
      "Bonyad Mostazafan, or the \u201cFoundation of the Oppressed,\u201d is believed to be the largest in the country by assets, with a 2008 U.S. Congressional Research Service report suggesting it represented 10% of Iran's entire gross domestic product at the time. The Treasury in 2020 put its worth into the billions of dollars. Its network includes interests in mining, railroads, energy, steel and shipping through its Sina Port and Marine Services Development Co.",
      "Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show the epicenter of Saturday's explosion struck just next to Sina's terminal at the port, shredding the facility and the containers stacked nearby.",
      "Late Sunday, Iran\u2019s semiofficial ILNA news agency quoted Saeed Jafari, the CEO of Sina, as saying there had been false statements about the cargo that detonated, which he called \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe incident happened following a false statement about the dangerous goods and delivering it without documents and tags,\u201d Jafari said. He didn't elaborate and access to the site has been restricted by authorities since the blast.",
      "Since its creation, Bonyard Mostazafan has been linked to the Guard. Its current president, Hossein Dehghan, reached the rank of general in the Guard and serves as a military adviser to Khamenei. Other leaders in the foundation's history have had direct and indirect ties back to the Guard.",
      "The U.S. Treasury separately describes the foundation as having business relationships or cash transactions with the country's police, the Defense Ministry and the Guard as well.",
      "\u201cMostazafan has de-facto been functioning as the IRGC\u2019s \u2018money box,\u2019 whereby its financial assets and resources are made available to senior IRGC commanders, not least to fund terrorist activities,\u201d alleges United Against Nuclear Iran, a New York-based pressure group, using an acronym for the Guard.",
      "In sanctioning Bonyad Mostazafan in 2020, the first Trump administration described the foundation as being used by Khamenei to \u201cline the pockets of his allies.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite its outsized influence in the Iranian economy, Bonyad Mostazafan operates outside of government oversight and, due to a 1993 decree by the Supreme Leader, is exempt from paying taxes on its multibillion-dollar earnings,\u201d the U.S. Treasury said. The foundation says its affiliated companies pay taxes.",
      "On Tuesday, the Treasury issued new sanctions on China and Iran over the transshipment of sodium perchlorate and dioctyl sebacate to the Islamic Republic. Sodium perchlorate is used to produce ammonium perchlorate, a key ingredient to make solid fuel for ballistic missiles. The Treasury identified one individual from an Iranian firm as being linked to the Guard.",
      "The Financial Times in January first reported that two loads of sodium perchlorate were coming to Iran from China. Tracking data showed that one of the ships identified as carrying the load was near Shahid Rajaei in recent weeks. The private security firm Ambrey separately said that the port received the sodium perchlorate, which is described as a white, sand-like solid.",
      "Iranian Defense Ministry spokesperson Gen. Reza Talaeinik denied earlier this week that missile fuel had been imported through the port. Iranian Cabinet spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani separately described the explosion Wednesday as coming from \"human error, probably.\u201d",
      "However, no official in Iran has offered any explanation for what material detonated with such incredible force at the site.",
      "A reddish cloud could be seen in surveillance camera footage before the blast Saturday. That suggests a chemical compound like ammonia being involved in the blast, like the 2020 Beirut port explosion, in which ammonium nitrate caught fire and exploded.",
      "That cloud also resembled one seen in footage from a 1988 massive explosion in Nevada at the PEPCON plant that killed two people and injured hundreds. PEPCON, or the Pacific Engineering and Production Company of Nevada, made rocket fuel for NASA and had accumulated ammonium perchlorate that went unused after the Challenger disaster, leading to the blast.",
      "Similar reddish smoke could be seen just before a 2013 explosion at a Texas fertilizer plant filled with ammonium nitrate that killed 15 people.",
      "Sella, the chemistry professor, said the reddish cloud likely was nitrogen dioxide, which can be produced when burning ammonium perchlorate or ammonium nitrate. However, the reports about the missile fuel shipment suggests it was ammonium perchlorate, he said.",

      "So many headlines about The Washington Post over the past year had little to do with its journalism",
      "NEW YORK -- After a brutal year of headlines about The Washington Post, executive editor Matt Murray sounded almost relieved to be talking about journalism.",
      "In an interview, he was touting \u201c100 scoops in 100 days\u201d about the Post's coverage of the Trump administration's first weeks. What sounds like a publicist's confection has truth behind it, with reporters putting their heads down and working, notably on stories involving the federal workforce and spending cuts.",
      "Most stories about the Post in the past few months have been negative, including publisher Will Lewis' botched reorganization that led to former executive editor Sally Buzbee's resignation last June, owner Jeff Bezos asserting himself over the opinion section and defections among journalists worried about the outlet's direction.",
      "\u201cGreat stories and great scoops are always good to remind people \u2014 both externally and internally \u2014 that it's all about the journalism at the end of the day,\u201d Murray said.",
      "Dan Diamond, Hannah Natanson, Carolyn Y. Johnson and Lena H. Sun are among the reporters who have dug into specifics about Department of Government Efficiency-inspired cuts and what they've meant for medical research and services for Social Security recipients. Natanson, Rachel Siegel and Laura Meckler have explored the use of government data to go after undocumented immigrants.",
      "Adam Taylor and John Hudson have dug into proposed cuts at the State Department. Maria Sacchetti and Artur Galocha showed how half of the people the White House reported as immigration enforcement arrests were already behind bars. Jacob Bogage wrote about a Trump appointee asking the IRS to review an audit of conservative personality Mike Lindell.",
      "It's grunt work, developing sources and stories that build upon other stories, many involving federal workers \u2014 the industry that the city is built upon.",
      "\u201cThe Post has an historic obligation \u2014 it's right in our name, Washington \u2014 to write aggressively, truthfully, thoughtfully about the government and what's happening there,\u201d Murray said. \u201cObviously the Trump administration, whatever one thinks of them, has the most aggressive change program that we've seen in many administrations.\u201d",
      "The work breaking stories has been noticeable, said Margaret Sullivan, a former media columnist at the Post who still writes, teaches at Columbia University and runs the Craig Newmark Center for Journalism Ethics and Security there.",
      "\u201cI've been happy to see that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe place has been through such a difficult time and it's not due to the journalists there. It's because of the ownership and management.\u201d",
      "The Post hasn't yet earned its own Truth Social post about its reporting since President Donald Trump's return \u2014 the ultimate sign it has gotten under Trump's skin \u2014 but the White House labeled one of its stories about health funding \u201cfake news.\u201d Tulsi Gabbard, national intelligence director, cited a Post story about Israel and Iran among her reasons to seek out internal leakers.",
      "The work has also calmed fears about whether owner Bezos' newfound friendliness with Trump would impact news coverage. Last fall, Bezos ordered a planned endorsement of Trump opponent Kamala Harris spiked, triggering an exodus of angry subscribers. He was a prominently visible guest at Trump's second inauguration and soon after said the Post's opinion pages should focus primarily on personal liberties and the free market.",
      "That change in direction led to the resignations of editorial page editor David Shipley and two long-time Post columnists, Ruth Marcus and Eugene Robinson.",
      "Bezos' actions with the opinion section have hurt the Post's reputation when the country really needs it, and when its news coverage has been excellent, said Robert McCartney, a retired Post columnist. \u201cTheir DOGE coverage has been really good, as good as anybody's,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have broken a lot of news. They have done a lot of important accountability reporting.\u201d",
      "Between the turmoil and a sea of red ink resulting in layoffs, the Post suffered a significant talent defection at the end of last year. Journalists like Matea Gold, the respected managing editor, and reporters Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker and Michael Scherer took new jobs. That exposed some thin skin; Murray, then only interim editor, briefly banned goodbye emails believing they were bad for morale, before the decision was reversed, the Guardian reported. The paper has banned its media writers from reporting stories about the newspaper.",
      "\u201cThe reporters are doing good work, by and large,\u201d said Richard Prince, a retired reporter and editor who spent 20 years at the Post in two stints. \u201cIt's a shame there is all this turmoil that is coming from the top. It seems like they lost more talent than they gained.\u201d",
      "At a time there are more journalists than jobs, the Post is still a desired destination. \u201cMany other people are stepping up and have had new opportunities and are showing their chops,\u201d said Murray, who had the \u201cinterim\u201d removed from his title with no fanfare earlier this year.",
      "The Post is still in transition; Murray appointed some key deputies last week. It is still sorting out coverage areas that need more attention and those that don't. He promised more resources to follow technology, artificial intelligence and the markets.",
      "The Post reportedly lost some 325,000 subscribers after the Harris non-endorsement and editorial policy change; the newspaper won't say whether it has recovered that number since through new or returned subscribers. The newspaper is more aggressively seeking new readers and says 100,000 more new subscribers signed up this year than did over the same period in 2024.",
      "It's spring; consider them all shoots popping up from the ground after a damaging winter.",
      "\u201cI would not quit the Post,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIf I were a regular reader, I would still find it very interesting and necessary.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Financial markets are volatile. Consumer confidence is at its lowest level in five years. Economists say recession risks are rising.",
      "It all adds up to financial uncertainty for a lot of Americans. Roughly half of U.S. adults say that President Trump's trade policies will increase prices \u201ca lot,\" according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center of Public Affairs Research. And about half of Americans are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the possibility of the U.S. economy going into a recession in the next few months.",
      "Matt Watson, CEO of Origin, a financial planning app, says it's a period of uncertainty for everyone, including experts.",
      "\u201cNo one has a crystal ball. No one, even the people that do this professionally and have done it very successfully for many years, know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said.",
      "If you're worried about how economic uncertainty might affect you, here are some expert recommendations:",
      "The first step to preparing for uncertain financial times is knowing your starting point, Watson said. Look at your budget or your debit card expenses so you can understand how much you spend every month.",
      "\u201cTake stock of where you are across a number of different categories,\u201d Watson said.",
      "Looking at the state of your savings and investments can also provide you with an idea of your overall financial health.",
      "The more nonessential expenses you can pause, the more you can save for an emergency.",
      "\u201cYour choice is really to cut now or cut later, so it's easier to cut now and have a cushion,\u201d Watson said.",
      "If you're having difficulty finding where to cut back, Jim Weil, managing partner at Private Vista, a financial planning firm, recommends that you divide your expenses into three buckets: needs, wants and wishes. Wishes are larger expenses that can be postponed, such as a vacation to Europe.",
      "For the time being, cut back expenses from the wishes section until you feel like your finances are in a good place.",
      "Between news about tariffs and job losses, you might feel your anxiety rising. So, it's important that you protect your mental health while also caring about your finances, said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate at Credit Karma. Sometimes, reading too much news that can affect your finances can become overbearing and create more stress than you need.",
      "\u201cIt's good practice to stay informed but you don't want to let the news cycle consume you,\u201d Alev said.",
      "If you find yourself feeling high levels of stress or anxiety when it comes to your finances, it's best to contact a professional who can assist you, such as a financial therapist.",
      "If looking for regular mental health services, most health insurance covers some type of mental health assistance. If you don't have health insurance, you can look for sliding-scale therapists around the country, including through FindTreatment.gov and the Anxiety and Depression Association of America directory.",
      "Rather than worrying too much on the economics of the entire country, Alev recommends that you focus on the aspects of your personal life that you can control in order to feel more confident in case there is a recession.",
      "\u201cIdentify any changes that you might need to make to have more of a safety net in place that could give you confidence,\u201d Alev said.",
      "Things you can control include budgeting, creating an emergency fund and cutting unnecessary expenses.",
      "Whether you are worried about your job security or the high prices of goods, it's best that you sit down and reassess your budget to create an emergency fund. An emergency fund can feel unattainable if finances are already difficult, but having even a small amount of cash saved can make the difference, Alev said.",
      "Ideally, your emergency fund should amount to three to six months of expenses.",
      "Weil recommends you start thinking about any special commitments that you might have in the next year or two, such as college tuition or moving. If you are planning for a large financial commitment in the near future, Weil recommends that you plan to build a larger emergency fund.",
      "Alev recommends regularly adjusting your budget to keep your financial goals on track. Monthly budget check-ins can help identify when you are overspending or if your needs change.",
      "\u201cA budget is only as good as it is to help you actually make decisions, so don't be afraid to update and adapt your budget as the months go by,\u201d Alev said.",
      "Many Americans struggle with debt, whether it's credit card debt or student loan debt, which limits their ability to save. But, if you want to create an emergency fund while also tackling your debt, it will take some prioritization.",
      "\u201cI would think about different kinds of debt differently,\" Weil said, adding that you can place debt in three buckets: short-, medium- and long-term debt.",
      "Weil recommends that you prioritize paying off high-interest debt such as your credit card. By making extra payments or paying over the minimum payment, you will be able to pay it off quicker. Student loan debt and long-term debt such as a mortgage can be tackled with more modest payments while you focus on creating an emergency fund.",
      "If you have credit card debt and you can't make too much progress in paying it down, Alev recommends you try to eliminate or reduce the amount of credit you use.",
      "While the stock market has had some bad days, it's best that you are not reactive to the market. If you have investments, especially in retirement vehicles such as your 401(k), it's best not to make rushed decisions, Alev said.",
      "\u201cYou really want to try not to panic. It can be unnerving but most likely, you should have time to make that up,\u201d she added. If you're closer to retirement, Alev recommends that you look into more conservative investments.",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Ford Motor Company's top executive on Wednesday welcomed revisions to auto import rules but said more work is needed to craft trade policies that spur growth in the U.S. auto industry.",
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley touted his company's domestic production, saying it outpaces competitors, as he attended the rollout of the company's 2025 Expedition SUV at its massive truck plant in Kentucky.",
      "Farley focused on trade policies during his remarks to plant workers, a day after President Donald Trump signed executive orders to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts.",
      "\u201cThe changes this week on tariff plans will help ease the impact of tariffs for automakers, suppliers and consumers,\u201d Farley said. \u201cBut this is what we really care about. We need to continue to work closely with the administration on a comprehensive set of policies to support our shared vision of that healthy and growing auto industry. And we are not there yet.\u201d",
      "Farley pointed to Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant, which employs nearly 9,000 workers, as \u201ca shining example of American manufacturing.\u201d Ford has another auto production plant across town in Louisville. The venerable automaker opened the truck plant for a media tour Wednesday, showing off its synchronized assembly lines.",
      "Farley took aim at Ford's competitors in his speech, saying if they matched Ford's level of domestic production, it would be a boon for U.S. manufacturing and employment.",
      "\u201cMore than 80% of the vehicles Ford sells in America are assembled in America \u2014 plus we export significantly,\" he said. \"If each of our competitors matched that commitment, it would mean 4 million more vehicles assembled in America every single year.",
      "\u201cIf our competition matched Ford and moved auto assembly to the U.S., that would equal the production level of as many as 15 new assembly plants like this one \u2013 and that\u2019s not even counting the supplier parts to support them. That would mean hundreds of thousands of new jobs in America.\u201d",
      "While Ford touts its domestic production, the automaker continues to import vehicles and parts from Mexico as well as engines from Canada.",
      "Trump signed one order on Tuesday that amended his previous 25% auto tariffs, making it easier for vehicles that are assembled in the U.S. with foreign parts to avoid prohibitively high import taxes.",
      "The major car companies recently said sales rose sharply in March, with most reporting double-digit gains. For some companies, the strong performance helped make up for a sluggish start to the year. Some industry observers said the March numbers were expected to be higher due to some buying ahead of the anticipated imposition of tariffs.",
      "As discussions on trade and domestic production continue with Trump's administration, Farley called for policies that encourage exports and reward companies like Ford that export American-produced products.",
      "\u201cSo many of the vehicles we build here are exported around the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we get credit for that? Those are American jobs. And we have to keep working on affordable parts to ensure that those supply chains promote domestic growth and affordable vehicles in our country.\u201d",
      "Ford also said Wednesday that it is extending its \u201cemployee pricing\u201d offer to vehicle buyers through the July 4th weekend. Farley said the offer has \u201cstruck a chord\u201d with consumers.",

      "Uncertainty continues to hang over the latest round of financial results and forecasts for companies both big and small as they try to navigate a global trade system severely shaken by a stark shift in U.S. policy",
      "NEW YORK -- Uncertainty continues to hang over the latest round of financial results and forecasts for companies both big and small as they try to navigate a global trade system severely shaken by a shift in U.S. policy.",
      "Tariffs and the stark shift in policy has also shaken consumer and business confidence. The U.S. economy shrank during the first quarter of the year, its first drop in three years. Consumer spending has ramped up, likely an effort to get ahead of tariffs, and companies are pulling back on hiring. Stunted consumer spending and weaker employment could further hurt the U.S. economy.",
      "Roughly half of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported their latest quarterly financial results, but the focus has been on how they will adjust to tariffs and any change in consumers' behavior. The focus remains blurry for both companies and investors because of the on-again-off-again nature of President Donald Trump's policy",
      "Trump has implemented a range of tariffs on goods from some of the biggest U.S. trading partners and many of those countries have hit back with retaliatory tariffs. At the same time, Trump has pulled back or postponed some tariffs. The situation remains unpredictable and that is problematic for companies trying to plan ahead and investors looking for stability.",
      "Here's what companies are saying about tariffs and the potential impact:",
      "Caterpillar's latest profit and revenue results fell sharply from a year ago and they also missed Wall Street forecasts.",
      "The heavy machinery maker and industrial bellwether is among the many companies giving investors an uncertain forecast. Its equipment is used by the construction, mining and energy industries. Wall Street often uses Caterpillar's financial position and forecasts as a gauge for how well those industries are performing or will potentially perform in the quarter and year ahead.",
      "Without any impact from tariffs, the company expects sales and revenue in 2025 to match the prior year. With the current tariffs in place, sales and revenue are expected to dip slightly.",
      "Stanley Black & Decker said it raised prices in April and plans to raise prices again in the third quarter of the year as a reaction to tariffs.",
      "The maker of drills and other tools trimmed its earnings forecast for the year, based on the impact of tariffs and planned adjustments to its supply chain.",
      "\u201cIn light of the current environment, we are accelerating adjustments to our supply chain and exploring all options as we seek to minimize the impact of tariffs on end users while balancing the need to protect our business and our ability to innovate for years to come,\u201d said CEO Donald Allan, Jr., in a statement.",
      "Newell Brands has not changed its current financial forecast for the year, but warned that tariffs on China could take a big bite out of profits if they stand.",
      "The company makes ubiquitous consumer goods under brand names including Rubbermaid, Paper Mate and Coleman. It expects that tariffs on China, if they stand, to shave 20 cents per share from earnings. Newell Brands said it is already working on actions that could cut that impact in half.",
      "British bank Barclays saw its profit in the first-quarter of the year spike by a fifth largely as a result of a boom in trading activity sparked by the turmoil in financial markets following the array of tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Barclays said the 16% increase in income across its investment banking division to nearly 4 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) outweighed the hit to dealmaking from tariff and economic uncertainty. As a result. net profit rose 20% to 2.1 billion pounds.",
      "Still, the bank said it has set aside more cash for bad debts due to worries over the American economy as a result of the uncertainty. Barclays has an exposure to the tariff woes and U.S. economy through its sizable operations in America, where it has 20 million customers.",
      "CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan said the group remains \u201cvery committed\u201d to its U.S. business, despite the clouded outlook for the American economy.",
      "U.K.-based drugmaker GSK, formerly known as GlaxoSmithKline, has said it is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to cope with any financial impact from changes to U.S. tariff rules.",
      "The company maintained its financial guidance for the year despite uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, with the Trump administration currently investigating whether to change tariff policy for the pharmaceuticals sector.",
      "GSK was among pharmaceutical firms to recently call on the European Union to allow them to increase prices amid uncertainty over tariffs in the sector, warning Europe it will fall further behind the U.S. without stronger investment.",
      "Sysco cut its forecast for the year amid uncertainties over how tariffs will impact consumer spending.",
      "The food distributor purchases more than 90% of its products in each country that it operates within. That leaves it less exposed to tariff cost impacts than other industries, it said.",
      "\u201cOur main concern is the negative impact that tariff noise and volatility is clearly having on end consumer confidence and sentiment,\u201d said CEO Kevin Hourican, in a conference call with analysts.",

    "story": [
      "The new chief executive of California\u2019s embattled high-speed rail project says it is time to get serious about how to pay for it",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A long-delayed project promising nonstop rail service between San Francisco and Los Angeles in under three hours may be able to secure the private funding it desperately needs if California agrees to pay the investors back, its chief executive told The Associated Press.",
      "Ian Choudri, who was appointed CEO of the California High-Speed Rail Authority in August, is tasked with reinvigorating the nation's largest infrastructure project amid skyrocketing costs and new fears that the Trump administration could pull $4 billion in federal funding.",
      "\u201cWe started this one, and we are not succeeding,\u201d Choudri said, describing what drew him to the job after work on high-speed systems in Europe. \u201cThat was the main reason for me to say, let\u2019s go in, completely turn it around, and put it back to where it should have been. Fix all the issues, get the funding stabilized, and demonstrate to the rest of the world that when we decide that we want to do it, we actually will do it.\u201d",
      "Voters first approved $10 billion in bond money in 2008 to cover about a third of the estimated cost with a promise the train would be up and running by 2020. Five years past that deadline, no tracks have been laid and Choudri acknowledges it may take nearly two more decades to complete most of the San Francisco-to-Los Angeles segment, even if funding is secured.",
      "The project's price tag now exceeds $100 billion, more than triple the initial estimate. It has mostly been funded by the state through the voter-approved bond and money from the state\u2019s cap-and-trade program. A little less than a quarter of the money has come from the federal government.",
      "The authority has already spent about $13 billion. The state is now out of bond money, and officials need to come up with a financing plan for the Central Valley segment by mid-2026, according to the inspector general\u2019s office overseeing the project.",
      "\u201cThe managers of the project were in trouble from the very beginning because they never had the financing \u2013 certainly not stable and predicting financing \u2014 that they would have needed to manage the project efficiently,\u201d said Lou Thompson, who led a peer review group that analyzes the state\u2019s high-speed rail plans.",
      "Losing money from the federal government \u201cwould require a real hard rethinking of what do we do to survive the next four years,\u201d he said.",
      "Rail leaders are in talks with Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s administration and state lawmakers on what will be needed to secure private investment, Choudri said, adding that without the private sector money the state may have to take out federal loans or issue new bonds. At an industry forum in January, private investors expressed interest in the project but need some form of security, he said.",
      "Choudri is pushing Newsom and lawmakers to consider a program that would eventually commit the state to paying back private investors, possibly with interest. That would give the state more time to cover the cost.",
      "Legislative Democrats say they remain hopeful for the project\u2019s future. But they haven\u2019t unveiled any proposals yet this year in the state Legislature to set aside additional funding and have resisted spending more money on the project in the past.",
      "Choudri plans to provide lawmakers this summer with an updated timeline and price tag.",
      "Choudri aims to fulfill the original vision of building a pioneering system \u2014 already common in Europe and Asia \u2014 that spurs economic growth, curbs planet-warming emissions from cars and planes, and saves drivers hours on the road.",
      "At speeds up to 220 miles (354 kilometers) per hour, it would be the nation's fastest way to travel by ground.",
      "Amtrak\u2019s Acela train transports passengers at speeds up to 150 miles (241 kilometers) per hour to major cities including New York, Boston and Philadelphia. Another rail line in Florida operating at speeds up to 125 miles (201 kilometers) per hour shuttles people from Orlando to Miami.",
      "Construction is underway for a mostly privately funded high-speed system to carry riders from Las Vegas to Southern California.",
      "California's construction is far from completion. Of the 119 miles (192 kilometers) of construction underway in the Central Valley, only a 22-mile (35-kilometer) stretch is ready for the track-laying phase, which isn\u2019t set to start until next year.",
      "Finishing the line in the Valley is just the first step. Next, the train has to extend north toward the San Francisco Bay Area and south toward Los Angeles. Choudri's goal is to build to Gilroy, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) southeast of San Francisco. Under current public transit, it would then take at least one more train transfer to get into the city.",
      "Southward, he envisions building to Palmdale, 37 miles (60 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles. From there, it takes more than one hour to drive or two hours on an existing train line to reach Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cIn the ideal world, you can take the 500 miles, build it in your warehouse and then just drop it and everybody\u2019s happy,\" Choudri said. \u201cBut the programs are never built like that. You build incrementally and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now.\u201d",
      "Critics say the project will never be completed and may leave towering and unusable infrastructure stretching through the state's agricultural heartland. More than 50 structures have already been built, including underpasses, viaducts and bridges to separate the rail line from existing roadways for safety.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve now spent billions of dollars and really no tracks have been laid,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Tony Strickland, who is vice chair of the Senate Transportation Committee.",
      "Doug Verboon, chair of the Kings County Board of Supervisors, who has fought the High-Speed Rail Authority in court over farmers' loss of land due to the project, said the people who should be most upset by delays are its longtime supporters.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me like the state government is in a hurry to finish it,\" he said.",

The celebrations \u2014 performances by artists, speeches by leaders and former soldiers, and a squadron of jets \u2014 focused not just on the past but on the future.",
      "\u201cNational reconciliation does not mean forgetting the history or erasing differences, but accepting different perspectives in tolerance and respect, to work towards a greater goal: building a peaceful, unified, powerful, civilized and prosperous Vietnam,\u201d Communist Party general secretary To Lam said in an article published on a government website.",
      "He said that the war had historical roots and had resulted in divisions in the country, but now Vietnam was armed with \u201clessons of its past.\u201d",
      "The emphasis on reconciliation and not, like previous years, on military victory reflected how Vietnam was approaching the changing tides of the global economy and geopolitics today, said Nguyen Khac Giang, an analyst at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute. He added that the Vietnam War remains central to how the Communist Party framed its legitimacy, not just as a military triumph but also as a symbol of national unity. But To Lam\u2019s comments underlined that the reconciliation remains unfinished.",
      "\u201cThe war still defines Vietnam\u2019s unity, and its unresolved divides,\u201d Giang said.",
      "Pham Ngoc Son is a 69-year-old veteran who was an army truck driver bringing troops and supplies from the north to the south through the Ho Chi Minh trail \u2014 the secret route used by North Vietnam. He's on a weeklong tour of the city, which he remembers entering as a part of the northern troops that took over.",
      "He said he cherished those memories and couldn't describe the joy he felt at that moment. But now there was \u201donly space for peace and friendship\" between the U.S. and Vietnam.",
      "\u201cThe war is over a long time ago,\" he said.",
      "Nguyen Thi Hue, a resident of Ho Chi Minh city, agreed.",
      "\u201cThe war has ended and we shake hands (with the former enemy) for development. Now it\u2019s time for peace. Peace is the dream that everyone in the world wants,\u201d Hue said.",
      "This year also marks the 30-year anniversary of diplomatic ties between Vietnam and the United States. In 2023, Vietnam upgraded its relations with the U.S. to that of a comprehensive strategic partner, the highest diplomatic status it gives to any country and the same level of relations as China and Russia.",
      "Vietnamese officials insist that this relationship has been built on a bedrock of trust intrinsically linked to U.S. efforts to address war legacies such as Agent Orange and unexploded bombs in the countryside that still threaten lives. The future of those projects is now at risk because of the Trump administration\u2019s broad cuts to USAID. Moreover, the export-dependent country is vulnerable in a global economy made fragile by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff plans.",
      "About 13,000 people, including troops, militias, veterans and local citizens, were expected to take part in the parade. And, apart from China, troops from Laos and Cambodia also were due to attend the parade, which will march on the main boulevard leading to the Independence Palace before branching out through the streets in the city. The route will also pass the U.S. Consulate in the city.",
      "Meanwhile, a video of Chinese troops singing the iconic \u201cAs If Uncle Ho Were With Us on Victory Day\u201d during an earlier rehearsal was shared widely on social media. Chinese leader Xi Jinping had visited Vietnam earlier in the month in a bid to present the country as a force for stability in contrast with Trump.",
      "Close ties with Washington helped Vietnam balance its relations with its much larger and more powerful neighbor China, said Huong Le-Thu of the International Crisis Group think tank. Vietnam is among the countries involved in maritime disputes related to the South China Sea.",
      "But the Trump administration\u2019s focus on tariffs \u2014 Vietnam was slammed with reciprocal tariffs of 46%, one of the highest \u2014 puts a \u201cbig question mark\u201d on what the U.S. wants to achieve in Asia, she said. Focus on economic and not strategic competition may mean that Vietnam and other countries in Southeast Asia become less important for the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt really will be shaping up (on) how the new administration sees the strategic picture in the Indo-Pacific and where countries like Vietnam would fit in,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "There\u2019s new uncertainty about updated COVID-19 shots this fall after the Trump administration\u2019s handling of a shot from Novavax",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration's effort to impose new requirements on Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine \u2014 the nation's only traditional protein-based option for the coronavirus \u2014 is sowing uncertainty about updates to other vaccines, too.",
      "Novavax said Monday that the Food and Drug Administration was asking the company to run a new clinical trial of its vaccine after the agency grants full approval. The company said it had responded and that it believed its shot remains \u201capprovable.\u201d",
      "But a weekend post on social media by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested the prospect of needing a new trial before the shots' yearly strain update \u2014 something unlikely to be possible before fall. That's raised questions about whether other vaccines will be caught in the turmoil.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think because there\u2019s a strain change that this is a new product,\u201d said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief. If that\u2019s the new policy, \u201cyou\u2019d always be doing clinical trials and you\u2019d never have a vaccine that was up to date.\u201d",
      "The unusual move at FDA come shortly after the agency's longtime vaccine chief was forced out over disagreements with Makary's boss, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Kennedy won Senate confirmation to his job, in part, by promising not to change the nation\u2019s vaccine schedule. Since taking office, he\u2019s promised to \u201cinvestigate\u201d children\u2019s shots, canceled meetings of expert vaccine advisers and directed officials to look again for connections between vaccines and autism, a link long-ago debunked.",
      "The Novavax vaccine, which originally showed effectiveness in a nearly 30,000-person clinical trial, is still being sold under emergency use authorization in the U.S. The nation's other two options, mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, have earned full FDA approval for certain age groups.",
      "Because the coronavirus continually mutates, manufacturers follow instructions from FDA to make one change each year to their recipe \u2014 which strain to target \u2014 just like flu vaccines.",
      "The FDA was on track to grant Novavax full approval by its April 1 target date, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters. But Trump appointees directed FDA scientists to pause their decision, according to one of the people. Since that highly unusual move, Novavax and the agency have been discussing additional requirements for approval.",
      "In his weekend tweet, FDA's Makary referred to the Novavax vaccine as \u201ca new product,\u201d presumably because it had been updated to match last year's common coronavirus strain.",
      "\u201cNew products require new clinical studies,\u201d Makary added.",
      "An administration spokesman didn't respond to specific questions about Pfizer and Moderna but suggested all COVID-19 vaccines could face stricter requirements.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now been years since COVID has presented the threat it once did, and the urgency to rush approval of boosters without normal oversight no longer exists,\u201d said Andrew Nixon, a Health and Human Services spokesman, in a statement.",
      "The FDA had been treating the annual COVID-19 strain updates exactly as it's done for decades with flu vaccines \u2014 not as new products, but existing ones that are merely adjusted to protect against the latest strains, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "Offit said the companies still must perform tests in small numbers of people that show these updated vaccines produce levels of virus-fighting antibodies known to be protective, and they're closely monitored for safety.",
      "Nixon, the HHS spokesman, suggested the policy might not apply to the flu shot, \u201cwhich has been tried and tested for more than 80 years.\u201d",
      "Under federal law, the FDA is required to follow established procedures when issuing requirements to drugmakers for approval. If the agency skips certain steps or imposes additional requirements for political reasons, experts say, it could be sued by drugmakers \u2014 or even patients, such as those who prefer the Novavax vaccine over its competitors because of an allergy or some other reason.",
      "In addition to large clinical trials conducted before all three COVID-19 vaccines were cleared for use, there's data on real-world use, said former Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, who oversaw COVID-19 vaccine policy during the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cAt the point where I had left, we had put some 700 million COVID vaccines into the arms of Americans,\u201d he said. \"That\u2019s a pretty good size clinical trial.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- General Motors is recalling nearly 600,000 vehicles across its Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands in the U.S. due to potential manufacturing defects that can cause engine failure.",
      "The recall covers certain Cadillac Escalades and Escalade ESVs; Chevrolet Silverado 1500s, Suburbans and Tahoes; as well as GMC Sierra 1500s, Yukons and Yukon XLs between model years 2021 and 2024.",
      "According to recall documents published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, these vehicles share a gas engine that may have connecting rod or crankshaft component problems, due to supplier manufacturing or quality issues. This can lead to engine damage, and potentially failure, while driving \u2014 increasing crash risks.",
      "Prior to failure, NHSTA documents warn, impacted drivers may be alerted of these issues through loud knocking or banging noises, the check engine light turning on and/or other driving performance issues, such as reduced propulsion.",
      "As a remedy, dealers will inspect affected vehicles \u2014 and repair or replace the engine if necessary with newer components, free of charge. Dealers notifications began last week, with owner letters set to be mailed out June 9.",
      "In all, about 597,630 vehicles are covered by the recall, per a notice dated April 24. But the company estimates that just 3% have the defect.",
      "When asked why owner notification wouldn't start until June 9, GM maintained that it was \u201ccommon to require time\u201d to both confirm mailing lists for registered owners and ensure that dealers are prepared. The Detroit-based auto company added that it was continuing to increase engine production, but felt confident about having \u201csufficient supply to service this recall campaign\" \u2014 noting that it only expects a small percentage to need replacements.",
      "Drivers can also confirm if their specific vehicle is included in this recall, and find more information, using the NHTSA site and/or GM's recall lookup.",
      "\u201cThe safety and satisfaction of our customers are the highest priorities for the entire GM team, and we\u2019re working to address this matter as quickly as possible,\u201d GM said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.",
      "An investigation by GM has found 28,102 complaints or incidents across the U.S. related to engine failure of these vehicles between April 2021 and February 2025, including 14,332 reports that alleged loss of propulsion, NHTSA documents note. The probe also identified alleged reports of 12 crashes and 12 injuries, as well as 42 fires \u2014 but noted that causes were not always clear and that \u201call specifically alleged injuries,\" for example, were \"minor or non-physical, and most were not crash related.\u201d",

      "As Trump's trade war locks the world\u2019s two largest economies on a collision course, America's unnerved allies and partners are cozying up with China to hedge their bets. It comes as Trump's trade push upends a decade of American foreign policy \u2014 including his own from his first term \u2014 toward rallying the rest of the world to join the United States against China. And it threatens to hand Beijing more leverage in any eventual dialogue with the U.S. administration.",
      "With Trump saying that countries are \u201ckissing my ass\u201d to negotiate trade deals on his terms or risk stiff import taxes, Beijing is reaching out to countries far and near.

It's lending urgency for both the U.S. and China to bolster support from alternate partners.",

      "A fear is that Trump\u2019s on-again-off-again tariffs may be pushing households and businesses to alter their spending and freeze plans for long-term investment because of how quickly conditions can change, seemingly by the hour.",
      "So far, economic reports seem to show the U.S. economy is still growing, though at a weaker pace. On Wednesday, economists expect a report to say U.S. economic growth slowed to a 0.8% annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from a 2.4% pace at the end of last year.",
      "Most reports so far have focused on data from before Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d on April 2, when he announced tariffs that could affect imports from countries worldwide. That could raise the stakes for upcoming reports on the U.S. job market, including Friday\u2019s, which will show how many workers employers hired during all of April.",
      "Economists expect it to show a slowdown in hiring down to 125,000 from 228,000 in March.",
      "The most jarring economic data recently have come from surveys showing U.S. consumers are getting much more pessimistic about the economy\u2019s future because of tariffs. The Conference Board\u2019s latest reading on consumer confidence is due on Tuesday.",
      "In the bond market, Treasury yields fell further. They\u2019ve been sinking since an unsettling, unusual spurt higher in yields earlier this month rattled both Wall Street and the U.S. government. That rise had suggested investors worldwide may have been losing faith in the U.S. bond market\u2019s reputation as a safe place to park cash.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury was steady at 4.21% early Tuesday.",
      "In other dealings, benchmark U.S. crude oil lost 54 cents to $61.51 per barrel. Brent crude gave up 51 cents to $64.28 per barrel.",
      "The U.S. dollar bought 142.49 Japanese yen, up from 142.02 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1387 from $1.1422.",

      "The Mercury had a good run with Taurasi and Griner.",
      "Taurasi staked her claim as one of the greatest players in women's basketball history since the Mercury selected her with the No. 1 overall pick of the 2004 WNBA draft. In the 20 years that followed, she racked up six Olympic gold medals, three league championships and numerous records before calling it a career earlier this year.",
      "The 6-foot-9 Griner was a force during her 11-year stay in the desert, throwing down dunks and swatting shots like no other player while helping the Mercury win their most recent championship, in 2014. She opted to test free agency and signed a one-year contract with the Dream, hoping to set herself up for a bigger contract when the league's new collective bargaining deal is in place next year.",
      "Those are two big holes to fill, but general manager Nick U\u2019Ren already had the wheels in motion to start the Mercury's new era.",
      "Phoenix first acquired Thomas in a trade with Connecticut, adding a veteran do-everything forward who's the WNBA\u2019s career leader with 15 triple-doubles. The 6-2 forward played her entire 11-year career with the Sun, leading them to the WNBA Finals in 2019 and 2022, and earned a gold medal at the Paris Olympics last summer.",
      "With Taurasi's retirement looming, Phoenix pulled off a three-way trade that brought Sabally to the desert. The 6-4 forward was an All-WNBA first-teamer in 2023, then averaged 17.9 points, 6.4 rebounds and 5.0 assists in a 2024 season limited to 15 games because of a shoulder injury.",
      "\u201cPushing through uncomfortable times really makes us stronger and we are the pros at pushing through adversity,\u201d Sabally said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been through a lot in my life, but it just really makes you appreciate times like this even more.\u201d",
      "Rounding out Phoenix's new Big Three is Kahleah Copper, a dynamic scorer and leader.",
      "The 6-1 small forward was a three-time All-Star with Chicago before being traded to Phoenix, where she had a massive impact in just one season.",
      "Copper was the WNBA's third-leading scorer at 21.1 points per game last season and became a leader on a team that already had two of the game's best players. She also has a WNBA title under her belt, helping the Sky beat the Mercury in the 2021 finals.",
      "Now that Taurasi and Griner are gone, Copper fully will take the reigns as the team's leader, pushing teammates new and old to continue the Mercury's long history of winning.",
      "\u201cI think you\u2019re really going to see her kind of like spread her wings and take pride,\u201d second-year Mercury coach Nate Tibbetts said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it this whole offseason, adding the free agents, and she\u2019s really kind of bought into what we\u2019re about.\u201d",
      "The Mercury had no choice but to take a new direction with Taurasi and Griner gone. They're hoping the new core can lead the franchise along the same winning direction.",

      "North Carolina football coach Bill Belichick defended girlfriend Jordon Hudson for interjecting during a CBS interviewer's questions about their relationship and said she was \u201csimply doing her job.\"",
      "The six-time Super Bowl-winning head coach and first-time college coach at UNC issued a statement through the school Wednesday, which followed an appearance on \u201cCBS News Sunday Morning\u201d to promote his upcoming book on his coaching life. In the interview, Hudson objected to a question about how the two had met while Tony Dokoupil referred to her during the segment as being a \u201cconstant presence\u201d in the interview.",
      "\u201cThe final eight-minute segment does not reflect the productive 35-minute conversation which we had, which covered a wide range of topics related to my career,\u201d Belichick said in his statement. \u201cInstead, it presents selectively edited clips and stills from just a few minutes of the interview to suggest a false narrative \u2014 that Jordon was attempting to control the conversation \u2014 which is simply not true.\"",
      "CBS spokesman Richard Huff didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "The awkward interview added to the attention and curiosity that has followed the 73-year-old Belichick, hired as the Tar Heels' head coach in December after his ultra-successful run with the New England Patriots, and the 24-year-old Hudson, who has frequently posted glimpses into their relationship with social media photos. That has included her role in Belichick's transition to college coaching, such as a March public records report by The Assembly about Belichick's request for an athletic official at UNC to copy in Hudson on emails sent to him.",
      "In his Wednesday statement, Belichick said he shares \u201cboth a personal and professional relationship\u201d with Hudson and that he expected the interview would focus solely on the book release instead of his personal life. He said Hudson had \u201cstepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion\" in an effort to \u201censure the interview stayed on track.\u201d",
      "He also said the couple has \u201cbeen open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- WNBA training camps just opened and there already are so many eyes on the 2026 season when more than 100 players will be free agents.",
      "Nearly all of the league\u2019s top players could be on the move, including 20 of last season\u2019s All-Stars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that the majority of veterans will be unrestricted free agents after this season based on current contracts. It\u2019s unclear if that will equate to a ton of player movement,\u201d Atlanta Dream general manager Dan Padover said. \u201cBut everything is set up that it could be the most player movement in WNBA history. I think every franchise is looking at it differently.",
      "\"Our most important priority is taking care of our Dream players in 2025 and beyond.\u201d",
      "Though teams and players say the focus now is winning a championship in 2025, the uncertainty of what \u201cbeyond\u201d looks like is keeping front office staff around the league up at night.",
      "\u201cEverything can change. It\u2019s kind of fascinating. we won\u2019t really know what the gameboard looks like until we get the new CBA,\u201d ESPN analyst Rebecca Lobo said. \u201cAny team could theoretically become a super team. It could be Golden State, it could Toronto or Portland in their first year. It could completely change the power dynamic as we see it.\u201d",
      "A\u2019ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart are among the star-studded group on one-year contracts knowing that a new collective bargaining agreement will hopefully be in place next season that is expected to monumentally increase salaries. The WNBA begins an 11-year $2.2 billion media rights deal in 2026 which is where the shift will come from.",
      "Most of the players who won't be free agents are the ones on rookie contracts \u2014 including Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. The pair, who were rookies last season, earn about $75,000 in base pay. Currently WNBA players can have a maximum base salary of $250,000.",
      "While there hasn't been a media rights deal like this in the WNBA's 28-year history, when the NBA had an exponential increase in its TV deal in 2016, that league's salary cap increased about 35%.",
      "It\u2019s not just increased salaries, however, that will entice free agents to move. Many of the players who changed teams this offseason cited practice facilities as a factor in choosing where they\u2019ll go.",
      "Currently Phoenix, Las Vegas, Golden State and Seattle have dedicated practice facilities for their WNBA teams while Minnesota and Washington share their facilities with NBA franchises. New York, Dallas, Chicago and Indiana have ones in the works.",
      "\u201cI think facilities are a huge piece of it,\u201d Lobo said. \u201cYou heard how much players talked about that with Vegas a few years ago. Players were posting about Phoenix\u2019s new facility at All-Star last year.\u201d",

His numbers soared with career-bests in points (14.1, more than double his 5.8 average last season), rebounds (5.9), assists (4.4), steals (a league-leading 3.0) and his field-goal shooting went from 43.5% in his first two seasons to 49.3% this year. The Hawks made him a full-time starter, something Daniels hadn\u2019t been with the Pelicans.",

    "story": [
      "The families of Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau are still grieving their deaths last August after they were hit by a suspected drunken driver in New Jersey on the eve of their sister's wedding",
      "WESTVILLE, N.J. -- The family called him John. It wasn\u2019t until John Gaudreau played for Boston College that he picked up the \u201cJohnny Hockey\u201d nickname that followed him through 11 seasons in the NHL.",
      "His mother, Jane, gleefully recalled the \u201cJohnny Hockey\u201d T-shirts and sing-song chants BC fans bestowed on their beloved wizard on the ice. At home in New Jersey, older brother Matthew, who also played hockey for Boston College, and sisters Kristen and Katie couldn\u2019t help but tease their brother with the nickname as his popularity and All-Star career grew through stops in Calgary and Columbus.",
      "Take one night during the NHL Awards in Las Vegas, just one family story out of thousands of favorites, when Gaudreau tried to keep a low public profile on a family outing. Katie wasn\u2019t having it out on the Strip, shouting for all to hear, \u201cJohnny! Johnny Hockey!\u201d",
      "\u201cI can see John\u2019s face getting redder and redder and redder,\u201d Jane Gaudreau said with a laugh. \u201cYou walk down the street and no one knows who you are until Katie started making this whole big thing.\u201d",
      "Everything was fine for the family when they gathered last August for Katie\u2019s wedding. John and Matt were the groomsmen and Kristen the maid of honor. What happened next, the typhoon of shock and grief that rippled from New Jersey through the heart of the hockey community, has been well-documented over the last eight months. The night before the wedding, John, 31, and Matt, 29, died after they were hit by a suspected drunken driver while riding bicycles in the Delaware River country south of Philadelphia, leaving a family forever shattered, with not enough time to ever fully pick up all the pieces.",
      "They try.",
      "From births to hockey tributes, through Instagram pages dotted with photos from the family scrapbook and a new foundation, to a playground fundraising effort at the family\u2019s beloved school, the Gaudreaus have pushed through dark days when even getting out of bed seemed impossible. They pull through, pull together, just as they did as a family of six in South Jersey, and try to focus on a simple mantra: Live their lives to the fullest in honor of Matt and John.",
      "There is more hardship ahead and dark days are going to come and go. The driver charged with killing the brothers, a man prosecutors described as having a history of alleged road rage and aggressive driving, still faces trial.",
      "But as Jane Gaudreau details her dream of a new, adaptive playground for the special education students at the school where she works, it\u2019s the good times that stir the most memories. Like when John playfully threatened to stab Katie with a fork at a restaurant for not finishing a stack of pancakes and surprisingly \u2014 and gently \u2014 followed through.",
      "It's the stories that lift the spirits of Jane, husband Guy and countless friends and teammates who went through their first hockey season in decades without two men who gave so much to their growing families and to the game.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to keep their memories alive,\u201d said their sister, Kristen Venello, who rocks her Blue Jackets hoodie as a speech assistant at Archbishop Damiano School. \u201cIt is sad. But you think about all the good things they did and that\u2019s all you can think about. And how much they can help us still.\u201d",
      "Archbishop Damiano School was founded in 1968 for children with Down syndrome and now provides services for 125 students with special needs from ages 3 to 21. Jane Gaudreau\u2019s brother attended the school and their mother worked there for 44 years. Jane was hired in 1984 and is still a finance associate there. Kristen, the oldest daughter, has taught at the school for almost two decades. Katie used to assist with the kids when she could and the two Gaudreau boys volunteered at the school when they weren\u2019t playing hockey.",
      "In death, they can perhaps leave a permanent legacy at Damiano outside family and hockey.",
      "Kelsie Snow lost her husband, Chris, a former assistant general manager with the Calgary Flames, in 2023 to Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. She called Jane with a suggestion on how to navigate life through perpetual grief: Keep busy. Find a project. Jane and Guy embraced the idea and searched for the right one, until they realized the answer was right there at Archbishop Damiano.",
      "The Gaudreaus and the staff at Archbishop Damiano threw themselves into fundraising for a modern playground that allows for everything from basic wheelchair accessibility to ramps and transfer platforms for the students. Students tacked their wish list for the playground -- wheelchair swings and even a sand box -- to the walls inside the school.",
      "The Gaudreau Family 5K set for May 31 is expected to bring needed cash to the initiative launched by principal Michele McCloskey in October 2020. Raising the necessary funds over the last five years had been a slow build. So many friends from the hockey world and others now inspired by the brothers and the cause have since rallied around the effort.",
      "\u201cI know the boys would be proud of us,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBoth boys loved children, that\u2019s why we thought the playground would be perfect.\u201d",
      "The Gaudreaus have another, more enduring project ahead of them as doting grandparents. Both widows have given birth since their husbands died. Meredith, who revealed during her tearful eulogy for John in August that she was pregnant, gave birth in April to the couple\u2019s third child, Carter Michael Gaudreau. Madeline delivered her and Matty\u2019s first baby, Tripp Matthew Gaudreau, in December.",
      "Jane laughs when she describes how much the new additions resemble their fathers. Tripp has light hair like his dad; Carter looks like big sister Noa, and they both look like John.",
      "\u201cMy husband keeps saying this,\u201d Jane said, \u201d\u2018I think God sent us John and Matty back.\u2018\u201d",
      "Guy Gaudreu, a former hockey coach at Hollydell Ice Arena and Gloucester Catholic High School in New Jersey, had his sons on the ice at 2 years old and he\u2019s already making plans for Carter and Tripp. Matthew played for the junior ice hockey Omaha Lancers for two years, and when the family was invited back last month for a tribute night, Guy amused the family as he gave baby Tripp an introduction.",
      "\u201cHe was like, smell the ice, this is the locker room,\u201d Jane said with a laugh. \u201cWe\u2019re used to that. He\u2019s just crazy like that. I was looking at (Madeline) and she was just laughing, shaking her head.\u201d",
      "The Gaudreaus have kept busy, with fundraising, teaching and various outings that celebrated their sons. Guy has perhaps been at the rink the most since losing the boys. He joined practices for the Blue Jackets and spent time as a guest instructor this season with the Flyers. He hit the ice in Montreal and helped out Team USA at the 4 Nations Face-Off. The Gaudreaus led the Blue Jackets out of the tunnel at Ohio Stadium in front of nearly 95,000 fans at the NHL Stadium Series.",
      "\u201cI know sometimes we\u2019ll hear people, oh, this poor family, they have to go through this again,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut it\u2019s been quite healing. Through this, I\u2019ve had so many people tell stories of what Matthew or John has done for them, or a hospital, or other people. They appreciate everything the boys did. They were grieving, too. It was a way for us to get out there and talk to people, hear different stories.\u201d",
      "Jane needed a gentle nudge from some Blue Jackets to attend the team\u2019s annual Moms\u2019 Trip to a February game at Detroit. Defenseman Erik Gudbranson surprised Jane with a persuasive call for her attend the annual bonding trip. The other Blue Jackets moms were so supportive of her on the trip, she said, \u201cthey knew if I was going to get upset before I even knew.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe needed her there,\u201d Gudbranson said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have felt right if she wasn\u2019t there.\u201d",
      "Sean Monahan and Gaudreau became tight when the stars played together in Calgary, one reason the Blue Jackets center was persuaded by his friend to sign with the team last summer.",
      "Monahan and his family settled near the Gaudreaus in the same Columbus suburb of New Albany, so close as neighbors Monahan counted just 25 steps between the two houses. After Gaudreau\u2019s death, Monahan couldn\u2019t even drive by his friend\u2019s house on his commute to the rink. He and his family have tried to serve as a steady source of support for Meredith and her three children. Monahan even met Carter Gaudreau the day he was born (\u201cgood looking little guy, just like John\u201d).",
      "The Blue Jackets dedicated the season to the Gaudreaus and raised John\u2019s No. 13 to the rafters. There\u2019s a patch on the jerseys and the Blue Jackets wore Avalon Surf Shop sweatshirts as part of their \u201cJohnny fit\u201d collection. The team never failed to hang Gaudreau\u2019s jersey in a locker stall for every game, home or away.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s supposed to be here with us,\u201d Monahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one other thing we can do to keep his name around, keep his legacy going for such a special person.\u201d",
      "Motivated by the memory of their friend, the Blue Jackets were in the hunt for a playoff spot until the final week of the season. They fell two points shy, leaving the team with a \u201cwhat if?\u201d feeling over missing the playoffs while hurting over Gaudreau.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that weighs on my mind and it\u2019s something I think about every day,\" Monahan said. \"There are no easy days, for sure. I try and live the way he did and it benefited me.\u201d",
      "Gudbranson also held Carter in the hospital and wrestled with the conflicting feelings of the joy over the birth with the sadness Gaudreau was not alive to meet his son.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a part of you that says this feels wrong that I\u2019m holding my buddy\u2019s son and he hasn\u2019t met him,\u201d Gudbranson said. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to wrap your head around. Those kids will probably be 30 years old and I\u2019ll be thinking the same thing. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going anywhere.\u201d",
      "Gudbranson said that in large part because of Gaudreau\u2019s influence, the season was a \u201ca lot more joyous this year. We\u2019ve enjoyed being teammates.\u201d When the good times were rolling, the Blue Jackets tried to appreciate those moments just like Gaudreau did, the franchise player who was just one of the boys once the final horn sounded.",
      "\u201cOnce the game was done, we were just buddies,\u201d Gudbranson said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t necessarily Johnny Hockey to us. The personal side matters to us the most. But yeah, we\u2019ve had conversations like, can you imagine if this guy was on our team this year? How good would he have been with us this year? Holy smokes.\u201d",
      "Guy and Jane, married 42 years, almost never go out to dinner, overwhelmed by feelings of guilt over enjoying themselves, and those emotions also run deep with Katie. She told her mom, yes, she wanted to marry her fianc\u00e9, Devin Joyce, but wasn\u2019t sure a big wedding was the way to go. Jane said she simply told her there was no wrong decision, but to let the rage and sadness settle and take as much time as necessary make a decision.",
      "The couple eventually rescheduled their wedding for July 11. Katie wrote on her Instagram post, \u201cI guess this year has taught me to celebrate our love everyday, every minute.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou know the boys, they\u2019ll be there with us that day,\u201d Jane said. \u201cThey would want you to have fun.\u201d",
      "Jane added with resolve, \u201cThis guy already took two of the most important things away from us. Don\u2019t let him take away your wedding.\u201d",
      "Katie reflected on that fateful night on an Instagram post how she had texted her fianc\u00e9 \u201cwe forgot to practice our dip,\u201d during rehearsal to how a \u201cphone call later, our lives would forever change.\u201d",
      "The couple will get a second chance at a wedding, this one in memory of their brothers.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ll all be able to get through the day,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI think it will be hard at first. We want to be there for her, support her. The other three had big weddings, it was so fun for our family to be together. I think it will be OK.\u201d",
      "The Gaudreaus want people to remember how the young men lived, not how they died. Sometimes that is difficult: In mid-April, there was a hearing for Sean Higgins, the man charged with reckless vehicular homicide in the Gaudreaus' deaths, only a few hours before the Blue Jackets played the Flyers nearby. The family skipped the game for the Gloucester Catholic High School Hall of Fame banquet where Matthew was posthumously inducted.",
      "The Gaudreaus have kept their thoughts about the court proceedings private, though Jane did write a pair of inspirational quotes on Instagram later that day, including one that said, \u201cWhen you have a bad day \u2014 a really bad day \u2014 try and treat the world better than it treated you.\u201d",
      "The 5K has filled its allotment of 1,000 runners for race day at a New Jersey park but anyone can contribute from home as a virtual participant. More than 700 people have already signed up, from New Jersey to Canada to Ireland, eager to help the cause, which includes an online memorabilia auction that stretches beyond hockey, with all proceeds donated toward the playground effort and its $600,000 goal.",
      "Jane, 62, said it\u2019s hard to remember much through the haze of heartbreak from the funeral and memorial reception, only that she figured more than 1,000 people stopped by the family home to pay their respects. With some distance, the family hoped it would be comforting to see everyone at the 5K and thank them for their love and comfort.",
      "The current playground doesn\u2019t meet the needs of its students in its current shape, there are gaping holes in the turf and the swings and slides were not designed for children with disabilities. If the goal is met, the school hopes to break ground this fall and complete the project next spring.",
      "\u201cAs a school for serving people with multiple disabilities, we really don\u2019t get a lot of traction,\u201d said McCloskey, the school principal. \u201cI think through all the media attention, I think people see it, they see why this is important.\u201d",
      "It seems trite to call it a silver lining but the family has searched in vain to find some meaning, some good out of the senseless deaths.",
      "So they\u2019ll run.",
      "For John. For Matt. For a cause the boys so robustly supported in life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the way I\u2019d want to build the playground, of course,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI tend to believe they\u2019ll be up there, being able to listen to the children\u2019s laughter. They\u2019ll just really love the fact that the children will have a playground to play in.\u201d",

    "summary": "Giannis Antetokounmpo had to have known the question was coming",
    "story": [
      "Giannis Antetokounmpo had to have known the question was coming",
      "Giannis Antetokounmpo had to have known the question was coming.",
      "\"Do you think that you can still win that second championship here in Milwaukee after a third straight first-round exit?\u201d",
      "The question came after the Bucks' season ended in Indianapolis on Tuesday night. Antetokounmpo is surely asking himself the same question right about now.",
      "Antetokounmpo didn't have a public answer for it following the 119-118 overtime, season-ending loss in Game 5 of Round 1 against Indiana. He probably doesn't have a private answer to it, either. But he needs that answer sometime over the coming days or weeks, because he is now officially at the crossroads that plenty of superstars have reached over the years.",
      "Stay or go?",
      "Yes, a fair question \u2014 though it's not really Antetokounmpo's decision. He's under contract to the Bucks for multiple seasons. Even if he asks for a trade, they don't have to accommodate him.",
      "It could be great for Antetokounmpo; he'd pick a new spot and that team would instantly be considered a title contender. It could be great for the Bucks; most teams after years of contending have to hit the reset button at some point anyway, and they could get a haul of players and picks to begin anew.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to do this. I\u2019m not going to do this,\" Antetokounmpo said in response to the question. \"I know ... whatever I say, I know how it\u2019s going to translate. I don\u2019t know, man. I wish I was still playing. I wish I was still competing and going back to Milwaukee. I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Here's what might figure into the answer, whenever the time comes to formulate the real one: His place in Milwaukee lore is secure, he's brought an NBA championship to the city, he won't have Damian Lillard for much if not all of next season because of Lillard's torn Achilles, his team just got eliminated in the first round for the third consecutive season and the Bucks aren't exactly loaded with draft picks or easy ways to bolster their roster.",
      "Antetokounmpo is in his prime. He's about to finish in the top four of the voting for the NBA MVP award \u2014 a trophy he's won twice \u2014 for the seventh consecutive year. He just averaged 30 points per game for the third year in a row, and if he had scored eight more measly points in the 2021-22 season it'd be four straight years of doing that. He just averaged at least 25 points and 10 rebounds for the eighth straight season; only Shaquille O'Neal, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone have more such seasons.",
      "Antetokounmpo will want more, whether he's in Milwaukee or elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of times that life has made me sad or frustrated since I was a kid. I never gave up,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"You know, I always try to find solutions in my life. I think it translates to the basketball court. I always try to, even though things might not happen the way I want it to happen. I always have class, and I have this optimistic mentality of coming back, keep on working. And there\u2019s going to be a day that\u2019s it going to be your turn.\u201d",
      "Moving someone with two years and $113 million left on his contract \u2014 not to mention a player option that could extend it by another year and tack $63 million more onto the bill \u2014 will be difficult. And players don\u2019t always get traded where they want to go; the obvious case in point there is when Lillard wanted to be traded by Portland to Miami and wound up in Milwaukee instead.",
      "But if it's what he wants, teams will jump at the chance to make it happen.",
      "\u201cGiannis is one of one,\u201d Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cI think, unfortunately for all the voters, they're tired of voting for him for stuff. But he had every bit of an MVP season this year. What I'm most proud of is he has turned into a leader. I'm not just talking about on the floor, but off the floor.\u201d",
      "Antetokounmpo has received tons of praise in recent years for the way he has sometimes given long, well-thought-out, from-the-heart answers to important questions in postgame news conferences. He handled a question about the postgame fracas that involved Indiana star Tyrese Haliburton's father essentially taunting Antetokounmpo on the court seconds after the final buzzer with his traditional grace and charm. It wasn't the first time Antetokounmpo found the right words in an important moment.",
      "Another important moment is here. Another big question. Stay or go?",

      "Hulk Hogan is helping to launch Real American Freestyle wrestling",
      "Hulk Hogan felt sure he was onto something.",
      "After watching the NCAA Division I wrestling championships, he was absolutely certain.",
      "Hogan is one of the most popular professional wrestlers of all time, and he stayed in that lane until his teenage stepson pulled him into watching freestyle wrestling. After becoming more familiar with it, Hogan started to believe the sport could become more popular and profitable with the right promotion.",
      "Then, it happened. Last month, Oklahoma State's Wyatt Hendrickson stunned Minnesota\u2019s Gable Steveson \u2014 an Olympic gold medalist in Tokyo \u2014 with a late takedown to claim the national title at heavyweight.",
      "Hendrickson saluted President Donald Trump after his victory last month in Philadelphia. Then, with a United States flag draped over his shoulders, the Air Force second lieutenant walked over and shook Trump\u2019s hand and hugged him.",
      "Hendrickson\u2019s dramatic win and the moments that followed vaulted freestyle wrestling into the mainstream and made the timing perfect for Hogan to help launch Real American Freestyle. He'll be commissioner of a league that announced its plans on Wednesday.",
      "Hogan wants the league to provide more earnings opportunities for a sport that historically has lacked them. And after Hendrickson's big moment, he feels the time is now.",
      "\u201cWhen I saw that happen and I saw our President hug him, I went, OK, we are on point, we\u2019re ready to go and instincts have prevailed and I smell victory,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cI think we\u2019re right on track, brother.\"",
      "Hogan, who at 71 still has those massive arms and the charisma to match, initially was a bit worried that the freestyle wrestlers might not have the personality to sell tickets. He changed his mind as he began to connect with them.",
      "\u201cDude, they\u2019ve all got that edge,\u201d he said. \u201cThese kids are young, they\u2019re smart. They\u2019re watching TV. They know about branding, they know what sells. And they\u2019ve all got that little Conor McGregor swag.\u201d",
      "Real American Freestyle events will feature single matches at eight men\u2019s and four women\u2019s weight classes. The first event is scheduled for Aug. 30 in Cleveland, with other sites to be named in the coming months.",
      "Freestyle wrestling has been hot in the United States in recent years. The women\u2019s U.S. Olympic freestyle team earned four medals in six weight classes in 2024, while the men claimed three medals. And according to the National Federation of High Schools, wrestling set participation records for boys and girls in 2023 and 2024.",
      "Hogan said Kennedy Blades, an American who earned a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, will be the face of the women\u2019s division. Zahid Valencia and Ben Askren have agreed to participate on the men\u2019s side.",
      "Hogan said Hendrickson and Steveson are possible additions, and his eyes lit up when the subject of a possible rematch came up.",
      "\u201cHow much can we say,\u201d Hogan asked his advisors. \u201cIt\u2019s on the radar.\u201d",
      "Hogan\u2019s Real American Beer serves as the title sponsor, and he has plenty of support. Chad Bronstein is the co-founder and president. Left Lane Capital, which has backed Gerard Piqu\u00e9\u2019s Kings League, Shaun White\u2019s Snow League and League One Volleyball, among other things, has added this to its list of ventures. Cassius is another sponsor.",
      "Hogan knows some fans will be shocked that his next step does not involve pro wrestling, but he\u2019s confident in his decision.",
      "\u201cThe idea was so exciting that I get a chance to be involved with all these young people and help guide them in any way, especially to make them huge stars and create a future for them,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople might be surprised, but wrestling is wrestling, brother.\u201d",
      "Because of name, image and likeness deals, college athletes will be able to participate, though Hogan said the league won\u2019t interfere with college, national and international competitions.",
      "Hogan did bring in one connection from his pro wrestling days. Eric Bischoff, who ran World Championship Wrestling in its heyday in the late 1990s and created the famous New World Order storyline, will be the chief media officer.",
      "\u201cEric jumped in with both feet, and he\u2019s doing a lot to guide this ship right now, brother,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cHe\u2019s setting so much stuff up production wise \u2014 just moving us forward, light years ahead of where we could have been on our own.\u201d",
      "Israel Martinez is the chief operating officer. He is an accomplished wrestling coach who has helped build champions in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). He was the wrestling coach for Jon Jones and he coached Holly Holm when she upset Ronda Rousey. Hogan said Martinez played a key role in getting USA Wrestling's blessing.",
      "Hogan considers the new league an alternative to pro wrestling.",
      "\u201cI see this as an opportunity for me to get involved,\" Hogan said, \"to get back, quit sitting on the couch, to get involved with a bunch of powerful athletes that I can relate to as far as championship material, guys that are on top of their game, and I just \u2014 I couldn\u2019t pass on it.\u201d",

It\u2019s the subject of a growing body of research that cites a constellation of characteristics: big hearts, immense lung capacity, robust musculoskeletal systems and long, thin legs \u2013 all of which helped horses survive in the wild.",
      "\u201cIt goes back to the roots: They are an animal of prey,\u201d said Farmer, a veterinarian and equine medical director at Churchill Downs Inc. \u201cThat\u2019s how they got away from being eaten.\u201d",
      "Horses honed skills such as running, jumping and pulling as humans bred and trained them for various purposes over millennia. And the 151st Derby \u2014 horse racing's most-watched event \u2014 will draw attention not only to the animals' skills, but also to concerns about their treatment and health. Advocates have long raised concerns about deaths and injuries \u2014 calls that were amplified two years ago, when 12 horses died at Churchill Downs.",
      "There's no doubt that war, agriculture and societies have been transformed by the human-horse relationship.",
      "\u201cHorses allowed us to circumvent our own biological limitations as a species,\u201d said Timothy Winegard, a historian at Colorado Mesa University and author of a recent book, \u201cThe Horse.\u201d \u201cWe combined our brains with the horses\u2019 size, strength, stamina and speed to form the most unstoppable animal coalition.\u201d",
      "A horse\u2019s heart and lungs are the source of its extraordinary power.",
      "The heart averages 10 to 12 pounds (4.5-5.4 kg), or about 1% of the animal\u2019s body weight, compared with half a percent for the typical human heart. Secretariat, the storied horse that won the Triple Crown in 1973, was found after his death to have a heart weighing more than 20 pounds (9.1 kg).",
      "Horse hearts are built for exertion. The average horse can go from a resting heart rate of about 34 beats per minute to 220 or 240 while racing \u2013 faster than a human heart during maximum exertion.",
      "\u201cOne thing that\u2019s really unique about horses is that they have an incredible capacity to move blood around their bodies -- their heart rate can go really high and still be safe,\u201d said University of Connecticut researcher Sarah Reed, editor in chief of the journal Animal Frontiers.",
      "They also have a lung capacity of 60 liters \u2013 10 times that of humans.",
      "\u201cThat massive lung field allows for oxygen to transfer from the air into their blood, which is vitally important for sustaining aerobic energy,\u201d Farmer said.",
      "Recent research in the journal Science found that a genetic mutation enables horses to avoid negative side effects of super high energy production.",
      "\u201cHorses are great athletes because they can deliver a lot of oxygen to their muscles \u2013 way more than an elite human can \u2014and by elite human, I mean Olympic athlete,\u201d said Gianni Castiglione, the study's co-author. \u201cThey have a bigger tank of gas and they have a more efficient engine \u2026 and this mutation is contributing to both of those things.\u201d",
      "Other aspects of a horse's biology enhance its abilities.",
      "Horses store extra red blood cells in their spleens. These cells are released to carry even more oxygen around the body during intense exertion.",
      "\u201cAdrenaline when exercising causes the spleen to release extra red blood cells into circulation,\u201d veterinarian Hilary Clayton said. \u201cWhat horses are doing is essentially \u2018blood doping\u2019 themselves.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, horses' brains allow them to process sensory information and react quickly. That\u2019s despite having frontal lobes, parts of the brain used for thought and planning that are proportionally smaller than those in humans.",
      "\u201cBrainwise, they\u2019re designed with a real desire to play and run independent of any fear,\u201d said Dr. Scott Bailey, a veterinarian at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky, a thoroughbred breeding farm where Secretariat is buried. Horses are also able to focus intently, which \u201cis really important for an athlete.\u201d",
      "Bone structure and musculature also help. The ligaments and tendons in their hind legs act like springs, Farmer said, helping propel them forward. Like other large prey animals, he added, they have \u201clong, thin legs that are meant to run.\u201d",
      "The adaptations that make horses faster also predispose them to injury, Reed said. Their skinny legs absorb the impact of each stride, she said, and over time the repetitive stress of racing and training can lead to deformation of tendons and ligaments.",
      "In 2023, deaths occurred not only at Churchill Downs, but other major racing venues, affecting public perceptions of the sport and sparking changes. Reviews found no single cause for the deaths. But for 2024, Churchill Downs upgraded equipment used on its dirt surface and added an equine safety and integrity veterinarian.",
      "In its annual report, the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority noted the steps being taken to reduce injuries and fatalities \u2014 expanded veterinary protocols, pre-race inspections and uniform medication oversight. And, it said, the rate of deaths at authority-accredited tracks dropped in 2024, by 27%.",
      "Experts say a healthy, safe environment brings out the best in a horse \u2014 but they still don't know what makes certain horses standouts at the race track.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cEvery thoroughbred owner is trying to match the genetics of the parents in order to make the horse with the greatest chance of winning.\u201d",
      "Breeding is only part of the equation, experts said; nurture, training and the horse-rider relationship also factor in. Each time a horse emerges seemingly out of nowhere to win the Kentucky Derby, Farmer is reminded of this.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be this star-studded bred horse that cost a million dollars at sale to come and win and be a great runner,\u201d he said, raising his voice slightly above the din of galloping hooves. \u201cThere are a lot of great horses.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "\u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d filmmaker Joseph Kosinski started dreaming up a movie about Formula One racing while watching \u201cDrive to Survive.\u201d",
      "\u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d filmmaker Joseph Kosinski came to Formula One like many Americans: \u201cDrive to Survive.\u201d",
      "In that popular Netflix series, he saw the potential for a cinematic event, full of immersive thrills, the high stakes of the competitive racing world and the idea that your teammate could be your greatest rival.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other sport that\u2019s quite like that,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cIt\u2019s ripe for drama.\u201d",
      "The movies have loved car racing since their earliest days, and the popularity of F1 has exploded in recent years. Giving it the \u201cTop Gun\u201d treatment made sense. But it would take nearly four years for that dream to become \u201cF1,\u201d which is speeding into movie theaters on June 27.",
      "It was a complex operation that would involve unprecedented coordination with the league, groundbreaking innovation in camera technology, and letting one of the biggest movie stars in the world, Brad Pitt, drive a real race car at 180 miles an hour on film. Many, many times.",
      "Hollywood, it turned out, was a little easier to convince to make the film than the league. By the time Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer approached them, Pitt had already agreed to star and they\u2019d decided to go with Apple to help make the movie at the level they needed, with the guarantee of a robust theatrical release (which Warner Bros. is handling). Then came the Formula One meeting.",
      "\u201cWhen you come in, the first thing they think is you\u2019re going to make them look bad,\u201d Bruckheimer said. \u201cI went through this with when I went to the Navy the first time on \u2018Top Gun.\u2019\u201d",
      "There were many concerns: About anything going wrong, accidents, and the question of the villain. But, the filmmakers explained, this story wasn\u2019t about a villain. It\u2019s a competition between two drivers \u2014 a younger driver (Damson Idris) and an older driver (Pitt) trying to make him better.",
      "Bruckheimer said it took almost a year to get the league on board, and then they had to go around to the individual teams to explain it to them as well. But once everyone bought in, they committed and opened their world to the filmmakers.",
      "\u201cThe amount of, let\u2019s say, conversations regarding things not related to the actual filmmaking has been massive just from a coordination point of view,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way we could have made this film without that partnership with Formula One.\u201d",
      "Among the things they got to do: Build a garage at the Grand Prix for their fictional team; Drive on the track during Grand Prix weekends in front of hundreds of thousands of spectators; Put their Formula One cars on the track with the film\u2019s cars (and drivers); Have Pitt and Idris stand at the end of the national anthem in both Silverstone and Abu Dhabi; And sit in on drivers meetings and technical briefings.",
      "\u201cIt was full-on integration of these two worlds coming together,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the film could have happened or look like it does without that partnership. I think you\u2019ll see the result of that on screen because you couldn\u2019t recreate what we were able to capture by doing it for real.\u201d",
      "In true \u201cTop Gun\u201d spirit, part of \u201cdoing it for real\u201d meant trying to create the experience in the driver seat for the audience. Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, who was involved in the film from the earliest days, told Kosinski that he\u2019d never seen a film that had really captured what it felt like to be in one of those cars.",
      "\u201cThese Formula One cars, they deal in grams,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cAdding 100 pounds of camera equipment works against the very thing you\u2019re trying to capture. It became a technical engineering project for a year to figure out how to get very tiny cameras that are IMAX quality onto one of these cars.\u201d",
      "During \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d they had six Sony cameras inside the cockpit. Here, engineers were able to slim those down to about a quarter of the size (he estimates a 10x10 cm cube). Panavision also developed a remote control that allowed director of photography Claudio Miranda to pivot the cameras left and right, which they didn\u2019t have on \u201cMaverick.\"",
      "They had 15 camera mounts built into the cars and were able to run up to four at a time keeping the weight penalty to a minimum, and the close-ups real.",
      "\u201cEvery time you see Brad or Damson\u2019s face, they\u2019re really driving that car,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cIt\u2019s not being driven for them.\u201d",
      "And once it was go-time on the tracks, it was a race against the clock.",
      "\u201cIt was a technical feat and an organizational feat,\u201d Bruckheimer said. \u201cYou get limited access and we\u2019d get in there between some of their qualifying laps and have eight minutes to get on the track and off the track. It\u2019s precision, you can\u2019t be at nine minutes.\u201d",
      "When Hamilton first saw some of their racing footage cut together, Kosinski got a confidence boost.",
      "\u201cHe smiled and said, \u2018It looks fast,\u2019\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, thank God.\u2019 If Lewis says that we\u2019re in a good place.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis movie needed an icon kind of at the center of it,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, complicated, expensive film. And I needed one of our, you know, top, top movie stars.\u201d",
      "Kosinski knew Pitt liked cars. About a decade ago he, Tom Cruise and Pitt actually developed a car movie that never came to be. Plus, he said, \u201cI just felt like it was a role that I always wanted to see him play.\u201d",
      "The character is fictional driver named Sonny Hayes who was \u201cthe greatest who never was.\u201d A phenomenon in the 1990s, he was destined to be the next world champion before an accident at a Grand Prix ends his Formula One career.",
      "\u201cNow he drives in every type of racing league you could imagine, but not Formula 1,\u201d Kosinski said, from Le Mans to swamp trucks. \u201cHe likes to challenge himself to a new racing league and master it, but then he walks away.\u201d",
      "The audience meets him driving the midnight shift at the Daytona 24 hour race where he meets his old teammate and now Formula One team owner (Javier Bardem) who asks him to come back to help them win one race to save them from being sold.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a story about a last place team, a group of underdogs, and Sonny Hayes in his later years having one more chance to do something he was never able to, which is win a race in F1,\u201d Kosinski said.",
      "After the pitch, they went to the racetrack with Hamilton and Pitt \u201cwas hooked.\u201d",
      "Pitt trained for three months before cameras started rolling to get used to the physical demands of the precision vehicles. He and his co-star really drove the cars at speeds up to 180 mph, and sometimes in front of a couple hundred thousand people.",
      "\u201cThe happiest day was when they said, \u2018OK, it\u2019s a wrap on driving,\u2019 and he (Brad) climbed out of the car,\u201d Bruckheimer said. \u201cThat was the best day for me because it is dangerous, it really is.\u201d",
      "The film, everyone has acknowledged, was enormously expensive. They had the advantage of advertising on the cars, which helped offset some of the costs, but the operation was akin to building a real F1 team, Bruckheimer said. They built six cars, which they transported all around the world along with production.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like an army exercise moving vast groups of people and machinery around the world,\u201d Bruckheimer said.",
      "But it was much less than the $300 million figure going around, both Kosinski and Bruckheimer said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s expensive, don\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s an expensive movie. But it was substantially lower than that number,\u201d Bruckheimer said. \u201cHollywood is a very competitive place, and our friends sometimes inflate our budgets to make them look better.\u201d",
      "The biggest question is whether audiences will turn out in blockbuster numbers. So far, test scores have been very high across genders. And they promise you don\u2019t need to be an expert or even a fan of the sport to enjoy the film, which will teach you everything you need to know.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s emotional, it\u2019s exciting, it has humor. It\u2019s got great music with a Hans Zimmer score and a bunch of phenomenal artists,\u201d Bruckheimer said. \u201cWe hope it\u2019s a perfect summer movie.\"",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Jannik Sinner considered taking an extended break from tennis earlier this year before he accepted a three-month ban in a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency.",
      "Asked during an interview with Italian state TV RAI if he ever thought about dropping everything, the top-ranked Sinner replied, \u201cYes.",
      "\u201cI remember before the Australian Open this year, it wasn't a very happy time,\u201d Sinner added. \u201cI didn\u2019t really feel comfortable in the locker room, where we were eating. Players were looking at me differently. I said to myself, \u2018Maybe I need to take some time off after Australia.\u2019 I didn't want (the ban) though.\"",
      "Sinner won his second straight Australian Open title in January.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until February that the settlement was made in the doping case, after WADA appealed a decision last year by the International Tennis Integrity Agency to fully exonerate Sinner for what it deemed to be an accidental contamination by a banned anabolic steroid in March, 2024.",
      "\u201cI had a tough time accepting these three months. Because I knew that I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. So why do I have to pay this price?\u201d Sinner said. \u201cBut then we discussed it with my lawyer and about what could have happened in the worst-case scenario and so we decided to accept it.\u201d",
      "The handling of Sinner\u2019s case had raised questions about double standards. The positive tests weren\u2019t publicly revealed until August because Sinner successfully appealed against being provisionally banned from playing. He then won the U.S. Open in September.",
      "The settlement also raised questions, since it conveniently allows Sinner to return next week at the Italian Open \u2014 his home tournament \u2014 and not miss any Grand Slams.",
      "\u201cThe last year was definitely very stressful,\u201d Sinner said in the interview, which was broadcast late Tuesday. \u201cBut we were still able to obtain incredible results. We started this year really well, too. Then what happened happened. At the start it was a bit strange to find myself in that situation. Also, a lot of things happened off the court that I didn\u2019t expect.\u201d",
      "Several top players suggested that Sinner was treated too lightly.",
      "\"I don't even want to respond. Everyone is free to say what they want. For me, the important thing is that I know what happened,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cI don\u2019t wish it upon anyone who is innocent to go through what I went through.\u201d",
      "Despite having played just one tournament this year, Sinner held on to his top ranking during his ban because No. 2 Alexander Zverev and No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz didn\u2019t win enough when he was out to overtake him.",
      "\u201cI miss the competition,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that this period is done and I\u2019m ready to play again.\u201d",

      "The transformation of Bod\u00f8/Glimt from an unheralded Norwegian team located inside the Arctic Circle to one of the fairytale stories of European soccer has been underpinned by a fighter pilot who developed mental techniques for his squadron before bombi...",
      "How did an unheralded Norwegian team from a tiny town north of the Arctic Circle become one of the fairytale stories of European soccer?",
      "For Bod\u00f8/Glimt, the transformation has been underpinned by a fighter pilot who developed mental techniques for his squadron before bombing missions in Libya.",
      "Bj\u00f8rn Mannsverk discovered a group of players exuding negative energy and prone to \u201ca collective mental breakdown\u201d when he was asked in early 2017 to join the backroom staff of a team that had just been relegated to Norway\u2019s second tier.",
      "His task as \u201cmental coach\u201d at Bod\u00f8/Glimt? To make players talk openly about their feelings, lower stress levels, change their attitudes and routines about things like preparation and nutrition, and remove the stigma around mental training.",
      "Winning or losing no longer mattered. It was all about following a philosophy and culture established by Mannsverk, a former Royal Norwegian air force squadron leader whose military duties took him to Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks and to Libya for a NATO-led intervention in 2011.",
      "The results have been extraordinary.",
      "After securing an immediate return to Norway\u2019s top division, the team \u2014 based more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) north of Oslo in a fishing town, Bod\u00f8, with a population of around 55,000 \u2014 has captured four of the country's last five league titles. It started in 2020 with a first in the history of a club founded in 1916.",
      "Bod\u00f8/Glimt has also had some big results in Europe in recent seasons \u2014 a 6-1 thrashing of Jose Mourinho\u2019s Roma in the Conference League 2021 stands out \u2014 and this year it has become the first Norwegian club to reach the semifinals of a major European competition.",
      "The first leg against Tottenham in the Europa League takes place in London on Thursday. It\u2019s Bod\u00f8/Glimt\u2019s biggest ever match.",
      "\u201cIt is a fairy tale, almost a miracle,\u201d Mannsverk told The Associated Press in a video interview. \u201cHow can you actually come from (Norway's) second division in 2017 to playing a Champions League playoff and teams like Arsenal five years later?",
      "\u201cBut I think it\u2019s possible ... if you have the right mentality and you work hard over time.\u201d",
      "An active air force pilot for more than 20 years, Mannsverk and others in his squadron were the subjects of a mental training project in 2010 where the focus was on meditation and \u201cevery day repeating boring stuff, but with 100% attention.\u201d",
      "It meant that when he was in Libya the following year, he had the mental capacity to handle the dangerous missions he was asked to perform. His squadron\u2019s mantra \u2014 \u201ctrain as you intend to fight\u201d \u2014 worked.",
      "\u201cEven though I got strong feelings when my first bombs hit the target and it was in infernal flames and fragments and everything,\" he said, \"it was like, \u2019My training said that it\u2019s OK, this is happening, recognize that, but know I have to return and do my job.'\u201d",
      "With Bod\u00f8 until recently having a NATO air base, it was simply a happy coincidence that Bod\u00f8/Glimt\u2019s leadership came across members of the squadron at the same time as it was seeking a \u201csilver bullet\u201d \u2014 as Mannsverk put it \u2014 to improve the team\u2019s mental conditioning.",
      "A project was born and fully embraced by manager Kjetil Knutsen following his appointment in 2018.",
      "Bod\u00f8/Glimt has never looked back.",
      "Mannsverk\u2019s fingerprints are all over the team\u2019s behavior, though he acknowledges there has been such a buy-in by the players that they now take decisions by themselves.",
      "Like having a rotating cast of eight captains to share leadership duties. Like when the players gather into a circle \u2014 Mannsverk calls it the \u201cBod\u00f8/Glimt Ring\u201d \u2014 after conceding a goal to discuss what happened and maintain solidarity. Like the players having no specific targets, apart from being the best version of themselves.",
      "Inge Henning Andersen, Bod\u00f8/Glimt\u2019s chairman, told the AP that midfielder Ulrik Saltnes considered retiring because he used to suffer from stress-related stomach issues that flared up around matches. Saltnes opened up about his problems to Mannsverk and \u201cfinally found a way out of it,\u201d Andersen said.",
      "The team plays at an intensity that far exceeds its rivals, which players attribute to Mannsverk.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be possible to play like that without Bj\u00f8rn and the mental work we do,\u201d Saltnes once told the BBC.",
      "This season\u2019s Europa League campaign is giving Bod\u00f8/Glimt widespread attention, notably for its location. The team\u2019s Aspmyra stadium \u2014 with a capacity of less than 9,000 \u2014 is one of the most northernly in world soccer at 67 degrees latitude. Tourists have long come to the town on the tip of Norway\u2019s west coast because it is a good spot to see the northern lights.",
      "Bod\u00f8, named the European Capital of Culture in 2024, has less than an hour of sunlight during its shortest days, meaning players take supplements to combat a lack of sunlight. It can be bitterly cold and windy in the long winters, making for tough trips for opponents from other countries.",
      "On paper, Tottenham, one of the world\u2019s richest clubs, starts as a huge favorite against Bod\u00f8/Glimt. The crowd at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday will be bigger than Bod\u00f8's population.",
      "Yet the English club is having one of its worst seasons in a generation and currently lies in 16th place in the 20-team Premier League. It gives Bod\u00f8/Glimt a realistic shot at an upset, like it produced when getting past Italian team Lazio in the quarterfinals.",
      "Another chance, then, for the club to write another amazing chapter in its remarkable journey.",
      "\u201cWe like to tell our story,\u201d Mannsverk said. \u201cThe philosophy is a good thing. We know it\u2019s difficult in football, where there\u2019s so much money involved, to give a coach or a team the time. And it takes time to change and drill in the mentality.",
      "\u201cThis was not done overnight ... but I\u2019m totally convinced that it will work more or less all over.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Conservative activist Robby Starbuck has filed a defamation lawsuit against Meta alleging that the social media giant's artificial intelligence chatbot spread false statements about him, including that he participated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Starbuck, known for targeting corporate DEI programs, said he discovered the claims made by Meta's AI in August 2024, when he was going after \u201cwoke DEI\u201d policies at motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson.",
      "\u201cOne dealership was unhappy with me and they posted a screenshot from Meta\u2019s AI in an effort to attack me,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cThis screenshot was filled with lies. I couldn\u2019t believe it was real so I checked myself. It was even worse when I checked.\u201d",
      "Since then, he said he has \u201cfaced a steady stream of false accusations that are deeply damaging to my character and the safety of my family.\u201d",
      "The political commentator said he was in Tennessee during the Jan. 6 riot. The suit, filed in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, seeks more than $5 million in damages.",
      "In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Meta said that \u201cas part of our continuous effort to improve our models, we have already released updates and will continue to do so.\u201d",
      "Starbuck's lawsuit joins the ranks of several other similar cases in which people have sued AI platforms over information provided by chatbots. In 2023, a conservative radio host in Georgia filed a defamation suit against OpenAI alleging ChatGPT provided false information by saying he defrauded and embezzled funds from the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights group.",
      "When Starbuck discovered the claims made by Meta's AI, he tried to alert the company about the error and enlist its help to address the problem. The complaint said Starbuck contacted Meta\u2019s managing executives and legal counsel, and even asked its AI about what should be done to address the allegedly false outputs.",
      "According to the lawsuit, he then asked Meta to \"retract the false information, investigate the cause of the error, implement safeguards and quality control processes to prevent similar harm in the future, and communicate transparently with all Meta AI users about what would be done.\u201d",
      "The filing alleges that Meta was unwilling to make those changes or \u201ctake meaningful responsibility for its conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, it allowed its AI to spread false information about Mr. Starbuck for months after being put on notice of the falsity, at which time it \u2018fixed\u2019 the problem by wiping Mr. Starbuck\u2019s name from its written responses altogether,\u201d the suit said.",
      "Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, responded to a video Starbuck posted to X outlining the lawsuit and called the situation \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is clearly not how our AI should operate,\" Kaplan said on X. \"We\u2019re sorry for the results it shared about you and that the fix we put in place didn\u2019t address the underlying problem.\u201d",
      "Kaplan said he is working with Meta's product team to \u201cunderstand how this happened and explore potential solutions.\u201d",
      "Starbuck said that in addition to falsely saying he participated in the the riot at the U.S. Capitol, Meta AI also falsely claimed he engaged in Holocaust denial, and said he pleaded guilty to a crime despite never having been \u201carrested or charged with a single crime in his life.\u201d",
      "Meta later \u201cblacklisted\u201d Starbuck's name, he said, adding that the move did not solve the problem because Meta includes his name in news stories, which allows users to then ask for more information about him.",
      "\u201cWhile I\u2019m the target today, a candidate you like could be the next target, and lies from Meta\u2019s AI could flip votes that decide the election,\u201d Starbuck said on X. \u201cYou could be the next target too.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been telling our stories as long as time immemorial,\u201d said Picuris Lt. Gov. Craig Quanchello. But he said those traditions were often \"overlooked and erased.\"",
      "As members of the Picuris Pueblo seek a greater voice in shaping decisions about the future of Chaco Canyon, where debates about oil and gas drilling loom, leaders including Quanchello decided that using DNA sequencing to complement or corroborate their oral histories could be a useful tool. The group began a collaboration with an international team of geneticists.",
      "\"The DNA could help us protect\" our heritage, he said. \"Now we can say, \u2018This is ours, we need to protect it.\u2019\"",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, show close links between the genomes of 13 current members of Picuris and ancient DNA recovered from 16 Picuris individuals who lived between 1300 A.D. and 1500 A.D. in or near Chaco Canyon.",
      "Today the members of Picuris Pueblo live about 170 miles west of Chaco Canyon, between Santa Fe and Taos.",
      "\u201cThe results show a strong relationship between ancient and present-day Picuris,\u201d said co-author Thomaz Pinotti, a geneticist at the University of Copenhagen.",
      "The genetic analysis was led by the Picuris. The researchers said this model of collaboration contrasts with a long history of archaeologists and geneticists seizing and studying artifacts and remains without the consent of Indigenous groups.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision\u201d to begin the collaboration with scientists, said co-author and Picuris Gov. Wayne Yazza. \u201cThis is life-changing data.\u201d",
      "There are 19 Pueblo tribes in New Mexico. The new study does not refute the historic connections of other tribes to Chaco Canyon.",
      "Chaco Culture National Historical Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site managed by the U.S. National Park Service. It is famous for sweeping desert vistas and for monumental sandstone structures \u2014 including multistory homes and ceremonial structures \u2014 built by ancestral Pueblos.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s super important that we don\u2019t talk about Chaco in the category of \u2018lost civilizations,\u2019 like the Egyptian pyramids or Stonehenge,\u201d said Paul Reed, a preservation archaeologist at Archaeology Southwest, who was not involved in the study. That notion \"is particularly damaging in this instance because it disenfranchises the Pueblo people who live all around the canyon to this day.\u201d",
      "Brian Vallo, a member of the Acoma Pueblo who leads the Chaco Heritage Tribal Association, said a current concern revolves around drilling and mining permits on federal land adjacent to the park, which also impact the environment within the canyon.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government has issued a new policy for terminating international students' legal status",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government has begun shedding new light on a crackdown on international students, spelling out how it targeted thousands of people and laying out the grounds for terminating their legal status.",
      "The new details emerged in lawsuits filed by some of the students who suddenly had their status canceled in recent weeks with little explanation.",
      "In the past month, foreign students around the U.S. have been rattled to learn their records had been removed from a student database maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some went into hiding for fear of deportation or abandoned their studies to return home.",
      "On Friday, after mounting court challenges, federal officials said the government was restoring international students' legal status while it developed a framework to guide future terminations. In a court filing Monday, it shared the new policy: a document issued over the weekend with guidance on a range of reasons students' status can be canceled, including the revocation of the visas they used to enter the U.S.",
      "Brad Banias, an immigration attorney representing a student whose status was terminated, said the new guidelines vastly expand ICE's authority beyond previous policy, which did not count visa revocation as grounds for losing legal status. In the past, if a student had their visa revoked, they could stay in the U.S. to finish their studies \u2014 they simply would not be able to reenter if they left the country.",
      "\u201cThis just gave them carte blanche to have the State Department revoke a visa and then deport those students even if they\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d Banias said.",
      "Many of the students who had visas revoked or lost their legal status said they had only minor infractions on their record, including traffic violations. Some did not know why they were targeted at all.",
      "Lawyers for the government provided some explanation at a hearing Tuesday in the case of Banias' client Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems in Texas. Patel's status was terminated \u2014 and then reinstated \u2014 this month, and he is seeking a preliminary court ruling to keep him from being deported.",
      "In court filings and in the hearing, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run database that contains reams of information related to crimes. It includes the names of suspects, missing persons and people who have been arrested, even if they have never been charged with a crime or had charges dropped.",
      "In total, about 6,400 students were identified in the database search, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said in the hearing Tuesday. One of the students was Patel, who had been pulled over and charged with reckless driving in 2018. The charge was ultimately dropped \u2014 information that is also in NCIC.",
      "Patel appears in a spreadsheet with 734 students whose names had come up in NCIC. That spreadsheet was forwarded to a Homeland Security official, who, within 24 hours of receiving it, replied: \u201cPlease terminate all in SEVIS.\u201d That's a different database listing foreigners who have legal status as students in the U.S.",
      "Reyes said the short time frame suggested that no one had reviewed the records individually to find out why the students' names came up in NCIC.",
      "\u201cAll of this could have been avoided if someone had taken a beat,\u201d said Reyes, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. She said the government had demonstrated \u201can utter lack of concern for individuals who have come into this country.\u201d",
      "When colleges discovered the students no longer had legal status, it prompted chaos and confusion. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.",
      "In some cases this spring, colleges told students to stop working or taking classes immediately and warned them they could be deported.",
      "Still, government attorneys said the change in the database did not mean the students actually lost legal status, even though some of the students were labeled \u201cfailure to maintain status.\u201d Instead, lawyers said, it was intended to be an \u201cinvestigative red flag.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Patel is lawfully present in the U.S.,\u201d Andre Watson of the Department of Homeland Security said. \u201cHe is not subject to immediate detention or removal.\u201d",
      "Reyes declined to issue a preliminary injunction and urged lawyers from both sides to come to a settlement to ensure Patel could stay in the U.S.",

      "Japan\u2019s top automaker Toyota has announced a partnership with U.S. autonomous driving technology company Waymo",
      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s top automaker Toyota announced a partnership with U.S. autonomous driving technology company Waymo on Wednesday.",
      "The move was somewhat anticipated, as the use of such technology speeds up around the world, and Toyota Motor Corp. has been aggressive about its intention to stay on top of such advances.",
      "\u201cToyota is committed to realizing a society with zero traffic accidents and becoming a mobility company that delivers mobility for all. We share a strong sense of purpose and a common vision with Waymo in advancing safety through automated driving technology,\u201d Toyota Executive Vice President Hiroki Nakajima said in a statement.",
      "Waymo, which started out as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, now offers fully autonomous ride-hailing services in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles and Austin, and is rolling them out in other U.S. cities. It also has a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "Toyota has built a city, complete with streets and housing, near Mount Fuji called Woven City to test robotics, artificial intelligence and autonomous zero-emissions transportation. The maker of the Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models tends to be very cautious about rolling out auto technology, seeking to protect its reputation as a safe and environmentally conscious manufacturer.",
      "Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO at Waymo, said partners were key to winning trust.",
      "\u201cThis requires global partners like Toyota that share our commitment to improving road safety and expanding accessible transportation,\u201d Mawakana said.",
      "Details of the terms of the deal were not disclosed. Both sides said they were still exploring how their collaboration might develop into actual products.",
      "Although there are various test versions of fully autonomous vehicles in Japan, they are for now limited to certain restricted areas. Other companies and automakers are working on similar services, including public transportation.",

      "In the White House and the Republican-led Congress, \"woke AI\u201d has replaced harmful algorithmic discrimination as a problem that needs fixing. Past efforts to \u201cadvance equity\u201d in AI development and curb the production of \u201charmful and biased outputs\u201d are a target of investigation, according to subpoenas sent to Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and 10 other tech companies last month by the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "And the standard-setting branch of the U.S. Commerce Department has deleted mentions of AI fairness, safety and \u201cresponsible AI\u201d in its appeal for collaboration with outside researchers. It is instead instructing scientists to focus on \u201creducing ideological bias\u201d in a way that will \u201cenable human flourishing and economic competitiveness,\u201d according to a copy of the document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "In some ways, tech workers are used to a whiplash of Washington-driven priorities affecting their work.",
      "But the latest shift has raised concerns among experts in the field, including Harvard University sociologist Ellis Monk, who several years ago was approached by Google to help make its AI products more inclusive.",
      "Back then, the tech industry already knew it had a problem with the branch of AI that trains machines to \u201csee\u201d and understand images. Computer vision held great commercial promise but echoed the historical biases found in earlier camera technologies that portrayed Black and brown people in an unflattering light.",
      "\u201cBlack people or darker skinned people would come in the picture and we\u2019d look ridiculous sometimes,\u201d said Monk, a scholar of colorism, a form of discrimination based on people\u2019s skin tones and other features.",
      "Google adopted a color scale invented by Monk that improved how its AI image tools portray the diversity of human skin tones, replacing a decades-old standard originally designed for doctors treating white dermatology patients.",
      "\u201cConsumers definitely had a huge positive response to the changes,\u201d he said.",
      "Now Monk wonders whether such efforts will continue in the future. While he doesn't believe that his Monk Skin Tone Scale is threatened because it's already baked into dozens of products at Google and elsewhere \u2014 including camera phones, video games, AI image generators \u2014 he and other researchers worry that the new mood is chilling future initiatives and funding to make technology work better for everyone.",
      "\u201cGoogle wants their products to work for everybody, in India, China, Africa, et cetera. That part is kind of DEI-immune,\" Monk said. \u201cBut could future funding for those kinds of projects be lowered? Absolutely, when the political mood shifts and when there\u2019s a lot of pressure to get to market very quickly.\u201d",
      "Trump has cut hundreds of science, technology and health funding grants touching on DEI themes, but its influence on commercial development of chatbots and other AI products is more indirect. In investigating AI companies, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, chair of the judiciary committee, said he wants to find out whether former President Joe Biden's administration \u201ccoerced or colluded with\" them to censor lawful speech.",

      "The Trump administration declined to make Kratsios available for an interview but quoted several examples of what he meant. One was a line from a Biden-era AI research strategy that said: \u201cWithout proper controls, AI systems can amplify, perpetuate, or exacerbate inequitable or undesirable outcomes for individuals and communities.\u201d",
      "Even before Biden took office, a growing body of research and personal anecdotes was attracting attention to the harms of AI bias.",
      "One study showed self-driving car technology has a hard time detecting darker-skinned pedestrians, putting them in greater danger of getting run over. Another study asking popular AI text-to-image generators to make a picture of a surgeon found they produced a white man about 98% percent of the time, far higher than the real proportions even in a heavily male-dominated field.",
      "Face-matching software for unlocking phones misidentified Asian faces. Police in U.S. cities wrongfully arrested Black men based on false face recognition matches. And a decade ago, Google\u2019s own photos app sorted a picture of two Black people into a category labeled as \u201cgorillas.\u201d",
      "Even government scientists in the first Trump administration concluded in 2019 that facial recognition technology was performing unevenly based on race, gender or age.",
      "Biden's election propelled some tech companies to accelerate their focus on AI fairness. The 2022 arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT added new priorities, sparking a commercial boom in new AI applications for composing documents and generating images, pressuring companies like Google to ease its caution and catch up.",
      "Then came Google's Gemini AI chatbot \u2014 and a flawed product rollout last year that would make it the symbol of \u201cwoke AI\u201d that conservatives hoped to unravel. Left to their own devices, AI tools that generate images from a written prompt are prone to perpetuating the stereotypes accumulated from all the visual data they were trained on.",
      "Google's was no different, and when asked to depict people in various professions, it was more likely to favor lighter-skinned faces and men, and, when women were chosen, younger women, according to the company's own public research.",
      "Google tried to place technical guardrails to reduce those disparities before rolling out Gemini's AI image generator just over a year ago. It ended up overcompensating for the bias, placing people of color and women in inaccurate historical settings, such as answering a request for American founding fathers with images of men in 18th century attire who appeared to be Black, Asian and Native American. Google quickly apologized and temporarily pulled the plug on the feature, but the outrage became a rallying cry taken up by the political right.",
      "With Google CEO Sundar Pichai sitting nearby, Vice President JD Vance used an AI summit in Paris in February to decry the advancement of \u201cdownright ahistorical social agendas through AI,\u201d naming the moment when Google\u2019s AI image generator was \u201ctrying to tell us that George Washington was Black, or that America\u2019s doughboys in World War I were, in fact, women.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to remember the lessons from that ridiculous moment,\u201d Vance declared at the gathering. \"And what we take from it is that the Trump administration will ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias and never restrict our citizens\u2019 right to free speech.\u201d",
      "A former Biden science adviser who attended that speech, Alondra Nelson, said the Trump administration's new focus on AI's \u201cideological bias\u201d is in some ways a recognition of years of work to address algorithmic bias that can affect housing, mortgages, health care and other aspects of people's lives.",
      "\u201cFundamentally, to say that AI systems are ideologically biased is to say that you identify, recognize and are concerned about the problem of algorithmic bias, which is the problem that many of us have been worried about for a long time,\u201d said Nelson, the former acting director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy who co-authored a set of principles to protect civil rights and civil liberties in AI applications.",
      "But Nelson doesn't see much room for collaboration amid the denigration of equitable AI initiatives.",
      "\u201cI think in this political space, unfortunately, that is quite unlikely,\u201d she said. \u201cProblems that have been differently named \u2014 algorithmic discrimination or algorithmic bias on the one hand, and ideological bias on the other \u2014- will be regrettably seen us as two different problems.\u201d",

      "People with diseases caused by rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than other patients despite rapid recent advancements in the growing field of genetic science",
      "Emily Kramer-Golinkoff can\u2019t get enough oxygen with each breath. Advanced cystic fibrosis makes even simple things like walking or showering arduous and exhausting.",
      "She has the most common fatal genetic disease in the U.S., which afflicts 40,000 Americans. But her case is caused by a rare genetic mutation, so medications that work for 90% of people with cystic fibrosis won\u2019t help her.",
      "The same dynamic plays out in other genetic conditions. Stunning advances in genetic science have revealed the subtle, insidious culprits behind these brutal diseases and have started paving the way for treatments. But patients with these exceedingly rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than those with more typical forms of these diseases \u2014 and many are now pinning hopes on experimental gene therapies.",
      "\u201cWe feel such pure joy for our friends who have been lifted from this sinking ship,\u201d said Kramer-Golinkoff, 40. \u201cBut we just feel so eager and desperate to join them. It\u2019s really hard to be in this minority of people left behind.\u201d",
      "It's not just science that is working against these patients, it's market forces. Drug companies are naturally going to look for medications that target the most common mutations.",
      "\u201cYou need a sufficiently large number of patients in a major market in order for a company to be interested in going forward,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert. What it amounts to, he says, is \"mutational discrimination.\u201d",
      "Charities \u2013 including a nonprofit Kramer-Golinkoff co-founded called Emily\u2019s Entourage \u2013 are trying to overcome this barrier. Fundraising efforts have helped jump-start gene therapy that could help patients regardless of mutation.",
      "While it likely won't be available for years, \u201cjust to have these therapies in trials provides so much hope,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff was just six weeks old when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body.",
      "It occurs when the so-called CFTR protein is not made or not made correctly, allowing chloride to become trapped in cells, meaning water can't keep the cell's surface hydrated. Mucus buildup can lead to damage, blockages and infections in the lungs and other affected organs.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older \u2026 my CF has gotten worse, despite all my best efforts to delay it,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Before her illness got so bad, she was able to earn a master\u2019s degree in bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, work, travel and spend time with friends. But she eventually developed CF-related diabetes and other problems. She\u2019s prone to infections, and since the pandemic has lived with her parents in isolation in Greater Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cCF is a real monster of a disease,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, others with the condition have seen vast improvements in their health with \u201cCFTR modulator\u201d therapies that work for people with the most common mutation, correcting the malfunctioning protein. Research shows they dramatically improve lung function, respiratory symptoms and patients\u2019 overall quality of life.",
      "Besides not working for people with rare mutations, these treatments are unavailable to patients whose disease-causing mutations aren't known or fully understood. Mutations may be unknown because of a lack of genetic testing in places such as developing nations, or understudied because they are uncommon or difficult to detect.",
      "Genetic testing companies such as GeneDx have made some headway in screening more people of diverse backgrounds, but inequities remain.",
      "For example, comprehensive data about cystic fibrosis is scarce among African populations \u2013 affecting people who live on the continent as well as those who trace their ancestry there. Research shows Black cystic fibrosis patients are more likely than their white counterparts to be among the 10% who don\u2019t benefit from modulator therapies.",
      "While there\u2019s little chance of changing market dynamics, researchers said, one solution is to develop \u201cmutation agnostic\u201d gene therapies targeting all patients with a disease. This approach is being tried in diseases of the retina as well as cystic fibrosis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge push to develop these therapies,\" said Dr. Garry Cutting of the Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis Center.",
      "Most of the 14 experimental gene therapies in the pipeline for the disease aim to help patients with any mutation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation says, delivering a new, correct version of the CFTR gene to cells. Getting correct copies of the CFTR gene would enable cells to make normal proteins no matter what mutation causes a patient to have no, or not enough, functional CFTR proteins.",
      "One treatment, partially funded by the foundation, is sponsored by Spirovant Sciences, a company Emily\u2019s Entourage provided seed money to launch. The first patient received the therapy in November in a 53-week clinical trial at Columbia University that aims to determine if it's safe and how long it stays in the lung.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff said she\u2019s more optimistic about her future these days, even as her own illness worsens. At this point, she\u2019s living with 30% lung function, suffers from kidney issues and has high blood pressure in her lungs. She depends on insulin for her diabetes and takes numerous pills daily.",
      "\u201cYou have to make really conscientious choices ... throughout the day on how to use your limited energy. And that\u2019s really difficult to do when you have big dreams and important work and life to live,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited about the promise of gene therapies. They can\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A lawsuit against Florida's ban on \u201clab-grown\u201d meat is still alive after a federal judge tossed four parts of the suit on Friday but kept a fifth.",
      "Northern District of Florida Chief Judge Mark Walker declined to dismiss a part of the lawsuit that argued Florida's restrictions give an unconstitutional advantage to Florida farmers over out-of-state competitors. Meanwhile, the judge sided with state attorneys seeking to dismiss the lawsuit and their argument that federal approval of cultivated chicken doesn't mean individual states can't ban it.",
      "U.S. regulators first signed off on the sale of what\u2019s known as \u201ccell-cultured\u201d or \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d meat in June 2023. The lawsuit had argued that Florida\u2019s law is preempted under federal laws that regulate the interstate market for meat and poultry products. Sellers say the product is a more ethical and sustainable alternative to conventionally raised chicken, beef and pork.",
      "But lawmakers in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi have called cultivated meat a threat to their states\u2019 agriculture industries and banned the sale of the product, which is made of animal cells that are fed a mix of proteins, vitamins and water and then formed into nuggets, sausages and steaks.",
      "The lawsuit was filed last year by Upside Foods, represented by the nonprofit law firm the Institute for Justice.",
      "\u201cUpside is not looking to replace conventional meat, which will always have a place at the table,\u201d Upside CEO Uma Valeti said in a statement. \"All we are asking for is the right to compete, so that Floridians can try our product and see that it is possible to have delicious meat without the need for slaughtering animals. Today\u2019s ruling is an important step toward securing that right.\u201d",
      "The governor's office and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment about the lawsuit.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis was flanked by cattle farmers last May when he signed the state\u2019s cultivated meat ban into law.",
      "\u201cWe stand with agriculture, we stand with the cattle ranchers, we stand with our farmers because we understand it\u2019s important for the backbone of the state,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cTake your fake lab-grown meat elsewhere.\u201d",

      "X, the social media platform owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, is challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota ban on using deepfakes to influence elections and harm candidates",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- X Corp., the social media platform owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, is challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota ban on using deepfakes to influence elections and harm candidates, saying it violates First Amendment speech protections.",
      "The company's federal lawsuit filed this week also contends that the 2023 state law is preempted by a 1996 federal statute that shields social media from being held responsible for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\u201cWhile the law's reference to banning \u2018deep fakes\u2019 might sound benign, in reality it would criminalize innocuous, election-related speech, including humor, and make social-media platforms criminally liable for censoring such speech,\" the company said in a statement. \u201cInstead of defending democracy, this law would erode it.\u201d",
      "Minnesota's law imposes criminal penalties \u2014 including jail time \u2014 for disseminating a deepfake video, image or audio if a person knows it's fake, or acts with reckless disregard to its authenticity, either within 90 days before a party nominating convention, or after the start of early voting in a primary or general election.",
      "It says the intent must be to injure a candidate or influence an election result. And it defines deepfakes as material so realistic that a reasonable person would believe it's real, and generated by artificial intelligence or other technical means.",
      "\u201cElon Musk funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the 2024 presidential election and tried to buy a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat,\" said the law's author, Democratic state Sen. Erin Maye Quade.",
      "\"Of course he is upset that Minnesota law prevents him from spreading deepfakes that meant to harm candidates and influence elections. Minnesota\u2019s law is clear and precise, while this lawsuit is petty, misguided and a waste of the Attorney General Office\u2019s time and resources,\u201d her statement said.",
      "Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison's office, which is legally obligated to defend the constitutionality of state laws in court, said in a statement that it's \u201creviewing the lawsuit and will respond in the appropriate time and manner.\u201d",
      "The Minnesota law was already the subject of a constitutional challenge by Christopher Kohls, a content creator, and GOP state Rep. Mary Franson, who likes to post AI-generated parodies of politicians. That case is on hold while they appeal to overturn a judge's denial of their request to suspend the law.",
      "The attorney general's office argues in that case that deepfakes are a real and growing threat to free elections and democratic institutions, that the law is a legitimate and constitutional response to the problem, and that it contains important limitations on its scope that protect satire and parody.",
      "X, formerly known as Twitter, said it's the only social media platform challenging the Minnesota law, and that it has also challenged other laws it considers infringements of free speech, such as a 2024 California political deepfakes law that a judge has blocked.",
      "X said in its statement that its \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d feature allows users to flag content they consider problematic, and that it's been adopted by Facebook, YouTube and TikTok. The company's lawsuit said its \u201cAuthenticity Policy\u201d and \u201cGrok AI\u201d tool provide additional safeguards.",
      "Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor and expert on technology law, said in an interview Friday that it's important to separate the free-speech issues from whatever one thinks about the controversial Musk.",
      "\u201cI'm almost positive that this will be struck down,\u201d Rozenshtein said.",
      "There's no exception under the First Amendment for false or misleading political speech, even lies, he said. And the potential for criminal penalties gives social media companies like X and Facebook \u201can incentive to take down anything that might be a deepfake. ... You're going to censor a massive amount to comply with this law.\u201d",
      "Deepfakes aren't good, but it would be nice to get evidence that they're causing actual problems before imposing such limits on free speech, the professor said. And while it's easy to focus on the supply of misinformation, the large demand for it is the problem.",
      "\u201cPeople want to be fooled, and it's very bad for our democracy, but it\u2019s not something I think can be solved with a deepfakes ban,\" he said.",

      "Bessent says it signals Russia that Trump is committed to a peace process.",
      "The U.S. and Ukraine have signed the deal to create the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund -- the long-awaited deal that gives the U.S. rights to Ukrainian rare earth minerals, both sides announced Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThis agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a press release. \"President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides\u2019 commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.

      "In a video discussing the deal posted on X, Bessent gave more details about the deal.",
      "\"This partnership allows the United States to invest alongside Ukraine to unlock Ukraine's growth assets, mobilize American talent, capital and governance standards that will improve Ukraine's investment climate and accelerate Ukraine's economic recovery,\" Bessent said in the video.",
      "Both sides were ready to sign the agreement on critical minerals and other resources earlier but the U.S. said it wanted the main minerals resources agreement signed and the creation of an investment fund document signed at the same time, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and a source in the Ukrainian president's office said.",
      "Ukraine had planned to separate the signing dates, as the creation of the fund agreement was still being finalized, the source added.",
      "\"Now they'll be rushing to finish it,\" the source said.",
      "Ukraine said it was ready to sign but ran into a last-minute snag when the U.S. requested it sign both the mineral resources agreement and the investment fund agreement at the same time, a Ukrainian official told ABC News. The U.S. refuted that series of events in comments during President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet meeting Wednesday, saying it was \"ready to sign\" the agreement but the Ukrainians decided on Tuesday night to \"make some last-minute changes,\" Bessent said.",
      "\"Our side is ready to sign,\" Bessent said.",
      "When asked what was changed, Bessent said there have been \"no changes on our side.\"",
      "Trump then put the mineral resources agreement into \"context,\" talking about the amount of money the U.S. has given to Ukraine's war effort. But he seemed optimistic about the prospect of the agreement coming together.",
      "\"But we haven't really seen the fruits of that deal yet. I suspect we will,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were originally set to sign the minerals deal in late February, but the plan was derailed following a tense exchange between the two men in the Oval Office.",

      "Consumer egg prices have climbed 25% since January, data shows.",
      "President Donald Trump this week disputed criticism over high egg prices in an exclusive interview with ABC News, faulting his predecessor for the price hike and claiming what he described as a recent decline in egg prices.",
      "\u201cYou remember the big thing with eggs? They hit me the first week, \u2018Eggs, eggs, eggs,\u2019 like it was my fault. I said, \u2018I didn't cause this problem. This problem was caused by [Joe] Biden,\u2019\u201d Trump told ABC News\u2019 Terry Moran.",
      "\u201cEgg prices are down,\u201d Trump later added.",
      "The remarks echoed claims made repeatedly by Trump since he took office, but his assessment of egg prices is potentially misleading, some food economists told ABC News.",
      "Retail egg prices, or the prices paid by shoppers, have climbed over the early months of Trump\u2019s term, meaning household budgets have been slammed by worsening egg costs, the economists said.",
      "By contrast, wholesale egg prices -- the amount grocers pay to suppliers -- have dropped significantly since Trump took office, though Trump appeared to overstate the amount of decline during the ABC News interview.",
      "It remains unclear when and to what extent that decline in wholesale egg prices will translate into relief for consumers, economists added.",
      "\u201cEgg prices have been increasing at the retail level and that\u2019s really important when assessing the claim President Trump made yesterday,\u201d said David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University.",
      "Parke Wilde, a food economist at Tufts University, added: \"I encourage people who are reading the news about food prices to focus on consumer prices, not wholesale prices, because that\u2019s what real consumers care about.\"",
      "Economists also largely rejected the attribution of blame for egg prices to any president, whether former President Joe Biden or Trump, saying a president exerts minimal influence over day-to-day egg costs.",
      "\u201cThe president has little or no control over egg prices,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cAny changes, whether egg prices go up or down, have almost nothing to do with what the president or any other policymaker is doing.\u201d",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s claim that eggs prices are falling, the price paid by shoppers has increased significantly since he took office, food economists said.",
      "The average retail price of a dozen eggs climbed from $4.95 in January to $6.22 in March, the most recent month for which data is available. That change in price amounted to a 25% spike, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.",
      "In recent years, bird flu -- also known as avian flu -- has decimated the egg supply while demand has persisted, lifting prices higher.",
      "\u201cEven as egg prices have exploded over the last year or two, we\u2019ve actually seen really strong demand for eggs,\u201d Trey Malone, a food economist at Purdue University, told ABC News.",
      "\u201cThe reality is it\u2019s really hard to substitute away from eggs. I can\u2019t make cookies without eggs if I want to make grandma\u2019s recipe.\u201d",
      "In recent months, however, the rise in retail egg prices has coincided with a drop in wholesale prices. That decline largely owes to an easing of the avian flu outbreak, food economists told ABC News.",
      "When Trump refers to a drop in egg prices, he may be referring to the decline in wholesale prices. In a memo on Tuesday listing economic accomplishments, the White House highlighted the drop in wholesale egg prices while acknowledging that retail prices may still be elevated for some consumers.",
      "\"Most consumers have seen relief in prices on the shelf, but all consumers should see it within the next month or two,\" the White House said.",
      "Speaking with ABC News on Tuesday, Trump said: \u201cEggs are down 87% since I got involved.\"",
      "Trump has provided different figures for the size of the drop in egg prices. On April 17, he said prices had fallen 92%, while on April 4 he said egg prices had dropped 87%.",
      "Each of those figures overstates the drop in wholesale egg prices, according to data from the USDA.",
      "On Jan. 21, the day after Trump took office, the average wholesale price of a dozen eggs stood at $6.55; as of April 30, that price had dropped to $3.25, a Trading Economics analysis of USDA data shows. That change in price amounts to a roughly 50% decline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not accurate to say egg prices have decreased by 87%,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cWholesale egg prices are down but they\u2019re not down by that much.\u201d",
      "The decline in wholesale egg prices may result in a drop in the prices paid by consumers, but the timing and extent of the relief remain unclear, food economists said.",
      "The lag owes in part to the nature of contracts between businesses and egg suppliers, which often lock in prices for weeks, experts said. Grocers may also be reluctant to slash egg prices, some experts added, since customers have largely kept up egg purchases at higher prices.",
      "\u201cFor as much people talk about increasing egg prices, they\u2019re still buying eggs,\u201d Malone said.",

      "When he returned to Washington, Trump wasted little time -- almost immediately waging a sweeping campaign against what he says are grossly unbalanced economic partnerships and double-dealing international institutions designed to swindle the U.S.",
      "Yet, Trump's trade fights have been as a volatile as they are contentious, with tariff hikes often delayed by last minute reprieves. This added uncertainty has shaken investors and perhaps exacerbated many American consumers' sense of economic unease.",
      "\"So far, the results have been spectacularly bad. Trump's trade policy has lurched from empty threats to sweeping tariffs to humiliating retreats, roiling markets and destroying remaining confidence in U.S. economic leadership,\" said Edward Alden, a columnist at Foreign Policy and visiting professor at Western Washington University.",
      "\"Unless the administration can bring some discipline to its approach, Trump will accomplish none of his goals and leave the United States poorer and weaker,\" he continued.",
      "But tariffs have also evolved into a tool deployed by the White House to coerce foreign governments to comply with its broader agenda.",
      "Just days after his return to the White House, Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all imports from Colombia if its President Gustavo Petro didn't agree to take in deportees from the U.S. Petro initially said he would impose retaliatory tariffs but soon reversed course -- accepting two planeloads of migrants.",
      "Additionally, Trump's hawkish approach to tariffs has fueled tension between the world's two largest economies: China and the U.S.",
      "The trade relationship between the U.S. and Beijing was a frequent target of Trump's ire during his first term. Now, he has taken the feud to the next level-- raising levies on Chinese imports as high as 145%.",
      "This time around also feels like a more personal battle between Trump and China's President Xi Jinping. White House officials have hinted that trade negotiations between the nations have been quietly taking place -- a claim China's foreign ministry adamantly denies. Beijing also disputes a claim the president made in a recent interview with Time that Xi had called him.",
      "\"With both sides convinced they hold the advantage -- and neither signaling a shift in posture -- the U.S.-China relationship is entering a new era of heightened confrontation,\" said Craig Singleton, the senior director of the China Program at Foundation for Defense of Democracies.",
      "Despite the apparent lack of progress toward a trade deal with China, the White House says more than 100 countries around the world have come to the table in the wake of the president's tariff war -- a dynamic that will test the administration's ability to simultaneously carry out so many complicated economic negotiations in the weeks and months to come.",
      "Expansionist intent",
      "In his second term, the president's international ambitions have extended well beyond tariffs. Even before taking office, Trump indicated he was laser focused on assuming control of two foreign territories: the Panama Canal and Greenland.",
      "Administration officials often argue that in both cases, the president is primarily concerned about foreign interference and its impact on national security. But other statements and actions signal there may be more at play.",
      "On Saturday, Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform that American ships should be able to transit the Panama Canal as well as Egypt's Suez Canal free of charge, adding that he had directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to \"immediately take care of\" the situation.",
      "And when Vice President J.D. Vance visited Greenland in March, he indicated that the Trump administration's interest in the territory was fueled in part by interest in edging out China and Russia in the competition for the rare earth resources that may lie buried under its ice sheet.",
      "\"We know that Russia and China and other nations are taking an extraordinary interest in Arctic passageways and Arctic naval routes and indeed in the minerals of the Arctic territories. We need to ensure that America is leading in the Arctic, because we know that if America doesn't other nations will fill the gap where we fall behind,\" Vance said.",
      "The Trump administration's drive to secure critical minerals is also intertwined in its dealings with Ukraine and appears to have motivated efforts to secure peace in other areas of the world. As part of its work to pave the way for U.S. investments in the mineral-rich Democratic Republic of the Congo, the administration has played a key role in brokering peace negotiations between the country and Rwanda.",
      "Deals deferred",
      "Meanwhile, other longstanding conflicts the president initially declared he would swiftly resolve continue to rage as U.S. mediation efforts sputter.",
      "Trump famously said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine on \"day one\" of his second term -- a claim he now says was \"an exaggeration.\"",
      "The first 100 days of the second Trump term have seen the U.S. approach to Russia and Ukraine undergo a dramatic shift.",
      "With Moscow, the Trump administration has brought about a significant warming of relations. Delegations from both the U.S. and Russia have been involved in slow but steady talks to revive their diplomatic presences in each other's countries, while top Trump administration negotiator Steve Witkoff has now met face-to-face with Russian leader Vladimir Putin four times.",
      "Dealings with Ukraine, on the other hand, have presented some of the administration's most intense and iconic foreign policy moments.",
      "In late February, Trump, Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sparred inside the Oval Office. After the spat, Zelenskyy was instructed to leave the White House",
      "Over this past weekend, in an entirely different scene from the Oval Office encounter, Trump and Zelensky met again -- this time, just two of them sitting alone, inside a hushed St. Peter's Basilica as world leaders gathered at the Vatican to pay their last respects to Pope Francis.",
      "Amid the stark highs and lows of his interactions with Zelenskyy, Trump has repeatedly insisted he is neutral and simply wants to put an end to the bloodshed.",
      "But Trump and his administration have also set a tight deadline for U.S. involvement in the process, with the president declaring after his meeting with Zelenskyy that he expected to see progress within \"two weeks or less.\"",
      "Critics of the Trump administration's approach have consistently faulted the president for failing to hold the Kremlin accountable.",
      "\"Trump's desire for peace is laudable. But the way he has pursued it -- undercutting Ukraine while putting no tangible pressure on Russia -- leaves much to be desired,\" said John Hardie, the deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.",
      "\"The shift in Washington's Ukraine policy under Trump has contributed to a broader erosion of European trust in America,\" he continued. \"The silver lining: Europe now appears more serious than ever about stepping up on defense.\"",
      "On Wednesday, the 101st day of the president\u2019s term, the Trump administration did secure one deal with Ukraine -- signing onto a long-awaited partnership with the country that gives American businesses access to Ukraine\u2019s mineral resources.",
      "Administration officials say the partnership will provide Kyiv with implicit security guarantees by increasing U.S. involvement in Ukraine\u2019s economy, but the agreement has no direct impact on efforts to finally bring the war with Russia to a close.",
      "Israel, Gaza",
      "With Israel's war in Gaza, the Trump administration has taken a more hands-off approach, even though the conflict appeared to be on the brink of a resolution when he re-entered the White House in January.",
      "In tandem with the outgoing Biden administration, Trump officials worked to secure a three-phase ceasefire/hostage-release that saw the release of 33 captives that had been detained since the Oct. 7 attacks, including two Americans. But the framework fell apart before the parties could move into its second phase, which would see the release of the final American hostage held in Gaza.",
      "Despite promises to find an endgame for the conflict, much of Trump's focus seems to have been on his unusual proposal to relocate Gazans and redevelop the territory, a pitch that was met by widespread backlash.",
      "But Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute and former National Security Council official, says Trump will eventually have to take on the conflict -- or see his agenda constrained by it.",
      "\"The Israeli-Palestinian front remains the thorniest and most difficult challenge to producing progress in the Middle East. Without a clear game plan to end the war, bring hostages home, and improve the living conditions for the 2 million Palestinians in Gaza, the Trump administration's wider aspirations for the Middle East will continue to face limits,\" he said.",
      "In the first months of his term, Trump has also rekindled long-stagnant nuclear talks with Iran -- while also declaring he would be \"leading the pack\" in a military strike on the country if it did not ultimately agree to a deal.",
      "Diplomacy deconstructed",
      "The initial weeks of Trump's second term have seen no shortage of turmoil in Washington, and the president's aims of shrinking the federal government and ramping up efficiency have resulted in significant cuts to diplomatic structures.",
      "As one of his first executive actions, Trump ordered a freeze on all foreign aid spending. His administration quickly began lobbing accusations of fraud and other misdeeds against the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and moved to close it. By February it had suspended most of its employees, and by March, officials developed plans to fold the few programs that had not been cancelled into the framework of the State Department.",
      "But the State Department is also bracing for major staffing reductions. In April, Rubio unveiled plans to drastically overhaul the department by sharply cutting the number of offices within it and ultimately wiping out roughly 700 Washington, D.C.-based positions for Foreign Service and Civil Service employees.",
      "Additionally, Rubio has instructed leaders throughout the department to draw up plans to reduce their personnel by 15% -- a move that could lead to thousands of additional job cuts.",
      "Already, the second Trump administration has seen the State Department shift its focus from international organizations and peacekeeping efforts to carrying out the president's deportation goals and securing the southern border. Rubio's first actions in his post include designating international cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and securting various deals with South American and Central American nations -- including, most controversially, El Salvador -- to accept deportees from the U.S.",
      "Beyond Washington, Trump has also withdrawn from a number of international organizations, including the World Health Organization and the United Nations Human Rights Council.",
      "At the 100-day mark, there is one vacant seat in Trump's Cabinet: the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.",
      "\"Trump believes his actions will consolidate U.S. power and put an end to America being 'ripped off' by an outdated international system,\" said Bronwen Maddox, the director and chief executive of Chatham House.",
      "\"The danger is that by unpicking the alliances and institutions that have underpinned US power at such breakneck speed, Trump ends up handing the US's many advantages \u2013 in innovation, commercial strength and global influence -- to Beijing,\" she added.",

      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who has stayed largely out of the political limelight since leaving office, is set to deliver remarks on Wednesday in San Francisco as the Trump administration celebrates its accomplishments of its first 100 days.",
      "Harris will be speaking at the 20th anniversary celebration for Emerge, an organization that supports Democratic women running for office.",
      "The former Democratic nominee for president has had few public appearances since departing the White House, and has limited her political activity.",
      "But her remarks come as she is set to possibly re-enter politics in the coming months. Harris has been mulling a run in California's gubernatorial race and will make a decision by the end of summer, two sources familiar with her plans told ABC News in March.",
      "Some Democrats have also floated her as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, although some of her longtime supporters have told ABC News they are torn over that prospect.",
      "Whether she runs for either office or not, Harris' public remarks thus far have sometimes included veiled and explicit swipes at the Trump administration and the president himself.",
      "In remarks at a women of color leaders summit in early April, she weighed in on the second Trump administration, saying \"there is a sense of fear that has been taking hold in our country\" but that \"courage is also contagious.\"",
      "And in remarks at the NAACP Image Awards in February, Harris framed the \"chapter\" America is in as one that \"will be written not simply by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us. The American story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people.\"",
      "Harris and her spouse Doug Emhoff have been the target of recent actions by President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump issued a memo in March that revoked the security clearances and access to classified information of his previous presidential opponents -- Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris -- as well as more than a dozen former administration officials. On Tuesday, Emhoff said he had been dismissed from the board of trustees of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as the White House confirmed it had removed board members.",

    "story": [
      "Midwest agricultural exports face Chinese barriers.",
      "President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies have created uncertainty and opportunity across America's heartland as farmers and small business owners grapple with the effects of his administration's tariff decisions in his first 100 days.",
      "According to a recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, 53% of Americans believe the economy has deteriorated since Trump took office, with 72% expressing concern that his economic policies could trigger a recession.",
      "The impact of these policies is playing out dramatically in two very different sectors of the American economy: agriculture and fishing.",
      "In Racine, Wisconsin, where farming roots run deeper than the Civil War, soybean farmers are watching the trade war with growing anxiety. Kevin Malchine, whose family has worked the same land for six generations, described the current situation as \"unsettled.\"",
      "\"We deal with floods and droughts and too hot, too cold, insects, weeds, all those things,\" Malchine says. \"It feels like tariffs are a little bit harder to deal with because it's entirely out of our control.\"",
      "The stakes are particularly high for soybean farmers. Last year, Malchine says China purchased 42% of America's soybean production, representing nearly $13 billion in sales to American farmers. With Trump's implementing a 145% tariff on Chinese products and China's retaliatory 125% tariff on American goods, including soybeans, farmers like Malchine face an uncertain future.",
      "\"These markets have been created over decades, multiple administrations, and here he's trying to fix that in 100 days or 200 days,\" Malchine explains. \"This is going to have a major impact.\"",
      "The solution isn't as simple as switching crops, according to Malchine. \"I know some people think, well, just raise a different crop,\" Malchine says. \"That's a big shift to turn when you're talking about Midwest ag production, corn, soybeans and what we do. That would take years and years to change what we'd do.\"",
      "While farmers brace for impact, some small business owners have found opportunities in the trade war's upheaval. In Charleston, South Carolina, shrimpers like Rocky Magwood told ABC that they see potential benefits from the tariffs.",
      "\"The tariffs, it's great that they're there for now. To bring awareness,\" said Magwood, who has been on shrimp boats since he was six weeks old with his dad.",
      "In an industry where 94% of shrimp consumed in America is imported, local shrimpers have struggled to compete with lower-priced imports.",
      "The impact has been devastating on the local industry, according to Magwood, who said when he started, \"there was 100 boats on Shim Creek. There's six of us now. However, recent developments have brought hope. \"South Carolina wild-caught shrimp, we don't even have any in the freezer, we sold out,\" he said.",
      "As the Trump administration navigates a 90-day pause in tariffs for most countries except China, the consequences of these policies continue to ripple through the economy. Major retailers, including Walmart, Target, and Home Depot, have warned the White House that continued tariffs could lead to empty store shelves.",
      "Back in Wisconsin, Malchine remains cautiously realistic about the future.",
      "\"The impact is coming, and it will have a real impact as time goes on,\" he says. \"If you really want to know what the impact is, come and visit me six months from now or next year.\"",
      "Despite the uncertainty, he maintains the resilience characteristic of American farmers, \"There's been times where we faced big time adversity. It gives you faith and confidence that you're going to be able to weather this storm. And hopefully it's sooner rather than later that we get a resolution.\"",

      "The president ramped up arrests, deportation threats and immigrant detention.",
      "A controversial deportation program targeting alleged gang members has become the latest flashpoint in President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, as civil rights advocates warn of due process violations and questionable deportations.",
      "Among those caught in the crosshairs is Alessandro Paredes, a 19-year-old Venezuelan migrant detained in North Texas. After turning himself in for allegedly pointing a pistol at someone in South Carolina, Paredes was arrested by immigration authorities before his weapons charge could make its way through court.",
      "The Trump administration claimed he is a gang member in the country illegally -- an allegation Paredes denied.",
      "\"We're being forced to sign papers ... saying we're part of a gang,\" Paredes told ABC News from detention.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) declined to comment on his case.",
      "Paredes fears being deported to CECOT, an El Salvador prison where hundreds of other Venezuelans facing similar accusations have been sent in recent weeks. A last-minute Supreme Court decision temporarily blocked Paredes' deportation, ruling that he and others deserve due process.",
      "\"This is not being done by law, this is totally illegal and it's out of the blue,\" Paredes said of the effort to deport him.",
      "The case exemplifies the Trump administration's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement in its first 100 days. On the day of his inauguration, Trump issued executive orders ramping up deportations and ending humanitarian parole programs established under former President Joe Biden.",
      "After that, DHS conducted raids targeting alleged gang members around the same time military reinforcements were sent to fortify the southern border.",
      "The administration's most controversial move came in mid-March, when Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act -- an obscure law allowing presidential deportation powers when there is a threatened \"invasion\" of U.S. territory.",
      "This led to hundreds being deported to CECOT, despite court orders to turn the deportation flights around. Some civil rights attorneys argue the policies violate U.S. law.",
      "\"The Trump administration has not only pushed up to the legal line, but gone well past it,\" American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawyer Lee Gelernt told ABC News. \"Many of the policies are just flouting laws that Congress has passed.\"",
      "But there is no question Trump\u2019s policies have had a stunning impact on the southern border. After reaching all-time highs over and over during the Biden administration, border crossings have plunged to near-record lows since the inauguration, statistics show, with the administration's supporters crediting the deterrent effect.",
      "\"President Trump is responsible for the turnaround at our southern border,\" Julie Kirschner, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), told ABC News. \"He has sent the message across the globe that if you come here illegally, there will be consequences.\"",
      "However, there are also mounting concerns over wrongful deportations and removals of people with no criminal records.",
      "An ABC News poll shows Americans divided, with 46% approving of Trump's handling of immigration while 53% disapprove. Most of the policies face ongoing legal challenges, and some experts warn of a potential constitutional crisis over the administration's resistance to court orders -- including its possible defiance of the order to turn deportation flights around.",
      "The policies' future remains uncertain since they rely largely on executive actions that a future administration could reverse without congressional action. For now, migrants like Paredes remain in limbo.",
      "\"We just want justice, we're human, we have human rights, and we're fighting for it,\" Paredes said. \"We don't deserve to get taken to a country that's not even ours. We just want to go back.\"",

      "A day after ABC News' exclusive interview with President Donald Trump, an attorney for wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia told ABC News he believes the Trump administration \"is talking out of both sides of its mouth.\"",
      "\"We have [border czar] Tom Homan saying that the deportation was not a mistake, and then we have the president yesterday flatly conceding that he has the power to solve this problem with a phone call, and he hasn't made that phone call yet,\" said attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who has been living with his wife and children in Maryland, was deported in March to El Salvador -- despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to that country due to fear of persecution -- after the Trump administration claimed he was a member of the criminal gang MS-13, which his wife and attorney deny.",
      "Tuesday, in an Oval Office interview with ABC News' Terry Moran to mark his 100th day in office, President Trump said he \"could\" secure the return of Abrego Garcia, and \"if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that\" -- before adding, \"I'm not the one making this decision.\"",
      "\"You're the president,\" Moran told Trump.",

      "\"I'll never tell you that,\" Rubio said. \"And you know who else? I'll never tell a judge, because the conduct of our foreign policy belongs to the president of the United States and the executive branch, not some judge.\"",
      "The Trump administration, while acknowledging that Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in error, has said that his alleged MS-13 affiliation makes him ineligible to return to the United States.",
      "In 2019, an immigration judge determined that Abrego Garcia was removable from the U.S. based on allegations of his gang affiliation made by local police in Maryland. But Abrego Garcia was subsequently granted withholding of removal to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis early this month ruled that the Trump administration must \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, and the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously affirmed that ruling, \"with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.\"",

      "Trump, on his 100th day, spoke with ABC News' Terry Moran in the Oval Office.",
      "President Donald Trump discussed his first 100 days in office during an exclusive interview with ABC News, discussing a wide range of topics from the economy to immigration, executive powers, and foreign policy.",
      "In an Oval Office sit-down with ABC News anchor and Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran, Trump highlighted his administration's immigration policies and sought to reassure anxious Americans on the economy. He acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin might be \"tapping\" him along in Ukraine peace talks and repeatedly criticized his predecessor, Joe Biden.",
      "The interview airs on ABC at 8 p.m. ET, 7 p.m. CT. It can also be streamed later Tuesday on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu.",
      "And he delivered positive remarks about some of his administration's officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and billionaire Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Here are more headlines from ABC News' exclusive sit-down with Trump.",
      "Asked by ABC News' Moran for a message to voters who may feel some anxiety at the prospect of higher costs from tariffs, Trump claimed that he has delivered on his signature campaign pledge to lower prices on his first day in the White House.",
      "\"There is a lot of concern out there,\" Moran said. \"People are worried, even some people who voted for you sayin', 'I didn't sign up for this.' So how do you answer those concerns?\"",
      "\"Well, they did sign up for it, actually. And this is what I campaigned on,\" Trump replied. \"I said that we've been abused by other countries at levels that nobody's ever seen before \u2026 I could've left it that way, and at some point, there would've been an implosion like nobody's ever seen. But I said, 'No, we have to fix it.' I've -- I've wanted to do this for many years.\"",
      "Trump claimed credit for what he said were lower prices for gasoline and groceries, pointing specifically to eggs, which emerged as a major issue during the 2024 campaign.",
      "\"They hit me the first week, 'Eggs, eggs, eggs,' like it was my fault. I said, 'I didn't cause this problem. This problem was caused by Biden. What's the problem with eggs?' And they said, 'They've doubled it.' Well, eggs are down 87% since I got involved,\" Trump said. \"And by the way -- and there were plenty of eggs for Easter, which we just went through.\"",
      "Trump promoted his administration's immigration policies and responded to concerns about the wrongful deportation of some people living in America, maintaining that they are \"careful\" in their efforts.",
      "\"Well, they seem to work,\" Trump said of his methods to cut down on illegal crossings along the southern border.",
      "Moran questioned Trump about whether he agrees that even \"really bad guys\" deserve due process.",
      "\"Well, they get a process where we have to get 'em out, yeah,\" Trump replied, adding later that, \"If people come into our country illegally there's a different standard. These are illegal. They came in illegally.\"",
      "When Moran later asked about podcaster and Trump supporter Joe Rogan's comments that those being deported must be afforded due process because \"we gotta be careful that we don't become monsters while we're fighting monsters,\" the president said he agreed.",
      "\"Oh, I agree with that a hundred percent, yeah. We want to be careful,\" Trump said. \"We are careful. We're doing something that has to be done. We have a country that's very sick.\"",
      "Trump framed his unprecedented use of official powers to push through his policy agenda as a necessary step in healing a \"sick\" country.",
      "\"What do you say to people who are concerned you are taking, seizing too much power and becoming an authoritarian president like we haven't had before?\" Moran asked.",
      "\"No, I would hate them to think that,\" Trump said. \"I'm doing one thing: I'm makin' America great again. We have a country that was failing. We have a country that was laughed at all over the world. We had a leader that was grossly incompetent. He should have never been there.\"",
      "In a social media post on Saturday, Trump asserted that \"there was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,\" adding that \"it makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through \"Banking\" or \"Secondary Sanctions?\" Too many people are dying!!!\"",
      "\"It's possible,\" Trump told Moran of Putin \"tapping\" him along. \"Yeah, that's possible. Sure. He could be tapping me along a little bit. I would say that he would like to stop the war. I think that--\"",
      "\"You believe that?\" Moran jumped in.",
      "\"If -- if it weren't for me, I think he'd want to take over the whole country, personally,\" Trump continued. \"I always felt -- so when I left, there wasn't even a chance that this would happen. When Biden got involved, I won't say whether or not he handled it properly, but obviously it wasn't good, because the war started.\"",
      "The president went on to say, \"I think Putin wanted all of Ukraine,\" and claimed Putin invaded Ukraine because Biden was in office. \"I think if I didn't win the election, he would have gotten all of Ukraine.\"",
      "He later added that, \"And because of me, I do believe that -- he's willing to stop the fighting.\"",
      "Trump, in discussing his administration's Department of Government Efficiency, the effort spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk to rid the federal government of what they call waste and fraud, said referrals have been made to the Department of Justice for prosecution on fraud charges.",
      "Moran asked if DOGE, which has cut foreign food programs and medical research, among other items, had gone \"too far, too fast, too recklessly.\"",
      "Trump said, \"no,\" saying DOGE had saved the country billions.",
      "\"We also found tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse, as you know. We found a lot of fraud. There was a lot of fraud,\" Trump said. \"Fraudulent things were taking place, and we ended that, and those people are gonna be suffering--\"",
      "Asked several times on whether any fraud referrals were made to the Justice Department, Trump said, \"Have there been? Yes, there have.\"",
      "\"So, there have been referrals for fraud from the work of DOGE?\" Moran asked Trump.",
      "Trump replied, \"Of course there have been.\"",
      "Throughout the interview, Trump repeatedly accused former President Joe Biden of incompetence and blamed his predecessor for myriad challenges facing his administration. Moran also asked Trump about his decision to strip his political opponents' security details and about appearing to target some law firms.",
      "\"Are you using your powers as president to get personal revenge?\" Moran asked Trump.",
      "\"No. I'll tell you what -- I tell you what you sh -- not -- you're really not asking and you should be asking. There has never been a president in this country in the history that was persecuted like I was persecuted by really crooked people,\" Trump maintained. \"Dishonest, horrible people. And it's been proven.\"",
      "Moran later asked Trump again if \"that gives you the right to go after your political opponents with the powers of this office?\"",
      "\"I don't go after -- I don't go -- I'm going after -- all I'm doing -- hey, Biden did something to me -- and I did something to Biden. And you know why I did it? 'Cause he's grossly incompetent,\" Trump said. \"That's not a man that should be allowed to, you know, be lookin' at things that are very confidential.\"",
      "A day after Canadians voted to elect a fourth straight Liberal government and keep Prime Minister Mark Carney, who has been fiercely critical of Trump's tariffs and annexation threats, Trump downplayed souring relations with America's northern neighbor.",
      "\"You were a big issue in it,\" Moran told Trump of the election. \"And Canadians, many of them, are really angry, furious, about your talk about, 'We're gonna take over Canada. It's gonna become the 51st state--'\"",
      "\"That's their prerogative,\" Trump said.",
      "When Moran pointed to a decrease in travel from Canada to the U.S., Trump said, \"We're doing great.\"",
      "\"Feels like there's been reputational damage,\" Moran told the president.",
      "\"The country's doing great,\" Trump maintained.",
      "Moran later asked Trump if he thought \"the reputation of the United States has gone down under your presidency?\"",
      "\"I -- no, I think it's gone way up, and I think we're a respected country again,\" the president said. \"We were laughed at all over the world.\"",

    "summary": "Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority appears ready to clear the way for creation of the nation\u2019s first religious charter school funded directly with taxpayer dollars.",
    "story": [
      "Oklahoma court had blocked the Catholic Church's charter school contract.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority on Wednesday appeared ready to clear the way for creation of the nation's first religious charter school funded directly with taxpayer dollars.",
      "The justices heard arguments in a landmark dispute from Oklahoma, where the state Supreme Court last year blocked the Catholic Church from receiving a charter school contract on grounds that it violated state and federal constitutional bans on government-sponsored sectarian education.",
      "A decision overruling the state high court would have ripple effects nationwide, especially in the 45 states that are home to 8,000 charter schools serving more than 3.8 million kids.",
      "The state's Republican attorney general argues that charter schools are public schools \u2013 open to all and subject to close supervision \u2013 and, as such, operate as extensions of state government subject to principles of separation of church and state.",
      "Lawyers for the prospective school -- St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School -- insist that it is privately created and controlled and that excluding it from generally available charter school funding is religious discrimination.",
      "For more than two hours, the justices debated application of the First Amendment's competing religion clauses to the case, weighing both its prohibition of state establishment of religion and its protection of free exercise of religious faith.",
      "The court's three liberal members were united in the view that charter schools are quintessentially public institutions that cannot advance a specific ideology using taxpayer funds.",
      "\"The essence of the Establishment Clause was, we're not going to pay religious leaders to teach their religion,\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan noted that the Oklahoma law creating a charter school program explicitly says they must be nonreligious.",
      "\"These are state-run institutions,\" Kagan said. \"With respect to a whole variety of things, the state is running these schools and insisting upon certain requirements.\"",
      "Conservatives suggested they had a fundamentally different view of charter schools -- as contractors for a public service rather than an arm of the government.",
      "\"The argument that St. Isidore and the board has made is that it's a private entity that is participating in a state program,\" noted Justice Clarence Thomas. \"It was not created by the state program.\"",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed concern that a ruling against St. Isidore on First Amendment grounds could call into question other government contracts with religiously affiliated organizations.",
      "\"I think a concern here is that religiously operated senior homes or food banks or foster care agencies or adoption agencies or homeless shelters, many of which get substantial funding from the government, would potentially \u2026 become state actors and, thus, not be able to exercise their religion,\" Kavanaugh said.",
      "A series of recent Supreme Court decisions has endorsed the idea that taxpayer-funded public benefit programs, from school vouchers to state-run scholarships, must be equally available, even if a person or organization has a religious affiliation.",
      "Many of the justices said those precedents apply to the Oklahoma case.",
      "Kavanaugh emphasized that religious charter schools would provide families with \"options\" but not confine students to a religious education.",
      "\"A student in Oklahoma is free to choose a public school, correct? No student is required to attend a charter school, correct?\" he said.",
      "\"That's right,\" replied Gregory Garre, the attorney representing the state.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch suggested that individual states opposed to religiously affiliated charter schools could tailor their laws to prevent that -- and potentially curtail a charter's independence.",
      "\"I can imagine some states might respond to a decision in your favor by imposing more requirements on charter schools,\" Gorsuch said to attorney James Campbell representing the plaintiffs.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts posed critical questions of both sides. At one point, Roberts opined that a St. Isidore charter school would pose a striking \"comprehensive involvement\" between church and state. Later, he likened the relationship to Catholic Charities' contract with the City of Philadelphia to provide adoption services; a 2021 high court decision said the city could not exclude the religious agency from the foster care program.",
      "\"How is that different from what we have here?\" Roberts asked Oklahoma attorney Gregory Garre. \"You have an education program, and you want to not allow them to participate with a religious entity.\"",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused from the case last year but did not explain her decision. Veteran court watchers have noted her close ties to the University of Notre Dame and personal relationships with law professors there who are involved in the case.",
      "Her absence creates the possibility of a gridlocked 4-4 court, in which case the Oklahoma state Supreme Court ruling would stand. Roberts is widely seen as being the decisive vote.",
      "\"Today's oral arguments made clear that states must not treat religious individuals and institutions as second-class citizens,\" said Carrie Severino, a former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas and president of JCN, a conservative legal advocacy group. \"I expect the court will follow precedent and allow St. Isidore to offer educational choice for Oklahoma's students.\"",
      "Opponents of religious charter schools said they feared a major ruling is on the horizon and could be transformative.",
      "\"If today's arguments are any indication, the Supreme Court may be on the verge of abandoning one of the bedrock principles of our democracy,\" said Rev. Dr. Shannon Fleck, executive director of Faithful America, a left-leaning Christian advocacy group. \"Let's be clear, this was always a test case, and today, the constitutional protections that have guarded true religious freedom for generations are at risk.\"",

      "A federal judge in Los Angeles has denied the U.S. government's request to release a former FBI informant while he appeals his case",
      "LAS VEGAS -- A federal judge has denied the U.S. government's request to release from prison a former FBI informant who made up a story about President Joe Biden and his son Hunter accepting bribes that later became central to Republicans\u2019 impeachment effort.",
      "The decision, issued Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Otis Wright in Los Angeles, comes weeks after a new prosecutor reassigned to Alexander Smirnov's case jointly filed a motion with his attorneys asking for his release while he appeals his conviction. In the motion, the U.S. government had said it would review its \u201ctheory of the case.\u201d",
      "Wright said in his written order that Smirnov is still flight risk, even if prosecutors say they will review his case.",
      "\"The fact remains that Smirnov has been convicted and sentenced to seventy-two months in prison, providing ample incentive to flee,\" he said.",
      "Smirnov, 44, was sentenced in January after pleading guilty to tax evasion and lying to the FBI about the phony bribery scheme, which was described by the previous prosecutors assigned to the case as an effort to influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.",
      "His attorneys, David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld, told The Associated Press in a text that they will appeal the judge's decision and \u201ccontinue to advocate for Mr. Smirnov's release.\u201d The U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles declined to comment.",
      "Smirnov had been originally prosecuted by former Justice Department special counsel David Weiss, who resigned in January days before President Donald Trump returned to the White House for his second term.",
      "Smirnov has been in custody since February 2024. He was arrested at the Las Vegas airport after returning to the U.S. from overseas.",
      "Smirnov, a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen, falsely claimed to his FBI handler that around 2015, executives from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid then-Vice President Biden and his son $5 million each.",
      "The explosive claim in 2020 came after Smirnov expressed \"bias\u201d about Biden as a presidential candidate, according to prosecutors at the time. In reality, investigators found Smirnov had only routine business dealings with Burisma starting in 2017 \u2014 after Biden's term as vice president.",
      "Authorities said Smirnov's false claim \u201cset off a firestorm in Congress\u201d when it resurfaced years later as part of the House impeachment inquiry into Biden, who won the presidency over Trump in 2020. The Biden administration dismissed the impeachment effort as a \u201cstunt.\u201d",
      "Weiss also brought gun and tax charges against Hunter Biden, who was supposed to be sentenced in December after being convicted at a trial in the gun case and pleading guilty to tax charges. But he was pardoned by his father, who said he believed \u201craw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.\u201d",

      "The full panel of judges on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 9-6 to keep the ruling from U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander in place while DOGE pushes forward with an appeal. The appellate decision was released Wednesday.",
      "Earlier this month Hollander issued a preliminary injunction in the case, which was brought by a group of labor unions and retirees who allege DOGE\u2019s recent actions violate privacy laws and present massive information security risks.",
      "Hollander said DOGE staffers could access data that has been redacted or stripped of anything personally identifiable, but only if they undergo training and background checks. She also said DOGE and its staffers must purge any of the non-anonymized Social Security data they have already obtained, and barred them from making any changes to the computer code used by the Social Security Administration.",
      "Attorneys representing DOGE had argued that anonymizing the data would be too burdensome, and disrupt the Trump administration's efforts to root out any Social Security fraud.",

      "The Trump family company has struck a deal for a luxury golf resort in Qatar",
      "The Trump family company struck a deal Wednesday to build a luxury golf resort in Qatar in a sign it has no plans to hold back from foreign dealmaking during a second Trump administration, despite the danger of a president shaping U.S. public policy for personal financial gain.",
      "The project, which features Trump-branded beachside villas and an 18-hole golf course to be built by a Saudi Arabian company, is the first foreign deal by the Trump Organization since Donald Trump took office and unlike any done in his first term. Back then, he forswore foreign deals in an extraordinary press conference surrounded by stacks of legal documents as he pledged to avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest.",
      "Noah Bookbinder, president of a watchdog group that has sued Trump for alleged ethics violations, blasted the Qatari deal.",
      "\u201cYou want a president making decisions that are in the best interest of the United States, not his bottom line,\u201d said Bookbinder, who leads Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.",
      "In addition to a Saudi Arabian partner, called Dar Global, the planned resort north of the Qatari capital of Doha will be developed by a Qatari company called Qatari Diar, which is owned by the Qatari government. That would appear to violate the Trump Organization\u2019s much weaker, second-term ethics pledge that, while it would pursue foreign deals, none would include foreign governments.",
      "When asked for clarification, the Trump Organization said its deal was with the Saudi firm, not the Qatari one, though Trump's son Eric, who is in charge of the business, mentioned both companies in an earlier statement.",
      "\u201cWe are incredibly proud to expand the Trump brand into Qatar through this exceptional collaboration with Qatari Diar and Dar Global,\u201d he said.",
      "The deal Wednesday for the Trump International Golf Club and Trump Villas is unlikely to be the last of its kind. It follows several other deals made before Trump was sworn in, including one for a golf resort in Vietnam late last year with a firm with ties to the Communist Party.",
      "The deals have drawn outrage from government watchdogs but mostly silence from Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress.",
      "The Associated Press reached out to the two Republicans who chair the foreign relations committees in the Senate and House, Sen. James Risch of Idaho and Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, but neither responded.",
      "Any deal with Saudi Arabia is seen as especially problematic in foreign policy circles. Trump\u2019s close ties to Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, drew heavy criticism in his first term after the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi columnist for The Washington Post who had written critically about the monarchy.",
      "Khashoggi is believed to have been dismembered, a killing that the U.S. intelligence community concluded was approved by the crown prince.",
      "The deal on Wednesday with the Saudi firm Dar Global, a London-based international arm of developer Dar Al Arkan, follows deals with it for two Riyadh projects in December. Dar Global is not owned by the Saudi government, but it has close ties to the royal Saudi family.",
      "Another government tie to Trump is through his son-in-law Jared Kushner. The Saudi sovereign wealth fund has reportedly invested $2 billion in an investment fund run by Kushner. And the Saudi government-backed LIV Golf has hosted tournaments at Trump's Doral resort near Miami.",
      "Despite Trump's pledge in his first term to not make moves that would appear to conflict with his personal financial holdings and business, he ended up opening the doors to all sorts of potential pay-to-play deals. His hotel down the street from the White House hosted scores of corporate lobbyists, CEOs, members of Congress and diplomats. Trump once suggested holding a G7 meeting of global leaders at Doral before he backed down after an outcry over ethics concerns.",
      "Several lawsuits were filed against the first Trump administration, alleging it violated the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which bans a president from accepting gifts or payments from foreign or domestic governments. One case was appealed to the Supreme Court but was never heard because Trump had already left the presidency at that point and the issue was moot.",
      "This time, the hotel is gone, sold to a Miami investment firm, but other sources of potential conflicts of interest have emerged.",
      "The Trump Organization also owns much of the publicly traded parent company of social media platform Truth Social, which allows Trump to financially benefit from traffic to the site where his postings as U.S. president are widely followed. The family also has a stake in a cybercurrency trading platform called World Liberty Financial as Trump has pushed for less regulatory oversight on cybercurrencies.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Contractors hired by the Trump administration have removed a memorial wall to fallen staffers from the now-closed headquarters of the U.S. Agency for International Development, with no immediate word on where it will wind up.",
      "Engraved tiles on the wall honor 99 USAID staffers killed in the line of duty around the world. President John F. Kennedy and Congress created the foreign assistance agency in the early 1960s.",
      "President Donald Trump and ally Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency swiftly moved to dismantle USAID, closing the headquarters and terminating most staff and projects within weeks of Trump\u2019s inauguration.",

      "At the now-barricaded and screened-off former headquarters, the names of the dead were gone from the lobby. Two people were seen working on Wednesday at the spot where the memorial had been, while a third focused on a separate steel memorial plaque honoring support staff killed while aiding the agency\u2019s mission.",
      "The federal government posted notice Tuesday of a $41,142.16 contract to remove and relocate the memorial wall by June 6. Neither the State Department nor the contractor immediately responded to requests for comment on where it would go.",
      "A security guard inside the agency\u2019s former lobby said the memorial wall was being moved to the State Department, which is overseeing the remaining USAID programs.",
      "Supporters had proposed moving it to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History or the National Cathedral, while a counterproposal suggested moving it to a rented office, according to a former USAID official familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.",

      "Florida lawmakers have given final approval to a bill aimed at reforming a condominium safety law passed in 2022 in the wake of a deadly building collapse in Surfside",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida lawmakers gave final approval Wednesday to a bill aimed at reforming a condominium safety law passed in 2022 in the wake of the partial collapse of Champlain Towers South, which killed 98 people in Surfside in June 2021.",
      "Condo owners have been facing higher costs because of the 2022 law, which requires condo associations to have sufficient reserves to cover major repairs and to conduct a survey of reserves every decade.",
      "Sponsors of this year's bill said further changes were needed to allow for more flexibility and to lessen the burden of new costs shouldered by residents, while ensuring protections remain in place to prevent another potential collapse.",
      "\u201cWithout moving one step backwards on safety, this bill provides options, flexibility, and relief so condo owners and associations can prioritize the most important repairs first,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Jennifer Bradley, a sponsor of the bill.",
      "Residents and attorneys say regulations prior to 2022 allowed condo associations to keep fees low by failing to save money for future repairs, only to hit residents with steep special assessments when repairs couldn't be put off any longer. The mounting cost of funding deferred maintenance and building up reserves has strained residents in the condo haven of South Florida, especially retirees and those living on fixed incomes.",
      "In Hallandale Beach, condo owner Kelli Roiter sympathizes with people having trouble paying the higher fees, but said she supports rules requiring associations maintain reserves for needed repairs.",
      "Her building was built in 1971 and sits a few miles from Champlain Towers South.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that this building will collapse,\u201d Roiter told The Associated Press in December. \u201cThere are nights I wake up hearing a creak, and I jump. And then I remind myself that, no, no, no, we\u2019re safe. But am I safe?\u201d",
      "The bill, which now heads to the desk of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, would allow certain condo associations to fund their reserves through a loan or line of credit, give residents greater flexibility to pause payments to their reserves while they prioritize needed repairs, extends the deadline by which associations have to complete structural integrity studies and exempts some smaller buildings from having to do those analyses.",
      "\u201cWe have strived to reach that delicate balance between the safety of our constituents that live in condominiums, as well as understanding the incredible financial impact that sometimes these particular bills that we pass have,\u201d said bill sponsor state Rep. Vicki Lopez, a Miami Republican.",
      "\u201cI will continue this work as long as we need to do so,\u201d she added.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's former agriculture secretary wants the administration to support adding the Okefenokee Swamp's vast wildlife refuge to a United Nations list of World Heritage site",
      "SAVANNAH, Ga. -- President Donald Trump\u2019s former agriculture secretary is urging the administration to support adding a vast, federally protected wildlife refuge in the Okefenokee Swamp to a list of globally treasured natural and cultural sites recognized by the United Nations.",
      "The swamp near the Georgia-Florida state line was nominated under President Joe Biden, whose priorities Trump has worked swiftly to dismantle during his first 100 days since returning to the White House.",
      "Now the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge is being touted by Sonny Perdue, a former two-term Georgia governor who led the Department of Agriculture during Trump's first term.",
      "So far, only 26 places in the United States have been designated as UNESCO World Heritage sites. The U.S. Interior Department put the refuge up for consideration in December.",
      "In an April 17 letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Purdue wrote that seeking the rare distinction poses \u201can extraordinary opportunity to preserve a national treasure while also delivering incredible economic benefits to the state of Georgia.\u201d He noted it's been endorsed by Republicans and Democrats.",
      "\u201cThis designation is not a partisan issue,\u201d Perdue wrote in his letter, which was first reported by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \"By supporting this effort, we can ensure the Okefenokee\u2019s legacy as a natural wonder while fostering growth and prosperity for the communities surrounding it.\"",
      "The Okefenokee is the largest national wildlife refuge east of the Mississippi River, sprawling across more than 400,000 acres (161,800 hectares) in southeast Georgia.",
      "Supporters say making it a World Heritage site would boost its profile as one of the world\u2019s last intact blackwater swamps, which get their dark tea-colored waters from decaying vegetation. The Okefenokee is home to abundant alligators, stilt-legged wood storks, endangered woodpeckers and more than 400 other animal species.",
      "The Interior Department \u201cremains committed to supporting the pursuit of World Heritage Site recognition for the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge,\u201d said a statement emailed Wednesday by Alyse Sharpe, an department spokesperson.",
      "Designation as a World Heritage site wouldn\u2019t impose any added restrictions or regulations for the Okefenokee. Nor would it directly affect a company\u2019s plan to mine minerals just outside the Okefenokee refuge.",
      "Twin Pines Minerals has been awaiting final permits from Georgia environmental regulators for more than a year. The company says it can extract minerals without doing harm, but scientists and other opponents have warned that mining near the swamp\u2019s bowl-like rim could cause irreparable damage.",
      "Since the 1970s, the World Heritage list has recognized more than 1,200 sites worldwide for having \u201coutstanding universal value\u201d to all of humanity. U.S. sites on the list include national parks like the Grand Canyon in Arizona and treasured manmade landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty.",
      "The U.S. government had listed the Okefenokee refuge as a \u201ctentative\u201d nominee since 1982. It started moving in earnest in 2023 as the nonprofit Okefenokee Swamp Park, which operates boat tours and other concessions within the refuge, signed an agreement to work on an application with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge.",
      "Okefenokee Swamp Park raised $600,000 to pay for the nearly 300-page application packet, said Kim Bednarek, the nonprofit's executive director.",
      "The bid for World Heritage status still needs U.S. government support. Bendarek said pending steps include an Okefenokee site visit by experts evaluating the nomination for UNESCO's World Heritage Committee. She said a final vote isn't expected before the summer of 2026.",
      "\u201cThe fact that it happened under the Biden administration is not pivotal,\u201d Bendarek said. \u201cWhat\u2019s pivotal is this is an outstanding place of beauty and diversity that the United States can be proud of. We do expect and hope for the full support of the Trump administration.\u201d",

      "State Attorney General James Uthmeier and local prosecutors also asked U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams in Miami to put her injunction on hold while the order is appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.",
      "In her ruling on Tuesday, the judge specified that her order applied to all of the state\u2019s local law enforcement agencies, despite a recent letter to the contrary from Uthmeier. The judge also set a hearing in May to determine if Uthmeier should be held in contempt for sending the letter to law enforcement agencies in Florida.",
      "The judge had issued a 14-day temporary restraining order on April 4, shortly after a lawsuit challenging the law was filed by the Florida Immigrant Coalition and other groups with support from the American Civil Liberties Union. Williams extended the order another 11 days after learning the Florida Highway Patrol had arrested more than a dozen people, including a U.S. citizen. The lawsuit claims the new law violates the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution by encroaching on federal duties.",
      "After Williams issued her extension April 18, Uthmeier sent a memo to state and local law enforcement officers telling them to refrain from enforcing the law, even though he disagreed with the injuction. But five days later, he sent another memo saying that the judge was legally wrong and that he couldn\u2019t prevent local police officers and deputies from enforcing the law.",

      "Prater was previously sentenced to five years in federal prison for setting another fire in June 2019 at an adult video and novelty store in East Tennessee.

      "\u201cWe were told that it was like finding a needle in the haystack to prove who did it \u2014 that that\u2019s in fact the point of an arson,\u201d she said. \u201cYou've got to remember this was 2019, so Donald Trump was still in his first presidency. Frankly, for years, we didn\u2019t get any updates.\u201d",
      "A week after the incident, Democratic U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, of Memphis, called for a federal probe. He also called on more government funding to counter an uptick in hate crimes and white nationalism nationwide.",
      "Woodard Henderson said authorities informed Highlander's leaders in 2022 that they were indeed victims of a hate-motivated attack.",
      "Highlander is known as a place where Civil Rights icons such as Rosa Parks and John Lewis received training. Parks attended a workshop there on integration in 1955, about six months before she famously refused to move to the back of a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. She always credited Highlander with helping her become a more determined activist.",
      "Parks returned to Highlander two years later with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. for the school\u2019s 25th anniversary celebration, where King gave a keynote address on achieving freedom and equality through nonviolence.",

      "The Americans \u201cmaintain their innocence, and it\u2019s important to note none of these cases had an identified victim, and all of them were built on supposed confessions taken in Arabic without translation,\u201d according to a statement from Jonathan Franks, a private consultant working on cases involving American hostages and detainees who represented nine of the 10 people released Wednesday. He spent weeks in the country trying to negotiate the releases.",
      "Kuwait is considered a major non-NATO ally of the U.S. The U.S. and Kuwait have had a close military partnership since America launched the 1991 Gulf War to expel Iraqi troops after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, with some 13,500 American troops stationed in Kuwait at Camp Arifjan and Ali al-Salem Air Base.",
      "But Kuwait also has detained many American military contractors on drug charges, in some cases for years. Their families have alleged that their loved ones faced abuse while imprisoned in a country that bans alcohol and has strict laws regarding drugs.",
      "Others have criticized Kuwaiti police for bringing trumped-up charges and manufacturing evidence used against them \u2014 allegations never acknowledged by the autocratic nation ruled by a hereditary emir.",
      "Among those freed Wednesday was Tony Holden, an HVAC technician. He was working as a defense contractor in support of Camp Arifjan at the time of his November 2022 arrest, when his family and supporters allege he was \u201cset up by corrupt Kuwaiti police looking to earn bonuses.\u201d",
      "His supporters say his wife and daughter were physically threatened, that he was coerced into signing a written confession in Arabic and was charged with drug possession despite testing negative in a drug test and abstaining for religious reasons from drug and alcohol use.",
      "\u201cTony was an innocent man when he was arrested, and he remains an innocent man today,\u201d says a website that was established to support him and advocate for his release.",
      "Added Secretary of State Marco Rubio: \u201cWe celebrate his release and return to the United States.\u201d",
      "A minor is also being released in the coming days but is expected to remain in Kuwait.",

      "Investigators have concluded that the leak of a Wisconsin Supreme Court abortion order last year was likely deliberate, but they were unable to determine who was responsible",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Investigators concluded in a report released Wednesday that the leak of a Wisconsin Supreme Court abortion order last year was likely deliberate, but they were unable to determine who was responsible.",
      "The June leak of a draft order showed the court would take a case brought by Planned Parenthood, which is seeking to declare access to abortion a right protected by the state constitution. A week after the leak was reported, the court issued the order accepting the case.",
      "The draft order, which was not a ruling on the case itself, was obtained by online news outlet Wisconsin Watch.",
      "The Supreme Court's seven justices, in a statement released with the investigative report, called the leak \u201ca breach of trust the court had not experienced in its history.\u201d All seven justices condemned the leak.",
      "The leaked order in June came in one of two abortion-related cases before the court. The court also heard a second case challenging the 1849 abortion ban brought by Attorney General Joh Kaul. A ruling in that case is pending.",
      "The court has yet to set a date for oral arguments in the Planned Parenthood case that was the subject of the leaked memo.",
      "Investigators questioned 62 people, including all seven Supreme Court justices, staff, interns and people with access to the court during a two-week period in June from the date the draft was available until Wisconsin Watch published its article.",
      "Network logs, including individual web histories, shared folder files, individual folders, and emails from all employees with access to the draft order were also reviewed, the report said.",
      "Additionally, printer data was analyzed to see who may have printed off a copy of the draft order.",
      "\u201cAll available leads have been thoroughly pursued, and no suspects have been positively identified at this time,\u201d the report said. It added that there was no evidence that the leak was the result of a breach of the court's computer system.",
      "The report did conclude that the draft order had been forwarded to the personal email account of Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, one of the four liberal justices on the court who voted to hear the abortion case.",
      "Bradley's law clerk told investigators that forwarding important documents to Bradley's personal email account was standard operating procedure.",
      "That was the only time prior to publication of the Wisconsin Watch article that the draft order was forwarded to an email outside of the state court system, the report said.",
      "Bradley did not return an email on Wednesday asking about the report.",
      "Bradley is retiring at the end of her term in August. She is being replaced by Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford, who won election to the court in April, ensuring that liberals will maintain their 4-3 majority.",
      "Missing computer data hindered the investigation, the report said. The logs showing websites visited in the two weeks leading up to the Wisconsin Watch story about the leaked order were incomplete, the report said. Only logs from June 26 and June 27 were available, not from June 13 through June 26 as requested. The article was published on June 26.",
      "The lack of those website visitation logs \u201csignificantly hampered the ability to thoroughly examine the circumstances surrounding the leak,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe issue underscores the importance of proper data management, retention, and verification procedures, especially when such information is crucial for ongoing investigations.\u201d",
      "The court hired an independent investigator to look into the leak because the court does not have an independent law enforcement agency. However, the report did not identify who led the investigation.",
      "Three retired police detectives were hired at a cost of $165,740 to conduct the investigation and write the report, a spokesperson for the state court system said.",
      "Investigations into the inner workings of the Wisconsin Supreme Court are rare and fraught.",
      "In 2011, when Bradley accused then-Justice David Prosser of choking her, the Dane County Sheriff\u2019s Department led the investigation. That agency took over the investigation after the chief of Capitol Police at the time said he had a conflict. But Republicans accused the sheriff of having a conflict because he was a Democrat who endorsed Bradley.",
      "The Sauk County district attorney acted as special prosecutor in that case and declined to bring charges.",

      "A federal judge has again directed the Trump administration to provide information about efforts to retrieve Kilmar Abrego Garcia from an El Salvador prison",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday again directed the Trump administration to provide information about its efforts so far, if any, to comply with her order to retrieve Kilmar Abrego Garcia from an El Salvador prison.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland temporarily halted her directive for information at the administration\u2019s request last week. But with the seven-day pause expiring at 5 p.m., she set May deadlines for officials to provide sworn testimony on anything they have done to return him to the U.S.",
      "Abrego Garcia, 29, has been imprisoned in his native El Salvador for nearly seven weeks, while his mistaken deportation has become a flash point for President Donald Trump's immigration policies and his increasing friction with the U.S. courts.",
      "The president acknowledged to ABC News on Tuesday that he could call El Salvador's president and have Abrego Garcia sent back. But Trump doubled down on his claims that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang.",
      "\u201cAnd if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that,\u201d Trump told ABC's Terry Moran in the Oval Office.",
      "Police in Maryland had identified Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 gang member in 2019 based off his tattoos, Chicago Bulls hoodie and the word of a criminal informant. But Abrego Garcia was never charged. His attorneys say the informant claimed Abrego Garcia was in an MS-13 chapter in New York, where he's never lived.",
      "The gang identification by local police prompted the Trump administration to expel Abrego Garcia in March to an infamous El Salvador prison. But the deportation violated a U.S. immigration judge\u2019s order in 2019 that protected him from being sent to El Salvador.",
      "Abrego Garcia had demonstrated to the immigration court that he likely faced persecution by local Salvadoran gangs that terrorized him and his family, court records state. He fled to the U.S. at 16 and lived in Maryland for about 14 years, working construction, getting married and raising three kids.",
      "Xinis ordered the Trump administration to return him nearly a month ago, on April 4. The Supreme Court ruled April 10 that the administration must work to bring him back.",
      "But the case only became more heated. Xinis lambasted a government lawyer who couldn\u2019t explain what, if anything, the Trump administration has done. She then ordered officials to provide sworn testimony and other information to document their efforts.",
      "The Trump administration appealed. But a federal appeals court backed Xinis\u2019 order for information in a blistering ruling, saying, \"we shall not micromanage the efforts of a fine district judge attempting to implement the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration resisted, saying the information Xinis sought involved protected state secrets and government deliberations. She in turn scolded government lawyers for ignoring her orders and acting in \u201cbad faith.\u201d",
      "The judge has directed U.S. attorneys to provide specific justifications for their claims of privileged information. But her order could face continued resistance.",
      "When a reporter asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday whether he has had any conversations with El Salvador about returning Abrego Garcia, Rubio said foreign policy should not be discussed with judges.",
      "\u201cWell, I\u2019ll never tell you that. And you know who else I\u2019ll never tell? A judge,\u201d Rubio said during a Cabinet meeting. \u201cBecause the conduct of all foreign policy belongs to the president of the United States and the executive branch, not some judge.\u201d",

      "A Philadelphia judge\u2019s role in a cheesesteak shop his wife owns is resulting in allegations from the panel that investigates judicial misconduct in Pennsylvania that his efforts have run afoul of ethical rules for jurists",
      "A Philadelphia judge's role in a cheesesteak shop owned by his wife has prompted a panel to allege he's violated the state's ethics rules.",
      "The Pennsylvania Judicial Conduct Board on Tuesday filed a complaint against Common Pleas Judge Scott DiClaudio over Shay's Steaks, a high-end cheesesteak restaurant that opened more than a year ago a few blocks from city hall.",
      "\u201cThis complaint is such a farce,\u201d DiClaudio, who is acting as his own lawyer, said in a phone interview Tuesday evening. \u201cPeople do not come to Shay's because a judge may make their cheesesteak.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have a support role, which I\u2019m permitted to have,\u201d he said. In a podcast interview cited by the board, DiClaudio discussed decisions about pricing, ingredients, salary levels for employees and competing restaurants.",
      "\u201cI don't mind charging $19, because I'm giving you a better quality steak,\u201d DiClaudio said on the podcast.",
      "Lately, he said, health issues and the demands of having a young child have limited his time in the business. As a criminal court judge, his focus these days is on court actions filed by defendants after they have been convicted.",
      "The Judicial Conduct Board investigates and prosecutes possible instances of judge misconduct in Pennsylvania. The case will be heard by the Court of Judicial Discipline.",
      "The board complaint notes that news coverage of the restaurant in Philadelphia, where cheesesteaks are the subject of perpetual public interest, has noted he is a judge. One story referred to him as \u201cwhiz honor\u201d \u2014 a reference to the use of Cheez Whiz on some cheesesteaks.",
      "If anything, DiClaudio said, his role in the restaurant may be improving the image of judges in the minds of his fellow Philadelphians, giving them \u201cconfidence in the judiciary \u2014 that we're not all robots.\u201d",
      "Shay's Steaks is named for his late mother and the luncheonette his parents ran for more than two decades in South Philly.",
      "The complaint references several news stories about the restaurant that describe him as a judge.",
      "\u201cI had no idea what they were going to write,\" DiClaudio said. \"I had no say in the editing process until I saw it myself.\u201d",
      "He noted a sign at the restaurant states Jackee DiClaudio is the owner \u2014 the couple lives in the same building as the restaurant. He said Shay's Steaks has never used an image of him in judicial robes or described him as a judge in advertising materials. He says he's never been paid for his work there, and that the profits go to his wife.",
      "DiClaudio is accused of falling short of a requirement that judges always act in a way that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. Another allegation is that he violated a rule that judges \u201cnot abuse the prestige of judicial office to advance the personal or economic interests of the judge or others, or allow others to do so.\u201d",
      "County judges such as DiClaudio may not have other employment that would in any way interfere with their judicial duties and responsibilities, said Sam Stretton, a prominent judicial ethics lawyer. He has represented DiClaudio in the past, and may again in the current matter.",
      "\u201cHe's very proud of his wife and what she's doing there,\u201d Stretton said. \u201cSure, he gives input but I don't see that as being prohibited. The issue he's got to deal with is: Is there self-promotion here?\u201d",
      "Complicating the case is that DiClaudio is currently on probation under a decision by the Court of Judicial Discipline that involved tax liens and an unpaid bill. He was found to have not acknowledged debt on his financial disclosure forms and did not obey court orders, leading to repeated contempt citations against him, the court said.",
      "He was suspended without pay for two weeks, so in order to qualify for a pension and retiree health care he needs to serve two additional weeks after his term expires in January 2026. A Democrat, he is seeking retention to another 10-year term. If he wins retention he says he is considering retiring early next year.",

      "Libby asked the Supreme Court for an order requiring her legislative votes be counted as her lawsuit plays out.",
      "Her censure came after she posted about a high school athlete who won a girls\u2019 track competition. Libby included a photo of the student and identified them by first name, with the name in quotation marks and said the student had previously competed in boys\u2019 track.",
      "Libby\u2019s post went viral, preceding a public disagreement over the issue between Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic Maine Gov. Janet Mills. The Trump administration later filed a lawsuit against the state for not complying with the government\u2019s push to ban transgender athletes.",
      "Maine\u2019s Democratic House Speaker, Ryan Fecteau, accused Libby of violating the state\u2019s legislative ethics code and the Maine House of Representatives censured her in February.",

      "FALL 2019: Another immigration judge grants Abrego Garcia protection from removal to El Salvador, affirming Abrego Garcia's claim that he would be endangered by local gangs. But the judge denies blanket asylum, noting that \u201cwithholding from removal, in contrast to asylum, confers only the right not to be deported to a particular country rather than the right to remain in the U.S.\u201d This point will become key to the Trump administration's arguments.",
      "MARCH 12, 2025: According to court documents, ICE agents arrest Abrego Garcia, telling him his \u201cimmigration status has changed.\u201d He is later deported to El Salvador's CECOT prison.",
      "MARCH 31: The Trump administration writes in a court filing that \u201cICE was aware of his protection from removal\u201d to his home country but Abrego Garcia \u201cwas removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error.\u201d",
      "APRIL 4: Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni says in court: \u201cWe concede he should not have been removed to El Salvador.\u201d Pressed for a reason he is being held, Reuveni replies: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have taken the case, he shouldn\u2019t have argued it if that\u2019s what he was going to do,\u201d Bondi says. She compares his exchanges in court to \u201ca defense attorney walking in, conceding something in a criminal matter\u201d about their client.",

Drew Ensign, deputy assistant attorney general, says the administration is \u201cactively considering what could be done\u201d in response to a Supreme Court order that it must work to bring him back.

Kozak, identifying himself in the document as senior official in the State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs. \u201cHe is alive and secure in that facility.\u201d",

Van Hollen posts a photo of the meeting on X, saying he also called Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife \u201cto pass along his message of love.\u201d The lawmaker does not provide an update on the status of Abrego Garcia. El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele also posts images of the meeting, saying, \u201cNow that he\u2019s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador\u2019s custody.\u201d",

Officials say Abrego Garcia was stopped for speeding and the officer suspected human trafficking, but no citations were issued or arrests made. \u201cThe facts reveal he was pulled over with eight individuals in a car on an admitted three-day journey from Texas to Maryland with no luggage,\" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant homeland security secretary for public affairs, says in the statement. \u201cThe facts speak for themselves, and they reek of human trafficking.\u201d",
      "In a statement issued through his lawyers, Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife said: \u201cKilmar worked in construction and sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites. ... He was not charged with any crime or cited for any wrongdoing. Unfortunately, Kilmar is currently imprisoned without contact with the outside world, which means he cannot respond to the claims or defend himself.\u201d",

      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller highlights as fact the allegation that Abrego Garcia is in MS-13. So, Miller reasons, Abrego Garcia \u201cwas no longer eligible for any foreign immigration relief in the United States\u201d and was deported under a \u201cvalid\u201d order.",

    "story": [
      "Visa is hoping to hand your credit card to an artificial intelligence \u201cagent\u201d that can find and buy clothes, groceries, airplane tickets and other items on your behalf",
      "Artificial intelligence \u201cagents\u201d are supposed to be more than chatbots. The tech industry has spent months pitching AI personal assistants that know what you want and can do real work on your behalf.",
      "So far, they're not doing much.",
      "Visa hopes to change that by giving them your credit card. Set a budget and some preferences and these AI agents \u2014 successors to ChatGPT and its chatbot peers \u2014 could find and buy you a sweater, weekly groceries or an airplane ticket.",
      "\u201cWe think this could be really important,\u201d said Jack Forestell, Visa\u2019s chief product and strategy officer, in an interview. \u201cTransformational, on the order of magnitude of the advent of e-commerce itself.\u201d",
      "Visa announced Wednesday it is partnering with a group of leading AI chatbot developers \u2014 among them U.S. companies Anthropic, Microsoft, OpenAI and Perplexity, and France's Mistral \u2014 to connect their AI systems to Visa's payments network. Visa is also working with IBM, online payment company Stripe and phone-maker Samsung on the initiative. Pilot projects begin Wednesday, ahead of more widespread usage expected next year.",
      "The San Francisco payment processing company is betting that what seems futuristic now could become a convenient alternative to our most mundane shopping tasks in the near future. It has spent the past six months working with AI developers to address technical obstacles that must be overcome before the average consumer is going to use it.",
      "For emerging AI companies, Visa's backing could also boost their chances of competing with tech giants Amazon and Google, which dominate digital commerce and are developing their own AI agents.",
      "The tech industry is already full of demonstrations of the capabilities of what it calls agentic AI, though few are yet found in the real world. Most are still refashioned versions of large language models \u2014 the generative AI technology behind chatbots that can write emails, summarize documents or help people code. Trained on huge troves of data, they can scour the internet and bring back recommendations for things to buy, but they have a harder time going beyond that.",
      "\u201cThe early incarnations of agent-based commerce are starting to do a really good job on the shopping and discovery dimension of the problem, but they are having tremendous trouble on payments,\u201d Forestell said. \u201cYou get to this point where the agents literally just turn it back around and say, \u2018OK, you go buy it.\u2019",
      "Visa sees itself as having a key role in giving AI agents easier and trusted access to the cash they need to make purchases.",
      "\u201cThe payments problem is not something the AI platforms can solve by themselves,\" Forestell said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we started working with them.\u201d",
      "The new AI initiative comes nearly a year after Visa revealed major changes to how credit and debit cards will operate in the U.S., making physical cards and their 16-digit numbers increasingly irrelevant.",
      "Many consumers are already getting used to digital payment systems such as Apple Pay that turn their phones into a credit card. A similar process of vetting someone's digital credentials would authorize AI agents to work on a customer's behalf, in a way Forestell says must assure buyers, banks and merchants that the transactions are legitimate and that Visa will handle disputes.",
      "Forestell said that doesn't mean AI agents will take over the entire shopping experience, but it might be useful for errands that either bore some people \u2014 like groceries, home improvement items or even Christmas lists \u2014 or are too complicated, like travel bookings. In those situations, some people might want an agent that \u201cjust powers through it and automatically goes and does stuff for us,\u201d Forestell said.",
      "Other shopping experiences, such as for luxury goods, are a form of entertainment and many customers still want to immerse themselves in the choices and comparisons, Forestell said. In that case, he envisions AI agents still offering assistance but staying in the background.",
      "And what about credit card debt? The credit card balances of American consumers hit $1.21 trillion at the end of last year, according to the Federal Reserve of New York.",
      "Forestell says consumers will give their AI agents clear spending limits and conditions that should give them confidence that the human is still in control. At first, the AI agents are likely to come back to buyers to make sure they are OK with a specific airplane ticket. Over time, those agents might get more autonomy to \u201cgo spend up to $1,500 on any airline to get me from A to B,\" he said.",
      "Part of what is attracting some AI developers to the Visa partnership is that, with a customer's consent, an AI agent can also tap into a lot of data about past credit card purchases.",
      "\u201cVisa has the ability for a user to consent to share streams of their transaction history with us,\u201d said Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity's chief business officer. \u201cWhen we generate a recommendation -- say you\u2019re asking, \u2018What are the best laptops?\u2019 \u2014 we would know what are other transactions you\u2019ve made and the revealed preferences from that.\u201d",
      "Perplexity's chatbot can already book hotels and make other purchases, but it's still in the early stages of AI commerce, Shevelenko says. The San Francisco startup has also, along with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, told a federal court it would consider buying Google's internet browser, Chrome, if the U.S. forces a breakup of the tech giant in a pending antitrust case.",

    "story": [
      "Not long after a Norfolk Southern train derailed and caught fire in eastern Ohio in February 2023 the railroad started to repeat its promise that it would \u201cmake it right\u201d in East Palestine",
      "Norfolk Southern began making promises to East Palestine, Ohio, soon after its train derailed and caught fire in February 2023, saying it would \u201cmake it right\u201d after five tank cars of vinyl chloride were intentionally burned, sending up a huge black plume of smoke that spread more toxic chemicals over homes, schools and farms.",
      "A lawsuit filed by the school district Wednesday adds to doubts about the railroad's commitment after plans for a student wellness center stalled. Some residents also point to Norfolk Southern's attempts to force other companies to help pay for its $600 million class-action settlement and its agreement to abandon a training center for first responders that was meant to help the village recover.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of empty promises were made,\u201d said lifelong resident Krissy Ferguson. She recently moved her family away to Poland, Ohio, saying her home in East Palestine still doesn't feel safe.",
      "Of course, not everyone feels exactly the same way. East Palestine 's people remain deeply divided: While some complain about lingering respiratory problems, rashes and other unexplained symptoms that raise long-term health concerns, many others say they feel fine and want to put the disaster behind them.",
      "\u201cFrom the village's perspective, Norfolk Southern is meeting the expectations outlined in our agreements,\u201d a village spokeswoman said. \u201cThat's all we can say at this time.\u201d",
      "East Palestine and the railroad announced a $22 million settlement in January that included $13.5 million already paid to the town and formalized the railroad's additional $25 million pledge to renovating the village's park. Without offering explanations or details, the joint statement said both sides agreed the promised training center isn't feasible.",
      "Norfolk Southern estimates that it has committed more than $115 million to help residents and communities in the area recover, including $1.1 million paid to the school district. That doesn't include the class-action settlement or the more than $1.1 billion the railroad has spent on the cleanup.",
      "But the school district isn't satisfied. Its lawsuit accuses the railroad of failing to reimburse the schools for using its buildings during the disaster and abandoning construction of the community wellness center. The derailment also caused more than 200 students to transfer \u2014 25% of the district's enrollment \u2014 which cost more than $1 million in lost state and federal funding last year alone. And property and income tax revenues have dropped, leaving future school finances uncertain.",
      "\u201cTo abruptly walk away, it says a lot about what a corporation can do to a community,\u201d Superintendent James Rook said.",
      "The schools' center, with an estimated price tag of $30 million, was meant to offer health and wellness care and job training for students, the lawsuit said. Norfolk Southern even hired an architect and construction firm to design it, but the project stalled last year.",
      "Rook said the wellness center was supposed to be the centerpiece of Norfolk Southern\u2019s commitment to fixing the mess. \u201cPeople were very excited, still are, about the potential of it,\" he said.",
      "The railroad insists there has been no change in its commitments. The derailment became the worst North American rail disaster in a decade after the officials blew open the vinyl chloride tanks, forcing evacuations as the plastic ingredient burned, generating new chemicals that later fell to the ground. The National Transportation Safety Board found the venting was unnecessary.",
      "Norfolk Southern maintains its www.nsmakingitright.com website, based on the phrase former CEO Alan Shaw repeated in testimony to Congress and in community meetings and interviews. Shaw was fired last fall for having an inappropriate consensual relationship with a railroad executive.",
      "\u201cFrom the outset, we have been clear about our commitment to do right by the community in East Palestine. We remain focused on taking meaningful action that aligns with community priorities,\" a railroad statement said.",
      "Current CEO Mark George said after taking over that Norfolk Southern will follow through on all its promises, and he's visited East Palestine several times.",
      "But residents like Misti Allison say it doesn't feel like \u201cmaking it right\u201d when the railroad refuses to pay for cost overruns beyond its $25 million pledge to the park project. She said people are also mourning the loss of the training center for first responders, which would have brought jobs to town and helped firefighters throughout the region prepare to handle rail disasters.",
      "\u201cNow that Alan Shaw is gone and there is a new CEO in place, all the board cares about is getting those shares as high as possible and to be able to make it right for their shareholders,\" Allison said. \u201cAnd if the East Palestine community is a casualty in that, then so be it. This is yet another example of putting profits over people.\u201d",
      "Most of the class-action payments remain on hold because of appeals, adding to frustration in the village. Some personal injury payments have been trickling out, but many residents have complained about the amounts. The court system is the reason for those payment delays, but many blame the railroad nevertheless.",
      "The village's leaders are trying to build on the positives, said Barb Kliner, a retired chief financial officer for a different school district, but she said \"the feeling among the people that I associate with and the older folks in town is just kind of disappointment.\u201d",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Republican South Carolina Treasurer Curtis Loftis appears likely to stay in office for at least the rest of the year.",
      "The Republican-dominated House has decided not to take up a resolution passed by the Senate to kick Loftis out of office because of his role in a phantom $1.8 billion account that showed up on the state\u2019s books but had barely any real money in it and the failure to report it to lawmakers for years.",
      "The Senate sent the resolution to remove Loftis to the House on April 21. House Speaker Murrell Smith said there just isn't enough time to take it up before the session ends May 8.",
      "\u201cWe're going to concentrate on passing legislation now and we'll make a decision after session concludes on the path forward with the treasurer,\u201d Smith told South Carolina Public Radio.",
      "The decision leaves Loftis open to run for a fifth four-year term in 2026. One of his arguments to stay in office was it wasn't fair to overturn the results of an election.",
      "\u201cI am grateful for the House leadership\u2019s decision today to choose the people\u2019s business over political theatre. I feel sure that South Carolinians are thankful that they are the first priority, and political games are not. I am ready to turn my focus back to doing the people\u2019s work,\u201d Loftis wrote in a statement.",
      "The Senate voted 33-8 to remove Loftis after an extraordinary hearing with 23 Republicans voting yes. It was the culmination of over two years of investigation by senators that began when state accountants unintentionally exaggerated money given to colleges and universities by $3.5 billion.",
      "That led to the discovery of an account error that started a decade ago when the state was changing from one accounting system to another. If accountants couldn\u2019t balance the entries in the two sets of books as they moved thousands of accounts with different definitions, they kept adding it to a special account year after year until it grew to $1.8 billion.",
      "It took forensic accountants, who were paid millions of dollars in fees, to finally unravel that nearly all of the money was not real cash but just an accumulation of errors.",
      "Loftis has called the Senate investigation a witch hunt. He repeatedly said no money went missing and the errors were not made in his office, although others have testified differently. The treasurer said continuing to focus on the mistakes threatens the state\u2019s strong credit rating.",
      "Just because eight Republican senators voted against the resolution doesn't mean they back Loftis. Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said he simply thought his fellow senators did not make a strong enough case to remove him from office.",
      "\u201cI'd vote for a monkey over Curtis Loftis. I think he has no business being treasurer and my hope is Republicans will put up a good candidate to run against him,\" Massey said.",
      "This is the first year of a two year session, so the resolution to dump Loftis, which is currently in a House committee, will stay alive when lawmakers return to Columbia in 2026.",
      "Filing for office starts next March with the Republican primary for treasurer, governor and other statewide offices happening in June.",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk has for years made Texas a business home and playground, launching rockets, building cars, and dreaming about creating a utopian enclave for his workers on the rural outskirts of the state capital.",
      "Now, a new Musk project is on the brink of victory: an election Saturday to officially turn a small patch of coastal South Texas \u2014 home to his rocket company SpaceX \u2014 into a city known as Starbase.",
      "If Musk prevails \u2014 which appears likely, since the small number of residents eligible to vote include his employees \u2014 it will be a victory for the mega-billionaire whose popularity has waned since he became the chain-saw-wielding public face of President Donald Trump's federal job and spending cuts, and sunk more than $20 million into a failed effort to tip Wisconsin Supreme Court elections. Profits at his Tesla car company have plummeted.",
      "As of Tuesday, nearly 200 of 283 eligible voters had already cast an early ballot, according to county election records. The list of names so far does not include Musk, who voted in the county in the November elections.",
      "The cosmic dateline sounds like a billionaire\u2019s vanity project in an area where the man and his galactic dreams already enjoy broad support from residents and state and local officials. But there are creeping concerns that the city vote and companion efforts at the state Legislature will give Musk and his company town too much control over access to a popular swimming and camping area known for generations as the \u201cpoor people's beach.\u201d",
      "Saturday\u2019s vote to establish Starbase is seen as a done deal.",
      "The proposed city at the southern tip of Texas near the Mexico border is only about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometers), crisscrossed by a few roads and dappled with airstream trailers and modest mid-century homes. The polling site is in a building on Memes St., a cheeky nod to Musk's social media company X.",
      "Musk first floated the idea of a Starbase city in 2021. SpaceX officials have said little about exactly why they want a company town, and did not respond to messages seeking comment this week. But a fight over beach access highlights at least part of what could be at stake.",
      "SpaceX rocket launches and engine tests, and even just moving certain equipment around the launch base, requires closing a local highway and access to Boca Chica State Park and Boca Chica Beach.",
      "Closure currently requires collaboration with surrounding Cameron County. Two bills being considered by state lawmakers would move most of that responsibility to the the new city, just as the company seeks permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to increase the number of launches from five to 25 a year.",
      "SpaceX officials say the bills would streamline beach closures and operations at a company that has contracts with the Department of Defense and NASA for use of its heavy rocket Starship, including a goal to send astronauts back to the moon and eventually Mars.",
      "\u201cThis fully reusable rocket system keeps the U.S. ahead of global competitors like China, and its being developed right here in South Texas,\u201d SpaceX Vice President of Starship Legal and Regulatory Sheila McCorkle wrote to state lawmakers. She noted the company\u2019s $4 billion investments and thousands of jobs in Texas.",
      "\u201cWe need to carry on our mission of turning South Texas into the Gateway to Mars and making humankind multiplanetary,\u201d McCorkle wrote.",
      "A legislative hearing this month on the beach access bills drew just a handful of company executives and environmental activists but generated hundreds of comments from supporters and opponents.",
      "Dozens of people who identified themselves as SpaceX workers, scientists and engineers living in the area submitted identical statements: \u201cIt improves coordination around beach access during spaceflight activities without increasing closures. This is key to public safety and continued growth of the space industry in Texas.\u201d",
      "Others praised SpaceX's mission, jobs and investments in the area.",
      "Opponents countered that the state would be giving Musk and his company too much control over a beach that draws tens of thousands of visitors every year.",
      "Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino Jr., said the county has been a good steward for beach closures and that there is no need to move the authority to the new city.",

      "Another proposed bill would make it a Class B misdemeanor with up to 180 days in jail if someone doesn't comply with an order to evacuate the beach. But that measure would only take effect if beach closure authority is shifted to the new city.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is moving to cancel $1 billion in school mental health grants, saying they reflect the priorities of the previous administration.",
      "Grant recipients were notified Tuesday that the funding will not be continued after this year. A gun violence bill signed by Democratic President Joe Biden in 2022 sent $1 billion to the grant programs to help schools hire more psychologists, counselors and other mental health workers.",
      "A new notice said an Education Department review of the programs found they violated the purpose of civil rights law, conflicted with the department\u2019s policy of prioritizing merit and fairness, and amounted to an inappropriate use of federal money.",
      "The cuts were made public in a social media post from conservative strategist Christopher Rufo, who claimed the money was used to advance \u201cleft-wing racialism and discrimination.\u201d He posted excerpts from several grant documents setting goals to hire certain numbers of nonwhite counselors or pursue other diversity, equity and inclusion policies.",
      "\u201cNo more slush fund for activists under the guise of mental health,\u201d Rufo wrote.",
      "The Education Department confirmed the cuts. In an update to members of Congress that was obtained by The Associated Press, department officials said the Republican administration will find other ways to support mental health.",
      "\u201cThe Department plans to re-envision and re-compete its mental health program funds to more effectively support students\u2019 behavioral health needs,\u201d according to the notice.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration has cut billions of dollars in federal grants deemed to be related to DEI and has threatened to cut billions more from schools and colleges over diversity practices. The administration says any policy that treats people differently because of their race amounts to discrimination, and it argues that DEI has often been used to discriminate against white and Asian American students.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A late-night shooting in Minneapolis that left three people dead and two others seriously injured may have been gang related, police said Wednesday.",
      "The killings followed a period of relative peace in Minneapolis, which like many cities saw an increase in crime during the COVID-19 pandemic and after the 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.",
      "But crime fell in many major cities last year, and Minneapolis recently went two months without a homicide until a man was shot to death April 19. It was the city's longest period without a homicide in a decade, according to police. Authorities have credited the work of community organizations and a federal crackdown on local gang members.",
      "In Tuesday's shootings, officers responded to three alerts from the ShotSpotter gunfire detection system in a south Minneapolis neighborhood, and 911 callers reported gunfire in the area, police Chief Brian O'Hara told reporters.",
      "Police arrived to find four gunshot victims in a vehicle and one nearby on a sidewalk, O'Hara said. The man on the sidewalk, and a man and a woman in the vehicle, died. Another man and a women were taken to a hospital, and O'Hara said the man was in grave condition.",
      "O'Hara said it was \u201cvery clear\u201d that the victims were deliberately targeted and that the shootings were \u201cpotentially gang related,\u201d but he added that investigators were still working to determine a motive.",
      "\u201cTonight our city is grieving,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter a relative period of peace, the likes of which had not been seen in at least five years, that peace has been shattered. And there are families that are suffering tonight, that are grieving.\u201d",
      "Police responded to reports of another shooting about an hour later just five blocks away and found evidence of gunfire. A man later was dropped off at a hospital with a non-life-threatening gunshot wound. Investigators were still trying to determine if those cases were related.",
      "There were no immediate arrests. O'Hara asked for anyone with information to come forward.",
      "\u201cNow more than ever, we need our entire community to stand up and to not accept this level of violence.\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is proven that if people are able to come forward with information as soon as possible, that will help us to provide some sense of justice for these victims and these family members.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The US has signed a deal with Ukraine on the joint exploitation of its energy and mineral resources, after months of tense negotiations.",
      "The two countries have agreed to establish a reconstruction investment fund to spur Ukraine's economic recovery from its war with Russia.",
      "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it showed both sides were committed to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine. For Kyiv, the deal is seen as essential to accessing US military aid.",
      "Ukraine is believed to have vast reserves of critical minerals like graphite, titanium and lithium. They are highly sought after because of their use in renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure.",
      "The agreement comes amid a US trade war with China, where 90% of the world's current rare-earth stocks are sourced.",
      "According to the statement from the US Treasury on Wednesday afternoon, the newly created US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund recognises the \"significant financial and material support\" the US has given Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022.",

      "Under the deal, the US would contribute new assistance to Kyiv, she added, including, for example, air defence systems.",
      "President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for the agreement as a prerequisite to offering any future security guarantees to Kyiv.",
      "Crucially, the draft of the deal indicates Ukraine will be giving Washington access to some of its natural resources in return for future US security assistance.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has managed to eke out some concessions from Washington.",
      "The deal was delayed after US authorities said Kyiv was trying to make last-minute changes.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, a US source familiar with the talks criticised Ukraine for seeking to reopen some terms that had apparently been finalised over the weekend.",
      "The source said sticking points had included governance of the fund, issues with transparency, and steps to ensure that all funds would be fully traceable.",
      "Technical documents were signed last week by representatives of both countries.",
      "The initial agreement was due to be signed in February, but fell apart following a heated exchange at the White House when Trump accused Zelensky of \"gambling with World War Three\".",
      "The breakthrough comes days after Trump and Zelensky held a face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral, and as talks between Moscow and Washington over a possible ceasefire in Ukraine grind on.",

      "\"I was telling him that it's a very good thing if we can produce a deal that you sign it,\" he said, \"because Russia is much bigger and much stronger. Russia is just chugging forward.\"",
      "The US president said the deal would recuperate the multi-billion dollar US assistance to Ukraine since the war began and \"much more in theory\".",
      "\"So I went to them and said, 'Look, we got to get rare earth.' They have great rare earth, meaning certain minerals, materials,\" said Trump.",
      "\"They have things that a lot of places don't have. It's a big asset that they have.\"",

One supplier said he had half-a-million pieces of clothing waiting to ship to Walmart, and a few others echoed his uncertainty. But two exporters we spoke to said some shipments from US retailers had indeed restarted.",
      "The range and complexity of the trade between the two economies, which includes cargo cranes, umbrellas and everything in between, means that it's often down to different businesses and supply chains as to how they deal with the tariffs.",

      "In fact, his language skills saved the 30-year-old from becoming destitute. Through a deportee support organisation, he heard that a local company \u2013 EZ Call Center \u2013 was looking for English-speakers.",
      "The work, as telephone sales agents, isn't well paid, but employees can earn commissions, and the regular pay cheque gave Alberto the stability he craved.",
      "\"I had to do something to get back on my feet. Thanks to the call centre, now I have,\" he tells me during a break between calls.",
      "Almost every agent at EZ Call Center is a deportee, including the company's owner, Daniel Ruiz.",
      "He was also born in Mexico and grew up in the US before being deported for low-level drug crime in his early 20s. Daniel says he can relate to his employees' initial sense of disorientation in Mexico.",
      "\"We are all dealing with culture shock,\" he says over a steady hum of telephone calls.",
      "\"We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too.\"",
      "In their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing.",
      "All the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking people in Mexico rather than the US.",
      "Daniel says that agents like Alberto \u2013 who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico \u2013 are among his most trusted employees.",
      "\"They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,\" he explains.",
      "Daniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions.",
      "As well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation \u2013 called the Borderline Crisis Center \u2013 which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico.",
      "After his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls \"the largest deportation in American history\".",
      "He has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California.",
      "Mexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees.",
      "So far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing.",
      "The latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024.",
      "However, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant \"encounters\" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years.",
      "The threat of mass deportation combined with other factors \u2013 from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador \u2013 may have acted as an effective deterrent.",
      "The Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings.",
      "Still, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city.",
      "The few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality.",
      "Beyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce.",
      "With its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys.",
      "\"What happened in the US stays in the US,\" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. \"We don't really do background checks on that.\"",
      "Nora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate.",
      "\"We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,\" she explains.",
      "The \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start.",
      "He grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as a kid, I made some bad choices: joined a gang, ran around with the wrong crowd. Cost me a lot, cost me a life sentence. I was a lifer in California state prison,\" Luis explains.",
      "While in prison in California, he enrolled for every educational programme available and worked hard on his rehabilitation. On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech.",
      "Now 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life.",
      "\"I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends.\"",
      "For Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with.",
      "\"From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,\" he adds.",

      "The US economy shrank in the first three months of the year as government spending fell and imports surged due to firms racing to get goods into the country ahead of tariffs.",
      "The economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter, the Commerce Department said.",
      "The figures marked the first quarterly decline in three years, and came as the introduction of import taxes by President Donald Trump has scrambled global trade and created major uncertainty.",
      "But analysts said it would take more time to understand the impact of the tariff changes.",
      "While imports count against growth in calculations of gross domestic product (GDP), the surge is expected to be reversed in the months ahead. Those swings do not necessarily indicate an economy performing poorly.",
      "The report also showed consumer spending - the primary driver of the US economy - expanded 1.8%, though at a slower pace than in 2024.",

      "While he has watered down some of the policies in face of domestic outcry, analysts say the measures still leave the US with the highest overall effective average tariff rate in more than 100 years.",
      "This report tracked activity through the end of March, a period before Trump announced his most far-reaching \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on China and other countries around the world, which sparked a dramatic sell-off in the stock market and turmoil in currency and debt markets.",
      "It showed imports skyrocketed by more than 40% in the first three months of the year, while consumer spending grew 1.8%, down from 4% at the end of 2024.",
      "Analysts cautioned that those figures could be distorted by people pulling forward their purchases in anticipation of tariffs.",
      "The report also showed an unexpected jump in business investment, while final sales to private domestic purchasers - a closely watched indicator of overall demand - grew a solid 3%, little changed from the previous quarter.",
      "\"Overall, not as bad as feared,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Apr 2025 08:30:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The slowdown in the market was expected due to the lowering of thresholds at which buyers need to start paying stamp duty.",
    "story": [
      "House prices fell in April as buyers faced paying thousands of pounds more in stamp duty, according to new figures from Nationwide.",
      "Prices were down 0.6% month-on-month, the building society said.",
      "The slowdown in the market was expected due to changes to stamp duty thresholds kicking in on 1 April.",
      "Annual house price growth also slowed, but homes remain 3.4% more expensive  than they were a year ago, with the average price now at \u00a3270,752.",
      "Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said there was a \"significant jump\" in transactions in March, with buyers bringing forward purchases to avoid the additional tax charges.",
      "\"The market is likely to remain a little soft in the coming months,\" he said.",
      "But Mr Gardner added buying was likely to pick up as over summer due to earnings rising and the expectation of further cuts to interest rates.",
      "Mortgages under 4% are back but dangers lurk for borrowers",
      "What is stamp duty and how is it changing?",
      "In her October Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that the government had decided to lower stamp duty thresholds in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "The changes, which came into effect in April, means house buyers now pay the tax on properties over \u00a3125,000, instead of over \u00a3250,000, as was the case previously.",
      "First-time buyers will also now have to pay stamp duty on homes costing more than \u00a3300,000, whereas before the April change, they did not have to pay the charge unless the property was above \u00a3425,000.",
      "Nationwide's house price data is based on its own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales.",
      "April's drop in house prices was the biggest monthly fall since August 2023, according to UK economist Ashley Webb from Capital Economics.",
      "He said that the easing of mortgage rates would help boost housing demand in the coming months, offsetting any tightening in spending as a result of higher prices potentially caused by US president Donald Trump's trade tariffs.",
      "Mr Webb added that house prices are predicted to rise by 3.5% this year, and 4.5% in 2026.",
      "A mini price war has broken out between mortgage providers, although many of the lowest-rate deals still require borrowers to provide a hefty deposit.",
      "All major UK lenders are now offering fixed mortgage deals with an interest rate of less than 4%, but brokers say further cuts are not guaranteed.",
      "Recent figures suggested that more low-deposit mortgages at 5% or 10% are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008.",
      "The extra choice is a boost for first-time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years.",
      "Expectations are growing that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year because of the global fallout from US trade tariffs. That, in turn, could lower mortgage costs.",
      "\"With the anticipation of further rate cuts and mortgage provider competition, we expect to see the market accelerate through the gears over the remainder of the year,\" said Jean Jameson, from estate agent Foxtons."

    "published": "Wed, 30 Apr 2025 06:58:11 GMT",
    "summary": "The move to increase staff numbers comes as the coffee shop giant continues to see sales fall.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks will hire more baristas and scale back plans to roll out automation, the coffee shop giant's chief executive Brian Niccol says.",
      "The move, which is part of his strategy to win back customers, comes as other food and drink chains increasingly adopt technology to cut costs.",
      "Also on Tuesday, the firm announced worse-than-expected financial results as its sales continue to fall.",
      "Mr Niccol was brought into Starbucks last year tasked with turning the business around as it struggles with rising prices and consumers cut back spending.",
      "\"Over the last couple of years, we've actually been removing labour from the stores. I think with the hope that equipment could offset the removal of the labour,\" Mr Niccol said during a call with investors.",
      "\"What we're finding is... that wasn't an accurate assumption with what played out.\"",
      "Increasing staff numbers was tested in a handful of stores around the time Mr Niccol joined the firm in September 2024. He has been expanding the approach to include around 3,000 stores this year.",
      "At the same time the firm said it will pull back from deploying its Siren Craft System. Named after the iconic Starbucks logo, it is a suite of technology and equipment that was introduced in 2022 to streamline drink-making.",
      "Mr Niccol highlighted that taking on more staff would mean higher costs but said he was \"banking on some growth to come with the investment\".",

      "Starbucks said in April that its baristas would wear dark, single coloured shirts to \"allow our iconic green apron to shine and create a sense of familiarity for our customers\".",
      "In January, it reversed rules for its cafes in North America that allowed people to use their facilities even if they had not bought anything.",

      "So far Mr Niccol's turnaround efforts have seen limited results.",
      "The company's latest financial figures showed that global sales fell by 1% in the three months to the end of March, the fifth quarterly decline in a row.",

    "summary": "The real battleground of the current trade war might be China's domestic economy",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Laura read this article",
      "If you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.",
      "The US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.",
      "Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.",
      "China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.",
      "\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.",
      "His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.",
      "Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?",
      "Xi's domestic challenges",
      "With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.",
      "This has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.",
      "Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.",
      "The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.",
      "Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.",
      "The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.",
      "And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.",
      "They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.",
      "There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.",
      "The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.",
      "\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.",
      "\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"",
      "According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"",
      "To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".",
      "\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"",
      "This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.",
      "A political test for Xi",
      "Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.",
      "A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.",
      "All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.",
      "\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.",
      "This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.",
      "Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.",
      "It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.",
      "Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.",
      "Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Turning a challenge into an opportunity",
      "President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.",
      "\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"",
      "Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.",
      "In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.",
      "Geopolitical gains",
      "As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.",
      "The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.",
      "Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.",
      "\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.",
      "China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.",
      "Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.",
      "According to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".",
      "There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.",
      "China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.",
      "In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.",
      "Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.",
      "China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.",
      "And it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.",
      "\"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.",
      "Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.",
      "The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.",
      "This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.",
      "Trump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on Asia",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",

      "Canada and US relations have been strained in recent months, driven by Trump's talk of a \"51st state\" and referring to previous Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as \"governor\" - the title for leaders of individual American states.",
      "The US president has also sparked a global trade war in which Canada was one of the first countries targeted with tariffs.",
      "Trump has partially imposed a blanket 25% tariff on various Canadian goods, along with 25% import taxes on all aluminium and steel imports, but has exempted products covered by a US, Canada and Mexico trade deal known as USMCA.",

      "\"We could expand the level of integration between our countries, like-minded countries. You think about defence partnerships, and those conversations have just just begun, so there's a lot that we can do,\" he added.",

      "In the final days of polling, in his victory speech in Ottawa, and in his interview with me, he clearly intends to continue with the approach that has brought him to elected power, with a majority still possible. Even if he falls just short of a majority, two of the other main party leaders have lost their seats, and are likely to sign up to some degree behind a united Canada agenda on issues facing the US.",
      "Underpinning this approach is absolute conviction that the US is making a mistake that will primarily and visibly backfire on itself, its companies, and its consumers. The fact the White House is attacking Amazon for \"hostile acts\" in publishing tariffs is a cast-iron example of this. President Trump's gun is pointed primarily at his own feet, the thinking goes.",

      "While \"enemy\" is overstating it, Peterson was right, and additionally Carney is also very adept at understanding the nexus between markets and headlines.

      "After the prince's disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, legal ownership of his Dragons' Den-style start-up competition, Pitch@Palace Global, was transferred to a Barrowman-linked firm, Knox House Trustees (UK).",
      "Barrowman and his wife, lingerie boss Baroness Michelle Mone, hit the headlines when she admitted they had lied about their links to a company that won large government contracts during the Covid pandemic after she recommended it to ministers.",
      "A lawyer for Mr Barrowman said he \"at no time... had any business or personal involvement with the duke\".",
      "Pitch@Palace Global remained the prince's company, under his control. But in line with longstanding royal practice, it was owned under the names of other people or companies, acting on his behalf as so-called \"nominees\".",
      "Documents filed at Companies House show that from 2021, the nominee owner was Knox House Trustees (UK), which was controlled and ultimately owned by Mr Barrowman until 2023.",
      "Controversial associates",
      "Prince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor after he was cut off financially by his brother, King Charles.",
      "The prince's choice of business associates has long been controversial. In December, he said he \"ceased all contact\" with Yang Tengbo, who led the Chinese arm of Pitch@Palace, after receiving advice from the UK government which alleged that he was a spy.",
      "Mr Yang has denied being a spy or doing anything unlawful.",
      "Mr Barrowman has attracted plenty of controversy too. In 2017, HMRC began an investigation into one of his companies, AML Tax (UK), which it said \"aggressively promoted\" tax avoidance schemes. It was fined \u00a3150,000 in 2022.",
      "In January that year, the Guardian newspaper first reported links between Mr Barrowman, Baroness Mone and PPE Medpro. The pair denied involvement until December 2023, when she admitted in a BBC interview that they had lied about their links with the company.",
      "The National Crime Agency is now investigating suspected criminal offences at the firm. Mr Barrowman and Baroness Mone both deny any wrongdoing.",
      "Author Andrew Lownie, who is writing a biography of the prince, said: \"Andrew has a long history of associating with dubious business figures and disguising his business activities behind nominee and offshore accounts. There really needs to be a full investigation into the duke's financial activities.\"",
      "Who owns Pitch@Palace?",
      "Pitch@Palace was a start-up competition, founded in 2014, where entrepreneurs would pitch their ideas to possible investors in the hope of winning their backing. It had two parts:",
      "a UK-based version, set up as a community interest company, which cannot pay profits to shareholdersan international arm, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd, which held competitions in places such as Australia, Bahrain and China, and was set up as a for-profit UK company",
      "a UK-based version, set up as a community interest company, which cannot pay profits to shareholders",
      "an international arm, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd, which held competitions in places such as Australia, Bahrain and China, and was set up as a for-profit UK company",
      "Both arms of Pitch@Palace suspended operations following the Newsnight interview in 2019 about the prince's links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which led to Andrew stepping down as a working royal.",
      "Nonetheless, the international operation has emerged as a possible way for the duke to fund his lifestyle. In a court witness statement from 2023, Mr Yang wrote that the duke had needed money \"and saw the relationships with China through Pitch as one possible source of funding\".",
      "Earlier this year a Dutch company said it was in talks to buy it, saying it saw \"immense value\" in the network, even though it had suspended operations.",
      "However, Prince Andrew has never held the company in his own name.",
      "Founded in 2017, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd was initially held in the name of Amanda Thirsk, the prince's private secretary, in an arrangement often used by the Royal Family.",
      "But early in 2021, the legal ownership was transferred to Knox House Trustees (UK) Limited.",
      "This company had been set up the year before, and Mr Barrowman was named as having \"significant influence and control\" over it.",
      "Corporate filings in the Isle of Man show Knox House Trustees (UK) was ultimately owned by Knox Limited, whose sole shareholder is Mr Barrowman.",
      "Investigations into Barrowman's companies",
      "In 2023, ownership of Knox House Trustees (UK) Ltd \u2013 which still owned Pitch@Palace Global - was transferred to Arthur Lancaster, an accountant who has a longstanding working relationship with both the prince and Mr Barrowman. This remains the situation today.",
      "The same year Mr Lancaster took over as the sole director and shareholder of PPE Medpro. He was also a director of many of the companies involved in the AML tax avoidance case.",
      "The judge in that case called him \"evasive\" and said he had \"real concerns as to the reliability of Mr Lancaster's evidence\", which contained \"significant inconsistencies\".",
      "After the case, his lawyer wrote to the court arguing that the conclusions were \"unnecessarily harsh\", that Mr Lancaster had been a \"diligent and truthful witness\", and that his efforts to provide information had been hampered by the Covid pandemic.",
      "For decades the Royal Family has held investments through nominees, and still does. In the past this has served to keep details of their holdings private, though not in this case. Prince Andrew's involvement in Pitch@Palace Global is well known, and he is listed as having \"significant influence or control\" over the company on Companies House.",
      "Mr Barrowman's lawyer said in a statement: \"Mr Lancaster was a director of KHT (UK) Ltd which provided company administration services to a number of external companies, including Pitch@Palace, a company wholly owned by the duke. Mr Lancaster acted for the duke in a personal capacity at all times and has been an associate of the duke for many years.\"",
      "Mr Lancaster declined to comment. Prince Andrew did not respond to requests for comment."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70zy5w983go",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:41:25 GMT",
    "summary": "The president said the move would give companies relief while they adjust their supply chains.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has taken action to ease the impact of new tariffs on the car making industry, which had sparked warnings about higher prices and the potential for significant hits to sales and production.",
      "The change will allow companies with US factories to reduce the amount they pay in import taxes on foreign parts, using a formula tied to how many cars they sell and the price.",
      "The provision is intended to provide relief to businesses for two years as they rework their supply chains, the White House said.",
      "Officials also moved to shield car firms from facing mounting tariffs on the same items.",
      "They said businesses that have to pay tariffs on cars and parts would not be charged other duties the administration has imposed on steel, aluminium and goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "The changes came as Trump visited Michigan on Tuesday for a rally to mark his first 100 days in office.",
      "The state is home to the so-called Detroit Three carmakers - Ford, General Motors (GM) and Stellantis - and a network of more than 1,000 major suppliers to the industry.",
      "Those firms and the wider industry have been plunged into uncertainty since Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts in March, saying he wanted to expand domestic car manufacturing - an industry the White House sees as key to national security.",
      "Trump's tariff announcement drove a spike in sales, as consumers rushed to get ahead of the tariffs. But it has also left businesses scrambling to respond.",
      "Ahead of the latest announcement, General Motors and other carmakers said they welcomed the plans to soften the impact of the measures.",
      "\"We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us,\" GM chief executive Mary Barra said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together.\"",
      "General Motors, which reported its quarterly performance to investors on Tuesday, also said on Tuesday that it needed to rework its forecast for the year and pulled its prior guidance.",
      "In an unusual move, it also postponed the call with analysts that had been set to discuss the results.",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
      "'Kicking butt' or 'going too fast'? Trump voters reflect on 100 days",
      "Why Trump keeps attacking the US central bank",
      "Tariffs on foreign-made cars - which accounted for nearly half of US sales last year - went into effect last month.",
      "The duties on parts were expected to come into force on 3 May.",
      "Under the modified plan, carmakers will be able to claim an \"offset\" for what they pay in tariffs on car parts, worth up to 3.75% of the suggested retail price of all the cars they assemble in the US.",
      "That share would fall to 2.5% in the second year.",
      "The White House said the rules were designed so that a car with 85% of its parts made in the US - or in Canada or Mexico under the terms of an existing free trade deal - would not face any tariffs, a threshold that rises to 90% in the second year.",
      "The adjustment is a recognition of the global nature of the industry's current supply networks, where even cars that promote themselves as American-made often source a significant share of their parts from abroad.",
      "In remarks to reporters ahead of the signing, Trump downplayed the easing, saying they applied to a \"very, very small part of the car\" and while noting he did not want to penalise companies with factories in the US.",
      "\"We just wanted to help them during this little transition, short-term,\" he said.",
      "Last week, a coalition of US motor industry groups called on the president to not impose the measures on parts.",
      "A letter to his administration from groups representing companies including GM, Toyota and Volkswagen said the levies would \"lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive\".",
      "Ford said it appreciated Trump's decision, which it said would \"help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers\".",
      "\"We will continue to work closely with the administration in support of the president's vision for a healthy and growing auto industry in America,\" a statement added.",
      "The car maker said policies that encouraged exports and ensured affordable supply chains to promote more domestic growth were \"essential\".",
      "\"It will be important for the major vehicle importers to match Ford's commitment to building in America,\" the company said, adding that if they did, the US would see a \"windfall of new assembly and supplier factories and hundreds of thousands of new jobs\".",
      "Stellantis chairman John Elkann echoed the sentiments of his rival carmakers in response to the tariff reliefs.",
      "\"We look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,\" he added."

      "The sugar tax applied to fizzy drinks could be extended to pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes under new government plans.",
      "The government is consulting on proposals to end the exemption from the tax for milk-based drinks, as well as non-dairy substitutes such as oats or rice.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in her autumn budget last year that the government was considering widening the levy.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride labelled the move a \"sucker punch\" to households when Labour had \"already pushed up the cost of living for families\".",
      "The sugar tax, known formally as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), is a tax on pre-packaged drinks such as those sold in cans and cartons in supermarkets.",
      "It applies to manufacturers and was introduced by the Conservative government in April 2018 as a means to tackle obesity.",
      "On Monday, the Treasury also confirmed proposals to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml.",
      "Some 203 pre-packed milk-based drinks on the market, which make up 93% of sales within the category, will be hit with the tax unless their sugar content is reduced in accordance with the proposals, government analysis says.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government was consulting on \"going further\" with the existing levy after it was shown to have had a particular impact on children's health.",
      "\"We are making sure we are taking practical, sensible measures to improve the health of our children,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children.",
      "Announcing the planned changes, the Treasury said young people only get 3.5% of their calcium intake from such drinks, meaning \"it is also likely that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar\".",
      "\"By bringing milk-based drinks and milk substitute drinks into the SDIL, the government would introduce a tax incentive for manufacturers of these drinks to build on existing progress and further reduce sugar in their recipes,\" it added.",
      "The government estimates that 89% of soft drinks sold in the UK are not subject to the tax because of widespread reformulation by manufacturers since 2018.",
      "But it added that the levy had effectively created a \"target\" of just below the 5g threshold, and products had clustered below 5g as a result.",
      "The government consultation will run from Monday until 21 July.",
      "No drinks with sweeteners for younger children, say UK advisers",
      "Top-brand baby food pouches lack key nutrients",
      "Are sweeteners healthier than sugar?",
      "The SDIL has raised a total of \u00a31.9 billion since its introduction in 2018, according to government statistics released last September. Revenue for HMRC for the 2023-24 financial year was \u00a3338 million.",
      "Opponents of the levy in recent years include the soft drinks industry, pubs and off licences. Some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to tackle obesity.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the BBC on Tuesday he was \"sick to death of a government telling us how we should live\" and said the focus should be on educating people who can then make decisions about their health.",
      "Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she had not been a \"fan\" of the levy when it was first introduced by her party, calling it \"a bit too much nanny state\".",
      "She told BBC Breakfast: \"My worry is that the government does not have any plans... and so they're just looking for what else they can tax.\"",
      "But Tam Fry, the chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said he welcomed the proposals \"tremendously\" and said it was \"high-time\" the levy was extended.",
      "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was \"not a game-changer\" in terms of tackling obesity, but \"one of those things that is needed\".",
      "Industry body the Food and Drink Federation said it welcomed the chance to share its views in the consultation.",
      "It said \"significant progress\" had already been made and \"many years of investment in research and development\" had reduced sugar in soft drinks by 46% in the last five years, with a 30% sugar reduction in pre-packed milk-based drinks in the last three years.",
      "It added that food and drink manufacturers were facing a series of inflationary pressures and called on the government to \"continue to create the right conditions for businesses to innovate and also be clear about their long-term goals to promote business confidence\"."

    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 06:56:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Australia has proposed to create a strategic reserve of critical minerals.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (\u00a3580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.",
      "The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.",
      "China's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?",
      "What are rare earth minerals and why are they important?",
      "Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named \"rare\" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.",
      "Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades \u2013 including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.",
      "Albanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.",
      "Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining \u2013 which makes them usable in technology \u2013 takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.",
      "And that has spooked Western governments.",
      "Why is China restricting the export of rare earth minerals?",
      "Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.",
      "But analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.",
      "Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had \"dropped the ball\" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.",
      "\"China has its foot on the blood vein\u2026 of US and European defence systems,\" he added.",
      "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.",
      "Could Australia's proposal change the game?",
      "Albanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both \"domestic industry and international partners\", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.",
      "But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as \"long overdue\", added that the proposal is \"not going to solve the problem\".",
      "The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.",
      "Lithium \u2013 not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels \u2013 is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.",
      "Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.",
      "But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.",
      "How will the US and China respond?",
      "China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.",
      "In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to \"join hands\" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.",
      "Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products.",
      "But analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China.",
      "Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was \"more sophisticated\" than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension.",
      "If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices.",
      "But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China.",
      "\"If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West \u2013 especially the US \u2013 there are weak spots China can enter \u2013 and the most important is refining.\"",

      "The Caribbean nation of Guyana is breathing a sigh of relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the introduction of higher tariffs on a number of countries.",

      "But why had Guyana been facing a higher levy in the first place?",
      "Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in Guyana.",
      "Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company.",
      "For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana's key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana's fishing and sugar industries.",
      "The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of \"consequences\" if it were to use force against Guyana.",
      "But the planned high tariff showed Washington's ire, says Mr Bailey. \"I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana.",
      "\"The US is saying, 'if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country'. Trump is a very transactional president \u2013 and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression.\"",
      "The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments before this article was initially published. However, it subsequently put out a statement denying that the country's initially high tariff from the US had anything to do with its relationship with China.",
      "It pointed to the website of the US Trade Representative, which it said \"very transparently indicated that the formula for determining the tariff applied to each country is based on the trade balance between the US and the country concerned, and that the formula does not include any variable to capture the relationship of the country concerned with any other country whatsoever\".",
      "The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015.",
      "Last year it exported $3.13bn (\u00a32.4bn) of crude oil to the US, according to United Nations figures.",
      "Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US. However, it is the price impact of Trump's global tariffs on what they import from the US that is of most concern.",
      "This is because the Caribbean's love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour.",
      "And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean.",
      "Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US.",
      "So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US.",
      "With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump's tariffs could be profound and keenly felt.",

      "\"Some of my projects are on hold while we wait to see what happens,\" she explains. \"I am extremely worried from a business aspect but also just as a local consumer.",
      "\"I'm so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don't think people realise the impact it will have on us.\"",
      "Ms Warner believes one way Caribbean governments could ease the squeeze on their people is by lowering their own import duties, which are partially calculated using a percentage of an item's cost.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's Prime Minister Gaston Browne has dubbed global tariffs \"extremely worrisome\" and is urging citizens to \"buy smarter and buy local\".",
      "Trump's tariffs come as the Caribbean is already grappling with a confluence of harsh economic conditions from the cost of cleaning up after frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, to the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic.",

      "\"The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets.\"",
      "As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: \"Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market.\"",
      "The Caribbean islands' small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica.",
      "\"These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,\" Sir Ronald continues.",
      "Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to $1.5m per docking. This idea was mooted by the White House in February.",
      "Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China.",
      "Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US \"can only come from diversifying the market, but that's not an overnight achievement\".",
      "He adds: \"It's not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It's not governments who control trade; it's the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US.\"",

      "Mr Webb added that house prices are predicted to rise by 3.5% this year, and 4.5% in 2026.",
      "A mini price war has broken out between mortgage providers, although many of the lowest-rate deals still require borrowers to provide a hefty deposit.",

      "The extra choice is a boost for first-time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years.",
      "Expectations are growing that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year because of the global fallout from US trade tariffs. That, in turn, could lower mortgage costs.",

    "story": [
      "After more than 20 years roaming the deep dark wood, the Gruffalo is coming back in a new book, which author Julia Donaldson says she was spurred to write by a campaign to reverse a decline in children's reading.",
      "The book will be published in 2026, and will be the third about the beloved animal - after 1999's best-selling original and 2004's sequel The Gruffalo's Child.",
      "Donaldson said she had the idea \"a long time ago\", but was inspired to finally put pen to paper after the National Literacy Trust (NLT) started using the previous two books in its Early Words Matter scheme.",
      "According to the NLT, just 35% of children aged between eight and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time in 2024.",
      "That is the lowest level since the charity started gathering data in 2005.",
      "Some of those who had the original books read to them as young children will now be able to read the new story to their own kids.",
      "The first picture book saw a humble mouse encounter a fox, a snake and an owl in the deep, dark wood - before meeting the Gruffalo itself, and tricking the furry monster into being scared of it.",
      "Then in The Gruffalo's Child, the character's offspring went in search of the \"big, bad mouse\".",
      "\"It's always a challenge to write a sequel,\" Donaldson said in a statement. \"Five years elapsed between publication of The Gruffalo and The Gruffalo's Child, and now it will be more than 20 between The Gruffalo's Child and the third book.",
      "\"I actually had the basic idea for the story a long time ago, but couldn't think how to develop it.",
      "\"It was only when the NLT, whose work I'm very impressed by, used the first two books as part of their Early Words Matter programme that I was spurred on to get my idea out of the cupboard and see once and for all if I could turn it into a really satisfying story. To my surprise, I managed to do just that!\"",
      "She said she was \"delighted\" when illustrator Axel Scheffler came back on board. \"I really hope that children - and adults too - will enjoy the new story, as I know what a wonderful experience shared reading can be,\" she added.",
      "Publisher Macmillan Children's Books billed the new book as \"a fresh and exciting adventure that has all the hallmarks of a Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler classic\".",
      "The first two books have sold 18 million copies, Macmillan said.",
      "NLT chief executive Jonathan Douglas said \"reading and sharing stories is critical for shaping a child's early speech and language development\".",
      "Since the two main Gruffalo books were published, there have been spin-offs and animated versions of both, the first of which was nominated for an Oscar.",
      "Donaldson has written more than 200 books in total, and told the BBC last year it was \"amazing\" that The Gruffalo had such an impact, but that she thought it \"hogs too much of the attention\".",

    "summary": "The Irish band have a reputation for provocation, but a new row has led to rising scrutiny and anger.",
    "story": [
      "To their fans, west Belfast rave-rap group Kneecap are a rowdy, subversive force of nature. But to many others, their inflammatory political messages make them dangerous and amoral.",
      "Following in the footsteps of anti-establishment rap groups like NWA and Run The Jewels, the trio present themselves as dissident underdogs, giving a voice to the oppressed.",
      "Their lyrics, delivered in a rapid-fire mix of English and Irish, cover everything from drug-fuelled parties to their desire to free Northern Ireland from British rule.",
      "On stage and on film, they've created a riotous experience that's thrilled Glastonbury, won a Bafta award, and inspired what's been called an \"Irish language revolution\".",
      "But their rising profile has resulted in increased scrutiny and anger about their political statements.",
      "During an incendiary performance at the Coachella music festival in California earlier this month, they described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide. As a result, they've been called anti-Semitic and branded \"terrorist sympathisers\".",
      "Now, footage from two previous gigs is being assessed by counter-terrorism police in the UK.",
      "In one, the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.",
      "Kneecap have responded with a statement, saying they \"do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah\".",
      "They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.",
      "But Cox's widower Brendan was unimpressed, calling their statement \"only half an apology\". Downing Street agreed, describing their words as \"half-hearted\" and \"completely unacceptable\".",
      "The row was discussed in the House of Commons on Tuesday, with Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp calling their comments \"evil\".",
      "It isn't the band's first brush with controversy. If anything, controversy is in their DNA. But this time, the fallout threatens to engulf their career, with venues and festivals under pressure to cancel the band's gigs.",
      "To understand how we got here, here's Kneecap's origin story.",
      "Kneecap were formed in 2017 by rappers Mo Chara (Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh) and M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap (Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in), alongside beatmaker DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed (JJ \u00d3 Dochartaigh).",
      "Their career was sparked by an incident in which M\u00f3gla\u00ed and a friend were out spray-painting the day before a march in support of an Irish Language Act.",
      "M\u00f3gla\u00ed had written \"cearta\" (rights) on a bus stop when police arrived. He fled but his friend was arrested, and spent a night in the cells after refusing to speak English to the police.",
      "They documented the incident in the song C.E.A.R.T.A, which they released \"just for the craic. No plans for after,\" Mo Chara told the Irish Times.",
      "To their surprise, the song was playlisted by Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9, only to be removed after listeners complained about drug references in the lyrics.",
      "After that, their output was sporadic. The mixtape 3CAG (slang for the drug MDMA) arrived in 2018, followed by the singles H.O.O.D and MAM - dedicated to M\u00f3gla\u00ed's mother, who had died by suicide.",
      "Those early records showcased an ability to move between sharp satire, tender vulnerability and the experiences of Northern Ireland's \"ceasefire babies\" - the generation born around the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.",
      "Talking to the BBC in 2023, the band said they were inspired by US bands like Dead Prez, NWA and Wu Tang Clan.",
      "\"Rebel music in Ireland has all the same sort of ideas as hip-hop in America. A community that's oppressed, using songs to revolt in some way,\" said Mo Chara.",
      "They perform most of their lyrics in Irish, drawing inspiration from a burgeoning underground scene of \"as Gaeilge\" rap acts like Iml\u00e9 and Seamus Barra (the latter was even name-checked in their debut single).",
      "\"The only way that Irish history and mythology was passed down was orally. I think that's why it's important for us to have that intertwined with our music,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told Crack magazine last year.",
      "Kneecap's lyrics frequently contain Republican slang and slogans. Even their name is a reference to the IRA's chosen method of punishment for alleged drug dealers during the Troubles.",
      "The messaging has landed them in hot water before. DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed lost his job as a teacher in 2020 after his school was alerted to a video of a concert where he'd painted \"Brits out\" on his buttocks.",
      "Two years later, the band made headlines in Belfast after commissioning a mural of a burning police vehicle with a slogan criticising Northern Ireland's pre-Good Friday police force, the RUC.",
      "Designed to promote a festival appearance, it was criticised by politicians across the  spectrum.",
      "\"Loathe to give the band more publicity,\" said Alliance leader Naomi Long, \"but as a community we need to start asking ourselves what messages we're sending out about the kind of future we want.\"",
      "The band have claimed their take on Republicanism is partially tongue-in-cheek - satirising the self-important sloganeering they grew up with.",
      "\"Republicanism is so vast, and on a spectrum,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told the New York Times. \"We like to toy with it. We like to take the irony on.\"",
      "Certainly, the band's gleeful celebration of drug culture puts them at odds with the old guard of the movement - but the band are serious about their desire for a unified Ireland.",
      "\"The British government has failed us for 100 years,\" Mo Charra told Vulture last year. \"It's not like this is a trial run. You've had enough time and it's failed.\"",
      "Awards success",
      "Kneecap's reputation grew in 2024 with the release of a film, also called Kneecap, which presented a semi-fictional, and often hilarious, account of their rise to fame.",
      "Starring the band as themselves, with Michael Fassbender as M\u00f3gla\u00ed's father, the movie won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival, with critics praising its \"punky defiance\" and \"unruly energy\", and was nominated for six Baftas.",
      "It was followed by their debut album, Fine Art, a concept record that threw fans into a hedonistic night out with the band at a fictional Belfast pub called The Rutz.",
      "With songs that skewered the music industry and addressed Northern Ireland's mental health crisis, it showcased a band with more to say than their reputation suggested.",
      "Still, in an era of sanitised, apolitical music, Kneecap's instincts for provocation and protest were inevitably going to draw attention.",
      "Pro-Palestinian chants have featured in their gigs since the start of the latest Israel-Gaza war. But when they brought those messages to Coachella, they faced a new level of scrutiny and criticism.",
      "Kneecap weren't the only people who uttered pro-Palestinian messages at the festival, but accusations of genocide and video screens that declared \"F*** Israel\" were seen by some as crossing a line into hate speech.",
      "The organisers of Israel's Nova Music Festival, where more than 360 people were killed by Hamas in 2023, said Kneecap's message \"deeply hurt\" their community, and invited the band to visit an exhibition about the victims and survivors \u2013 \"not to shame or silence but to connect\".",
      "Others took a more strident tone. A music industry group called The Creative Community For Peace, along with Sharon Osbourne, called on the US government to revoke the band's visas.",
      "The band's manager defended their actions. Citing Hamas-run health ministry figures that more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed since the start of the war, Daniel Lambert characterised criticism of the Coachella performance as \"moral hysteria\".",
      "\"If somebody's hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by,\" he told RT\u00c91. \"But it's really important to speak truth and thankfully, the lads are not afraid to do that.",
      "\"They have the bravery and the conviction, given where they've come from in a post-conflict society, to stand up for what's right, and [they] are willing to do that despite the fact that it may harm their career.\"",
      "Right now, their career is under intense pressure.",
      "Since Coachella, Kneecap have received death threats and have been dropped by their booking agents in the US, which could jeopardise their visas ahead of a forthcoming sold-out tour.",
      "The discovery of the concert video in which the band shouted \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" and advised the audience to \"kill your local MP\" shocked the political establishment, with counter-terrorism police reviewing the footage.",
      "In Scotland, First Minister John Swinney has called for the band to be dropped from Glasgow's TRNSMT festival, saying their comments had \"crossed a line\".",
      "The Eden Project in Cornwall has cancelled their gig in July, and others, including Glastonbury, are under pressure to call off appearances.",
      "Home Office minister Dan Jarvis said on Tuesday: \"There is an ongoing live police investigation, so the government would urge the organisers at the Glastonbury Festival to think very carefully about who is invited to perform there later this year.\"",
      "At the same time, the criticism has only increased the profile of an act who were essentially an underground act a month ago.",

      "It typified an anthemic style of song but their unpretentious and down-to-earth approach earned loyal followings on both sides of the Atlantic.",

      "He was born in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, and lived in Dyserth with his wife of 39 years, Jules - who had fought her own cancer battle - and their sons Dylan, 20 and Evan, 18.",
      "He was awarded the MBE in 2019 for his services to cancer care.",

      "They would go on to sell an estimated five million records and also become the first Welsh musicians since Tom Jones and Bonnie Tyler to crack America.",
      "Thanks to a support slot with U2 on their 1983 US tour, The Alarm gained a transatlantic following - not an inconsiderable achievement.",
      "Their debut album Declaration was released in 1984. As well as Sixty Eight Guns, it also included another favourite, Blaze of Glory.",
      "The band had honed their live performances by extensive touring, and were also reliable \"go-to\" support choice for big names - which included Bob Dylan, Queen and U2 again - including an appreciative crowd at Cardiff's National Stadium in 1987.",

      "The trial has begun of 10 people who are accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at a Paris hotel in 2016.",
      "The reality TV star and business woman was tied up and held at gunpoint in a luxury suite where she was staying during Paris Fashion Week.",
      "About $10m (\u00a37.5m) worth of jewels were taken from her, including a $4m (\u00a32.9m) diamond engagement from then-husband Kanye West.",
      "In a grand courtroom adorned with 19th Century tapestries, the court was given a fascinating snapshot into the lives of the diverse cast of characters suspected of involvement in the heist.",
      "For the first one up - 71-year-old Yunice Abbas - this was done through a \"enqu\u00eate de personnalit\u00e9\", a sort of background report on a person accused of a crime which French courts regularly include in their trials. These reports take in elements of the defendant's family history, behaviour and work to paint a picture of their lives and help jurors make a decision.",
      "The court heard a long list of crimes that Abbas has been found guilty of in the past - from petty crime and small-time drug trafficking to bank robberies - and retraced his difficult childhood, which was partly spent in Algeria and marked by the deaths of two of his siblings.",
      "Abbas - who has spent almost a third of his life in jail - has already admitted to his role in the heist, and even wrote a memoir entitled I Held Up Kim Kardashian. The president of the court, David De Pas, suggested that the book shows Abbas was proud of what he did - something he has repeatedly denied.",
      "When asked if he had any sympathy for his victims, Abbas said that he never did before the Kardashian heist, \"but this time I do regret what I did\u2026 It opened my eyes.\"",
      "Abbas said that while watching television in jail, he was confronted with relentless coverage of the burglary, which made him realise how much Kim Kardashian had suffered.",
      "\"We just grabbed the lady's handbag but I have discovered there's trauma behind it,\" he said.",
      "The court also focused on Gary Madar, whose brother's company provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for several years. Now 35, the father-of-two has been accused of feeding information to the gang about Kim Kardashian's location on the night of the heist.",
      "At the time, Gary worked as a customer service agent in airports for the transport company. His task was to welcome VIPs arriving at Paris airports and escort them through passport and customs checks. Through this job, he met the Kardashians several times.",
      "But he also worked at a caf\u00e9 owned by another defendant, Florus H\u00e9roui, 52, to whom investigators believe Madar passed on information about Kim Kardashian.",
      "He has denied this and his lawyer has told the BBC that Madar should not be on the dock as there is \"no solid proof\" of his involvement.",
      "Marc Boyer, 78, who is accused of supplying the weapon that was used to threaten Kardashian, was also questioned at length. He expressed regret that his son Marc-Alexandre Boyer - also a defendant - had grown up surrounded by \"thieves\" and \"crooks\" who had led him to make the wrong life choices.",
      "The rest of the week will see more defendants take the stand as the trial ticks on towards 13 May - the day Kim Kardashian is expected to testify.",
      "Most of the 400 journalists reporting on this trial are expected to flock to the courthouse that day, and court staff are unsure how they will accommodate so many reporters who will want a front seat.",

      "The trial is taking place eight and a half years after the heist.",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and author of a book on the robbery, told the BBC that Paris courts were busy with large terrorism trials for several years, which created a backlog.",
      "She also said the long wait had to do with the defendants' age and health issues which meant they spent little time in provisional detention.",
      "\"Once they were freed it felt less urgent for judges to bring this to trial,\" Tourancheau said."

      "Jeremy Vine has said he will no longer post videos of his encounters with motorists while cycling because of the level of online abuse he receives - saying \"it did get to me\".",
      "The TV and radio presenter has for years been posting clips of his London commute, and making the case that some motorists in his videos are driving dangerously and greater consideration needs to be given to cyclists.",
      "He spoke to BBC Radio 4's World at One on Monday about his decision, after announcing on social media on Sunday that he would stop uploading the videos.",
      "\"I do have to deal with quite a lot of incoming, what you would have called flak in the olden days, but now they call it trolling,\" he said.",
      "\"I shouldn't mind, but in the end I just thought I just want to now switch the narrative, I don't want to do this any more and in the end it did get to me,\" the BBC Radio 2 presenter added.",
      "\"Car driving is a religion in this country,\" he said, adding \"if you say anything that runs counter, that's what you get.\"",
      "He read out examples of the comments he had received online, in which people said they wanted to see him injured on the road, or made personal comments about his family.",
      "\"Please only upload another cycling video if it's you getting run down and hospitalised,\" was among the comments Vine read out.",

      "He left little doubt about his personal determination to stamp out bad behaviour at the BBC.",
      "But will he succeed?",
      "The Respect at Work 2025 report was commissioned following Huw Edwards' guilty pleas last year. The corporation was reeling from the revelations surrounding one of its biggest names.",
      "But 12 years ago, a report was published after a scandal involving another former BBC star.",
      "That 2013 Respect at Work review looked into BBC culture in light of Jimmy Savile's depravity. It found bullying was an issue inside the corporation, with some people viewed as \"untouchable\" because of their status and colleagues too scared to speak up, for fear of reprisals.",
      "The then director general, Tony Hall, said he wanted \"zero tolerance of bullying\". The BBC brought in a series of measures, including updating its policies and setting up a confidential helpline.",
      "'We have your backs'",
      "On Monday, the current director general, Tim Davie, said he was \"totally committed to make long-lasting change.\"",
      "He said staff must feel confident to speak up and they will be supported (unless their complaints are malicious) without any negative impact on their careers.",
      "\"We have your backs,\" he said. He announced a series of measures including a new code of conduct, a more robust disciplinary policy and leadership training.",
      "All organisations have bad apples, but the power dynamics in a media company are multi-layered. Well-known presenters, for example, can wield extraordinary influence, as well as behind-the-scenes editors and managers.",
      "Then there is the issue of an industry that often relies on freelancers, who have even less power. 30% of freelancers told the report they had seen inappropriate behaviour at the BBC. Less than half said they would feel safe speaking up. That is sobering.",
      "Equally, in BBC news and current affairs, only 48% of staff who answered a recent survey said they thought the corporation dealt with bullying and harassment concerns appropriately.",
      "This is all about power imbalances. Will BBC employees ever feel confident that the organisation really will have their backs if they decide to complain?",
      "My sense is that the biggest consideration when deciding whether to make a formal complaint is the fact that the person you are complaining about will be told you have done so. If that person is your boss, or a close colleague, how can you be sure that it won't have an impact on your career?",
      "But equally, if you don't take formal action, then there is a perception that offenders consistently get away with bad behaviour. There are rumours and stories about particular individuals inside the BBC, just as there are in all organisations.",
      "The proof, perhaps, of whether these new policies are working will be whether the small number of people whose names are often raised internally, accused informally of bad behaviour, will now face more scrutiny; whether colleagues will feel confident to raise a formal complaint.",
      "The report makes clear the majority of people enjoy working at the BBC and that there isn't a toxic culture. But it also talks of some names repeated several times as people who are \"not being held to account for poor behaviour\".",
      "Who are those people and is any action being taken in light of this review?",
      "The report doesn't name names, either complainants or those accused.",
      "A BBC source told me the corporation will always act if necessary on any information it becomes aware of.",
      "But in pockets of the BBC there is real anger that bullying by individuals is an open secret - and there's a belief that complainants aren't protected. Shah and Davie are promising that will change.",
      "It takes time to change cultures. While some behaviour is always unacceptable - sexual harassment or physical assault for example - the report also talks about grey areas, including colleagues being tetchy or rude, ridiculing ideas or using aggressive language. The plan is to nip these in the bud.",
      "Sometimes this kind of behaviour has been blamed on working in a high pressure environment, for example a newsroom, where short-term emotions can run high. It's not an excuse, Davie said.",
      "The report was commissioned because of the BBC's newsroom's most high-profile star, Huw Edwards. But his name was never mentioned over its 60 pages.",
      "Perhaps the evidence of real culture change will be if this is the last report the BBC ever does about workplace culture."

      "All her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.",
      "Yunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.",
      "She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.",
      "The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.",
      "But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",
      "Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",
      "Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.",
      "Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".",
      "Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not.",
      "One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.",
      "By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.",
      "Gun wielding robbers fled on bikes and on foot",
      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",
      "The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.",
      "They found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him.",
      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",
      "It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.",
      "\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.",
      "Blunders meant heist was doomed from the start",
      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",
      "\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.",
      "'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".",
      "\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed.",
      "\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"",
      "The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.",
      "\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.",
      "Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness.",
      "Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.",
      "In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.",
      "However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.",
      "\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

    "story": [
      "A 29-year-old doctor from Bristol has had her eyesight saved after a \"game-changing\" test identified a mystery infection that had plagued her health for five years.",
      "Ellie Irwin suffered persistent inflammation in her right eye that didn't go away, resulting in blurred vision. No treatment helped and at one point she even considered having her eye removed.",
      "It was only after Ellie was offered a \"last resort\" analysis called metagenomics, that she was diagnosed with a rare bacterial infection which was cured with antibiotics.",
      "\"It's been transformative,\" Ellie told the BBC. \"I feel so fortunate.\"",
      "Professor Carlos Pavesio, consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says Ellie's case is a \"breakthrough in the diagnosis of infectious diseases\".",
      "\"There are many patients we treat with chronic infections for years, but despite multiple tests we cannot identify the bug responsible,\" he says.",
      "In 2019, while still at medical school, Ellie began suffering from inflammation in her right eye. All tests for infection came back negative and it was assumed she had an autoimmune condition.",
      "Ellie was prescribed steroid eye drops and immunosuppressants, some of which needed to be given by intravenous infusion.",
      "\"It was completely dominating my life,\" Ellie says. \"I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor. My vision was really variable, and I would have some bad days.",
      "\"I was on so much medication and going to so many appointments, yet I didn't feel I was getting any better.\"",
      "The treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school.",
      "Ellie says she eventually reached \"breaking point\", and even began considering having her affected eye removed.",
      "\"Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying,\" she says, \"my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye.\"",
      "It was one of Ellie's doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection.",
      "Metagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, fungi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens.",
      "A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie's eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world.",
      "Currently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish.",
      "For viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test. These will be familiar to many from the pandemic, when millions sent off swabs in the post to confirm whether they had Covid.",
      "However, Dr Julianne Brown, principal clinical scientist at the GOSH metagenomics service, says PCR has some drawbacks.",
      "\"The trouble with PCR is that you have to think of the viruses that might be causing an infection and do a separate test for each and every one,\" she says. \"So if you've got an infection with something that's unexpected, rare or not previously known, you won't find it.\"",
      "Dr Brown says metagenomics is \"an enormous step up - it's a complete game-changer\".",
      "In Ellie's case, metagenomics diagnosed a rare strain of the bacterial infection leptospirosis found in South America.",
      "It is now presumed Ellie picked up the bug swimming in the Amazon river in 2018, while on a trip to Ecuador and Colombia.",
      "Ellie says it was an emotional moment when she was given the results of the test.",
      "\"I broke down - I just had to cry. I never imagined that it would come back positive and be for something that was treatable,\" she says.",
      "\"I was given three weeks of antibiotics and within days my vision was clearer and the inflammation subsided.\"",
      "A single metagenomics test costs around \u00a31,300, which is far more than standard diagnostics. However, as the technology is developed that price is likely to fall rapidly.",
      "Virologist Professor Judy Breuer, who has been developing metagenomics at GOSH and University College London (UCL) for more than a decade, says her team currently receives three or four samples a week from hospitals around the UK for metagenomic testing in addition to those it carries out on its own patients.",
      "These are often samples from parts of the body that are normally sterile sites, where bacteria are not usually found such as the brain, central nervous system, liver and eye.",
      "\"In the future, we think metagenomics will become a first line test and be able to diagnose infection in any sample, probably within the same day,\" she says.",
      "It's also likely to become faster, cheaper and easier to do, explains Dr Brown, meaning it will become available to more patients rather than just a small number who are severely unwell.",
      "Resolving her eye problems has allowed Ellie to concentrate on her training as a GP and arrange her wedding.",
      "Ellie was married in Newcastle on 29 March, the same day the city celebrated   Newcastle United's win in the Carabao Cup.",
      "She says: \"We got a shout-out from Ant and Dec and went up on a scissor lift above the Newcastle United fans, which was incredible.\"",

      "In March 2023, Belfast City councillors passed a motion in favour of setting up a safe injecting facility to help prevent overdoses among drug users.",
      "The council has no legal power to open a facility and a change in legislation would be required for this to happen.",
      "The aim would be to reduce overdoses and drug-related harm as well as making drug use less visible to the community.",

      "\"While every patient's journey may be different, together you are ensuring that a cancer diagnosis need never mean facing the future without hope and support,\" said the King.",

      "X-rays called mammograms are offered to women between the age of 50 and 71 every three years to check for signs of cancer, but can currently only be performed by female staff.",
      "The Society of Radiographers (SoR) has called for a change in policy due to \"critical\" staff shortages among radiographers who specialise in this area.",
      "Sally Reed, 67, who had two mastectomies after mammograms revealed breast cancer, told the BBC that \"if something can save your life you should go for it\" - whether it's administered by a woman or man.",
      "Major breast cancer screening AI trial to begin",
      "Women urged to book breast screening appointments",
      "'I may not have been here today without mammogram'",
      "But Sally also admits women who already don't want to go for breast screening \"would definitely be turned off by a man\".",
      "Breast X-rays, which look for cancers that are too small to see or feel, are only permitted to be undertaken by female health workers. Mammography is the only health examination carried out exclusively by female staff.",
      "According to radiographers, the vacancy rate among mammographers who specialise in breast exams is 17.5%.",
      "Among mammographers who assess women who have found a lump in their breast or have a family history of breast cancer, the figure is 20%.",
      "It takes three to four years to qualify as a radiographer through a university degree.",
      "Changes to staffing were being discussed at the annual SoR conference, with discussions also taking place over whether transgender men should be included in the NHS breast screening programme.",
      "Sue Johnson, who represents the SoR, told the BBC: \"The role of the radiographer has developed and evolved and there is a much broader scope to the job role than simply taking the images.",
      "\"It's a very desirable and enjoyable career and men are saying 'we would like to access that same career and we could help deliver the service'\".",
      "Johnson said she believes this could help the recruitment of more radiographers and open up the job to more qualified people because \"mammography doesn't get as much publicity\" as other health professions.",
      "The prospect of men performing mammograms has been explored unsuccessfully in the past, but Johnson believes \"the world has changed\" and that \"the time is right\" to start reconsidering the role.",
      "She says women would still be given a choice on who conducted their mammogram if they didn't feel comfortable with a man doing it.",
      "Ms Reed said having two mammograms 15 years apart were responsible for \"saving\" her life.",
      "She's now had two mastectomies after two separate breast cancer diagnoses.",
      "Because of what she's gone through, having a male radiographer \"wouldn't bother me at all\", she says.",
      "But Claire Rowney, chief executive of charity Breast Cancer Now, says \"it's vital that efforts to build up the screening workforce do not inadvertently damage uptake of breast screening\".",
      "She says that \"while we welcome every effort to reduce staff shortages and delays in breast screening, we know that concerns about being seen by a male mammographer already deter some women from attending breast screening, even with current staffing being all-female\".",
      "Ms Rowney adds that recruiting male mammographers could be an issue for some women in ethnic minority communities, who may have greater concerns around preserving their modesty and who may be less likely to take up the offer of screening."

      "The government is consulting on proposals to end the exemption from the tax for milk-based drinks, as well as non-dairy substitutes such as oats or rice.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in her autumn budget last year that the government was considering widening the levy.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride labelled the move a \"sucker punch\" to households when Labour had \"already pushed up the cost of living for families\".",
      "The sugar tax, known formally as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), is a tax on pre-packaged drinks such as those sold in cans and cartons in supermarkets.",
      "It applies to manufacturers and was introduced by the Conservative government in April 2018 as a means to tackle obesity.",
      "On Monday, the Treasury also confirmed proposals to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml.",
      "Some 203 pre-packed milk-based drinks on the market, which make up 93% of sales within the category, will be hit with the tax unless their sugar content is reduced in accordance with the proposals, government analysis says.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government was consulting on \"going further\" with the existing levy after it was shown to have had a particular impact on children's health.",
      "\"We are making sure we are taking practical, sensible measures to improve the health of our children,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children.",
      "Announcing the planned changes, the Treasury said young people only get 3.5% of their calcium intake from such drinks, meaning \"it is also likely that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar\".",
      "\"By bringing milk-based drinks and milk substitute drinks into the SDIL, the government would introduce a tax incentive for manufacturers of these drinks to build on existing progress and further reduce sugar in their recipes,\" it added.",
      "The government estimates that 89% of soft drinks sold in the UK are not subject to the tax because of widespread reformulation by manufacturers since 2018.",
      "But it added that the levy had effectively created a \"target\" of just below the 5g threshold, and products had clustered below 5g as a result.",
      "The government consultation will run from Monday until 21 July.",
      "No drinks with sweeteners for younger children, say UK advisers",
      "Top-brand baby food pouches lack key nutrients",
      "Are sweeteners healthier than sugar?",
      "The SDIL has raised a total of \u00a31.9 billion since its introduction in 2018, according to government statistics released last September. Revenue for HMRC for the 2023-24 financial year was \u00a3338 million.",
      "Opponents of the levy in recent years include the soft drinks industry, pubs and off licences. Some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to tackle obesity.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the BBC on Tuesday he was \"sick to death of a government telling us how we should live\" and said the focus should be on educating people who can then make decisions about their health.",
      "Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she had not been a \"fan\" of the levy when it was first introduced by her party, calling it \"a bit too much nanny state\".",
      "She told BBC Breakfast: \"My worry is that the government does not have any plans... and so they're just looking for what else they can tax.\"",
      "But Tam Fry, the chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said he welcomed the proposals \"tremendously\" and said it was \"high-time\" the levy was extended.",
      "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was \"not a game-changer\" in terms of tackling obesity, but \"one of those things that is needed\".",
      "Industry body the Food and Drink Federation said it welcomed the chance to share its views in the consultation.",
      "It said \"significant progress\" had already been made and \"many years of investment in research and development\" had reduced sugar in soft drinks by 46% in the last five years, with a 30% sugar reduction in pre-packed milk-based drinks in the last three years.",
      "It added that food and drink manufacturers were facing a series of inflationary pressures and called on the government to \"continue to create the right conditions for businesses to innovate and also be clear about their long-term goals to promote business confidence\"."

      "The ex-Labour prime minister argued the climate change debate had become \"irrational\" and people in rich countries no longer wanted to make financial sacrifices \"when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal\".",
      "His comments have been seized on by opposition parties as an attack on Sir Keir Starmer's plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2050.",
      "Asked about the comments at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said: \"If you look at the detail of what Tony Blair said he's absolutely aligned with what we're doing here.\"",
      "Labour ministers have insisted the drive to net zero will not involve any financial sacrifices and have minimal impact on people's lives.",
      "Minutes before PMQs, the Tony Blair Institute (TBI) issued a statement saying they \"support the government's 2050 net zero targets\" and that the UK government's approach is \"the right one\".",
      "Questioned whether the institute had been asked by the government to issue a clarification to help defuse a growing political row, the prime minister's spokesman said: \"I won't get into private conversations.\"",
      "Sir Keir's spokesman also stressed that the PM had confidence in Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, adding that he was \"doing a great job\".",
      "But he said the PM did not agree with Sir Tony that there was too much \"hysteria\" in the climate change debate.",

      "It says the focus should instead be on emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage and nuclear fusion - and new international effort to persuade the world's biggest economies, such as China and India, to cut their emissions.",

      "Speaking to Parliament's Human Rights Joint Committee,  Shabana Mahmood said judges at the UK's highest court \"provided the legal clarity in their legal decision which is exactly their job\".",
      "The decision was seen as a victory by women's rights groups but some trans campaigners have argued it did not take into account their view of the complexities of biology and a transgender former judge says she plans to bring an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights .",
      "Mahmood said: \"It's disappointing... that some individuals have sought to question the validity of the Supreme Court or cast aspersions...\"",
      "Supreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman",
      "Trans former judge plans to challenge gender ruling at European court",
      "Equality watchdog issues interim guidance on single-sex spaces",
      "In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\".",
      "This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces.",
      "The judges said trans people are still protected from discrimination under equalities legislation, and that this interpretation of the law does not cause disadvantage to the \"potentially vulnerable group\".",
      "The Equalities and Human Rights Commission also published interim guidance after the ruling which said trans women \"should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\" in workplaces or public-facing services.  The same applies to trans men, who are biologically female.",
      "But it said that trans people \"should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use\".",
      "Mahmood was speaking to MPs and peers a day after Dr Victoria McCloud, the only UK judge to publicly say she is transgender, said she is planning to bring an appeal case before the European Court of Human Rights.",
      "Dr McCloud, who stepped down from a High Court role last year, said the Supreme Court judgement and equality watchdog's new guidance violated her human rights and she felt \"contained and segregated\".",
      "She said the ruling had failed to consider human rights arguments that would have been put by trans people and the judgement had left her with the legal \"nonsense\" of being \"two sexes at once\".",
      "Some trans campaigners have expressed disappointment at the ruling. They argued, for example, it is impossible for services - from police officers performing a strip search through to restaurants - to truly specify someone's biology, pointing to intersex cases as an example of where biological sex is not binary.",
      "The Supreme Court ruling was the culmination of a long-running legal battle brought by campaign group For Women Scotland, which had argued that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. The group had argued that women felt unsafe with trans women using female facilities.",
      "Mahmood told the committee the Supreme Court had \"handled things very sensitively\".",
      "She said the judges have \"done their job and I think they've sought to do it in a way that recognises that we're talking about a balance of rights but sought to give confidence to a minority community that they still have protections from discrimination\".",
      "In her evidence, to the Human Rights Joint Committee, the justice secretary also addressed the government's policy on transgender prisoners.",
      "Mahmood said it \"strikes the right balance\" but \"we will obviously now go back and with the clarity from the Supreme Court just make sure that that policy still stands to scrutiny or whether we need to make any changes\".",
      "The justice secretary said the vast majority of trans women inmates are within the male estate, and she had not moved any trans prisoners into women's jails since taking office last July.",
      "Prison service data for 2023-24 shows there were 295 transgender prisoners in England and Wales, with 51 in female prisons and 244 in male prisons.",
      "But she said: \"No trans women convicted of a rape or serious violence offence who retains birth genitalia would ever be considered for being placed in the women's estate.\"",

    "summary": "The government has been facing growing demands to reveal which areas are running grooming gang inquires.",
    "story": [
      "Kemi Badenoch has accused the government of breaking its promise to set up five local inquiries into grooming gangs despite pledging to do so.",
      "The Conservative leader said Sir Keir Starmer had promised \u00a35m to fund five locally-led investigations into grooming gangs but delivered just one, in Oldham.",
      "During Prime Ministers Questions, Badenoch suggested Sir Keir was \"dragging his heels\" on inquiries to shield Labour-run councils from scandal.",
      "Sir Keir said Labour were \"investing more in delivering truth and justice\" for victims of grooming gangs than the Conservatives had during \"14 long years\" in power.",
      "Ministers have been facing growing demands to reveal which areas are running grooming gang inquires alongside the review in Oldham, and a three-month audit of national evidence being led by government troubleshooter Baroness Louise Casey.",
      "Earlier this month Tom Crowther, the barrister helping to develop the schemes, suggested local inquiries into grooming gangs had stalled since they were announced in January.",
      "Crowther, who chaired the inquiry into child sex abuse in Telford, Shropshire, gave evidence to the Commons Home Affairs Committee at the start of April and told MPs he had asked a government official \"do you still want me?\"",
      "The issue was again raised in the Commons on Monday, when Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips told MPs she expected there to be more than five local inquires.",
      "Labour was focusing on ensuring \"there is a local process of accountability that actually changes things on the ground\", Phillips told MPs.",
      "More local grooming inquiries expected - minister",
      "Local grooming gang reviews will go ahead, says Cooper",
      "During a heated PMQs exchange, Badenoch sought to tie grooming gang inquiries to the local elections, a series of councils and mayoral votes across England on Thursday.",
      "The Tory leader said voters faced a choice of \"chaos and cover-ups under Labour councils or better services under the Conservatives\".",
      "Badenoch repeatedly asked Sir Keir for an update on the local inquires. When he did not respond, she said he \"cannot name a single place because nothing is happening\".",
      "She questioned whether the prime minister was \"dragging his heels\" on local inquiries into grooming gangs because he \"doesn't want Labour cover-ups exposed\", adding that the inquiries hadn't started because \"local authorities don't want to investigate themselves\".",
      "A national inquiry was needed as local probes \"cannot force witnesses to appear\" and \"cannot force people to give evidence under oath\", Badenoch said.",
      "Sir Keir accused Badenoch of \"staying silent\" on the issue in government while he \"oversaw the first grooming gang prosecution\" as Director of Public Prosecutions.",
      "He told the Commons: \"I was the prosecutor who brought the first case.",
      "\"On the back of that I then changed the entire approach to prosecutions, which was then lauded by the government that we were doing the right thing, and brought those prosecutions.\"",
      "In contrast to the Conservatives, Labour were \"implementing existing recommendations\" of the 2022 national inquiry into child sexual abuse and \"providing for local inquiries\", he said.",
      "For more than a decade there has been a series of high-profile cases where groups of men, predominantly of Pakistani descent, were convicted of sexually abusing and raping mainly white girls in the UK.",
      "In 2022, Prof Alexis Jay published the conclusions of a seven-year national inquiry into child sexual abuse, which investigated abuse in churches and schools, as well as by grooming gangs.",
      "The Conservative have been calling for a second national inquiry into grooming gangs since the issue was thrust back into the spotlight by tech billionaire Elon Musk at the start of the year.",
      "The proposal was backed by opposition MPs, as well as some Labour figures including Rotherham MP Sarah Champion alongside Labour mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham.",
      "Speaking in the House of Lords, Labour's Baroness Hazarika offered an apology on behalf of the Muslim community for the \"sickening, despicable, wicked acts\" of child grooming gangs.",
      "She said that many people in Muslim community were as appalled as anyone else, telling peers: \"This is not who we are\", and added that many of the men were abusing Muslim women as well as white women.",
      "The Liberal Democrats have called for the the government to focus on implementing all 20 of the recommendations made by the Jay inquiry.",
      "On Monday, party spokesperson Lisa Smart said MPs \"owe it to\" victims to not just \"offer words of support, but to deliver justice and bring offenders to account\".",
      "Reform UK have backed calls for a national inquiry and have previously offered to fund their own.",
      "Party leader Nigel Farage has previously accused both Labour and Tories of \"failing to bring justice to the thousands of victims across multiple decades of these horrific crimes\".",
      "Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer said Badenoch \"appears determined to use this issue as an excuse to push her own agenda and try to make political capital\".",
      "\"A leader of a major political party who is serious about tackling sexual abuse and exploitation of girls would put the victims and their needs front and centre and offer support for action to tackle misogyny,\" she added.",

      "Any offender sentenced to more than a year in prison, as well as terrorists and war criminals, can currently be refused asylum and deported under the Refugee Convention.",
      "The government want to widen the scope to include anyone convicted of a crime that would see them put on the sex offenders register in the UK, regardless of the length of their sentence.",

      "Nearly 42,000 UK asylum seekers waiting on appeal",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Cooper said ministers would move to classify sex offences as a \"particularly serious crime\" - enabling the government to reject the asylum applications of sex offenders.",
      "Cooper also called for \"stronger\" rules to stop judges blocking the deportation of migrants on human rights grounds, suggesting there could be a new \"framework\" set by Parliament in future, although she did not provide details.",
      "The government is currently reviewing how the right to a family life contained in Article 8 in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is applied in immigration cases, with an update expected in the coming weeks.",
      "Article 8 has been used by some migrants and asylum seekers to successfully appeal deportation.",
      "Asked about the issue on Radio 4's Today Programme, Cooper she had \"concerns about some of the individual cases\" where the government \"disagreed\" with decisions made in the courts.",
      "\"Respect for family life is supposed to be balanced against other issues, including against the public interest, including against the ability for a government to set its own policies, for Parliament to set policies, and for respect for border security and control,\" she added.",
      "It is not clear how many cases the change could affect.",
      "The planned crackdown would apply to those committing an offence that places them on the sex offenders register in the UK.",

      "Ezedi killed himself within hours after he was suspected of dousing his ex-girlfriend with a corrosive liquid when he attacked her and her children in south London in January last year.",
      "He was already on the sex offenders register, after pleading guilty to charges of sexual assault and exposure in 2018, when he was granted asylum in 2020 following two failed attempts.",
      "The changes will be introduced through an amendment to the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament.",

      "\"The Conservatives had already tabled tough, clear reforms to remove all foreign criminals and to disapply the Human Rights Act so activists and lawyers cannot block deportations.",
      "\"But Labour voted against our measures - they are not serious about controlling our borders.\"",

      "Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, welcomed efforts to resolve asylum cases quickly, but warned the use of AI could \"backfire\" if it produced flawed decisions that end up in the courts.",

      "It applies to manufacturers and was introduced by the Conservative government in April 2018 as a means to tackle obesity.",

      "The government estimates that 89% of soft drinks sold in the UK are not subject to the tax because of widespread reformulation by manufacturers since 2018.",
      "But it added that the levy had effectively created a \"target\" of just below the 5g threshold, and products had clustered below 5g as a result.",

      "Opponents of the levy in recent years include the soft drinks industry, pubs and off licences. Some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to tackle obesity.",

      "Industry body the Food and Drink Federation said it welcomed the chance to share its views in the consultation.",

    "story": [
      "Rates of knife crime, violence against women, and theft could rise in London without more government funding, the Metropolitan Police commissioner has warned.",
      "In a report, due to be presented by Sir Mark Rowley to the London Policing Board this week, he says the force \"must be honest to Londoners that in light of the budget, we are shrinking as an organisation\".",
      "The commissioner acknowledges that extra funding from the Home Office and City Hall means the Met's final settlement is \"nearly \u00a3100m better\" than it feared in November 2024, when he warned of a \u00a3450m funding gap and \"eye-watering cuts\" to services.",
      "The Home Office has been asked to comment.",
      "Sir Mark says unless the Met receives more money in June's spending review, the government risks being unable to meet its own national promises to halve knife crime, and violence against women and girls, over the next decade.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told BBC London last week that a review of the Met's finances is currently under way, alongside the mayor and Scotland Yard.",
      "The commissioner's report states the force wants to grow in size to 38,000 officers and 19,000 staff, but is forecast to have just 31,248 officers and 10,972 staff by the end of the year.",
      "He predicts the Met will lose about 1,700 officers, PCSOs and staff, but that additional funding may allow the force to reduce the losses by speeding up recruitment.",
      "'Less capacity, increasing demand'",
      "The report warns that with no additional investment, London may experience \"sustained increases\" in knife crime, violence against women and girls (VAWG), and theft.",
      "\"We will have less policing capacity and capability at a time when demand has been steadily increasing,\" the commissioner writes.",
      "\"Undoubtedly this will impact our ability to respond to victims of crime and Londoners and have consequences for our own officers and staff and our reform plans.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Met detailed a list of savings it would need to make in order to protect frontline services such as neighbourhood policing and public protection teams, which tackle sex offences and domestic abuse.",
      "Those plans include scrapping the Royal Parks police and Safer Schools officers, along with cuts to forensics and mounted police, and potentially taking firearms off the Flying Squad.",
      "Sir Mark's report warns the financial challenges are likely to have a \"negative impact on the speed and scale\" of reforms, which the force is under pressure to make following a series of scandals and a highly critical review two years ago by Baroness Casey.",

      "Over 300 quango bosses received a higher salary than the prime minister last year, according to the TaxPayers' Alliance (TPA).",
      "Quango stands for quasi autonomous non-governmental organisations, which means they are taxpayer-funded but not directly controlled by central government, and include watchdogs as well as the prison service.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer axed the biggest quango, NHS England, last month and the government is currently reviewing hundreds of quangos in a bid to reduce bureaucratic waste and inefficiency.",
      "John O'Connell, chief executive of the TPA, said there should be more scrutiny of the hundreds of \"quangocrats\" taking home \"massive pay packets\" with minimal democratic oversight.",

      "Ministers to review hundreds of public bodies",
      "Starmer pitches reform to 'shackled' civil servants",

      "In all, 315 quango chief executives received a higher salary, according to the TPA, with the top three being Channel 4's on \u00a3619,000, the chief executive of HS2 on \u00a3618,195, and head of Network Rail on \u00a3588,000.",
      "The research also found that at least 1,472 quango staff received more than \u00a3100,000 in total remuneration, which included salary, expenses and pension benefits.",
      "The TPA definition of a quango is wider than others and includes any non-ministerial department, public corporation, agency or other public body included in the government's departments, agencies and public bodies list, including the Bank of England and the BBC.",
      "Mr O'Connell said the TPA backed the Labour government's review of quangos, and urged more focus on scrapping unnecessary functions and bringing delivery of significant services back under political control.",
      "He said: \"Taxpayers will be shocked to hear that there are hundreds of quangocrats heading up bodies they may never have heard taking home massive pay packets the average Brit can only dream of.",
      "\"But beyond the healthy remuneration, arguably the bigger problem is that in many areas of government policy these quango bosses reign supreme, with minimal ministerial or parliamentary oversight despite the often highly sensitive and significant nature of what their organisation is responsible for.",
      "\"The government may have signalled an intent to get a grip of the quango state, but as well as restoring political accountability there needs to be serious review of some of the functions they perform.\"",
      "However, Matthew Gill, the Institute for Government's programme director on public bodies, said focusing on the pay of quango bosses could be misleading.",
      "\"It is important that public bodies are democratically accountable, but ministers cannot micro-manage everything in the public sector,\" he said.",
      "\"They need good people running things \u2013 and pay that is too low to attract them is a false economy.",
      "\"It is very difficult to evaluate whether public sector leaders are paid appropriately without benchmarking their pay to the private sector.\"",
      "Under Sir Keir, the Labour government has set up more than 20 new quangos, including Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals; and Skills England, which aims to support people in finding jobs.",
      "Almost 60% of day-to-day government spending is channelled through quangos, with \u00a3353.3bn budgeted for them in 2022/23, according to the latest published figures.",
      "The last major shake-up was under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, when a \"bonfire of the quangos\" scrapped nearly a third of them, including the Audit Commission and the UK Film Council.",
      "Asked last month if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",
      "Meanwhile, the government has announced it will merge the Valuation Office Agency, which values properties for council tax and business rates, into HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) by April 2026.",
      "It is the latest quango to be scrapped in a move the Treasury said would increase efficiency and cut duplication.",

      "When asked to clarify this, the EHRC pointed to a section of the Supreme Court ruling stating that trans men could be excluded from women's facilities \"where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance or attributes to which reasonable objection might be taken\" in the context of a women-only service.",

      "If the business cannot recover over the next four years, the rest of her 28 staff, who are nearly all local women who became stylists after serving an apprenticeship at the salon, are facing potential redundancy.",

      "\"Where are the future hairdressers going to come from if good, employed salons go out of business?\"",
      "Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, \"totally goes against the objectives of the government\" in growing the economy and supporting workers.",
      "Part of the pressure is coming from the UK's Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage.",
      "\"If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,\" Kerry explained.",

      "For Kerry's salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a \"devastating\" \u00a323,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to \u00a35,000 and changes to business rates.",

      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",

      "The extent of the mosquito population is being understood thanks to a successful citizen science project.",
      "Midge bite or a mosquito?",
      "University researchers had received numerous reports from the public of nuisance biting and originally suspected midges or clegs to be responsible.",
      "Further analysis showed the areas in question were swarming with mosquitoes, actively trying to bite people.",
      "Over the last 12 months more than 700 potential sightings and photos were submitted to the ongoing Mosquito Scotland project.",
      "After analysis, more than half were confirmed to be mosquitoes with 21 different species now calling Scotland home.",
      "While sightings from the public were at their peak during the summer, reports were submitted to the team in every month of last year.",
      "The insects are most often spotted in woodland areas, particularly pine forests in the east, though they are often found inland in our biggest cities. In Glasgow larvae was found floating in stagnant water such as garden plant pots and ponds.",
      "Heather Ferguson, professor of medical entomology at the University of Glasgow, described the initial response to their three-year long project as \"tremendous\".",
      "She said: 'We found them to a much greater extent than we've known before.",

      "In addition to the public sightings, the team hung traps at 24 locations across the country, luring the insects by the smell of carbon dioxide which mimics human breath.",
      "Dr Georgia Kirby leads the citizen science project and said public reporting has guided where they hang the traps, which can sometimes catch more than 1,000 mosquitoes in just two days.",
      "She said: \"There were several areas of Scotland where we received lots of reports of bites but very few photos of the culprits \u2013 understandably, as most people don't want to hold still for a photo while they're being bitten by insects.",
      "\"We had suspected that midges or clegs could be responsible, but in our follow-up investigations we invariably found that these locations were swarming with mosquitoes \u2013 proving that people in Scotland are good at recognising them and distinguishing them from more familiar insects.",

      "Mosquitoes don't currently pose a health risk to humans in Scotland. The parasite needed to spread infectious disease like malaria is not present here.",
      "However, it was a different story 200 years ago when malaria was common in the UK.",
      "It was present in the east of Scotland in particular and spread by native mosquitoes.",
      "Today, climate change is likely to mean we could see more mosquitoes in Scotland, as our climate becomes warmer and wetter - perfect conditions to allow them to thrive.",

      "The virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and has affected blackbird populations.",

    "story": [
      "One of the world's most endangered amphibians - the strange, perpetually smiling Mexican axolotl - has thrived after being released in artificial wetlands, scientists have discovered.",
      "In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City.",
      "The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they \"survived and foraged successfully at both sites\" - even gaining weight.",
      "Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an \"amazing result\".",
      "The findings are published in the journal PLoS One and they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat.",
      "The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians.",
      "But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed  axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild.",
      "\"If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,\" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico.",
      "It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander.",
      "\"If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,\" Dr Zambrano continued, \"I feel that we have hope for humanity.\"",
      "To lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland \"refuges\" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water,",
      "The scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an \"artificial wetland\".",
      "Every animal was tagged with a radio tracking device.",
      "\"The amazing news is that they all survived,\" Dr Ramos told BBC News. \"And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting.\"",
      "The monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. \"We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,\" Dr Ramos explained.",
      "Somewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically.",
      "But in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover.",
      "\"Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,\" said Dr Ramos. \"And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people.",
      "\"You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out.\""

      "But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.",
      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",

      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

      "That is more than the previous high of 28,100 hectares for the whole year of 2019.",
      "The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and early April helped to create ideal conditions for widespread burning, according to researchers.",
      "Wildfires are very common in the UK in early spring, with plenty of dead or dormant vegetation at the end of winter that can dry out quickly.",
      "The switch back to wetter conditions over the past couple of weeks has largely brought an end to the spell of fires for now, but not before reaching record levels.",
      "The figures from the Global Wildfire Information System only capture fires larger than roughly 30 hectares (0.3 sq km).",
      "More than 80 such fires have been detected across the UK since the beginning of the year.",
      "Most fires are deliberately or accidentally started by humans, but favourable weather conditions can make it much easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly.",
      "\"We had an exceptionally dry and sunny March,\" said Will Lang, head of risk and resilience services at the Met Office.",
      "\"This followed quite a wet autumn and winter, which can have the effect of increasing the vegetation that acts as fuel for any fire that does start.\"",
      "A lack of rainfall in March and April can be particularly conducive to fires.",
      "\"The vegetation is coming out of the winter and it has gone dormant, so it's not growing, and therefore it's very dry and doesn't have water,\" explained Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London.",
      "\"Then in the spring, before you start to collect the water into the live tissue, there is a period where it's very flammable.\"",
      "The seven days from 2 to 8 April saw more than 18,000 hectares (180 sq km) burnt, the highest weekly figure on record.",

      "Fires have also been detected by satellite imagery on the Isle of Arran, the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as in the Mourne Mountains in south-east Northern Ireland. All occurred in early April.",
      "These early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated.",
      "Not all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health.",
      "Certain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover.",
      "Some researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again.",
      "\"My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,\" said Prof Rein, when \"there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic\".",
      "\"You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses.\"",
      "The recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season.",
      "But scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there's lots of variation from year to year.",
      "A study led by the Met Office found that the extreme \"fire weather\" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change.",
      "Shifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk.",

      "Warm weather can also see butterflies emerge. Hotter days earlier in the year can bring out red admirals, previously an exclusively migratory insect.",
      "The peacock and small tortoiseshell are among the first to spread their wings, with more butterflies emerging from April onwards.",
      "Dragonflies start to be seen around this time, too.",

      "Anne McCall, director of RSPB Scotland, says climate change is driving more regular wildfires of greater intensity, and especially so in spring.",
      "\"It is not just vegetation that gets destroyed by wildfire,\" she says. \"This is a critical time of year for our native wildlife \u2013 with birds nesting and other animals such as amphibians and reptiles coming out of winter dormancy and starting to breed.\"",
      "On the coasts, conservation experts say there has been a crop of sightings of whales and dolphins close to British shores \u2013 and though it's difficult to pin down a reason, warming seas and climate change are likely to be a factor.",
      "\"Seeing whales and dolphins in the wild is always an awesome experience but seeing more of them, and more unusual species around UK coast may not be such a good thing,\" says Danny Groves from the charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation.",

      "At the same time, it argues, the public have lost faith in climate policies because the promised green jobs and economic growth have failed to materialise, thanks in part to global instability and the Covid pandemic.",
      "Writing in the foreword, Sir Tony says: \"Though most people will accept that climate change is a reality caused by human activity, they're turning away from the politics of the issue because they believe the proposed solutions are not founded on good policy.\"",
      "He says \"any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail\".",
      "He also warns against the \"alarmist\" tone of the debate on climate change, which he  says is \"riven with irrationality\".",
      "The report calls for the rapid deployment of carbon capture and storage technology, greater use of AI to make energy grids efficient and investment in small scale nuclear reactors.",
      "It also argues for a greater focus on climate change adaptation measures such as flood defences and a new international push to persuade China and India to cut emissions.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, the author of the report dismissed claims that the foundation was rejecting net zero targets, saying it \"is a paper that is about increased climate ambition\".",
      "Lindy Fursman, director of climate and energy policy at the Tony Blair Institute, said:  \"We are certainly not rejecting net zero targets. The paper is really clear that we need to keep these because of the certainty they provide for businesses.\"",

      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",

      "Deforestation surges in 2022 despite pledges",
      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

    "summary": "Bug hunters make money by funding flaws in software, but AI is changing the way they work.",
    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

      "\"The overarching issue is whether she intended to kill or cause very serious injury,\" Justice Christopher Beale said.",
      "Opening the trial on Wednesday, prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC said this case was \"originally thought to be a mass food poisoning event\".",
      "But she alleges Ms Patterson \"deliberately poisoned\" her guests \"with murderous intent\", after inviting them for lunch \"on the pretence she'd been diagnosed with cancer\".",
      "Dr Rogers said the jury would hear evidence that Ms Patterson had travelled to a location, near her home in Leongatha, where death cap mushroom sightings had been logged on a naturalist website.",
      "And in the days after the lunch, she took a number of steps to \"conceal\" what she had done, the prosecution alleged.",
      "There'd be evidence that she lied to investigators about the source of the mushrooms in the dish - saying some had come from Asian grocery in Melbourne and she'd never foraged wild ones. And she made a trip to a local dump to dispose of a food dehydrator prosecutors say she used to prepare the toxic meal.",
      "\"You might be wondering, 'What is the motive?'\" Dr Rogers said to the jury, \"You might still be wondering this at the end of this trial.\"",
      "The prosecution will not be suggesting a specific motive, she explained.",
      "\"You do not have to be satisfied what the motive was, or even that there was one.\"",
      "What the jury could expect to hear, she said, was testimony from a range of witnesses, including: Mr Wilkinson, Ms Patterson's estranged husband Simon Patterson, medical staff who treated the lunch guests, and police who investigated.",
      "However the defence, in opening their case, reminded the jury they had not heard any actual evidence yet and needed to keep an open mind.",
      "Barrister Colin Mandy says while the prosecution will try to cast Ms Patterson's behaviour after the lunch as \"incriminating\", jurors should consider how someone might react in that situation.",
      "\"Might people say or do things that are not well thought out, and might make them look bad?\"",
      "\"The defence case is that she panicked because she was overwhelmed by the fact that these four people had become so ill because of the food she had served them. Three people died.\"",
      "He said Ms Patterson did not deliberately serve poisoned food to her guests.",
      "\"She didn't intend to cause anyone any harm on that day... what happened was a tragedy, a terrible accident.\"",
      "New details on the lunch",
      "The prosecution also detailed allegations of what took place in the lead up to the lunch, and at the table, in open court for the first time.",
      "The trial heard that, in 2023, the accused had been amicably separated from her husband Simon Patterson for years.",
      "\"Simon remained hopeful for some time that he and the accused would someday reunite,\" Dr Rogers told the jury.",
      "He was also planning to attend the gathering but pulled out at the last minute because he had noticed a recent \"change in his relationship\" with Ms Patterson and felt \"uncomfortable\", the prosecutor said. This was something that \"disappointed\" Ms Patterson who \"emphasised the effort she had put into preparing the lunch\".",
      "The jury was told it would hear testimony that Ms Patterson served her guests on large grey plates, but ate off a different, tan orange dish - prompting one of the guests to later ask if she had \"a shortage of crockery\".",
      "They said grace, dug in, and exchanged \"banter\" about how much they had eaten, before discussing how Ms Patterson should share her cancer diagnosis - which the defence admits was fake - with her children.",
      "The lunch party broke up in the early afternoon, and by that night, all of the guests were feeling ill, Dr Rogers says. Within a day, the four had gone to hospital with severe symptoms. Donald Patterson - who had eaten his portion of lunch and about half his wife's - told a doctor he'd vomited 30 times in the space of a few hours.",
      "The prosecutor said the Wilkinsons had asked whether Ms Patterson was also in hospital, as she'd eaten the same meal as them.",
      "She had gone to the hospital, reporting feeling ill, but repeatedly declined to be admitted, the court heard. A doctor who had treated the other lunch guests was so concerned for her welfare he called police to ask for help.",
      "Likewise, the jury was told Ms Patterson kept refusing to seek treatment for her children, who she said had eaten the beef wellington leftovers - albeit with the mushrooms scraped off as they didn't like them.",
      "\"Lots of people might have opinions or theories, but they aren't based on the evidence,\" the defence warned the jury at the end of the day.",
      "\"None of that should have any bearing on your decision.\""

    "summary": "The reality star was tied up and robbed at gunpoint at a luxury Paris hotel in 2016.",
    "story": [
      "The trial has begun of 10 people who are accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at a Paris hotel in 2016.",
      "The reality TV star and business woman was tied up and held at gunpoint in a luxury suite where she was staying during Paris Fashion Week.",
      "About $10m (\u00a37.5m) worth of jewels were taken from her, including a $4m (\u00a32.9m) diamond engagement from then-husband Kanye West.",
      "In a grand courtroom adorned with 19th Century tapestries, the court was given a fascinating snapshot into the lives of the diverse cast of characters suspected of involvement in the heist.",
      "For the first one up - 71-year-old Yunice Abbas - this was done through a \"enqu\u00eate de personnalit\u00e9\", a sort of background report on a person accused of a crime which French courts regularly include in their trials. These reports take in elements of the defendant's family history, behaviour and work to paint a picture of their lives and help jurors make a decision.",
      "The court heard a long list of crimes that Abbas has been found guilty of in the past - from petty crime and small-time drug trafficking to bank robberies - and retraced his difficult childhood, which was partly spent in Algeria and marked by the deaths of two of his siblings.",
      "Abbas - who has spent almost a third of his life in jail - has already admitted to his role in the heist, and even wrote a memoir entitled I Held Up Kim Kardashian. The president of the court, David De Pas, suggested that the book shows Abbas was proud of what he did - something he has repeatedly denied.",
      "When asked if he had any sympathy for his victims, Abbas said that he never did before the Kardashian heist, \"but this time I do regret what I did\u2026 It opened my eyes.\"",
      "Abbas said that while watching television in jail, he was confronted with relentless coverage of the burglary, which made him realise how much Kim Kardashian had suffered.",
      "\"We just grabbed the lady's handbag but I have discovered there's trauma behind it,\" he said.",
      "The court also focused on Gary Madar, whose brother's company provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for several years. Now 35, the father-of-two has been accused of feeding information to the gang about Kim Kardashian's location on the night of the heist.",
      "At the time, Gary worked as a customer service agent in airports for the transport company. His task was to welcome VIPs arriving at Paris airports and escort them through passport and customs checks. Through this job, he met the Kardashians several times.",
      "But he also worked at a caf\u00e9 owned by another defendant, Florus H\u00e9roui, 52, to whom investigators believe Madar passed on information about Kim Kardashian.",
      "He has denied this and his lawyer has told the BBC that Madar should not be on the dock as there is \"no solid proof\" of his involvement.",
      "Marc Boyer, 78, who is accused of supplying the weapon that was used to threaten Kardashian, was also questioned at length. He expressed regret that his son Marc-Alexandre Boyer - also a defendant - had grown up surrounded by \"thieves\" and \"crooks\" who had led him to make the wrong life choices.",
      "The rest of the week will see more defendants take the stand as the trial ticks on towards 13 May - the day Kim Kardashian is expected to testify.",
      "Most of the 400 journalists reporting on this trial are expected to flock to the courthouse that day, and court staff are unsure how they will accommodate so many reporters who will want a front seat.",

      "Another, Aomar Ait Khedache, will be up on Wednesday - but he is now nearly deaf and mute and will have to write his answers down on a piece of paper.",
      "The trial is taking place eight and a half years after the heist.",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and author of a book on the robbery, told the BBC that Paris courts were busy with large terrorism trials for several years, which created a backlog.",
      "She also said the long wait had to do with the defendants' age and health issues which meant they spent little time in provisional detention.",
      "\"Once they were freed it felt less urgent for judges to bring this to trial,\" Tourancheau said."

      "In the statement, the government said it \"has consistently expressed its firm intention to defend this framework\", a position it adopted because it said \"issues related to citizenship fall entirely within the national sphere of competence\".",
      "The government said the scheme had generated more than \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) for Malta since 2015.",
      "\"The Government of Malta takes pride in the wealth generated through this framework over recent years, which enabled the establishment of a national fund for investment and savings to address the needs of both present and future generations,\" the statement read.",
      "In the ruling, the EU's Court of Justice said a member state cannot grant its nationality - and by extension European citizenship - in exchange for predetermined payments or investments, \"as this essentially amounts to rendering the acquisition of nationality a mere commercial transaction.\"",
      "Although each EU member state determines how they grant nationality, the court said Malta's scheme \"jeopardises the mutual trust\" between member states.",
      "The country risks fines if it does not comply with the judgement.",
      "Tuesday's ruling goes against a report last October from the court's Advocate General at the time, Anthony Collins.",
      "He said the commission had failed to prove that EU law requires a \"genuine link\" between the person and the country to grant lawful citizenship, adding it is for each member state to decide who is \"to be one of their nationals and, as a consequence, who is an EU citizen\".",
      "Malta's government said the court's decision \"ignored\" the previous advocate general's recommendation.",
      "Malta noted it was \"not the only Member State operating similar frameworks\".",
      "In 2022, Malta suspended the scheme for Russian and Belarusian nationals in the wake of Russia's invasion and Europe's crackdown on Kremlin-linked individuals.",
      "The EU has previously called on countries to end the practice, noting that investor citizenship schemes carried \"inherent\" security issues, as well as risks of money laundering, tax evasion and corruption."

    "story": [
      "The Israeli military has released a Palestinian paramedic detained when Israeli troops killed 15 other emergency workers in southern Gaza last month, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said.",
      "Assad al-Nassasra was missing for three weeks until the International Committee of the Red Cross received information he was in Israeli detention.",
      "He was reportedly one of 10 detainees freed at an Israeli border crossing with Gaza on Tuesday.",
      "The Israeli military has not commented. But it had confirmed it was holding Mr Nassasra during a briefing on an internal inquiry into the attack, which identified \"several professional failures\".",
      "The PRCS denounced the findings as an attempt to justify a \"war crime\".",
      "Palestinian Red Crescent says Israeli report into Gaza medics' killings 'full of lies'",
      "'Professional failures' led to killing of Gaza medics, IDF inquiry says",
      "Gaza medic missing since deadly attack being detained by Israel, Red Cross says",
      "Eight PRCS paramedics, six first responders from Gaza's Civil Defence agency, and one employee of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) were killed when their ambulances, a fire engine and a UN vehicle came under fire in the Tal al-Sultan area of Rafah during an emergency call-out early on 23 March.",
      "Their bodies were found buried in shallow graves a week later next to the crushed vehicles.",
      "One other PRCS paramedic survived and said he was released by Israeli forces after being detained alongside Mr Nassasra.",
      "The Israeli military initially said its troops fired on \"suspicious vehicles\" driving in darkness with their headlights and emergency lights off.",
      "But it later said that account was \"mistaken\" after a video found on the mobile phone of one of the dead paramedics - Rifaat Radwan, who was in the same ambulance as Mr Nassasra - showed the convoy was using its emergency lights.",
      "At the end of the video, the ambulances are seen having pulled over on the roadside. The sound of gunfire can then be heard just as Radwan gets out of his ambulance. It continues for more than five minutes and Radwan is heard saying his last prayers, before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching.",
      "On 20 April, the military released a summary of its internal inquiry which said the shooting of the 14 PRCS and Civil Defence workers resulted from \"an operational misunderstanding\" by troops from a reconnaissance battalion \"who believed they faced a tangible threat\".",
      "It found the killing of the Unrwa employee meanwhile \"involved a breach of orders during a combat setting\".",
      "The military said the deputy commander of the reconnaissance battalion was dismissed \"due to his responsibilities as the field commander in this incident and for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief\".",
      "The PRCS condemned the report, saying it was evidence of what it called Israel's \"policy of systemic distortion of the truth\" to protect its soldiers from accountability.",
      "\"The results of the occupation's investigation hold the usual fallacious allegations of rescue teams in Gaza being part of Hamas in order to justify the war crime of targeting medical missions in general, and the war crime of attacking teams and vehicles carrying the protected emblems of the Geneva Conventions in particular,\" it said.",
      "A senior UN humanitarian official in Gaza warned \"a lack of real accountability undermines international law and makes the world a more dangerous place\".",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "At least 52,365 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "The ministry says more than 2,270 people have been killed since Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release the 59 hostages it is still holding.",
      "Palestinian media reported on Tuesday that at least six people were killed in Israeli air and artillery strikes across Gaza City, in the north, including three in the al-Shaaf area.",
      "Another four people were said to have been killed in strikes on tents housing displaced people in the southern al-Mawasi area, near the city of Khan Younis.",
      "Israel has also blocked all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza since 2 March, which the UN says has caused severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.",
      "On Tuesday, the UN's human rights chief urged the world to \"prevent the total collapse of critical life-saving support in Gaza\".",
      "\"Any use of starvation of the civilian population as a method of war constitutes a war crime, and so do all forms of collective punishment,\" Volker T\u00fcrk warned.",
      "The UN has said Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "But Israel has said it is complying with international law and that there is no shortage of aid because 25,000 lorry loads entered Gaza during the recent ceasefire. It has also accused Hamas of stealing supplies, which the group has denied."

    "summary": "The escalation in tensions means it could be years before tourism and businesses thrive again in Kashmir.",
    "story": [
      "One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.",
      "The main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.",
      "Last Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".",
      "The attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.",
      "In the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.",
      "There is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations.",
      "While violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.",
      "Tourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.",
      "At a \"selfie point\" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was \"panic\" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.",
      "Other tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.",
      "After a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.",
      "Among those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was \"don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers\".",
      "\"Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,\" Kulkarni said.",
      "But uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.",
      "Indian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.",
      "India and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.",
      "The escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.",
      "Indian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the \"freedom\" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.",
      "Top leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.",
      "\"This [attack] is a blot on us\u2026How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,\" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.",
      "The cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.",
      "\"After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,\" said Sansare. \"Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.\"",
      "The attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.",
      "The timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now \"looks uncertain\", a source told the BBC.",
      "The region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.",
      "\"People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,\" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.",
      "As the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.",
      "In an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.",
      "He said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.",
      "\"I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood? To the widow of the navy officer who was married barely a few days ago?",
      "\"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir."

      "At least 68 African migrants have been killed in a US air strike on a detention centre in Houthi-controlled north-western Yemen, the armed group's TV channel says.",
      "Al Masirah reported that another 47 migrants were injured, most of them critically, when the centre in Saada province was bombed. It posted graphic footage showing multiple bodies covered in the rubble of a destroyed building.",
      "A US defence official said the US military's Central Command was aware of the claims of civilian casualties.",
      "The strike came hours after Central Command announced its forces had hit more than 800 targets since President Donald Trump ordered an intensification of the air campaign against the Houthis on 15 March.",
      "It said the strikes had \"killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders\", including senior officials overseeing missile and drone programmes.",
      "Houthi-run authorities have said the strikes have killed dozens of civilians, but they have reported few casualties among the group's members.",
      "Who are the Houthis and why is the US targeting them?",
      "Hundreds of migrants killed by Saudi border guards - report",
      "'We make it or we die'",
      "The migrant detention centre in Saada was reportedly holding 115 Africans when it was hit four times shortly before 05:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Monday, according to Al Masirah.",
      "The casualty reports could not be immediately verified, but Al Masirah's videos showed first responders recovering the bodies of at least a dozen men among pieces of concrete and metal debris on the floor of a large building with partially destroyed walls and no roof.",
      "At a local hospital, another injured man told Al Masirah: \"The strike hit us while we were sleeping, that's it.\"",
      "Following a visit to the scene, the chairman of the Somali community in Yemen,  Ibrahim Cabdulqaadir Macallin, told the BBC: \"It was tragic and horrific... I saw burnt people. We couldn't recognise some of the bodies we saw.\"",
      "He said the number of Somali migrants who were killed was \"very small\" because a group had been removed from the detention centre three days earlier, and that the majority of the detainees were Ethiopians.",
      "He also said that the facility was in an \"open area\" and \"not near any military base\".",
      "The Houthi-run interior ministry condemned what it called the \"deliberate bombing\" of the facility and said it constituted a \"war crime\".",
      "The US defence official said Central Command took the claims of civilian casualties very seriously, and that it was currently conducting a battle-damage assessment and inquiry into them.",
      "The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was \"deeply saddened by the reports of the tragic loss of life in Saada\".",
      "\"While IOM has not been operating at this facility, we remain committed to closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to offer support as needed,\" it added.",

      "In 2022, at least 66 people were reportedly killed when the Saudi-led coalition supporting Yemen's government struck a pre-trial detention facility only 100m (330ft) away from the location of Monday's attack.",
      "Al Masirah also reported that another eight people had been killed in overnight US air strikes in the Houthi-controlled capital, Sanaa.",

      "Despite the devastation and humanitarian crisis in Yemen caused by 11 years of conflict, migrants continue to arrive in the country by boat from the Horn of Africa, motivated by political and economic instability, droughts and other extreme weather events in their own countries.",
      "Most of them are intending to cross into neighbouring Saudi Arabia to find work. Instead, they face exploitation, detention, violence, and dangerous journeys through active conflict zones, according to the IOM.",
      "In 2024 alone, it says, almost 60,900 migrants arrived in the country, often with no means to survive. The majority of them are Ethiopians and Somalis.",
      "Thousands of migrants are thought to be held in detention centres like the one in Saada, but there are no official statistics from the Houthi-run authorities. Rights groups say detainees experience dire conditions, including overcrowding, abuse and poor sanitation.",
      "Earlier this month, the Houthi-run government said a series of US air strikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea coast killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others. It said the terminal was a civilian facility and that the strikes constituted a \"war crime\".",
      "Centcom said the attack destroyed the ability of Ras Isa to accept fuel and that it would \"begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities\".",
      "Last month, Trump ordered large-scale strikes on areas controlled by the Houthis and threatened that they would be \"completely annihilated\". He also warned Iran not to arm the group - something it has repeatedly denied doing.",
      "On Sunday, Centcom said it would \"continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region\".",
      "On Monday evening, the Houthis' military spokesman said its forces had retaliated for the US \"aggression and massacres against civilians\" by targeting the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier battle group with \"a number of cruise and ballistic missiles and drones\".",
      "He also said the group had launched a drone towards the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. Israel's military announced earlier that it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen.",
      "Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.",
      "The Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.",
      "The Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden.",
      "After taking office in January, Trump redesignated the Houthis as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organisation\" - a status the Biden administration had removed due to what it said was the need to mitigate the country's humanitarian crisis.",
      "Yemen has been devastated by a civil war, which escalated in 2015 when the Houthis seized control of the country's north-west from the internationally-recognised government, and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US intervened in an effort to restore its rule.",
      "The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid."

    "story": [
      "A child has damaged a painting worth millions of pounds by the American artist Mark Rothko at a museum in Rotterdam.",
      "A spokesperson for the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen said it was considering the \"next steps\" for the treatment of Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8.",
      "The damage occurred during an \"unguarded moment\", a museum spokesperson told the Dutch media outlet Algemeen Dagblad (AD) last week.",
      "A spokesperson for the museum told the BBC the damage was \"superficial\", adding: \"Small scratches are visible in the unvarnished paint layer in the lower part of the painting\".",
      "The abstract painting is estimated to be worth up to \u20ac50m (\u00a342.5m), according to newspaper AD.",
      "\"Conservation expertise has been sought in the Netherlands and abroad. We are currently researching the next steps for the treatment of the painting\", the museum spokesperson told the BBC.",
      "\"We expect that the work will be able to be shown again in the future,\" they added.",
      "Sophie McAloone, the conservation manager at the Fine Art Restoration Company, said that \"modern unvarnished\" paintings like Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 are \"particularly susceptible to damage\".",
      "This is \"owing to a combination of their complex modern materials, lack of a traditional coating layer, and intensity of flat colour fields, which make even the smallest areas of damage instantly perceptible,\" she said.",
      "\"In this case, scratching of the upper paint layers can have a significant impact on the viewing experience of the piece,\" Ms McAloone said.",
      "The Rothko painting was hanging in the museum's Depot \u2013 a publicly accessible storage facility beside the main museum \u2013 as part of an exhibition displaying a selection of \"public favourites\" from the gallery's collection.",
      "Jonny Helm, a marketing manager at the art restoration service Plowden & Smith, said the incident had implications for UK institutions such as V&A East and the British Museum, which are considering \"opening up the display of things that would otherwise be obscured in archives.\"",
      "\"How will this event affect other UK institutions who are opening up their archives in the same way?\" Mr Helm said.",
      "Restoring a Rothko painting is a difficult task because \"Rothko's mixture of pigments and resins and glues were quite complex\", Mr Helm said.",
      "He said the fact the painting is unvarnished \u2013 meaning it is \"open to the environment\" \u2013 will pose an additional challenge to conservators.",
      "Conservators working to restore the painting will now likely be in the process of documenting the extent of the damage and researching \"historic successful treatments\" of Rothko paintings.",
      "\"Rothko works seem to have terrible luck \u2013 this isn't the first damaged Rothko we've heard about,\" Mr Helm said.",
      "Rothko's 1958 work, Black on Maroon, was deliberately vandalised by Wlodzimierz Umaniec at London's Tate Modern gallery in October 2012.",
      "Umaniec was sent to prison for two years and subsequently apologised for his actions.",
      "During his trial, prosecuting barrister Gregor McKinley said the cost of repairing the work would be about \u00a3200,000. It took conservators 18 months to repair the painting.",
      "Rachel Myrtle, Head of Specie and Fine Arts at Aon, a company that offers insurance broking to its clients, said fine art insurance policies typically cover \"all risks associated with physical loss and damage to artwork\".",
      "This includes \"accidental damage caused by children or visitors, albeit with certain exclusions\", she said.",
      "She said that when an artwork is damaged, a gallery's insurer will appoint a specialist fine art loss adjuster to visit the museum.",
      "The loss adjustor typically \"reviews the damage to the artwork, examines any CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the loss, and assesses conservation options\", Ms Myrtle said.",
      "The museum did not comment on who will be held liable for the damage to the 1960 painting, which the gallery reportedly bought in the 1970s.",
      "The Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen has previously billed visitors who have caused damage to artworks on display.",
      "In 2011, the museum asked an unsuspecting tourist who stepped on Wim T. Schippers' peanut butter floor artwork, called Pindakaasvloer, to pay for repairs to the work.",
      "Sharon Cohen, a spokesperson for the museum at the time, was quoted by AD as saying: \"It is normal procedure for people to pay if they damage art.\"",
      "The Rothko painting is described by the museum as an example of colour field painting, a term used to describe art characterised by large blocks of flat, solid colour spread across a canvas.",

      "If you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.",
      "The US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.",
      "Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.",
      "China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.",
      "\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.",
      "His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.",
      "Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?",
      "Xi's domestic challenges",
      "With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.",
      "This has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.",
      "Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.",
      "The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.",
      "Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.",
      "The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.",
      "And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.",
      "They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.",
      "There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.",
      "The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.",
      "\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.",
      "\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"",
      "According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"",
      "To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".",
      "\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"",
      "This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.",
      "A political test for Xi",
      "Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.",
      "A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.",
      "All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.",
      "\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.",
      "This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.",
      "Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.",
      "It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.",
      "Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.",
      "Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Turning a challenge into an opportunity",
      "President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.",
      "\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"",
      "Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.",
      "In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.",
      "Geopolitical gains",
      "As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.",
      "The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.",
      "Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.",
      "\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.",
      "China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.",
      "Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.",
      "According to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".",
      "There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.",
      "China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.",
      "In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.",
      "Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.",
      "China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.",
      "And it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.",
      "\"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.",
      "Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.",
      "The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.",
      "This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.",

      "Romanians are returning to the polls this weekend, following the unprecedented cancellation of presidential elections last December which fuelled protests and nationwide turmoil.",
      "Far-right candidate Calin Georgescu's shock victory in the first round of elections was annulled amid accusations of Russian interference, suspicious TikTok accounts and secret payments to online influencers. Moscow denied interfering in the election.",
      "Georgescu is now banned from running, and was detained, facing a criminal investigation including attempting to overthrow constitutional order. He has denied the charges and accused the authorities of \"inventing evidence to justify stealing the election\".",
      "The leader of Romania's far-right AUR party, George Simion, has been polling as the frontrunner in the first round of the election re-run on Sunday.",
      "He is followed in the polls by Crin Antonescu of the National Liberal Party and independent candidate Nicu\u0219or Dan.",
      "At the centre of this unprecedented political crisis are TikTok influencers accused by the Romanian authorities of participating in social media campaigns which artificially boosted Georgescu's online presence. The BBC has spoken to some of them.",
      "Protesters took to the streets in March, after it was announced Georgescu couldn't run in the May elections.",
      "What happened on TikTok?",
      "Pro-Russian independent candidate Calin Georgescu's victory in the first round of elections came as a surprise.",
      "Georgescu was relatively unknown in the months before the election, polling at between 3-5%.",
      "He declared a zero campaign budget, had no campaign office and didn't engage in traditional campaigning.",
      "Instead, he focused on TikTok videos including some showing him riding horses in traditional Romanian outfits, and practising judo. He went viral on TikTok weeks before the election and soared in the polls, ultimately winning almost 23% of the vote.",
      "An independent think tank, Expert Forum, published a report saying Georgescu's explosive rise on TikTok was \"created suddenly and artificially - consistent with the way he exploded in the polls\".",
      "Authorities say TikTok's algorithm was exploited in the November vote in three different ways: over 100  influencers for hire who posted paid content indirectly promoting Georgescu, thousands of inauthentic accounts whose comments boosted Georgescu on the platform, and finally a \"King of TikTok\" who supposedly paid thousands of dollars to facilitate the campaign.",
      "The authorities said that one of these campaigns was \"identical\" to an operation \"run by the Russian Federation in Ukraine\".",
      "Separately, declassified intelligence documents also stated that Russia carried out \"cyberattacks, leaks, and sabotage\" in Romania.",
      "But authorities still haven't provided any concrete evidence of Russian interference in the election, frustrating many Romanians.",
      "The Foreign Intelligence Services and Romanian Police declined to comment on ongoing investigations.",
      "Calin Georgescu has been barred from running in May's re-run of the election",
      "Influencer campaign",
      "Shortly before the election, a campaign using the hashtag \"stability and integrity\" flooded Romanian TikTok. Influencers uploaded videos describing what they were looking for in a future president: \"stability\", \"progress\", \"a patriot\".",
      "They did not name a specific candidate.",
      "They had been paid to upload videos with these messages through a marketing platform called FameUp, which allows brands to hire influencers at scale to promote products. But the influencers say they didn't know who paid for it.",
      "FameUp declined to comment to the BBC.",
      "Cristina, an influencer from the city of Iasi, says that when she took the job she felt \"there was nothing shady about it\". She says \"in the back of [her] mind\" she thought one of the 14 candidates likely paid for it and she \"just thought it was a smart approach. That's not doing any political propaganda. It's just encouraging people to go out and vote\".",
      "Some influencers did not mark the posts as paid content. This goes against TikTok rules, where paid political advertising is banned.",
      "While the adverts didn't mention Georgescu's name, influencers we spoke to described a \"wave of comments\" supporting him that appeared under the videos. Romeo Rusu, a micro-influencer from the city of Constanta with 25,000 followers, said: \"Right after I posted the video, within a few seconds, I started receiving dozens of comments. In the end, I received around 300 comments, all backing the independent candidate Calin Georgescu\u2026 I was absolutely surprised.\"",
      "The comments came into focus after TikTok stated in a report it had removed a network of over 27,000 inauthentic accounts that \"used fictitious personas to post comments related to the Romanian elections\".",
      "It is still not clear who created these bot accounts.",
      "Experts say that flooding unrelated videos with pro-Georgescu comments was a tactic to game TikTok's algorithm and get his name trending, which would in turn push his content into more users' feeds.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC that, during the presidential campaign, the company \"blocked millions of fake engagement attempts, removed hundreds of thousands of spam accounts, prevented impersonation of political candidates, and disrupted three covert influence networks with limited reach\".",
      "\"We continue to work closely with local and EU authorities and partner with local organisations to elevate reliable election information,\" they said.",
      "The uncertainty around the campaign lasted into the new year, until a surprising twist in January.",
      "The Romanian Tax Authority revealed that the #stabilityandintegrity campaign was paid for by the centre-right National Liberal Party (PNL), who were backing their own candidate in the elections.",
      "In response, the PNL told Romanian journalists at news outlet Snoop that their campaign was hijacked to support Georgescu.",
      "Romeo couldn't understand why he'd been named in declassified documents",
      "'TikTok King'",
      "Then, in March, TikTok influencer Bogdan Peschir was arrested for \"corrupting voters through electronic means of communication\". Peschir was known across Romania as the \"King of TikTok\", famous for awarding influencers with TikTok gifts, online tokens worth real money.",
      "The prosecution is reported to have claimed that Peschir paid over $900,000 to over 250 influencers \"to induce them to vote for \"a certain candidate\" in the presidential elections\" via TikTok gifts.",
      "His lawyers are reported to have said \"none of the donations made by Peschir on TikTok were for electoral purposes\".",
      "We spoke to Lucian Elgi, a musician and influencer who admitted being paid thousands of dollars by Peschir via TikTok gifts.",
      "He says he believes these payments were made in support of his work as a musician. Elgi denied that he promoted Georgescu. The BBC could not confirm this, as his videos on TikTok \u2013 along with those by others who were paid by Peschir's TikTok handle \u2013 have been removed.",
      "Elgi says his content wasn't about the election, but about manele music, a genre of pop-folk music with roots in the Roma community.  Several high-profile manele musicians have been accused of taking payments from Peschir to campaign for Georgescu.",
      "Elgi said this content was flooded in pro-Georgescu comments. \"It was madness,\" he says. \"Every single post, comments like: Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President!\"",
      "Much is unknown about the election's annulment. Investigations are ongoing at the European Commission and Romania's highest courts. While Romanians are concerned about the alleged foreign interference, many are outraged that there is still no publicly available evidence undeniably proving Russian interference in the election.",
      "It's painstaking and complex work untangling an influence operation and its effects. Razvan Lutac, the Editor of Romanian news outlet Snoop, fears it could take a very long time to get clarity.",
      "\"We have these small pieces now, like a puzzle,\" he says, \"I think that maybe in a year or two years we will have a complete image of why they cancelled the elections.\"",

    "summary": "Turkey has been building military bases on Iraqi territory, the BBC finds, raising fears of an occupation.",
    "story": [
      "Nestled in the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan sits the picturesque village of Sergele.",
      "For generations villagers have made a living growing pomegranates, almonds and peaches and foraging in the surrounding forests for wild fruits and spices.",
      "But Sergele, located 16km (10 miles) from the border with Turkey, has become increasingly surrounded by Turkish military bases, which are dotted across the slopes.",
      "One, perched halfway up the western ridge, looms over the village, while another in the east is under construction.",
      "At least seven have been built here over the past two years, including one by a small dam that regulates Sergele's water supply, rendering it off limits to villagers.",
      "\"This is 100% a form of occupation of Kurdish [Iraqi Kurdistan] lands,\" says farmer Sherwan Sherwan Sergeli, 50, who has lost access to some of his land.",
      "\"The Turks ruined it.\"",
      "Sergele is now in danger of being dragged into what's known locally as the \"Forbidden Zone\" - a large strip of land in northern Iraq affected by Turkey's war with the Kurdish militant group the PKK, which launched an insurgency in southern Turkey in 1984.",
      "The Forbidden Zone spans almost the entire length of the Iraqi border with Turkey and is up to 40km (25 miles) deep in places.",
      "Community Peacemaker Teams, a human rights group based in Iraqi Kurdistan, says that hundreds of civilians have been killed by drone and air strikes in and around the Forbidden Zone. According to a 2020 Kurdistan parliamentary report, thousands have been forced off their land and whole villages have been emptied out by the conflict.",
      "Sergele is now effectively on the front line of Turkey's war with the PKK.",
      "When the BBC World Service Eye Investigations team visited the area, Turkish aircraft pummelled the mountains surrounding the village to root out PKK militants, who have long operated from caves and tunnels in northern Iraq.",
      "Much of the land around Sergele had been burned by shelling.",
      "\"The more bases they put up, the worse it gets for us,\" says Sherwan.",
      "Turkey has been rapidly growing its military presence in the Forbidden Zone in recent years, but until now the scale of this expansion was not publicly known.",
      "Using satellite imagery assessed by experts and corroborated with on-the-ground reporting and open-source content, the BBC found that as of December 2024, the Turkish military had built at least 136 fixed military installations across northern Iraq.",
      "Through its vast network of military bases, Turkey now holds de-facto control of more than 2,000 sq km (772 square miles) of Iraqi land, the BBC's analysis found.",
      "Satellite images further reveal that the Turkish military has built at least 660km (410 miles) of roads connecting its facilities. These supply routes have resulted in deforestation and left a lasting imprint on the region's mountains.",
      "While a few of the bases date back to the 1990s, 89% have been constructed since 2018, after which Turkey began significantly expanding its military presence in Iraqi Kurdistan.",
      "The Turkish government didn't respond to the BBC's requests for interviews, but has maintained that its military bases are necessary to push back the PKK, which is designated a terrorist organisation by Ankara and a number of Western nations, including the UK.",
      "The sub-district capital of Kani Masi, which is only 4km (2.5 miles) from the Iraqi-Turkish border and parts of which are within the Forbidden Zone, may offer a glimpse into Sergele's future.",
      "Once famous for its apple production, few residents remain here now.",
      "Farmer Salam Saeed, whose land is in the shadow of a large Turkish base, hasn't been able to cultivate his vineyard for the past three years.",
      "\"The moment you get here, you will have a drone hover over you,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"They will shoot you if you stay.\"",
      "The Turkish military first set up here in the 1990s and has been consolidating its presence since.",
      "Its main military base, featuring concrete blast walls, watch and communication towers and space for armoured personnel carriers to move inside, is much more developed than the smaller outposts around Sergele.",
      "Salam, like some other locals, believes Turkey ultimately wants to claim the territory as its own.",
      "\"All they want is for us to leave these areas,\" he adds.",
      "Little leverage",
      "Near Kani Masi, the BBC saw first-hand how Turkish forces have effectively pushed back the Iraqi border guard, which is responsible for protecting Iraq's international boundaries.",
      "At several locations, the border guards were manning positions well inside Iraqi territory, directly opposite Turkish troops, unable to go right up to the border and potentially risk a clash.",
      "\"The posts that you see are Turkish posts,\" says General Farhad Mahmoud, pointing to a ridge just across a valley, about 10km (6 miles) inside Iraqi territory.",
      "But \"we cannot reach the border to know the number of posts\", he adds.",
      "Turkey's military expansion in Iraqi Kurdistan - fuelled by its rise as a drone power and growing defence budget - is seen as part of a broader foreign policy shift towards greater interventionism in the region.",
      "Similar to its operations in Iraq, Turkey has also sought to establish a buffer zone along its border with Syria to contain Syrian armed groups allied with the PKK.",
      "In public, Iraq's government has condemned Turkey's military presence in the country. But behind closed doors it has accommodated some of Ankara's demands.",
      "In 2024, the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly fight the PKK.",
      "But the document, obtained by the BBC, did not place any limitations on Turkish troops in Iraq.",
      "Iraq depends on Turkey for trade, investment and water security, while its fractured internal politics have further undermined the government's ability to take a strong stance.",
      "Iraq's national government did not respond to the BBC requests for comment.",
      "People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube",
      "Meanwhile, the rulers of the semi-autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan have a close relationship with Ankara based on mutual interests and have often downplayed the civilian harm due to Turkey's military action.",
      "The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), an arch enemy of the PKK, dominates the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and has officially been in charge since 2005, when Iraq's constitution granted the region its semi-autonomous status.",
      "The KDP's close ties with Turkey have contributed to the region's economic success and have strengthened its position, both against its regional political rivals and with the Iraqi government in Baghdad, with which it tussles for greater autonomy.",
      "Hoshyar Zebari, a senior member of the KDP's politburo, sought to blame the PKK for Turkey's presence in Iraqi Kurdistan.",
      "\"They [the Turkish military] are not harming our people,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"They are not detaining them. They are not interfering in them going about their business. Their focus, their sole goal is the PKK.\"",
      "The conflict shows no signs of ending, despite the PKK's long-jailed leader Abdulla Ocalan calling in February for his fighters to lay down arms and disband.",
      "Turkey has continued to shell targets across Iraqi Kurdistan, while the PKK claimed responsibility for downing a Turkish drone last month.",
      "And while violent incidents in Turkey have declined since 2016, according to a tally by the NGO Crisis Group, those in Iraq have spiked, with civilians living on the border region facing growing risk of death and displacement.",
      "One of those killed was 24-year-old Alan Ismail, a stage-four cancer patient hit by an air strike in August 2023 while on a trip to the mountains with his cousin, Hashem Shaker.",
      "The Turkish military has denied carrying out a strike that day, but a police report seen by the BBC attributes the incident to a Turkish drone.",
      "When Hashem filed a complaint in a local court about the attack he was detained by Kurdish security forces and held for eight months on suspicion of supporting the PKK - an accusation he and his family deny.",
      "\"It has destroyed us. It's like killing the whole family,\" says Ismail Chichu, Alan's father.",
      "\"They [the Turks] have no rights to kill people in their own country on their own land.\"",
      "Turkey's Defence Ministry did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment. It has previously told the media that the Turkish armed forces follow international law, and that in the planning and execution of their operations they only target terrorists, while taking care to prevent harm to civilians.",
      "The BBC has seen documents suggesting Kurdish authorities may have acted to help Turkey evade accountability for civilian casualties.",
      "Confidential papers seen by the BBC show a Kurdish court closed the investigation into Alan's killing, saying the perpetrator was unknown.",
      "And his death certificate - issued by Kurdish authorities and seen by the BBC - says he died because of \"explosive fragments\".",
      "Failing to mention when victims of air strikes have died as a result of violence, rather than an accident, makes it difficult for families to seek justice and compensation, to which they're entitled under both Iraqi and Kurdish law.",
      "\"In most of the death certificates, they only wrote 'infijar', which means explosion,\" says Kamaran Othman from Community Peacemaker Teams.",
      "\"It can be anything exploding.",
      "\"I think the Kurdish Regional Government doesn't want to make Turkey responsible for what they are doing here.\"",
      "The KRG said it acknowledged the \"tragic loss of civilians resulting from military confrontation between the PKK and Turkish army in the region\".",
      "It added that \"a number of casualties\" had been documented as \"civilian martyrs\", meaning they have been unjustly killed and entitling them to compensation.",
      "Almost two years after Alan was killed, his family is still waiting, if not for compensation, at least for acknowledgement from the KRG.",
      "\"They could at least send their condolences - we don't need their compensation,\" says Ismail.",
      "\"When something is gone, it's gone forever.\""

    "story": [
      "On a searing afternoon in Vietnam, Tung Linh declared she \"basically knows nothing\" about the bloody, decades-long war that pitted her country's Communist-run North against the United States-backed South.",
      "\"My grandparents fought in the war and because of that today we can look at the sky and see an airplane and we don't feel scared, like they did,\" says the 20-year-old college student.",
      "Stuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, Ho Chi Minh City, where she lived, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed.",
      "Today's Vietnam is a remarkably different country than the one American troops withdrew from in defeat \u2013 it's enterprising, it's growing fast and it's getting richer.",
      "Its authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China.",
      "But that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war \u2013 it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.",
      "Vietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.",
      "But it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle \u2013which hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "Vietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50).",
      "\"I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,\" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. \"And yes, success for me too,\" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.",
      "It's a dream that suits her bustling city \u2013 now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.",
      "You would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon.",
      "And when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.",
      "America's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over.",
      "The victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.",
      "But few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".",
      "Linh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back \u2013 they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.",
      "\"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said.",
      "Her answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future \u2013 and her country's - is not uncommon.",
      "A little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could \"become successful\".  With a laugh, she added: \"And rich!\"",
      "When we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.",
      "\"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\"",
      "Vietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.",
      "The country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.",
      "The ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.",
      "After the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as \"the boat people\". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.",
      "\"Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,\" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back.",
      "\"The most attractive thing is that the Vietnamese government is very supportive. The electronics industry is expanding out of China and a lot will choose Vietnam.\"",

      "Two young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: \"Now it's ready to go.\"",
      "They plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.",
      "Still, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\"",
      "Vietnam is again being asked to choose \u2013 America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.",
      "Less than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing \u2013 the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.",
      "As Vietnam insists on \"looking forward\", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.",
      "But even they say there must be no return to the past. \"I used to have a scar here,\" says Le Thanh Gian, pointing to his right hand, where a bullet had once lodged.",

    "story": [
      "On the journey into Yarrabah, there is nothing to suggest a national election is just days away.",
      "Posters for candidates, inescapable in other parts of Australia, are conspicuously absent as you drive past fields of sugar cane and down a gently winding coastal road.",
      "After entering this small Indigenous community near Cairns in far north Queensland, with fishing nets sitting on palm-lined shores, the only thing fighting for attention is a truck selling ice cream \u2013 urgently dinging a bell as it avoids the wild horses and dogs that wander the streets.",
      "\"It's weird,\" says Suzanne Andrews, chief executive of the town's Gurriny Yealamucka Health Services. \"We don't see any placards. No-one's visiting us.\"",
      "Watching the leaders of Australia's two major parties debate each other on television, the Jaru Bunuba Bardi woman was dismayed that \"they didn't talk about any Aboriginal issues or concerns\".",
      "\"So,\" she asks \"what the hell's going on?\"",
      "Indigenous Australians, who represent about 3.8% of the nation's 26 million population, are by most socio-economic measures the most disadvantaged people in the country - something successive leaders have for years called a \"national shame\".",
      "Yet in this election campaign, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition leader Peter Dutton have had little to say on First Nations issues.",
      "One glaring exception occurred this week, when during the final leader's debate Dutton said Indigenous \"welcome to country\" ceremonies -  where a local Aboriginal person acknowledges and give consent to events taking place on their traditional lands - were \"overdone\" and should not take place so frequently.",
      "The comments represent one of the only times on the campaign trail that Dutton has publicly addressed issues specifically relating to First Nations people \u2013 and not to discuss disadvantage, but within the context of a culture war.",
      "Part of the reason politicians try to steer clear of First Nations issues, according to experts and advocates, is that many believe they are too divisive and therefore electorally risky \u2013 especially after the failure of the Voice to Parliament referendum in 2023.",
      "That referendum, which was loudly supported by Albanese in the most polarising moment of his leadership, saw 60% of voters reject a proposal to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia's constitution and give them greater political say through a Voice to Parliament.",
      "Those opposing it said the idea was divisive, would create special \"classes\" of citizens where some have more rights than others, and the new advisory body would slow government decision-making.",
      "Ahead of the vote, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on both sides of the debate told the BBC they hoped the unprecedented level of interest in their lives would build momentum for more policies to improve them.",
      "Ms Andrews was one of them. But now she looks back at the result with sadness, believing it has now led political parties to \"play it safe\" and avoid \"the hot Aboriginal issues\".",
      "Others, including those who loudly opposed the Voice proposal, agree.",
      "On referendum night, prominent anti-Voice campaigner Warren Mundine told the BBC \"now the hard work starts\".",
      "Some 18 months on, he says the reality is that people on both sides of the political aisle promptly disengaged with Indigenous issues after the referendum.",
      "\"This is one of the sad things about this election campaign here: whether the Voice got up or didn't get up, we still had work to do,\" he said.",
      "\"What's happened now is that this is probably the first election that I've been in where there is no conversation about an Aboriginal policy. It's just gone silent.\"",
      "Lidia Thorpe, an independent senator in Victoria, told the BBC that \"Albanese particularly is too scared to mention us [Indigenous Australians] because of his failed referendum that we should never have had in the first place\".",
      "Thorpe spearheaded an Indigenous-run Blak Sovereign movement opposing the Voice, calling instead for priority to be given to a legally binding treaty between First Nations peoples and the Australian government.",
      "\"In previous elections, even though we may have been an afterthought and tacked on the end of the sentences, like we always are, at least we were mentioned. Now it's complete silence,\" she said.",
      "\"This election could have been a real opportunity for both leaders to unite the nation and tell some truth about the plight of our people. They need to tell the truth that these injustices continue, and they need to tell the truth that they are in a position to change that, to turn that around.\"",
      "Since 2008, the Australian government's Closing the Gap strategy has sought to reduce levels of Indigenous disadvantage through the annual tracking of 18 key measures in areas such as health and education.",
      "The latest review, however, found only four were on track to be met, while four were worsening \u2013 including the annual rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander incarceration, which was up 12% in a year.",
      "Despite these trends, Professor Rodney Smith of the University of Sydney says the defeat of the Voice - including in many Labor strongholds - makes it \"electorally foolish\" to talk too much about First Nations issues this election.",
      "He points to Coalition adverts that tie money \"wasted\" on the referendum \u2013 which is estimated to have cost more than $A400m \u2013 into the discussion about cost of living and a struggling economy.",
      "Prof Smith also argues, however, that the 2025 election is not unprecedented in its lack of focus on Indigenous affairs, but rather a return to the norm after several years of the issues receiving more attention than usual.",
      "\"I'm not saying people shouldn't care about this,\" he says. \"I'm just saying that generally speaking, the electorate doesn't particularly care about it.\"",
      "Recent data from Australian National University (ANU) seems to back that up. A long-term study of voter attitudes found that between January 2024 and January 2025 there was a sharp decline in the number of people believing it was the government's responsibility to reduce the gap in living standards between First Nations Australians and the rest of the population.",
      "\"This lack of policy focus (by Labor and the Coalition) reflects a low prioritisation amongst the Australian population\" ANU's Professor Nicholas Biddle said.",
      "Independent MP Bob Katter puts it more bluntly.",
      "A former minister of Aboriginal Affairs when a Queensland state MP in the 1980s, Mr Katter says he thinks about the struggles of many Indigenous Australians \"every night before I go to bed\".",
      "He told the BBC he believes in more self-governance and has campaigned to give greater access to farmable land and fishing rights.",
      "He also admits he doesn't talk about those issues on the campaign trail, though.",
      "\"As a politician that's got to win votes in the election, I wouldn't be game,\" he told the BBC.",
      "That's hard for many Indigenous people to swallow given the toll the referendum took - on those on both sides of the debate.",
      "A report published by Sydney's University of Technology last month found that the Voice referendum led to an increase in hostile levels of racism towards First Nations People, recording 453 \"validated\" incidents of racism roughly six months either side of the vote.",
      "About a fifth of all complaints contained mention of the failed referendum.",
      "\"While there was significant thought and debate given to the ideas of nation building and the righting of wrongs, the undercurrent of racism was ever present,\" said the report's guest author Professor Lindon Coombes in his introduction.",
      "\"This is its insidiousness.\"",
      "In Yarrabah, Ms Andrews becomes suddenly tearful, telling how her two daughters, studying at university in Brisbane, were intimidated and got \"so many racist remarks\" after the vote.",
      "\"To do this to young people, who have left community to better their life and to be something, is so wrong,\" she said.",
      "'My ancestors were invisible. I want to be visible'",
      "Hurt ripples in wake of Indigenous Voice vote",
      "It was not just increased racism that caused harm, but the tone and intensity of the debate leading up to the vote, many say.",
      "Mr Mundine says his participation in the toxic and polarised national discussion meant he felt alienated from many in his community.",
      "\"I got kicked off boards. I lost jobs\u2026 [I] was ostracised.\"",
      "\"Being the topic of every discussion for such a long period of time was overwhelming and extremely damaging to people's social and emotional well-being,\"  says Clinton Schultz, a Gamilaroi/Gomeroi man, psychologist and Director of First Nations Strategy at the Black Dog Institute.",
      "\"The aftermath of that has left a lot of people not willing to engage in in the debates moving forward.\"",
      "Millima May, a Kulumbirigin Danggalaba Tiwi woman from the Northern Territory, in 2023 told the BBC all First Nations people wanted was \"a seat at the table\" where decisions about their lives were made. But now there's been a \"tactical\" decision by some in the community to \"lie low\".",
      "\"I think a lot of Aboriginal people have really chosen to opt out of the political space and of so -called democracy in Australia,\" she says.",
      "\"If you could trust our political leaders and candidates to have nuanced and informed conversations, then you would be able to have debates and conversations in a respectful and safe way.",
      "\"But that is not how Australian politics is operating at the moment.\"",

      "Are petrol prices down 'by a lot'?",
      "Trump said \"gasoline prices are down by a lot\" since he took office.",

      "This claim is false.",
      "The average national price for consumers of a dozen large Grade A eggs when Trump entered office in January was about $4.95 (\u00a33.70).",

      "In March, there were 7,181 encounters of migrants there and in February there were 8,346.",
      "These are the the lowest numbers since these monthly records began in 2000.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 13:20:37 GMT",
    "summary": "The Spanish grid operator said the preliminary assessment suggests there was no cyber attack.",
    "story": [
      "The Spanish grid operator has ruled out a cyber attack as the cause of a massive power cut that crippled Spain, Portugal and parts of France on Monday.",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica's operations director Eduardo Prieto said preliminary findings suggest \"there was no kind of interference in the control systems\" to imply an attack, echoing Portuguese Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro the day before.",
      "But the exact reason behind the cut is still unclear.",
      "The grid operator said on Tuesday they \"cannot draw conclusions\" until they get concrete data. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said investigators were trying to pinpoint the cause, and then would take all necessary measures \"to ensure that this does not happen again.\"",
      "Information is trickling out about what happened at the time of the cut, leading to theories about what could have caused it. Experts told the BBC it was likely caused by several failures.",
      "Here is what we know and what questions remain unanswered.",
      "Follow live: Travel chaos continues",
      "Was the power cut caused by renewable energy?",
      "S\u00e1nchez on Monday evening said 15GW of power - the equivalent to 60% of demand at that time - was \"suddenly lost from the system... in just five seconds\".",
      "Mr Prieto said during a news conference on Tuesday that there were two \"disconnection events\" barely a second apart in the south-west of Spain, where there is substantial solar power generation.",
      "One issue that the Spanish grid operator may have been referring to was when power companies identify a mismatch of supply and demand for electricity that could lead to instability, and disconnect temporarily in order to protect their systems.",
      "However, S\u00e1nchez later said the power cut was \"not a problem of excessive renewables\". He said there was not a failure of coverage - meaning supply - and there was a relatively low demand for electricity that was quite normal in the days running up to the crisis.",
      "So what exactly happened? It is unclear, especially as many systems fail in electricity supply quite frequently, not only renewables, and outages on this scale happen somewhere in the world around once a year on average.",
      "The mismatch between supply and demand of electricity can change the frequency of the electricity grid, which is 50Hz in Europe and the UK.",
      "If that frequency changes out of a narrow range, it could lead to damage to equipment.",
      "\"When a big company detects that the frequency is moving out of their tolerance, they can go offline to protect their equipment,\" said Prof Hannah Christensen at the University of Oxford.",
      "If lots of companies do that in quick succession, it can have \"cascading effects\" and lead to a black-out, she added.",
      "But when it comes to renewables, operators have very accurate short-term weather forecasts to predict when there will be a surplus of wind of solar power, so they adjust power supply accordingly, Prof Christensen said.",
      "Renewable power has different challenges to fossil fuel energy \"because of its intermittency\", she said, but it is a well-known issue that is planned for.",
      "\"It is a little perplexing that this wouldn't have been predicted,\" she said.",
      "Prof Keith Bell, at the University of Strathclyde, added that \"if a system is relying on solar and wind, they design a system to reflect that,\" suggesting that the additional supply of energy from renewables will not have been a surprise to the grid.",
      "\"Spain has a lot of experience of wind and solar, and a long-standing system of forecasting weather and its impacts,\" he said.",
      "\"All sorts of systems fail,\" he added. \"Things can and do go wrong, whether that is from renewables, fossil fuels or nuclear power. This could be the Swiss cheese model, where the holes in the system have happened to align.\"",
      "Was it related to Spain's connection to France?",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica also suggested that the drop of power caused a grid interconnection between Spain and France to trip.",
      "Two basic technologies are used to interconnect parts of a grid or countries - a standard transmission line that carries alternating currents, and increasingly, high voltage direct current lines.",
      "Spain has a high voltage line that came into service seven years ago, meaning it is well-tested, Prof Bell said.",
      "The Iberian peninsula is often referred to as an \"electricity island\" because it relies on just a few connections through the Pyrenees to France, meaning it can be vulnerable to failures.",
      "S\u00e1nchez said power was brought back online thanks to connections with France and Morocco as well as gas and hydropower sources.",
      "Was it linked to a 'rare atmospheric event'?",
      "Portugal's grid operator REN refuted initial reports, attributed to the agency on Monday, which said the blackout was caused by a rare atmospheric event.",
      "The message in Portuguese said that \"due to extreme temperature variations in the interior or Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 KV), a phenomenon known as 'induced atmospheric vibration'\".",
      "\"These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.\"",
      "However, REN spokesman Bruno Silva told AFP on Tuesday that the grid operator \"did not put out this statement,\" without giving further details.",

      "Mark Carney and the Liberal Party have claimed a remarkable victory in the Canadian election \u2013 and it appears to have come with a big assist from Donald Trump.",
      "The US president's constant badgering of America's northern neighbour and taunts about making it the 51st US state since his return to office in January coincided with a dramatic reversal in fortune for the centre-left party.",
      "Carney has been almost singularly focused on his neighbour, and this was reflected in his victory speech. After warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources, Carney declared: \"President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\"",
      "Until Trump's return to power, Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party had held what looked like high and insurmountable ground in voter preference polls amidst general dissatisfaction with the state of the Canadian economy and almost a decade of Liberal government under then leader Justin Trudeau.",
      "The past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control \u2013 with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples.",
      "This Canadian general election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader.",

      "Instead, more of the same is the likely result \u2013 more pointed quips about Canada joining the US, more threats of a trade war and more willingness to cast longstanding ties and agreements with America's northern neighbour into doubt.",
      "The irony, however, is that Trump's derisive focus on Canada may have denied him a northern neighbour run by, if not a kindred spirit, at least a politician more in line with his populist conservative priorities than Liberal Carney.",
      "While Poilievre, a veteran politician, will never be mistaken for the American businessman-turned-president, they have some similarities \u2013 a goal of shrinking government, lowering taxes and trimming social services, a desire to promote fossil fuel production, and a distaste for what they both deride as \"woke\" leftist culture.",
      "A Conservative victory in this election would have been viewed by many \u2013 in America and throughout the world \u2013 as a new sign that the Trump win last year was more than just a singular American event. It would have represented what many in Trump's orbit like to believe is a global movement toward their brand of culturally conservative, anti-elite, anti-immigration, and pro-working-class politics.",

      "Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America \u2013 a move that is sure to irk the American leader.",

      "The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney \u2013 an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state.",
      "Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. Many world leaders are still working out how to deal with Donald Trump in his second term, but few will face this kind of test."

      "It was not until 11:15 (09:15 GMT) on Tuesday, almost 23 hours after the system collapsed that Spain's electricity grid declared it was back to normal.",
      "The trains have started running again although some lines are suspended and most homes have got their power back.",
      "So how did it get back up and running and why did it take so long?",
      "For most of Monday, Spain was in chaos.",
      "The issue appears to relate to two separate connection problems in the south west within moments of each other and then a disconnection from the French network for almost an hour.",
      "Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez highlighted the sudden loss of 15 gigawatts of electricity at 12:33 on Monday, when about 60% of Spain's power generation suddenly vanished.",
      "Eduardo Prieto, the director of operations for the grid, Red El\u00e9ctrica, said the systems had been stable, until two \"disconnection\" incidents within seconds of each other in the south-west, where Spain has substantial solar generation.",
      "Only the Canary Islands, the Balearics and Ceuta and Melilla on the North African coast were unaffected.",
      "An increasing number of public figures are blaming a saturation of solar power and an over-reliance on renewable energy.",
      "Minutes before the outage, Spain was running on 60.64% solar photovoltaic generation, with 12% wind and 11.6% nuclear.",
      "However diversified and advanced Spain's energy mix is, the national power collapse at 12:35 on Monday required an enormous effort to get Spain back up and running.",
      "The initial focus was to get the northern and southern power generating regions working again, which grid operator Red El\u00e9ctrica said was key to \"gradually re-energising the transmission grid as the generating units are connected\".",
      "The risk lay in overloading the system by turning everything on at the same time and triggering another massive outage.",
      "So everything had to be carefully phased for what experts call a \"black start\" working out as a success.",
      "The initial focus was on hydro-electric plants, in particular pumped-storage plants  with reservoirs full at this time of year and able to produce electricity fast from a standing start.",
      "Combined-cycle gas plants also played a significant part in repowering the grid, but four nuclear power reactors at Almaraz, Asc\u00f3 and and Vandell\u00f3s were automatically shut down by the outage, and three others were already offline anyway.",
      "Spain's neighbours France and Morocco also came to its aid.",
      "Morocco said 900MW of power had been transferred through two high-voltage lines that cross the Strait of Gibraltrar from Fardioua to Tarifa in southern Spain.",
      "French operator RTE said it had been \"gradually transferring more electricity to the Spanish border\" via its power lines supplying Catalonia in north-east Spain and the Basque country in the north-west.",
      "RTE said the Iberian network had been disconnected from 12:38 to 13:30 on Monday, when the 400kV line to Catalonia was restored. Within minutes, France had supplied 700MW and RTE said it was later able to increase that by up to 2,000 MW.",
      "Power was then eventually restored to Spain's electricity substations in the north, south and west of the peninsula.",
      "By 19:20 on Monday, the grid operator said more than a fifth of demand had been restored by way of Spain's own electricity generation and from France.",
      "Electricity provider Endesa said it had restored almost 3.5 million customers by 19:15 and had prioritised hospitals and other strategic infrastructure.",
      "Just over an hour later the head of Red El\u00e9ctrica boss Eduardo Prieto said about 9,200 MW of demand - about 35.1% - had been restored.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c787y082l47o",
    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 23:42:33 GMT",
    "summary": "Historians say there were three popes of North African descent, the last one more than 1,500 years ago.",
    "story": [
      "Now predominantly Muslim, North Africa was once a Christian heartland, producing Catholic popes who left their mark on the Church to this day.",
      "Their papacies were in the era of the Roman Empire, which stretched across modern-day Tunisia, the north-east of Algeria and the coast of western Libya.",
      "\"North Africa was the Bible Belt of ancient Christianity,\" says Prof Christopher Bellitto, a historian at Kean University in the US.",
      "Many Catholics in Africa are hoping that the papacy will return to the continent  for the first time in more than 1,500 years, as a successor to Pope Francis is chosen.",
      "Here, we look at the three previous African popes - and how they got Christians to celebrate Easter Sunday and St Valentine's Day.",
      "All three have been recognised in the Church as saints.",
      "Victor I (189-199)",
      "Thought to be of Berber origin, Pope Victor I was in charge of the Catholic Church at a time when Christians were sometimes being persecuted by Roman officials for refusing to worship Roman gods.",
      "He is perhaps best known for ensuring Christians celebrate Easter on a Sunday.",
      "In the 2nd Century, some Christian groups from the Roman province of Asia (in modern-day Turkey) celebrated Easter on the same day that Jews celebrated Passover, which could fall on different days of the week.",
      "However, Christians in the Western part of the Empire believed that Jesus was resurrected on a Sunday, so Easter should always be celebrated on that day.",
      "The debate over when the resurrection took place made it an extremely contentious issue.",
      "The \"Easter controversy\" was symbolic of larger conflicts between East and West, and whether or not Christians should follow Jewish practices.",
      "Victor I called the very first Roman Synod - a gathering of Church leaders - to resolve the impasse.",
      "He did this by threatening to excommunicate from the Church those bishops who refused to comply with his wishes.",
      "\"He was a rather forceful voice for getting everyone on literally the same page,\" Prof Bellitto told the BBC.",
      "This was an impressive feat, the historian said, because \"he was the Bishop of Rome when Christianity was illegal in the Roman empire.\"",
      "Another important part of Victor I's legacy was to introduce Latin as the common language of the Catholic Church. Previously Ancient Greek was the primary language of the Catholic Liturgy as well as official communication for the Church.",
      "Victor I himself wrote in - and spoke - Latin, which was widely spoken in North Africa.",
      "Miltiades (AD311-314)",
      "Pope Miltiades is believed to have been born in Africa.",
      "During his reign, Christianity gained increasing acceptance from successive Roman emperors, eventually becoming the Empire's official religion.",
      "Before this, the persecution of Christians had been widespread at different points in the Empire's history.",
      "However, Prof Bellitto pointed out that Miltiades was not responsible for this change, saying the Pope was the \"recipient of the Roman benevolence\" rather than being a great negotiator.",
      "Miltiades was given a palace by the Roman Emperor Constantine, becoming the first pope to have an official residence.",
      "He was also granted permission by Constantine to build the Lateran Basilica, now the oldest public church in Rome.",
      "While modern popes live and work in the Vatican, the Lateran church is sometimes referred to in Catholicism as \"the mother of all churches\".",
      "Gelasius I (AD492-496)",
      "Gelasius I is the only one of the three African popes who historians believe was not born in Africa.",
      "\"There's a reference to him being... Roman-born. So we don't know if he [ever] lived in North Africa, but it seems clear that he was of North African descent,\" Prof Bellitto explained.",
      "He was the most important of the three African church leaders, according to Prof Bellitto.",
      "Gelasius I is widely recognised as the first pope to officially be called the \"Vicar of Christ\", a term that signifies the Pope's role as Christ's representative on Earth.",
      "He also developed the Doctrine of the Two Swords, which emphasised the separate-but-equal powers of the Church and the state.",
      "Gelasius I made the critical distinction that both powers were given to the Church by God, who then delegated earthly power to the state, making the Church ultimately superior.",
      "\"Later on, in the Middle Ages, popes sometimes tried to veto the selection of an emperor or a king, because they said God gave them that power,\" said Prof Bellitto.",
      "Gelasius I is remembered, too, for his response to the Acacian Schism - a split between the Eastern and Western Christian Churches from 484 to 519.",
      "During this period, Gelasius I asserted the supremacy of Rome and the papacy over the entire Church, East and West, which experts believe went further than any of his predecessors.",
      "Gelasius is also responsible for a popular celebration which is still marked every year - establishing St Valentine's Day on 14 February in 496 to commemorate the Christian martyr St Valentine.",
      "Some accounts say Valentine was a priest who continued to perform weddings in secret when they were banned by Emperor Claudius II.",
      "Historians believe that Valentine's Day is rooted in the Roman love and fertility festival, Lupercalia, and was a move by Gelasius I to Christianise pagan traditions.",
      "What did Africa's popes look like?",
      "Prof Bellitto says there is no way of knowing with any degree of accuracy what the three popes looked like.",
      "\"We have to remember that the Roman Empire, and indeed the Middle Ages, didn't think of race as we think of it nowadays. It had nothing to do with skin colour,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"People in the Roman Empire didn't deal with race, they dealt with ethnicity.\"",
      "Prof Philomena Mwaura, an academic at Kenya's Kenyatta University, told the BBC that Roman Africa was very multicultural, with local Berber and Punic groups, freed slaves and people who had come from Rome found there.",
      "\"The North African community was quite mixed, and it was a trade route also for many people who were involved in trade in the earlier antiquity,\" she explained.",
      "Rather than identifying with specific ethnic groups, \"most people who belonged to areas within the Roman Empire regarded themselves as Roman\", Prof Mwaura added.",
      "Who will be the next Pope?How a Pope is electedWhy the conclave is so unpredictable",
      "Who will be the next Pope?",
      "How a Pope is elected",
      "Why the conclave is so unpredictable",
      "Why hasn't there been an African pope since?",
      "None of of the 217 popes since Gelasius I are believed to have come from Africa.",
      "\"The church in North Africa was weakened by very many forces, including the fall of the Roman Empire and also the incursion of Muslims [into North Africa] in the 7th Century,\" Prof Mwaura said.",
      "However, some experts argue that the prevalence of Islam in North Africa does not explain the absence of a pope from the entire continent over more than 1,500 years.",
      "Prof Bellitto said the process of electing a new pontiff became an \"Italian monopoly\" for many years.",
      "However, he said there was a strong chance of a pope from Asia or Africa in the near future because Catholics in the southern hemisphere outnumber those in the north.",
      "In fact, Catholicism is expanding more rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa today than anywhere else.",
      "The latest figures show there were 281 million Catholics in Africa in 2023. This accounts for 20% of the worldwide congregation.",
      "Three Africans are in the race to succeed Pope Francis - the Democratic Republic of Congo's Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, Ghana's Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson and Guinea's Robert Sarah.",
      "But Prof Mwaura argued that \"although Christianity is very strong in Africa, the power of the Church is still in the north, where the resources have been\".",
      "\"Maybe, as it continues to be very strong within the continent and supporting itself, then a time will come when there could be an African pope,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The head of Israel's Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency has resigned.",
      "Ronen Bar made the announcement that he would leave his position on 15 June at a memorial event for Shin Bet members who have died in service.",
      "It came after he had been engaged in a fierce trading of recriminations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who dismissed him last month. A challenge to the Supreme Court by the attorney general and the opposition had put the move on hold.",
      "Ronen Bar said he had chosen to announce his resignation on an evening that, in his words, symbolised \"remembrance, heroism and sacrifice\".",
      "He said every public servant who failed to stop the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the Gaza war, needed to bow their heads \"humbly before those who were killed, or wounded, or taken hostage, and act accordingly\".",
      "On Sunday, Netanyahu presented an affidavit to the Supreme Court in which he accused Bar of being a liar.",
      "In his own affidavit, the Shin Bet chief had accused the prime minister of demanding excessive personal loyalty and ordering his agency to spy on anti-government protesters.",
      "The confrontation has further exposed the deepening rifts in Israeli politics and society between the right-wing and hardliners supporting Netanyahu and the more liberal elements in the country, who took to the streets to protest against the government's moves to curb the powers of the judiciary for many months before the 7 October attacks.",
      "It centres on Netanyahu's insistence that he fired the Shin Bet head for professional failures.",
      "Bar countered by saying that his dismissal was motivated by political and personal considerations.",
      "In his affidavit last week, the spy chief said that it was \"clear\" that if there were to be a constitutional crisis, Netanyahu would expect him to obey the prime minister and not the courts.",
      "He also said Netanyahu had put pressure on him to use the Shin Bet to spy on Israelis leading or providing financial support to anti-government protests.",
      "Many in Israel reacted with alarm, saying it was evidence of what appeared to be an unprecedented effort to overstep the powers of the domestic intelligence agency.",
      "In his affidavit, which functioned as a form of rebuttal, Netanyahu excoriated the Shin Bet head.",
      "\"The accusation according to which I allegedly demanded action against innocent civilians, or against a non-violent and legitimate protest during the protests of 2023, is an absolute lie,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu also trained his sights on the security failures in the lead-up to and during the 7 October attacks, saying that Bar bore \"massive and direct responsibility\" for them and had \"failed in his role as chief of Shin Bet and lost the confidence of the entire Israeli government as far as his ability to continue to manage the organisation\".",
      "Bar immediately responded in kind in a statement, saying Netanyahu's affidavit was \"full of inaccuracies, biased quotes and half-truths aimed at taking things out of context and changing reality\".",
      "The Supreme Court was facing a quandary over who to believe - which Bar's resignation may have to some extent pre-empted.",
      "However, Bar made clear on Monday that he would play a part, if necessary, in any future proceedings.",
      "\"The court hearing is not about my personal affairs, but about the independence of the next heads of the Shin Bet, and of course I am ready to appear for any procedure that the court may require in this regard in the future,\" he said.",
      "The issues which have been exposed in the fierce recriminations between the two men have once again focused attention on the increasing bitterness between opposed sections of Israeli society.",
      "These have been further exacerbated by the ever-growing fault line between those who support Netanyahu and his hard-line government in wanting to continue the war in Gaza to eliminate Hamas at all costs, and those who believe the fate of the living Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas must be put first, even if it means ending the war.",

      "\"The numbers start getting bigger and people actually start getting arrested,\" says Allans. \"The police are everywhere. They're trying to push people back. People are even climbing on top of those water cannons.\"",
      "Despite the growing chaos outside, MPs remained in the chamber and the voting began.",
      "By 14:00, protesters had pushed police all the way back to the north-eastern corner of parliament.",
      "Inside at 14:14, the Finance Bill 2024 was voted in: 195 in favour, 106 against. Opposition MPs stormed out and word instantly reached the masses outside.",
      "\"This is when everybody is saying: 'Whatever happens, we are going to enter the parliament and show the MPs that we believe in what we're fighting for,'\" says Allans.",
      "At 14:20, protesters finally broke through the police blockade and reached the road running alongside parliament.",
      "An abandoned police truck stationed outside the gates was set on fire. Fences were torn down and protesters set foot on parliamentary grounds. The incursion was short-lived. Parliamentary security forces quickly cleared them out.",
      "At the same time, police officers went back up Parliament Road in force to drive the protesters back.",
      "While this was happening, journalists were filming, producing minute-by-minute footage from many angles.",
      "One of those videos captured a plain-clothes police officer shouting \"uaa!\", the Swahili word for \"kill\". Seconds later, a police officer knelt, gunshots were heard and protesters in the crowd collapsed - seven in total.",
      "David Chege, a 39-year-old software engineer and Sunday-school teacher, and Ericsson Mutisya, a 25-year-old butcher, were shot dead. Five other men were wounded, one of whom was left paralysed from the waist down.",
      "Footage shows Allans, the student journalist, holding up a Kenyan flag as he tried to reach Chege and another casualty bleeding out after the gunfire.",
      "But who fired those shots?",
      "In the video of the officer shouting, \"uaa!\", the shooter's back was to the camera. But the BBC compared his body armour, riot shield and headgear with that of every police officer at the scene.",
      "In his case, he had an upturned neck guard. We matched his distinctive uniform to an officer in a video recorded seconds later. There, he made sure to hide his face before firing into the crowd. We do not know his name.",
      "Even after the fatal shots, the plain-clothes officer could still be heard urging his colleagues forward to \"kill\". He was not so cautious about concealing his identity: his name is John Kaboi.",
      "Multiple sources have told the BBC he is based at the Central Nairobi Police Station.",
      "The BBC put its allegations to Kenya's police service, which said the force could not investigate itself, adding that the IPOA was responsible for investigating alleged misconduct.",
      "Kaboi has been approached for comment and not replied.",
      "No-one has been held accountable for the deaths of Chege or Mutisya. The BBC found that neither of them was armed.",
      "But these would not be the only lives lost. Rather than spook the demonstrators, the killings galvanised them and they tried for parliament again.",
      "At 14:57 they made it in.",
      "Footage shows them breaking down the fences and walking across the parliament's grounds. Many had their hands up. Others were holding placards or the Kenyan flag.",
      "Warning shots were fired. The demonstrators ducked down, then continued towards the building, filming on their phones as they went.",
      "Once inside, momentum turned to mayhem. Doors were kicked in, part of the complex was set alight and the last of the MPs fled the building.",
      "The destruction was severe but, after five minutes, footage showed them leaving the same way they had come in.",
      "At 15:04, shots rang out again and protesters tumbled across the flattened fence. As the smoke cleared, camera footage showed three bodies lying on the ground. Two were wounded - one raised his hand but could not get up.",
      "The third, 27-year-old finance student Eric Shieni, was dead - shot in the head from behind as he was leaving the grounds. The BBC again found, as in the cases of Chege and Mutisya, that he had been unarmed.",
      "BBC Africa Eye analysed more than 150 images taken during the minutes before and after Shieni was shot. We are able to identify the soldier who fired at the back of his head from 25m (82ft) away - again, we do not know his name.",
      "\"The video is very clear,\" says Faith Odhiambo, president of the Law Society of Kenya.",
      "\"The aim was to kill those protesters. They could have had him arrested. But the fact that you shoot his head - it was clearly an intention to kill.",
      "\"You have become the judge, the jury and the sentence executioner for Eric.\"",
      "The Kenyan Defence Forces (KDF) told the BBC the IPOA had not forwarded any request to look into any of its personnel involved in the operations at parliament.",
      "It added: \"The KDF remains fully committed to upholding the rule of law and continues to operate strictly within its constitutional mandate.\"",
      "After the shooting Allans is seen again, leading the evacuation. Footage shows him carrying a man with blood gushing from his leg.",
      "\"I feared for my life, that my parents would never see me again,\" he says.",
      "\"But I also feared to let other people die when I could help.\"",
      "People outside the UK can watch here",
      "As the sun set on 25 June, the country was reeling. After a week of protests, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights declared that 39 people had died and 361 had been injured around the country.",
      "That evening President William Ruto thanked his security officers for their \"defence of the nation's sovereignty\" against \"organised criminals\" who had \"hijacked\" the protests.",
      "The following day, the finance bill was dropped.",
      "\"Listening keenly to the people of Kenya, who have said loudly that they want nothing to do with this Finance Bill 2024, I concede,\" the president said in a national televised address, adding he would not sign it into law.",
      "But to this day no security officer has been held to account for the deaths and no official investigation has been published.",

    "published": "Sun, 27 Apr 2025 23:34:09 GMT",
    "summary": "The impact of what President Trump has done so far is being felt in every corner of American life.",
    "story": [
      "During last year's presidential campaign, Donald Trump constantly repeated his intention to bring about dramatic change as soon as he returned to the White House.",
      "But few expected it to come at such breakneck speed.",
      "In the three months since he took the oath of office, the 47th president has deployed his power in a way that compares to few predecessors.",
      "In stacks of bound documents signed off with a presidential pen and policy announcements made in all caps on social media, his blizzard of executive actions has reached into every corner of American life.",
      "To his supporters, the shock-and-awe approach has been a tangible demonstration of an all-action president, delivering on his promises and enacting long-awaited reforms.",
      "But his critics fear he is doing irreparable harm to the country and overstepping his powers - crippling important government functions and perhaps permanently reshaping the presidency in the process.",
      "Here are six turning points from the first 100 days.",
      "A social media post sets off a constitutional firestorm",
      "For once, it wasn't a Trump social media post that sparked an outcry.",
      "Three weeks into the new term, at 10.13am on a Sunday morning, Vice-President JD Vance wrote nine words that signalled a strategy which has since shaped the Trump administration's second term.",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he declared on X.",
      "In the media frenzy that followed, legal experts lined up to challenge that assertion, pointing to a 220-year-old principle which lies at the heart of American democracy.",
      "Courts have the power to check and strike down any government action - laws, regulations and executive orders - they think violates the US Constitution.",
      "Vance's words represented a brazen challenge to judicial authority and, more broadly, the system of three co-equal branches of government crafted by America's founders.",
      "But Trump and his team remain unapologetic in extending the reach of the executive branch into the two other domains - Congress and the courts.",
      "The White House has moved aggressively to wrest control of spending from Congress, unilaterally defunding programmes and entire agencies.",
      "This erosion of its power has been largely met by silence on Capitol Hill, where Trump's Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers.",
      "The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times.",
      "Some of the biggest clashes have been over Trump's immigration crackdown. In March, more than 200 Venezuelans deemed a danger to the US, were deported to El Salvador, many under sweeping wartime powers and without the usual process of evidence being presented in court.",
      "A Republican-appointed judge on a federal appeals court said he was \"shocked\" by how the White House had acted.",
      "\"Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both,\" Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote.",
      "Trump and White House officials have said they will obey court rulings, even as the president lambasts many of the judges who issue them and the administration at times moves slowly to fully comply.",
      "It all amounts to a unique test of a constitutional system that for centuries has operated under a certain amount of good faith.",
      "While Trump has been at the centre of this push, one of his principal agents of chaos is a man who wasn't born in the US, but who built a business empire there.",
      "Brandishing a chainsaw, dressed in black",
      "Elon Musk, dressed in black from head to toe and wearing sunglasses, stood centre stage and basked in the adulation of the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd.",
      "The richest man in the world, who wants to cut trillions of dollars from the federal government, said he had a special surprise.",
      "Argentinian President Javier Milei, known for his own budget-slashing, emerged from backstage and handed him a shiny gold chainsaw.",
      "\"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" Musk exclaimed. \"CHAINSAW!!\"",
      "It was a dramatic illustration not only of Musk's enthusiasm for his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (Doge) assignment, but also of the near rock-star status that the South African-born technologist has developed among the Trump faithful.",
      "Since that appearance, Musk has dispatched his operatives across the federal government, pushing to access sensitive government databases and identify programmes to slash.",
      "Although he has not come anywhere near to finding the trillions of dollars of waste he once promised, his cuts have drastically reduced dozens of agencies and departments - essentially shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and attempting to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "While pledges to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government and trim the ballooning federal deficit typically have broad appeal, the manner in which Musk has used his metaphorical chainsaw has led to conflict with senior government officials and stoked anger among some of the American public.",
      "Some Trump supporters may approve of the administration's aggressive budget-cutting but other constituents have berated Republican legislators at town hall events.",
      "Hecklers have expressed fear that the cuts will adversely affect popular government programmes like Social Security retirement plans, veterans benefits, and health insurance coverage for the poor and elderly.",
      "Their concerns may not be entirely misplaced, given that these schemes make up the bulk of federal spending.",
      "If these programmes are not cut back, sweeping tax cuts that Trump has promised would further increase the scale of US government debt and put at risk arguably his biggest election promise - economic prosperity.",
      "'I had to think fast as billions was lost before my eyes'",
      "When trader Richard McDonald saw Trump hold up his charts in the White House Rose Garden showing a list of countries targeted by US tariffs, he knew he had to act fast.",
      "\"I jumped to my feet because I wasn't expecting a board [of charts] - I was expecting an announcement,\" he says.",
      "McDonald expected tariff cuts of 10% or 20%, but says \"nobody expected these huge numbers\".",
      "He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold.",
      "\"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first'.\"",
      "He is one of the many traders who were at the coal face of global markets when share prices plunged everywhere following Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement.",
      "The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US was hit particularly hard - and even though the White House has reversed course on some of the highest tariffs, it hasn't fully recovered since.",
      "The economy was the biggest concern for US voters in November's election, and Trump rode a tide of deep unhappiness over Biden's handling of inflation all the way to victory.",
      "His pledge to cut prices, pare back government regulation and boost homegrown industry was a pro-business message warmly welcomed on Wall Street and by many working Americans.",
      "But as Trump tries to follow through on his promise of new tariffs, the economic costs, at least in the short term, have become painfully apparent.",
      "The stock market is sinking, interest rates - including for home mortgages - are rising, and consumer confidence is down. Unemployment is also ticking up, in part due to the growing number of federal employees forced out of their jobs.",
      "The Federal Reserve Bank, along with economic experts, warn Trump's plan will shrink economic growth and possibly lead to a recession.",
      "While the president's approval ratings on his handling of the economy have tumbled, many of his supporters are sticking with him. And in former industrial areas hollowed out by the loss of manufacturing jobs, there are hopes that tariffs could even the global playing field.",
      "\"Trump has earned back the respect,\" says truck driver Ben Maurer in Pennsylvania, referring to tariffs on China. \"We are still the force to be reckoned with.\"",
      "Economic concerns have contributed to Trump's overall decline in the polls, but in one key area, he is still largely on solid ground in the public's eye - immigration.",
      "Spotted in a photo - 'My son, shackled in prison'",
      "\"It's him! It's him! I recognise his features,\" says Myrelis Casique Lopez, pointing at a photo of men shackled and cuffed on the floor of one of the most infamous prisons in the world.",
      "She had spotted her son in the image, taken from above, of a sea of shaven heads belonging to men in white T-shirts sat in long, straight rows.",
      "At home in Maracay, Venezuela, Ms Casique was shown the photograph, first shared online by the El Salvador authorities, by a BBC reporter.",
      "When she last had contact with her son, he was in the US and facing deportation to Venezuela but now he was 1,430 miles (2,300 km) away from her, one of 238 men sent by US authorities to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration says they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang - a powerful, multi-national crime operation - but Ms Casique insists her son is innocent.",
      "A tough stance on immigration was a central plank of Trump's re-election campaign, and the president has used his broad powers of enforcement to deliver that pledge.",
      "Illegal border crossings were falling at the end of the Biden presidency, but are now at their lowest monthly total for more than four years.",
      "A majority of the US public still backs the crackdown, but it has had a chilling effect on communities of foreign students who have found themselves caught up in the blitz.",
      "Some, including permanent residents, have been detained and face deportation because of their role in pro-Palestinian campus protests. They have rejected accusations that they support Hamas.",
      "Civil rights lawyers warn that some migrants are being deported without due process, sweeping up the innocent among the \"killers and thugs\" that Trump says are being targeted.",
      "While so far there haven't been the level of mass deportations that some hoped for and others feared, newly empowered immigration enforcement agents have taken action across the US in businesses, homes and churches.",
      "They have been active in universities too, which have become a prominent target of President Trump in several other ways.",
      "A clash with academic, media and corporate worlds",
      "On 21 April, Harvard University's president, Alan Garber, decided to confront the White House head-on.",
      "In a letter to the university community, he announced a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to freeze billions of dollars in federal grants.",
      "It was, he said, an illegal attempt to \"impose unprecedented and improper control\" over Harvard's operations.",
      "The White House said it had to take action because Harvard had not tackled antisemitism on campus - an issue that Garber said the university was taking steps to address.",
      "But the Ivy League college's move was the most prominent display of resistance against Trump's use of presidential power to target American higher education, a longstanding goal energised by pro-Palestinian protests that engulfed campuses in 2024.",
      "The president and his officials have since impounded or threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal spending to reshape elite institutions like Harvard, which the president and many of his supporters think push a liberal ideology on students and researchers.",
      "Earlier in the month, Columbia University in New York City had agreed to a number of White House demands, including changes to its protest policies, campus security practices and Middle Eastern studies department.",
      "A similar dynamic has played out in the corporate and media worlds.",
      "Trump has used the withholding of federal contracts as a way to pressure law firms to recruit and represent more conservatives.",
      "Some of the firms have responded by offering the Trump administration millions of dollars in free legal services, while two firms have filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the administration's punishments.",
      "A defamation lawsuit Trump brought against ABC News has led to the media company contributing $15m (\u00a311m) to Trump's presidential foundation.",
      "CBS is also in talks to settle a separate lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview, as its parent company Paramount seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "The Associated Press, by contrast, has resisted administration pressure to accept Trump's \"Gulf of America\" name change despite the White House's efforts to block the news agency from coverage of the president.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump warned about the runaway power of the federal government. Now in office, he is wielding that power in a way no previous modern president has attempted.",
      "Nowhere, however, have the impacts of his efforts been more visible than within the federal government agencies and departments that he now controls.",
      "A retreat on race and identity",
      "The press conference at the White House began with a moment's silence for the victims of an aircraft collision over the Potomac River.",
      "Within seconds of the pause coming to an end, however, Trump was on the attack.",
      "A diversity and inclusion initiative at the Federal Aviation Agency was partly to blame for the tragedy, the president claimed, because it hired people with severe intellectual disabilities as air traffic controllers. He did not provide any evidence.",
      "It was a startling moment that was emblematic of the attack his presidency has launched against inclusivity programmes that have proliferated in recent years across the US government and corporate world.",
      "Trump has directed the federal government to end its diversity and equity (DEI) programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".",
      "His directive has accelerated moves among leading global companies like Meta and Goldman to cut back or eliminate these programmes.",
      "First introduced in the 1960s in the wake of civil rights victories, early forms of DEI were an attempt to expand opportunities for black Americans. They later expanded to take in women, LGBT rights and other racial groups.",
      "Efforts were stepped up and embraced by much of corporate America in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matters protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police officers.",
      "But to its critics, DEI was putting politics and race above talent, creating division and was no longer needed in modern America.",
      "While Trump's directive seems to have support from a narrow majority of voters, some of the unexpected consequences have raised eyebrows.",
      "Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed from its website all mentions of the history of black and female service members. And the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan was initially flagged for removal from Pentagon documents, apparently due to the word \"gay\".",
      "Donald Trump's first 100 days have been an unprecedented display of unilateral power exercised by a modern American president.",
      "His efforts to dismantle large swaths of the federal government will take years, if not decades, for subsequent presidents to restore - if they so desire.",
      "In other ways, however, Trump's efforts so far may end up being less permanent. Without the support of new laws passed by Congress, many of his sweeping reforms could be wiped away by a future president.",
      "And so to what extent this whirlwind start leads to lasting change remains an open question.",
      "Later this year, the narrow Republican majorities in Congress will attempt to provide the legislative backing for Trump's agenda, but their success is far from guaranteed.",
      "And in next year's mid-term congressional elections, those majorities could be replaced by hostile Democrats bent on investigating the administration and curtailing his authority.",
      "Meanwhile, more court battles loom - and while the US Supreme Court has a conservative tilt, its decisions on a number of key cases could ultimately cut against Trump's efforts.",
      "The first 100 days of Trump's second term have been a dramatic show of political force, but the next 1,361 will be the real test of whether he can carve an enduring legacy.",

    "published": "Sun, 27 Apr 2025 19:26:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Suspects who are accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in October 2016 stand trial in Paris.",
    "story": [
      "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep.",
      "When he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.",
      "All her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.",
      "Yunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.",
      "She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.",
      "The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.",
      "But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",
      "Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",
      "Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.",
      "Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".",
      "Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not.",
      "One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.",
      "By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.",
      "Gun wielding robbers fled on bikes and on foot",
      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",
      "The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.",
      "They found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him.",
      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",
      "It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.",
      "\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.",
      "Blunders meant heist was doomed from the start",
      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",
      "\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.",
      "'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".",
      "\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed.",
      "\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"",
      "The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.",
      "\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.",
      "Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness.",
      "Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.",
      "In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.",
      "However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.",
      "\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

    "summary": "The impact of what President Trump has done so far is being felt in every corner of American life.",
    "story": [
      "During last year's presidential campaign, Donald Trump constantly repeated his intention to bring about dramatic change as soon as he returned to the White House.",
      "But few expected it to come at such breakneck speed.",
      "In the three months since he took the oath of office, the 47th president has deployed his power in a way that compares to few predecessors.",
      "In stacks of bound documents signed off with a presidential pen and policy announcements made in all caps on social media, his blizzard of executive actions has reached into every corner of American life.",
      "To his supporters, the shock-and-awe approach has been a tangible demonstration of an all-action president, delivering on his promises and enacting long-awaited reforms.",
      "But his critics fear he is doing irreparable harm to the country and overstepping his powers - crippling important government functions and perhaps permanently reshaping the presidency in the process.",
      "Here are six turning points from the first 100 days.",
      "A social media post sets off a constitutional firestorm",
      "For once, it wasn't a Trump social media post that sparked an outcry.",
      "Three weeks into the new term, at 10.13am on a Sunday morning, Vice-President JD Vance wrote nine words that signalled a strategy which has since shaped the Trump administration's second term.",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he declared on X.",
      "In the media frenzy that followed, legal experts lined up to challenge that assertion, pointing to a 220-year-old principle which lies at the heart of American democracy.",
      "Courts have the power to check and strike down any government action - laws, regulations and executive orders - they think violates the US Constitution.",
      "Vance's words represented a brazen challenge to judicial authority and, more broadly, the system of three co-equal branches of government crafted by America's founders.",
      "But Trump and his team remain unapologetic in extending the reach of the executive branch into the two other domains - Congress and the courts.",
      "The White House has moved aggressively to wrest control of spending from Congress, unilaterally defunding programmes and entire agencies.",
      "This erosion of its power has been largely met by silence on Capitol Hill, where Trump's Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers.",
      "The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times.",
      "Some of the biggest clashes have been over Trump's immigration crackdown. In March, more than 200 Venezuelans deemed a danger to the US, were deported to El Salvador, many under sweeping wartime powers and without the usual process of evidence being presented in court.",
      "A Republican-appointed judge on a federal appeals court said he was \"shocked\" by how the White House had acted.",
      "\"Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both,\" Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote.",
      "Trump and White House officials have said they will obey court rulings, even as the president lambasts many of the judges who issue them and the administration at times moves slowly to fully comply.",
      "It all amounts to a unique test of a constitutional system that for centuries has operated under a certain amount of good faith.",
      "While Trump has been at the centre of this push, one of his principal agents of chaos is a man who wasn't born in the US, but who built a business empire there.",
      "Brandishing a chainsaw, dressed in black",
      "Elon Musk, dressed in black from head to toe and wearing sunglasses, stood centre stage and basked in the adulation of the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd.",
      "The richest man in the world, who wants to cut trillions of dollars from the federal government, said he had a special surprise.",
      "Argentinian President Javier Milei, known for his own budget-slashing, emerged from backstage and handed him a shiny gold chainsaw.",
      "\"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" Musk exclaimed. \"CHAINSAW!!\"",
      "It was a dramatic illustration not only of Musk's enthusiasm for his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (Doge) assignment, but also of the near rock-star status that the South African-born technologist has developed among the Trump faithful.",
      "Since that appearance, Musk has dispatched his operatives across the federal government, pushing to access sensitive government databases and identify programmes to slash.",
      "Although he has not come anywhere near to finding the trillions of dollars of waste he once promised, his cuts have drastically reduced dozens of agencies and departments - essentially shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and attempting to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "While pledges to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government and trim the ballooning federal deficit typically have broad appeal, the manner in which Musk has used his metaphorical chainsaw has led to conflict with senior government officials and stoked anger among some of the American public.",
      "Some Trump supporters may approve of the administration's aggressive budget-cutting but other constituents have berated Republican legislators at town hall events.",
      "Hecklers have expressed fear that the cuts will adversely affect popular government programmes like Social Security retirement plans, veterans benefits, and health insurance coverage for the poor and elderly.",
      "Their concerns may not be entirely misplaced, given that these schemes make up the bulk of federal spending.",
      "If these programmes are not cut back, sweeping tax cuts that Trump has promised would further increase the scale of US government debt and put at risk arguably his biggest election promise - economic prosperity.",
      "'I had to think fast as billions was lost before my eyes'",
      "When trader Richard McDonald saw Trump hold up his charts in the White House Rose Garden showing a list of countries targeted by US tariffs, he knew he had to act fast.",
      "\"I jumped to my feet because I wasn't expecting a board [of charts] - I was expecting an announcement,\" he says.",
      "McDonald expected tariff cuts of 10% or 20%, but says \"nobody expected these huge numbers\".",
      "He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold.",
      "\"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first'.\"",
      "He is one of the many traders who were at the coal face of global markets when share prices plunged everywhere following Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement.",
      "The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US was hit particularly hard - and even though the White House has reversed course on some of the highest tariffs, it hasn't fully recovered since.",
      "The economy was the biggest concern for US voters in November's election, and Trump rode a tide of deep unhappiness over Biden's handling of inflation all the way to victory.",
      "His pledge to cut prices, pare back government regulation and boost homegrown industry was a pro-business message warmly welcomed on Wall Street and by many working Americans.",
      "But as Trump tries to follow through on his promise of new tariffs, the economic costs, at least in the short term, have become painfully apparent.",
      "The stock market is sinking, interest rates - including for home mortgages - are rising, and consumer confidence is down. Unemployment is also ticking up, in part due to the growing number of federal employees forced out of their jobs.",
      "The Federal Reserve Bank, along with economic experts, warn Trump's plan will shrink economic growth and possibly lead to a recession.",
      "While the president's approval ratings on his handling of the economy have tumbled, many of his supporters are sticking with him. And in former industrial areas hollowed out by the loss of manufacturing jobs, there are hopes that tariffs could even the global playing field.",
      "\"Trump has earned back the respect,\" says truck driver Ben Maurer in Pennsylvania, referring to tariffs on China. \"We are still the force to be reckoned with.\"",
      "Economic concerns have contributed to Trump's overall decline in the polls, but in one key area, he is still largely on solid ground in the public's eye - immigration.",
      "Spotted in a photo - 'My son, shackled in prison'",
      "\"It's him! It's him! I recognise his features,\" says Myrelis Casique Lopez, pointing at a photo of men shackled and cuffed on the floor of one of the most infamous prisons in the world.",
      "She had spotted her son in the image, taken from above, of a sea of shaven heads belonging to men in white T-shirts sat in long, straight rows.",
      "At home in Maracay, Venezuela, Ms Casique was shown the photograph, first shared online by the El Salvador authorities, by a BBC reporter.",
      "When she last had contact with her son, he was in the US and facing deportation to Venezuela but now he was 1,430 miles (2,300 km) away from her, one of 238 men sent by US authorities to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration says they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang - a powerful, multi-national crime operation - but Ms Casique insists her son is innocent.",
      "A tough stance on immigration was a central plank of Trump's re-election campaign, and the president has used his broad powers of enforcement to deliver that pledge.",
      "Illegal border crossings were falling at the end of the Biden presidency, but are now at their lowest monthly total for more than four years.",
      "A majority of the US public still backs the crackdown, but it has had a chilling effect on communities of foreign students who have found themselves caught up in the blitz.",
      "Some, including permanent residents, have been detained and face deportation because of their role in pro-Palestinian campus protests. They have rejected accusations that they support Hamas.",
      "Civil rights lawyers warn that some migrants are being deported without due process, sweeping up the innocent among the \"killers and thugs\" that Trump says are being targeted.",
      "While so far there haven't been the level of mass deportations that some hoped for and others feared, newly empowered immigration enforcement agents have taken action across the US in businesses, homes and churches.",
      "They have been active in universities too, which have become a prominent target of President Trump in several other ways.",
      "A clash with academic, media and corporate worlds",
      "On 21 April, Harvard University's president, Alan Garber, decided to confront the White House head-on.",
      "In a letter to the university community, he announced a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to freeze billions of dollars in federal grants.",
      "It was, he said, an illegal attempt to \"impose unprecedented and improper control\" over Harvard's operations.",
      "The White House said it had to take action because Harvard had not tackled antisemitism on campus - an issue that Garber said the university was taking steps to address.",
      "But the Ivy League college's move was the most prominent display of resistance against Trump's use of presidential power to target American higher education, a longstanding goal energised by pro-Palestinian protests that engulfed campuses in 2024.",
      "The president and his officials have since impounded or threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal spending to reshape elite institutions like Harvard, which the president and many of his supporters think push a liberal ideology on students and researchers.",
      "Earlier in the month, Columbia University in New York City had agreed to a number of White House demands, including changes to its protest policies, campus security practices and Middle Eastern studies department.",
      "A similar dynamic has played out in the corporate and media worlds.",
      "Trump has used the withholding of federal contracts as a way to pressure law firms to recruit and represent more conservatives.",
      "Some of the firms have responded by offering the Trump administration millions of dollars in free legal services, while two firms have filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the administration's punishments.",
      "A defamation lawsuit Trump brought against ABC News has led to the media company contributing $15m (\u00a311m) to Trump's presidential foundation.",
      "CBS is also in talks to settle a separate lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview, as its parent company Paramount seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "The Associated Press, by contrast, has resisted administration pressure to accept Trump's \"Gulf of America\" name change despite the White House's efforts to block the news agency from coverage of the president.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump warned about the runaway power of the federal government. Now in office, he is wielding that power in a way no previous modern president has attempted.",
      "Nowhere, however, have the impacts of his efforts been more visible than within the federal government agencies and departments that he now controls.",
      "A retreat on race and identity",
      "The press conference at the White House began with a moment's silence for the victims of an aircraft collision over the Potomac River.",
      "Within seconds of the pause coming to an end, however, Trump was on the attack.",
      "A diversity and inclusion initiative at the Federal Aviation Agency was partly to blame for the tragedy, the president claimed, because it hired people with severe intellectual disabilities as air traffic controllers. He did not provide any evidence.",
      "It was a startling moment that was emblematic of the attack his presidency has launched against inclusivity programmes that have proliferated in recent years across the US government and corporate world.",
      "Trump has directed the federal government to end its diversity and equity (DEI) programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".",
      "His directive has accelerated moves among leading global companies like Meta and Goldman to cut back or eliminate these programmes.",
      "First introduced in the 1960s in the wake of civil rights victories, early forms of DEI were an attempt to expand opportunities for black Americans. They later expanded to take in women, LGBT rights and other racial groups.",
      "Efforts were stepped up and embraced by much of corporate America in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matters protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police officers.",
      "But to its critics, DEI was putting politics and race above talent, creating division and was no longer needed in modern America.",
      "While Trump's directive seems to have support from a narrow majority of voters, some of the unexpected consequences have raised eyebrows.",
      "Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed from its website all mentions of the history of black and female service members. And the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan was initially flagged for removal from Pentagon documents, apparently due to the word \"gay\".",
      "Donald Trump's first 100 days have been an unprecedented display of unilateral power exercised by a modern American president.",
      "His efforts to dismantle large swaths of the federal government will take years, if not decades, for subsequent presidents to restore - if they so desire.",
      "In other ways, however, Trump's efforts so far may end up being less permanent. Without the support of new laws passed by Congress, many of his sweeping reforms could be wiped away by a future president.",
      "And so to what extent this whirlwind start leads to lasting change remains an open question.",
      "Later this year, the narrow Republican majorities in Congress will attempt to provide the legislative backing for Trump's agenda, but their success is far from guaranteed.",
      "And in next year's mid-term congressional elections, those majorities could be replaced by hostile Democrats bent on investigating the administration and curtailing his authority.",
      "Meanwhile, more court battles loom - and while the US Supreme Court has a conservative tilt, its decisions on a number of key cases could ultimately cut against Trump's efforts.",
      "The first 100 days of Trump's second term have been a dramatic show of political force, but the next 1,361 will be the real test of whether he can carve an enduring legacy.",

    "summary": "Belichick's statement comes after segments of the interview posted to social media focused attention on the 73-year-old's relationship with his girlfriend, 24-year-old Jordon Hudson.",
    "story": [
      "Former Patriots coach Bill Belichick says his recent\u00a0interview on \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0created \"a false narrative\" about his relationship with his girlfriend, 24-year-old Jordon Hudson.",
      "Belichick, 73, who is now head coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, sat down with CBS News' Tony Dokoupil ahead of the release of his new book, \"The Art of Winning,\" but many commenters online focused on the glimpses of his relationship with Hudson.",
      "In a statement released Wednesday, Belichick said, \"Prior to this interview, I clearly communicated with my publicist at Simon & Schuster that any promotional interviews I participated in would agree to focus solely on the contents of the book.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, that expectation was not honored during the interview. I was surprised when unrelated topics were introduced, and I repeatedly expressed to the reporter, Tony Dokoupil, and the producers that I preferred to keep the conversation centered on the book,\" the statement continued. \"After this occurred several times, Jordon, with whom I share both a personal and professional relationship, stepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion.\"",
      "A CBS News spokesperson\u00a0responded: \"When we agreed to speak with Mr. Belichick, it was for a wide-ranging interview. There were no preconditions or limitations to this conversation. This was confirmed repeatedly with his publisher before the interview took place and after it was completed.\"",
      "Belichick's statement comes after portions of the interview posted to social media\u00a0generated scrutiny\u00a0of his relationship.",
      "Out of the eight-minute segment that aired on \"Sunday Morning,\" Belichick and Dokoupil discussed Hudson, whom the football legend described in his upcoming book as his \"creative muse,\" for about one minute and 30 seconds.",
      "Dokoupil said in the recorded voiceover that Hudson was a \"constant presence\" during the interview. He asked Belichick, \"You have Jordon right over there. Everybody in the world seems to be following this relationship. They've got an opinion about your private life. It's got nothing to do with them, but they're invested in it. How do you deal with that?\"",
      "\"I've never been too worried about what everybody else thinks,\" Belichick replied. \"Just try to do what I feel like is best for me and what's right.\"",
      "When Belichick was asked how the two of them met, Hudson spoke up: \"Not talking about this.\"",
      "In his statement Wednesday, Belichick defended Hudson.",
      "\"She was not deflecting any specific question or topic but simply doing her job to ensure the interview stayed on track. Some of the clips make it appear as though we were avoiding the question of how we met, but we have been open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021,\" he said.",
      "\"The final eight-minute segment does not reflect the productive 35-minute conversation we had, which covered a wide range of topics related to my career. Instead, it presents selectively edited clips and stills from just a few minutes of the interview to suggest a false narrative \u2014 that Jordon was attempting to control the conversation \u2014 which is simply not true.\"",
      "In a separate statement released Tuesday, Belichick's literary agent, InkWell Management, said the segments resulted in \"a raft of hostile social media posts about his personal life.\"",
      "\"Bill has written an authoritative and entertaining book about success that should be judged by its contents, not by the clicks generated by the segment,\" InkWell Management said.",
      "Belichick's book\u00a0\"The Art of Winning\"\u00a0is scheduled for release May 6.",

      "\"So, this is the 1990s, probably? And you're playing something from the 1940s?\"",
      "\"Exactly!\"",
      "Likewise, Bobby Darin was an old soul, says his son, Dodd Darin. \"He admired, he loved, he respected the old timers. He loved that era of show business. That's what he related to.\"",
      "That may have had something to do with the woman who raised him: \"Polly, his mother, was an old vaudevillian,\" said Dodd. \"And she nurtured him and said, 'You can't play stickball in the street. And you can't roughhouse with kids' ('cause he was frail and sickly). 'But you can learn to sing. You can learn to dance. You can learn to play piano.' And it opened a whole world.\"",
      "\"Frail and sickly\" was no exaggeration. Born Walden Robert Cassotto, Darin suffered several bouts of rheumatic fever as a child, permanently damaging his heart. When he was a boy, he overheard a family doctor say that he wouldn't live beyond his teenage years. \"Put yourself in that position,\" said Dodd. \"So, he was ambitious. He was driven. He was always on the go. He was trying to jam it all in, 'cause he knew he didn't have time.\"",
      "With no time to waste, he began writing songs, and at 22, Bobby Darin made waves with a recording of \"Splish Splash.\"",
      "Bobby Darin performs \"Splish Splash\" (1958):",
      "Not one to play it safe, for his second album, in 1959, Darin took a dark ballad from the German \"Threepenny Opera\" and made it swing. \"When my dad took 'Mack the Knife' before it was released and had Dick Clark listen to it, he said, 'Why are you doing this? This is gonna bomb!'\" Dodd said.",
      "It won the Grammy for record of the year, and became the biggest hit of Darin's career.",
      "The next year, he was on his way to Italy to make his motion picture debut opposite America's sweetheart, Sandra Dee. \"We hit it right off,\" Darin said. \"She hated me and I loved her, and that was it.\"",
      "The teen idol married the teen movie star in December of 1960, and welcomed their son, Dodd, a year later. Dodd would later write, \"My father made his destiny. Destiny made my mother.\"",
      "What did he mean by that? \"Well, my mom went through a lot,\" he said. \"Never really wanted fame. She really didn't crave it. It just sort of happened. Unlike my dad, who loved performing, loved show business.\"",
      "Dee was looking for a home life, said Dodd, but Bobby Darin wasn't ready to slow down. The marriage ended after six years. Darin never stopped playing the clubs.",
      "Sammy Davis Jr. once said that Bobby Darin was the one person he wouldn't want to have to follow. \"Absolutely true,\" said Dodd. \"My dad idolized Sammy.\"",
      "The feeling was mutual, as seen in a 1959 broadcast of \"This Is Your Life\":",
      "Also featured during the episode was Nina, the woman Darin thought was his sister. But almost a decade later he would learn a long-held family secret: Nina was in fact Bobby's mother, having given birth to him out of wedlock as a teenager. Which made Polly, the woman he thought was his mother, his grandmother. \"He was never the same,\" said Dodd. \"He said that his whole life was a lie; he was, like, a fraud. It's just devastating. There's no sugarcoating it.\"",
      "Looking at that tape today, says Dodd, it all seems obvious. \"That's a mother's love,\" he said. \"That's not a sister, okay? That's the adulation of, 'This is my son,' but you can't say it.\"",
      "Dodd, who was seven years old when his father found out, remembers a change in your father from that time: \"I'm not gonna say it's directly attributed to that incident; I'm sure that's part of it. But he got into the Bob Darin stage, you know? He took off his toupee. No more tuxedo. Started doing folk music, protest music, writing music, and dropped out of show business for a while.",
      "\"And that was some of the best times I had with him. He was a regular dude. We were up in Big Sur in a trailer, hanging out. And yeah, he let his hair down, if you will. It was good times.\"",
      "Bobby Darin performs \"Simple Song of Freedom\" (1970):",
      "In December of 1973, Bobby Darin's heart finally gave out. He was 37. Dodd had just turned 12. Now 63, Dodd Darin is grateful that, with the new Broadway show, a new generation can learn the story of his father.",
      "\"It's so beautiful that all these years later \u2013 he's been gone over 50 years \u2013 we're here talking about him. We're remembering him,\" said Dodd. \"He did something right.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/f-scott-fitzgeralds-the-great-gatsby-at-100/",
    "published": "Sun, 27 Apr 2025 09:38:13 -0400",
    "summary": "In 1925, a tragic tale of striving featuring an enigmatic millionaire was published \u2013 and it bombed. Since then, its reputation has only grown, to where many consider \"The Great Gatsby\" the Great American Novel.",
    "story": [
      "Dotting the water's edge of Long Island's Manhasset Bay, the opulence of the homes speaks for itself. But not nearly as well as F. Scott Fitzgerald once spoke of that opulence:",
      "\"A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other, like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling.\"",
      "That \"wedding cake\" of a ceiling, in a home now owned by Elena and George Schietinger, likely did look down on Gatsbyesque parties back in the day. \"I can almost hear the music playing and feel the spirits of the parties that went on here,\" said Elena.",
      "\"The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo.\"",
      "Fitzgerald lived in a much more modest house just a few miles away when he was writing \"The Great Gatsby.\" The Schietingers, though, believe the author must have visited here. They imagine him, while tilting his head back to down a bootleg cocktail, and taking note, and then writing their ceiling into his novel. \"I absolutely believe that to be true,\" said George.",
      "Fitzgerald's novel came out a hundred years ago this month. Scholars consider it a literary masterpiece. Hollywood finds it irresistible, and so does Broadway. There's even a recent graphic novel of \"Gatsby\" that brings Fitzgerald's characters to life, starting with James Gatz, who believed he was too poor to marry the rich girl of his dreams \u2013 and so he reinvents himself. It's less about love, and more about longing \u2013 his especially, for Daisy Buchanan just across the bay.",
      "They were so near, and yet worlds apart.",
      "\"I hadn't realized that either side of the bay, that they were so close to one another,\" said Blake Hazard, the great-granddaughter of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. \"I mean, you almost could look into the windows on the other side.\"",
      "She says her celebrated relatives are looming lovingly large on this centennial. \"I've gotten used to witnessing these kinds of things about my family, about my great-grandfather with other people, sharing it, and I think that feels right,\" Hazard said.",
      "Gatsby Tours have become popular, including one run by Kevin C. Fitzpatrick, an author and New York historian.",
      "\"There's a point we're in the middle of Manhasset Bay, and you can look to the left to West Egg and to the right to East Egg, and \u2013 it clicks,\" he said, \"because they can picture that green light on that dock.\"",
      "Few of those mansions remain \u2013 most never survived the Great Depression, torn down to make room for the new.",
      "From the archives: Death of the \"Great Gatsby House\" (YouTube Video)",
      "But back in Manhattan, some of the Gatsby lore remains, especially at the Plaza Hotel and its revolving doors. \"There are stories that Zelda would come in here and just go around and around and around,\" Hazard said.",
      "It was a temple to the times, where important people did important things, including Hazard's great-grandparents. \u00a0\"They both really wanted to be in the world, of the world, writing about what they saw, chronicling it all \u2026 and having a great time doing it,\" she said.",
      "The Fitzgeralds were not wealthy themselves. While they did enjoy money, they were amused with its perils, too.",
      "\"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy. They smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money, or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together.\"",
      "Hazard said, \"He was drawn to these things, but also very much an observer of them; he felt very outside of, certainly, the wealthy set.\"",
      "Fitzgerald did rub elbows with the wealthy set at Princeton University. Although he later dropped out, his papers found their way back, including the only surviving handwritten manuscript of \"Gatsby,\" which Emma Sarconi, a rare book librarian at Princeton's Special Collections at the Firestone Library, showed us.",
      "\"Here we have half a page scribbled out. The whole book is like this,\" she said.",
      "At the time, Fitzgerald was coming off two big hits: \"This Side of Paradise\" and \"The Beautiful and Damned.\" He believed that \"Gatsby\" would surpass both of them. But \"Gatsby\" landed with a thud, selling less than 20,000 copies. And according to Sarconi, the mixed reviews left him devastated: \"He wrote a letter to his daughter, Scottie, sort of in his final years, lamenting the fact that none of her friends would know who he was,\" she said.",
      "So, what changed? The times, perhaps. During World War II, the newly-formed Council on Books in Wartime shipped millions of pocket-sized books to keep the troops entertained overseas, including 155,000 copies of \"The Great Gatsby.\"\u00a0 \"We wouldn't be talking about this book today if this edition hadn't come out,\" Sarconi said.",
      "Fitzgerald had died long before that, at the age of 44. At that point he thought that he was a failure. \"He had really fallen into obscurity,\" said Sarconi. \"Famously, very few people attended his funeral.\"",
      "And yet today, \"Gatsby\" rubs dust jackets with the likes of Jane Austen, John Steinbeck and Ernest Hemingway. For many, \"The Great Gatsby\" is indeed the Great American Novel.",
      "\"It sounds silly, but I wish Scott could be here, I just think he'd be so thrilled,\" said Hazard, \"and surprised. Certainly surprised!\"",
      "Among the few keepsakes that Blake has are a necklace given to Zelda by Scott, as well as a ring. Is it a coincidence the stone is green? We'll never know.",
      "Still, that haunting green light still blinks for all of us; dreams, perfection, whatever eludes us \u2013 we keep trying.",
      "\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly, into the past.\"",

    "story": [
      "Diabetes deaths in the U.S. have fallen to some of the lowest rates in years, according to new preliminary figures published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reversing a surge in mortality that was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "There were 26.4 deaths per 100,000 people from diabetes, according to early death certificate data for the third quarter of 2024 published this month by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, according to CDC figures, at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people for that year. Diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in 2021. The CDC says the link between COVID-19 and diabetes may be to blame for that increase.",
      "\"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death,\" Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Holliday added that research shows the pandemic may also have made it harder for Americans to properly manage the disease, ranging from interruptions to physical activity to disruptions to routine medical care diagnosing and treating the disease.",
      "\"While diabetes-related death rates have decreased since 2021, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels,\" Holliday said.",
      "There were 103,294 deaths from diabetes in 2021, up more than 17% from 87,647 deaths in 2019 before the pandemic. Provisional data reported so far for 2024 have tallied 94,294 diabetes deaths last year.",
      "Diabetes deaths had been largely falling in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Those trends were before the introduction of new diabetes treatments like Ozempic and Mounjaro that have seen high demand.",
      "Nearly 1 in 10 adults had diagnosed diabetes in 2023, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.",
      "Experts caution that analyzing long term trends in diabetes deaths is complex for a number of reasons, including changes in the definition of the disease over the past decades and variation in how death certificates record diabetes deaths.",
      "Also, not all death certificates record diabetes as the main \"underlying cause of death\" but instead as a contributing factor, which is counted separately.",
      "\"Diabetes is a more common contributing cause of death, not the primary underlying cause of death. Furthermore, most deaths among people with diabetes are cardiovascular and would be counted among the cardiovascular,\" Elizabeth Selvin, director of the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, said in an email to CBS News.",
      "Selvin said it is up to doctors to choose whether to select diabetes or other underlying health conditions as the cause of a heart attack death.",
      "\"All of this to say, trends in underlying causes of death will reflect awareness of diabetes and coding practices; It is hard to know what role these play in these data,\" Selvin said.",

    "story": [
      "The head of the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that the agency is now looking at whether it will still approve COVID-19 vaccines for next winter, citing a lack of data on booster shots.",
      "\"We're taking a look. I can't comment on any particular application. As you know, we have a bunch of applications for those booster shots,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett.",
      "Makary said many health care workers did not get the last round of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots, calling it \"a bit of a public trust problem.\"",
      "\"I think there's a void of data. And I think rather than allow that void to be filled with opinions, I'd like to see some good data,\" Makary said.",
      "His answer marks a change from during the Biden administration, when FDA officials backed plans to routinely update the COVID-19 vaccines each year.",
      "Last year, the FDA issued guidance on what strain should be targeted by the shots for the following winter. Updates to Moderna and Pfizer's COVID shots for the new strain were approved in August.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also now weighing whether to significantly narrow its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Makary's remarks echo his justification for delaying Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to get full approval on April 1. Novavax said Monday that the FDA had asked the company to commit to another clinical trial of the shot.",
      "\"Today, there is broad population immunity, and the big question is does it provide a benefit? Without a study on the new formulation and product, we can't give an honest evidence-based answer to that question,\" Makary told the newsletter \"Inside Medicine\" this week.",
      "Multiple companies are now also being asked \"to do clinical studies, a basic clinical study, so we can educate the population and have information to work with,\" Makary told CBS News.",
      "\"It's my general feeling, not with this particular product, which I can't discuss in depth, but with drugs in general, that we need to know if they work today in order to be able to recommend them,\" he said.",
      "He also praised his special assistant, Dr. Tracy Beth H\u00f8eg, when asked what role she played in the agency's evaluation of Novavax's application.",
      "\"Dr. H\u00f8eg is an amazing M.D.-Ph.D. who has joined my staff as a special assistant to the commissioner. And she is involved in reviewing data sets at the agency. And I'm really excited to have her in the process,\" Makary said.",
      "Trade industry publication The Pink Sheet previously reported that H\u00f8eg had been asked to step in on Novavax's application. H\u00f8eg was also added to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunizations, in a slot previously filled by a career vaccines official from the FDA.",
      "Former FDA officials have criticized the agency's new political leadership for their intervention in vaccine approvals, a process which is usually entrusted to career scientific officials.",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 20:05:40 -0400",
    "summary": "Some FDA scientists and inspections staff were told that their layoffs may be rescinded.",
    "story": [
      "Food and Drug Administration officials have told some scientists and inspections staff that their layoffs will be reversed, after the job cuts led to disruptions in drug and food safety work.",
      "The move marks a significant reversal of a portion of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs. Kennedy initially planned to cut 3,500 employees from the FDA.",
      "In team-wide meetings that started last week, multiple FDA employees said they were informed by their supervisors that they should expect to have their layoffs reversed.",
      "Among the laid-off staff told they would be brought back are scientists for drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit as well as food safety labs\u00a0in Chicago and San Francisco. A handful of support staff for the FDA's inspectors are also being brought back.",
      "Multiple FDA scientists said they were eager to go back to work, though they had yet to receive official paperwork for reversing the layoffs.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the FDA's food safety labs were being reinstated.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services blamed errors in the layoffs on inaccurate data from the department's \"siloed HR divisions.\"",
      "\"This is exactly why HHS is reorganizing its administrative functions to streamline operations and fix the broken systems left to us by the Biden Administration. Streamlining this into one operation will allow for enhanced data integrity and coordination,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said some layoffs would be walked back, like to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's lead poisoning teams. But that reversal never ended up happening, leaving the agency's lead poisoning work largely abandoned.",
      "Some CDC laboratories also remain closed, including the agency's now-shuttered labs for investigating outbreaks of hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases or for worker safety, like oversight of N95 masks.",
      "FDA inspections falling behind",
      "Around two dozen of the support staff for the FDA's inspectors have been told their layoffs would be reversed, out of nearly 200 who were cut. The employees being restored are focused on booking travel for foreign inspections.",
      "Cuts to the FDA's Office of Inspections and Investigations have taken a steep toll on the agency's inspections, especially for overseas manufacturers of drugs and food products.",
      "A pilot program started under the Biden administration to expand unannounced foreign inspections stalled due to the cuts, multiple officials said. In a recent week, one FDA official said less than 60% of the agency's planned foreign inspections had been completed.",
      "Sidelined inspectors of foreign firms have been asked to find ways to \"pivot to\" local inspections they can do within the U.S. instead, according to internal emails shared with CBS News. More than $700,000 of expenses incurred by inspectors have also yet to be paid, an official said, due to the layoffs to support staff.",
      "Hopes by FDA leaders to increase inspections have also run up against an ongoing federal hiring freeze, officials said, especially as the ranks of supervisors for inspectors have been depleted by early retirements and resignations.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary had initially greenlighted a plan to use contractors to fill the gap, before the department moved to reverse some of the layoffs.",
      "FDA drug safety work stalls",
      "Multiple current and laid-off FDA employees said the abrupt layoffs had resulted in delays and disruptions to the agency's drug safety work. Virtually all the scientists in the FDA's San Juan and Detroit labs were cut, leaving only labs in New York and Irvine, California.",
      "The FDA labs in Detroit and San Juan had also been responsible for checking the shelf life of medical treatments stockpiled by the federal government for the military and pandemics, under a program administered by the Department of Defense.",
      "The layoffs also cut chemists based out of the labs who worked as foreign inspectors for the FDA, often assigned to travel with badge-carrying investigators to help with more complex or urgent frontline inspections of drugmakers.",
      "Some of the agency's work to detect and investigate fraudulent medical products had also effectively stalled, they said, amid complications around transferring the custody of the samples and a backlog of work that predated the April 1 layoffs.",
      "The FDA's labs had already been struggling with new hurdles to purchasing that had slowed their work, as staff waited for weeks in some cases for supply orders, officials said.",

      "The plans outlined by NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to amass a broad swath of confidential health data, as part of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s autism research effort, have been the subject of intense criticism in recent days by advocacy groups and autism researchers.",

      "The NIH director previously said, as part of a presentation to a meeting of the agency's outside advisers about the effort, that the NIH would be \"developing national disease registries, including a new one for autism\" to be integrated into a new \"data platform\" to study autism and other chronic diseases.",
      "The HHS official did not say whether Bhattacharya initially misspoke or explain why his plan was reversed. Bhattacharya did not respond to a request for comment. HHS has not responded to a CBS News request for an interview with Bhattacharya about the registry.",
      "Some $50 million will be invested in the research effort, which includes the data platform, the HHS official's statement said, which is \"aimed at understanding the causes of ASD [autism spectrum disorder] and improving treatments by leveraging large-scale data resources and fostering cross-sector collaboration.\"",
      "According to the official, the NIH still plans to explore partnerships with other federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \"to facilitate a comprehensive real-world health dataset that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy while supporting research into autism and other areas such as chronic diseases.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the NIH said its \"secure data repository\" would \"analyze large-scale, de-identified data\" for autism and chronic diseases, similar to the agency's cancer database. The autism research would \"be fully compliant\" with federal privacy laws and regulations, the agency said.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. economic growth slowed sharply in the first quarter of 2025 as businesses rushed to stockpile goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies.",
      "The nation's gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of products and services \u2014 shrank at a 0.3% annual rate, down from growth of 2.4% in the final three months of 2024, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday in its initial GDP estimate. It's the worst quarterly performance for the U.S. economy since early 2022, when the economy was in recovery after cratering during the COVID pandemic.",
      "The U.S. economy was forecast to show 0.8% growth in the first three months of 2025, according to the average estimate of economists polled by FactSet.",
      "The slowdown comes amid growing concerns that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy, with some economists raising the chances of the U.S.\u00a0slipping into a recession in 2025. Although the Trump administration's blanket tariffs were announced on April 2 \u2014 after the end of the quarter \u2014 businesses sought to get ahead of the impact of the import duties by front-loading purchases early in the year.",
      "The report may not fully reflect the state of economic growth, economists cautioned, noting that the figures are likely to be noisy because of the surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs. A rise in imports may appear to lower economic growth and show a shift away from domestic consumption, but that doesn't tell the whole story, economists note.",
      "Nevertheless, concerns about the tariffs caused businesses and consumers to change their behavior at year start, signaling that the rollout of steep import fees could create headwinds for the economy later in 2025, experts said.",
      "\"This artificial front-loading of demand sets the stage for a sharper demand cliff in Q2 \u2014 a far more troubling phase of the ongoing economic slowdown.\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "Yet GDP could get a second-quarter boost as companies import fewer goods in the current quarter due to the rollout of the tariffs and the front-loading at the start of the year, according to Capital Economics.",
      "Another key measure of the economy's health \u2014 known as final sales to private domestic purchasers \u2014 also rose 3% in the first quarter, edging up from 2.9% in the previous three months. That suggests demand from consumers and businesses remains resilient despite mounting concerns about the economy.",
      "\"Overall, [the GDP data is] not as bad as feared, although some of the drop back in imports in the second quarter will now be partly offset by a slowing in inventory accumulation,\" analysts with the investment advisory firm said in a report. \"We forecast a 2.0% annualized rebound in second-quarter GDP.\"",
      "Impact of DOGE cuts",
      "Growth in the first quarter was impacted by the increase in imports, as well as a 5.1% decline in government spending, the Commerce Department said.",
      "Mr. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, helmed by billionaire Elon Musk, has effectively shuttered major agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, cut hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and canceled funding for health and science research.",
      "Economists expect the U.S. economy to slow in 2025, partly due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which are import duties paid by American companies like Walmart or Target. When faced with higher tariffs, companies typically pass on all or some of the costs to shoppers, which can depress consumer spending.",
      "GDP growth is forecast to slow to 1.9% in 2025, according to FactSet. That's down from 2.8% in 2024.",
      "\"[T]he inflation data will show when the price increases of tariffs hit consumers, which will deliver a real income shock that we expect to weigh heavily on spending growth,\" Pearce said.",
      "A miss on ADP employment numbers",
      "Another red flag for the U.S. economy came on Wednesday with the release of ADP's employment numbers for April, which showed private employers added 62,000 jobs this month, far fewer than the 134,000 jobs that had been forecast by economists, according to FactSet.",
      "The monthly jobs report on Friday is expected to show that employers created 135,000 new jobs, a slowdown from 228,000 in March, FactSet data shows.",
      "The combination of weak ADP data, the GDP report and other economic data \"increasingly suggest a recession may have begun,\" said David Russell, global head of market strategy at trading company TradeStation, in an email.",
      "The shaky economic data could persuade the Federal Reserve to hold off on making more rate cuts, experts said. The central bank will make its next rate decision at its May 7 meeting, with most economists forecasting that the Fed will hold its benchmark rate steady.",

    "story": [
      "Despite promises to cut spending during the campaign and his first few months in office, President Trump's federal government has spent more than $200 billion more in his first 100 days compared to the same time period last year.",
      "In fact, the government is now spending more, day to day, than was spent in nine of the last 10 years. The exception: 2021, when the government was spending trillions to fight the coronavirus pandemic and prevent an economic disaster.",
      "CBS News analyzed the Treasury Department's daily financial reports to track the money flowing out of every government account each day since Mr. Trump returned to office. Here's a breakdown of what we found for spending through April 29. We will be tracking and updating the spending throughout the year.",
      "Some might ask how that's possible given the high-profile repeated announcements of layoffs, canceled contracts, claims of fraud elimination by Mr. Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and belt-tightening across the administration.",
      "The answer partly lies in the fundamentals of the government's budget when it comes to big-ticket expenditures that the White House can't fully control or massive changes to the way the U.S. pays for aging Americans' retirements and medical care.",
      "The rest of the answer is politics. The conservative base that elected Mr. Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress may not support cutting the other biggest share of federal spending, the operations of the U.S. military and caring for veterans.",
      "Take a look at some of the areas representing the largest spending and largest increases in Mr. Trump's first 100 days compared to the same time period in prior years.",
      "According to our analysis of the Treasury Department's daily reports on accounts, many of the largest persistently rising costs are direct payments to the military and seniors.",
      "The federal government's habit of spending more money than it takes in means the national debt is growing. Paired with higher interest rates, the daily price tag of paying the interest on the debt is skyrocketing. The amount over the last three months is about double the amount paid out just three years earlier.",
      "And the daily payments on bonds and other securities that show up in the Treasury Daily Statement cover only cash interest paid to public debt holders. There are other elements of the government's debt obligations that only add to the cost.",
      "One way the Trump administration can impact the budget is through the civilian workforce, and that's been a focal point of Musk and DOGE via layoffs and buyouts. But many of those attempts are facing legal challenges that have delayed or reversed firings.",
      "Despite the announced staff reductions, one of the biggest areas of the increasing spending in the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term remains federal salaries. Workers were given a 2% raise when then-President Biden signed an executive order two days before Christmas, a move allowed because of Congress' inaction on permanent federal budgets.",
      "Combined, it's the military and veterans, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt payments driving the lion's share of federal spending over the last decade. In the last full fiscal year, they accounted for nearly two-thirds of federal government outlays. That breakdown has barely changed over the last decade.",
      "The vast majority of the attempted cutting so far by DOGE has been outside those areas, focused on smaller targets that might prove popular with President Trump's political base, such as foreign aid, the Education Department and grants to colleges and universities.",
      "\"If the savings are rather small and the pain is high, DOGE is going to be a liability,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, who has been tracking DOGE's work.",
      "\"If you really want to cut federal spending, you're going to have to cut into the programs where the lion's share of the money is. That's Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security and we spend a lot of money on interest,\" Malkus said.",
      "There are some significant one-year spending reductions in some agencies and spending categories.",
      "Here's a look at some of the largest reductions since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"The fiscal year ends September 30. There's still a lot more year left so let's see where we are at the end of the year,\" said Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy.",
      "A look at DOGE cuts advertised",
      "Musk's DOGE team has focused its attention on many smaller spenders among federal programs.",
      "DOGE's website claims the task force has already saved that much, at $160 billion, between canceling grants, contracts and leases and making cuts to the federal workforce. On its \"wall of receipts\" site online, the office reports the largest reductions so far come from the Department of Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Department of Education, Department of Labor and Office of Personnel Management.",
      "Only about $60 billion, or less than 40%, of that alleged savings are itemized on the office's online \"wall of receipts\" and even those itemizations have included errors and lax documentation.",
      "In his work at the American Enterprise Institute, Malkus said his review indicates the savings is more likely to be around $80 billion.",
      "Even the $160 billion advertised as saved so far by DOGE would be tiny in the context of the larger federal budget and national debt.",
      "The administration has already spent more than $200 billion more than last year in a little over three months, according to CBS News' analysis of Treasury reports.",
      "The advertised savings represents less than 2% of a full year's national budget. That's akin to a family with $10,000 in monthly spending trimming its bills by $200 a month.",
      "The supporters of the administration's cost-cutting efforts have characterized it as necessary to root out fraud and waste and to take a bite out of the national debt. However, the Treasury Department reports that debt stands at $36 trillion as of this week.",
      "The $160 billion advertised DOGE savings is about 0.5% of the debt, so the reduction from DOGE's efforts would be like a family with $10,000 in credit card balances paying it down by $50.",
      "An independent analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, also reported recently that the disruptions caused by the DOGE cuts may have cost taxpayers $135 million.",
      "Musk recently said his work with DOGE is winding down.",
      "Explore the spending details yourself",
      "You can explore the government's daily account ledgers for yourself. We've isolated the money spent by category in the first few months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period in each of the last 10 years.",

Speaking during a Cabinet meeting at the White House, the president said Americans don't need many of the goods coming from China.",

You know, somebody said, 'Oh, the shelves are going to be open.' Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. But we're not talking about something that we have to go out of our way. They have ships that are loaded up with stuff, much of which, not all of it, but much of which we don't need.\"",
      "U.S. imports of goods made in China expand far beyond toys to include electronics, clothes, household goods, appliances, construction materials and more. The president has said he believes tariffs on Chinese goods will ultimately be substantially lower than 145%.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks came hours after the Commerce Department reported U.S. domestic gross product shrank at an 0.3% annual rate in the first quarter of 2025, down from growth of 2.4% at the end of 2024. It was the country's worst quarterly performance since early 2022. Despite taking credit for a strong stock market after his election victory and inauguration, Mr. Trump on Wednesday insisted the new economic numbers had nothing to do with him, and were the fault of his predecessor.",
      "\"This is Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's,\" the president wrote Wednesday on his social media platform Truth Social. \"I didn't take over until January 20th. Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden 'Overhang.' This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, the president took that statement a step further, telling reporters, \"You could even say the next quarter is sort of Biden.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has dismissed the possibility of higher prices stemming from tariffs before. Last month, he told NBC News in a phone interview that he \"couldn't care less\" if automakers raised prices as a result of his new tariffs. This week, the president took executive actions to soften the impact\u00a0of the 25% tariffs he's imposing on foreign cars and foreign auto parts.",
      "A recent CBS News/YouGov poll\u00a0found most Americans \u2014 69% \u2014 say the Trump administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, and 62% say he's focusing too much on implementing tariffs.",

      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",

Trump's\u00a0unrelenting pursuit\u00a0of American manufacturing dominance\" in a statement on its website.",
      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Apr 2025 10:09:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The drop-off in shipments could lead to empty store shelves this summer as retailers deem China-made goods too expensive to import.",
    "story": [
      "Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are dropping sharply with the Trump administration's steep tariffs in place, leading major U.S. retailers to warn about impending supply shortages.",
      "The trade war between China and the U.S. has escalated over the past few weeks, with each nation hiking its import duties multiple times in a tit-for-tat. While Trump has given other countries a 90-day pause on the tariffs, as their leaders pledged to negotiate with the U.S., China has remained the exception.",
      "U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand as high as 145%. China, meanwhile, has hit back with 125% tariffs on U.S. products.",
      "At the Port of Los Angeles, which, along with the Port of Long Beach, receives roughly 40% of all imports from Asia, shipments last week were down 10% compared with the same period one year earlier. That number is expected to keep falling.",
      "\"We are now beginning to see the flow of cargo to the Port of Los Angeles slow,\" Port of Los Angeles executive director Eugene Seroka said at a Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners meeting on April 24. \"It's my prediction that in two weeks time, arrivals will drop by 35%,\" he added.",
      "U.S. retailers had rushed to import goods into the country ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariffs going into effect, leading to a spike in imports since last summer. Now, with the 145% tariffs making goods from China roughly two-and-a-half times more expensive than they were last year, \"essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,\" Seroka said.",
      "By another estimate, container bookings from China to the U.S. are down by as much as 60%, according to Flexport, a supply chain management company. Bookings from other Asia ports, such as Vietnam and Thailand, are up 5% to 10% as some exporters look to expand production outside of China to avoid steep tariffs.",
      "The decline in bookings from China comes during what is usually a busy period for imports to the U.S.",
      "\"We would normally see an increase in bookings across the board, because this is the beginning of the shipping year,\" said Nathan Strang, director of ocean freight at Flexport. \"It's when back-to-school items and Halloween items start to come in.\"",
      "What's more, retailers have likely stockpiled sufficient inventory to last a couple of months, Seroka said, adding that come summer, consumers could find that many products are out of stock. All manner of goods flow through the Port of Los Angeles to end up in households across the U.S.",
      "The port's top five import categories are furniture, auto parts, clothing, plastics and footwear, a port spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Empty shelves?",
      "Major retailers and small establishments alike are warning that consumers could soon face tariff-related inventory shortages. Goods that do land on store shelves could be subject to price hikes, once \"tariff surcharges\" are added.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chef economist at private equity firm Apollo Global Management, said in a recent blog post that tariffs will lead to \"empty shelves in U.S. stores in a few weeks and COVID-like shortages for consumers and for firms using Chinese products as intermediate goods.\"",
      "Last week, the CEOs of Walmart and Target privately cautioned\u00a0President Trump that his sweeping tariff policy could lead to gaps on store shelves, if it remains in effect,\u00a0Axios first reported.",
      "\"We had a productive meeting with President Trump and his team and appreciated the opportunity to share our insights,\" Walmart\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "Target also said in a statement that it \"had a productive meeting with President Trump and our retail peers to discuss the path forward on trade, and we remain committed to delivering value for American consumers.\"",
      "Both retailers had previously publicly warned that the levies could lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"We never want to raise prices,\" but \"there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers,\" Walmart CFO John David Rainey\u00a0told CNBC.",
      "Last month, Target CEO Brian Cornell\u00a0told CNBC, \"the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days\" as a result of tariffs planned on imports from Mexico.",
      "Widespread booking freeze",
      "Logistics groups are also reporting sharp declines in cargo shipments from China.",
      "For the week of April 14, booking volumes from China to the U.S. dropped 45% compared with the same period one year earlier, according to Vizion, a container tracking service.",
      "\"This dramatic drop aligned with two key developments: the April 4th U.S. tariff announcement, followed by China's retaliatory measures announced on April 5th. The result? A widespread booking freeze, as shippers paused mid-shipment cycle to reassess costs, timelines and broader trade strategy,\" Vizion said in a report.",
      "Freightos, a freight booking platform, notes that carriers are canceling sailings from China at a fast clip, because they can't fill their ships with goods. Ocean container prices have dropped from $8,100 in July 2024 for a standard 40-foot container, to roughly, $2,327, the group noted.",
      "Many importers are pausing shipments until they gain more clarity into Mr. Trump's tariff plans. A Freightos survey of 195 small importers found that 33% of businesses planned to pause shipments in response to the tariffs.",
      "Kristin Bear, owner of a U.S.-based lingerie company, Kilo Brava, is hoping Mr. Trump softens his stance on tariffs, so that she can continue to manufacture garments in China and import them to the U.S. She can't afford to import goods with 145% tariffs in place, and if they don't come down, \"we'll just have to abandon the goods and close the company,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "UPS on Tuesday announced it is planning to cut 20,000 jobs this year, part of a cost-cutting effort that's linked to the delivery giant's decision to deliver fewer packages from Amazon, its biggest customer.",
      "The shipping company, which operates in over 200 countries, currently has around 490,000 employees. The layoffs will impact slightly over 4% of its workforce. This follows an announcement from UPS last year that it would cut 12,000 positions.",
      "The move is part of the company's plan to consolidate UPS's facilities and workforce. Along with the job cuts, the company announced it will also close 73 of its buildings by the end of June 2025 and said that it may target additional buildings for closure.",
      "\"These actions will enable us to expand our U.S. Domestic operating margin and increase profitability,\" Brian Dykes, the chief financial officer of UPS said during an earnings call on Tuesday morning.",
      "In a Tuesday regulatory filing, UPS said the cuts are in \"connection with our anticipation of lower volumes from our largest customer.\" The company, which announced $21.5 billion in revenue for this past quarter, expects to save $3.5 billion this year as a result of its consolidation plan.",
      "According to Sean M. O'Brien, the Teamsters general president, UPS is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs under their current national master agreement.",
      "\"If UPS wants to continue to downsize corporate management, the Teamsters won't stand in its way,\" O'Brien said. \"But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.\"",
      "\"Strong\" relationship with Amazon",
      "The company in January\u00a0said it had reached an agreement with Amazon to decrease its delivery volume by more than 50% in the second half of 2026.",
      "\"The reduction of package volume from Amazon is something UPS chose to do as we focus on revenue quality, and increase domestic operating margin and profitability,\" a UPS spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "Amazon said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the company has a \"strong working relationship\" with UPS and that it had actually offered to increase UPS' volumes before the delivery company made the decision to reduce its Amazon shipments.",
      "\"Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision,\" said Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson. \"We'll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers.\"",
      "UPS delivers millions of packages worldwide each year. Last year, the company delivered an average of 22.4 million parcels per day, or 5.7 billion for the entire year.",
      "UPS shares slipped 55 cents, or 0.6%, to $96.61 in afternoon trading.",
      "Trade risks rising",
      "In its\u00a0quarterly earnings statement, the company also mentioned the risk that shifts in global trade policy could have on business. The Trump administration has introduced sweeping new tariffs in recent months that have already began to impact the flow of goods in and out of the country, and around the world.",
      "UPS handles roughly 400,000 imported parcels each day, or roughly 2% of the packages they move on a daily basis. Still, the company could be impacted if the trade war between China and the U.S. continues.",
      "\"From a revenue perspective, last year, revenue on our China to U.S. trade lanes represented 11% of our total international revenue,\" said CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 said during Tuesday's earning call. \"Our China to U.S. trade lines are our most profitable trade lines.\"",
      "UPS is keeping customers abreast of tariff developments on its\u00a0website. It has also introduced a\u00a0tool\u00a0called UPS Global Checkout that shows online shoppers the upfront costs they will have to pay in duties, fees and taxes.",
      "Amazon is also coming under pressure over tariffs. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday accused the retailer of engaging in \"a hostile and political act\" after political news site Punchbowl reported\u00a0that Amazon plans to display tariff costs next to product prices.",
      "\"Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?\" Leavitt said during a press briefing.",
      "Amazon pushed back on the report, saying in a Tuesday statement to CBS News that its Amazon Haul store \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\" Amazon Haul was\u00a0introduced late last year\u00a0by the e-commerce giant to sell low-cost goods to compete with Temu and Shein.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:59:43 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposal from Republican lawmakers would eliminate the popular SAVE repayment plan, which helped lower costs for millions.",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",
      "The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know.",
      "How could income-based repayment plans change?",
      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",
      "SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it was paused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\"",
      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",

    "story": [
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, citing a report that Amazon plans to display tariff charges on imported goods, called the move \"a hostile and political act.\"",
      "The e-commerce giant plans to display new tariff costs next to products' prices, political news site Punchbowl\u00a0reported earlier Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. The move would provide shoppers with clarity into the cost of the new levies on imported goods.",
      "\"Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?\" Leavitt said during a press briefing Tuesday.",
      "However, Amazon pushed back on the report, saying in a Tuesday statement to CBS News that its Amazon Haul store \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\" Amazon Haul was introduced late last year by the e-commerce giant to sell low-cost goods to compete with Temu and Shein.",
      "\"This was never approved and is not going to happen,\" said Tim Doyle, an Amazon spokesperson.",
      "President Trump confirmed to reporters that he spoke with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on the phone Tuesday morning.",
      "\"Jeff Bezos was very nice,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly. And he did the right thing.\"",
      "The president has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on goods imported from China, while he lowered a range of tariffs on most other nations to a 10% baseline rate during a 90-day pause that began earlier this month. Tariffs are import duties that are paid by U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, which typically pass on the added fee to consumers in the form of higher costs.",
      "The duties are already making foreign-made goods more expensive for U.S.-based consumers.",
      "Earlier this month, data showed that\u00a0Amazon sellers had already hiked prices on nearly 1,000 of the top 100,000 selling products on the site, according to SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike was about 30%.",
      "At the time, Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement earlier this month to CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "summary": "President Trump has made a series of false or misleading statements about consumer prices, while shoppers are seeing some tariff-related cost hikes.",
    "story": [
      "In the last week, President Trump has made a number of inaccurate claims that the prices of everyday items like gas and groceries have fallen since he took office \u2014 even as Americans are starting to face surcharges for some items as a result of his tariff hikes.",
      "While Mr. Trump touts his economic record in interviews with the press, he has claimed without evidence that consumers are seeing record low prices at their gas pumps and exaggerated the decline in crude oil prices since he took office. The president has also falsely stated that he has overseen a drop in grocery prices.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's false claim that gas hit $1.98 a gallon in some places",
      "Trump said April 22: \"I see that we had a couple of states where gasoline was at $1.98 a gallon. Nobody thought they'd see that for years maybe.\"",
      "Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed that gas prices dropped to a low of $1.98 in a few states in April, hitting lows not seen since his first term. However, that is not true; on average, gas prices are around the same as when the president took office in January.",
      "Data from the Energy Information Administration shows a national average of about $3.14 per gallon of regular gas as of the third week in April \u2014 which is slightly higher than the $3.11 the week Mr. Trump was inaugurated.",
      "GasBuddy, a company that tracks prices at more than 150,000 gas stations across the country, told CBS News it had not found evidence of a gas station selling gas for $1.98 per gallon in April.",
      "Patrick De Haan, who leads petroleum analysis with the company, said the lowest price they could find in April was $2.19 at a gas station in Texas.",
      "Mr. Trump's claim that gas prices are at their lowest level since his first term is also not true; gas prices were lower than they are now for the first six months of Biden's presidency.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for more information on the president's claim.",
      "Trump's partially true claim that crude oil prices have dropped significantly since he took office",
      "Trump said on April 24: \"Energy is down and we're about $64 a barrel. When I came in\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and we were looking at $89, $90, $95.\"",
      "The president also claimed crude oil prices dropped to about $64 a barrel, from around $89 when he took office.",
      "A White House spokesman said the president was referring to the price per barrel of Brent crude oil, the global benchmark. According to data from FactSet, Mr. Trump accurately described the current price of Brent crude, which was about $64 a barrel on April 28, but he also exaggerated the price at the time he assumed office, which was about $80. The White House did not explain the discrepancy.",
      "According to a recent Energy Information Administration report, Mr. Trump's tariff hikes in early April contributed to declines in oil prices as traders weighed the potential impact on global demand. An early April announcement that OPEC members\u00a0would increase oil production ahead of schedule also added to the downward pressure on prices.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that the price of groceries came down since he took office",
      "Trump said April 24: \"Groceries are down.\" Trump said April 17: \"Food is down. Groceries, as we call it, are down.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that grocery prices have declined since he took office. However, Consumer Price Index data shows average cost of groceries in March increased by 0.49% from the previous month and by 2.4% compared to the previous year.",
      "Prices vary across products, and the White House said the president was referring to declines in the consumer prices of certain grocery store items like fresh vegetables. The USDA's Food Price Outlook shows that fresh vegetable prices decreased 1.1% in March, after falling by 1.7% in February. However, the same report also shows the prices of beef, poultry, eggs, and nonalcoholic beverages all ticked up in March.",
      "These increases occurred before the president imposed a baseline 10% tariff on goods from most countries in early April as well as tariffs as high as 145% on imports from China. Economists expect the prices of some grocery store items, including coffee and chocolate, will rise as a result, which could be reflected when data for April is released in the coming weeks.",
      "Trump's false claim that egg prices have gone down 87%",
      "Trump said on April 24: \"So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House, thousands and thousands of eggs, and the price was down 87% so we did a great job.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that egg prices are down significantly, without clarifying whether he is referring to wholesale or consumer prices. The president has a point that wholesale prices have declined since he took office, but he overstates the size of the decline. And recent data suggests consumer prices remain elevated.",
      "Wholesale egg prices \u2014 what large buyers such as Costco or Walmart pay producers \u2014 have dropped sharply since mid-March as egg losses due to bird flu decreased last month. U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows wholesale egg prices were roughly 52% lower on April 25 than they were at the start of Mr. Trump's second term. The White House did not explain the discrepancy in the president's figures.",
      "Meanwhile, retail prices for consumers remain at record highs. Bureau of Labor Statistics data released on April 10 shows average retail egg prices hit $6.23 per dozen in March, surpassing the previous record $5.90 set in February.",
      "A March 28 report from the Department of Agriculture said it can take \"up to three weeks\" for consumers to benefit from the wholesale price decline. If retail prices show consistent decline, this should be reflected in the national average from BLS for April, said Jeremy Horpedahl, an associate professor of economics at the University of Central Arkansas. That data should become available on May 13.",

But 100 days into his second term in the White House, the president is struggling to deliver on those promises.",
      "Mr. Trump's signature policies on trade, immigration and government spending have not only failed to spark economic growth \u2014 they're contributing to a sharp contraction in activity and threaten to re-ignite inflation, data shows. Economists also\u00a0warn that the chances of a U.S. recession\u00a0are rising.",
      "For millions of employers around the country, the Trump administration's helter-skelter approach to imposing tariffs on key trading partners, along with just about every other country on the planet,\u00a0has been challenging, corporate executives and small business owners have told CBS News.",
      "\"I can't think of a precedent for anything like this,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch of the impact of Mr. Trump's first 100 days on the economy.",
      "\"President Reagan, for instance, implemented a lot of changes in terms of tax policy and defense spending and cuts, and those things had big impacts,\" she added, \"but the element here that's quite different is the approach, which has been quite inconsistent and chaotic.\"",

      "\"Tariffs have been an unmitigated disaster, economically,\" former Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican and erstwhile economics professor at Texas A&M University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There's no doubt about it that the tariff policy in and of itself will drive up prices because tariffs are a tax. And remember, 61% of imports are component parts to be used in the production of goods and services in America.\"",
      "Gramm added, \"I want to emphasize that the harm of tariffs isn't just inflation \u2014 it's what they do for efficiency and economic growth.\"",

For the year, economic growth is predicted to slow to 1.9%, versus 2.8% in 2024, FactSet data shows.",
      "Economists warn that the U.S. could slip into a recession due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists largely gave the U.S. economy a good rating, pointing to its strong growth, low unemployment and progress in bringing inflation under control.",
      "Businesses large and small say the tariffs will cause disruptions, with almost 900 companies in the last 30 days alone citing the barrage of new U.S. levies in their earnings calls. That compares with 100 mentions in December 2024, according to transcripts posted by FactSet. Earlier this month, the CEOs of Walmart and Target\u00a0privately warned Mr. Trump that the tariffs could disrupt supply chains and lead to empty shelves within weeks.",
      "\"Most businesses plan to pass these costs on to their consumers, which will make things more expensive, and we're going to see cuts in consumer spending as a result,\" Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics said, adding that her firm isn't forecasting a recession although it has pared its GDP outlook. \"That's less revenue for businesses.\"",
      "Inflation fears flare",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" vowing that if he would bring down prices \"very quickly\" in a second term.",
      "But 100 days into his new administration, consumers are skeptical about Mr. Trump's vow to tackle inflation, with 63% telling CBS News in new polling that they believed his policies would cause grocery prices to go up. Only 15% said they believe his administration will help lower their grocery bills.",
      "Consumers are clearly worried about tariffs, with the same CBS News poll finding that 55% of respondents said Mr. Trump doesn't have a clear plan for tariffs and trade. Americans now expect inflation to rise to 6.5% a year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index \u2014 a potentially self-fulling outlook that could cause consumers to pull back on spending.",
      "So far, however, inflation data shows that price increases eased to 2.4% in March, down from 2.8% in February. Falling gas prices have come as a relief for motorists, with the national average for a gallon of regular gas now at $3.17, compared with $3.66 a year ago, according to AAA.",
      "Still, many economists forecasts that inflation will pick up later this year as the impact of tariffs works its way through the economy.",
      "The case for tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that his tariff policies will benefit the U.S. economy over the long term. In his view, the cost of the tariffs will spur both U.S. and foreign businesses to expand in the U.S., spawning jobs for American workers and reinvigorating the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, some businesses have said they are investing in domestic manufacturing, with Apple planning a $500 billion expansion of its U.S. facilities over four years and IBM on Monday announcing a $150 billion investment to \"fuel the economy.\"",
      "The president also maintains that tariffs will bring in trillions in new federal revenue , helping to offset an extension of his 2017 tax cuts currently being hammered out by Republican lawmakers. But many economists are skeptical that his tariffs could bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods\u00a0when their prices rise.",
      "\"Consumers have to be confident to affect their spending,\" noted Donald Boudreaux, an economist at George Mason University (whose book with Sen. Gramm, \"The Triumph of Economic Freedom: Debunking the Seven Great Myths of American Capitalism,\" will be published next month). \"The current policy is reducing their confidence.\"",
      "For his part, Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the impact of U.S. tariffs will cause \"some pain\" for Americans, while adding in a February social media post that \"IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\"",
      "Market turmoil",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the Trump administration's economic policies has been clear: The S&P 500 index has lost 10% of its value since reaching a post-inauguration high on February 19, putting the broad-based market into correction territory.",
      "The dollar has lost about 9% of its value since Mr. Trump's inauguration, according to the U.S. dollar index, which compares the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies. Typically, investors rush to the bond market in times of economic uncertainty, but in recent weeks\u00a0bond prices have slid and yields have risen \u2014\u00a0 signs investors are rattled by the impact of Trump administration policies.",
      "\"I would emphasize that this movement in the asset markets is indeed unusual, and it happened particularly after April 2, 'Liberation Day',\" or the day when Mr. Trump announced tariffs on almost every nation on Earth, Boudreaux said. \"It can only be explained by global investor fears of what might happen in the U.S. economy.\"",
      "He added, \"It's too soon to tell how far those fears will go, but the early signs aren't cheery.\"",
      "A boost from tax cuts and deregulation?",
      "To be sure, mounting anxieties among consumers, businesses and investors don't by themselves herald an inevitable economic downturn. And so far, the economy remains resilient, with unemployment near a 50-year low and inflation edging down to 2.4% in March.",
      "Some economists also point to what they view as positives in Mr. Trump's agenda, such as prospects for tax cuts and deregulation, which could spur economic growth. And Mr. Trump has touted his administration's efforts to slash federal spending, overseen by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, as a win for taxpayers.",
      "\"We found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse,\" Mr. Trump told Time Magazine in an interview this month.",
      "DOGE, by its account, has cut about $160 billion in costs, or about 2.4% of the federal government's roughly $6.8 trillion in annual spending. But some critics have pointed out that the cuts will ultimately cost taxpayers\u00a0due to rehiring federal workers who were mistakenly fired, lower productivity of remaining workers and through lower tax collections from the IRS, which is reducing its staffing under DOGE's direction.",
      "In the meantime, some observers say the biggest hurdle to Mr. Trump's economic goals is of his own creation.",
      "\"We want Trump to succeed \u2014 in criticizing this trading policy, it's the policy we're criticizing,\" Sen. Gramm said. \"I don't believe the president can achieve what he wants to achieve for America unless his trade policy changes.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-college-worth-the-money-heres-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 17:26:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Although attending college still offers a payoff, a recent study by New York Fed economists suggests it might not make financial sense for some people.",
    "story": [
      "Getting a college education has traditionally been seen as a way to move up the economic ladder. But an analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the cost of a degree may not always be worth it.",
      "The value of a college education has increasingly come into question in recent years, especially as tuition costs steadily climb and millions of Americans grapple with student loans. As a result, only one in four U.S. adults say it's extremely or very important to have a four-year college degree to get a well-paying job, according to a 2024\u00a0Pew Research poll.",
      "To be sure, the case for attending college remains strong. Another study by the New York Fed\u00a0found\u00a0that in recent years the typical college graduate with a bachelor's degree had an annual income of roughly $80,000, versus $47,000 for people with only a high school diploma \u2014 a 68% premium.",
      "Yet a recent study by the Fed bank suggests a college degree hasn't paid off for at least 25% of college graduates in recent decades.",
      "Of course, not everyone goes to college chiefly to earn a high income \u2014 education can be its own reward, after all. But how you\u00a0 navigate your college career \u2014 or whether you choose to attend at all \u2014 is among the most important financial decisions a person will make.",
      "Here's when a diploma may not deliver much of a bang for the buck.",
      "When might a college degree not be worth it?",
      "Not surprisingly, the more a student must spend on out-of-pocket expenses, the lower their typical return on investment. The average college student pays about $30,000 out of pocket for four years of college, according to the New York Fed study. However, students could face significantly higher costs if they choose to live on campus, or if they miss out on financial aid and are forced to pay a school's full price.",
      "The typical college graduate sees a return on investment (ROI) of roughly 12.5% according to the New York Fed. That rate has remained mostly unchanged over the past three decades, and still exceeds the returns on most other investments, including the stock market, which over time offers long-term return of about 8%.",
      "Despite that payoff, certain factors can lower a college grad's ROI. For example, the researchers found that living on campus increased the price tag for college by nearly $30,000 \u2014 from $180,000 to $207,000 \u2014 reducing the return on investment to about 11%. The 1.5% drop in ROI may seem nominal, but it can translate to hundreds of thousands in lost dollars.",
      "\"This extra cost and the associated return are comparable to attending a more expensive school that is roughly twice the average price,\" the researchers, economists\u00a0Jaison Abel and\u00a0Richard Deitz, said in the study.",
      "Among college graduates, 25% actually see little return on investment. This group was making less than $10,000 more in income than the median high school graduate in 2024. Their rate of return was only 2.6% compared to the average of 12.5% \u2014 meaning they see much less of a payoff.",
      "Another factor that can reduce the value of a college degree is how long it takes to obtain. The typical bachelor's program runs for four years, but in some cases students might extend the timeline if they haven't completed their course load. That can have major financial implications.",
      "Taking an extra one to two years to get your degree adds \"considerably to the cost,\" the New York Fed\u00a0found. There's the direct cost students have to pay for the additional tuition, but also higher \"opportunity costs\" \u2014 for example, a student who starts their career later misses out on years of working experience and can end up earning less over their lifetime.",
      "\"All in all, we estimate that taking five years to complete college pushes the median rate of return down to about 9% and taking six years pushes it down to 7%,\" the researchers found.",
      "Graduating in five years, rather than four, pushes up the total cost of college from $180,000 to $272,000, while taking six years would cost $364,000.",
      "How much does a student's major matter?",
      "Another important consideration in deciding if going to college is a sound investment is a student's major. After all, certain fields tend to lead to higher incomes.",
      "So-called STEM majors tend to earn the most, both in the early and mid-stages of their career, according to New York Fed\u00a0data. For instance, a computer engineering major stands to make a median wage of $122,000 mid-career, versus $55,000 for an education major, according to the bank's data.",
      "Among the fields of study with the highest returns are engineering, business and health sciences. The return is lowest for those majoring in fine arts, liberal arts, leisure, and hospitality and education, which ranked last.",
      "\"While some of it may come down to choices people make for the jobs they wish to have, one significant consideration is college major, something over which students have direct control,\" Abel and Dietz wrote.",

    "summary": "The push by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to slash federal funding will cost taxpayers money, nonpartisan group finds. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, says it has saved $160 billion through its push to root out wasteful or fraudulent government spending. But that effort may also have come at a cost for taxpayers, with a new estimate from a nonpartisan research and advocacy group estimating that DOGE's actions will cost $135 billion this fiscal year.",
      "The analysis seeks to tally the costs associated with putting tens of thousands of federal employees on paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity, according to the Partnership for Public Service (PSP), a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on the federal workforce.",
      "PSP's estimate is based on the $270 billion in annual compensation costs for the federal workforce, calculating the impact of DOGE's actions, from paid leave to productivity hits. The $135 billion cost to taxpayers doesn't include the expense of defending multiple lawsuits challenging DOGE's actions, nor the impact of estimated lost tax collections due to staff cuts at the IRS.",
      "DOGE has sought to slash federal spending by urging government workers to accept a deferred resignation plan, which allowed many employees to retain full pay and benefits through September without working. Another 24,000 government employees who were fired as part of the reform effort have since been\u00a0rehired after a court ruling.",
      "Other agencies also have rehired some workers after mistakenly firing them, such as bird flu experts\u00a0who were dismissed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal workers have also had to take on tasks such as documenting their weekly accomplishments, which has lowered productivity, Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We haven't seen much focus on the waste [DOGE] is creating,\" Stier told CBS MoneyWatch about his group's decision to analyze the costs of DOGE's cuts. \"This is an effort that was created to address waste, but we were seeing the opposite.\"",
      "\"Ultimately it's the public that will end up paying for this,\" he added, noting that he expects the taxpayers costs to grow after other DOGE cuts take effect.",
      "The White House took issue with the analysis.",
      "\"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said. \"The American public are in lockstep with the president's mission and will not be swayed by more lies coming from the legacy media.\"",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE's efforts aren't winning over most voters, with a new\u00a0Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll finding that 57% of Americans disapprove of the way Musk is handling his job in the Trump administration. About 6 in 10 said they're worried President Trump will do too much to cut the size and role of the federal government, the poll found.",
      "Why job cuts could raise costs",
      "The IRS, which is planning on cutting roughly\u00a040% of its workforce, could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "To be sure, the DOGE cuts could pay off over time, with a leaner, more focused federal workforce. For example, the direct savings from those layoffs will amount to $38 billion over 10 years, the Partnership for Public Service estimated.",
      "But Stier maintains that the costs for taxpayers could grow as they ripple through the economy, such as reductions in funding of health and science research. One analysis by researchers at institutions including the University of Maryland and University of Pennsylvania estimates that cuts to health research will result in a $16 billion annual economic loss, with 68,000 jobs lost.",
      "\"One can always imagine a miracle occurring, but none of this makes sense on so many different levels,\" Stier said.",
      "DOGE's \"wall of receipts\"",
      "DOGE keeps a running public tally of the federal money the task force says it has saved, posted on its\u00a0website in what is called a \"wall of receipts.\" But some of those savings have been overstated, a February CBS News investigation found.",
      "At the same time, DOGE's $160 billion in savings is far less than Musk's previously stated goal of shrinking annual government spending by $2 trillion, or almost one-third of the federal budget. Many experts say that far more ambitious objective is unlikely to be achieved without cutting major federal programs like Social Security and Medicare, which Mr. Trump has vowed not to touch.",
      "Musk said Tuesday that he'll curtail his work at DOGE starting in May. His decision comes as Tesla, the electric vehicle maker he runs, saw a 71% plunge in first-quarter profit and a 20% decline in vehicle sales as some consumers snubbed the brand due to objections to Musk's government work.",
      "Musk said he still plans to spend one to two days a week on DOGE-related work, focusing on eliminating government waste.",
      "\"I'll have to continue to keep doing it for the remainder of the president's term to make sure the waste and fraud doesn't come roaring back,\" he said during Tesla's first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday.",

      "\"Technology doesn't just build the future \u2014 it defines it,\" said Arvind Krishna, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer in a statement Monday. \"We have been focused on American jobs and manufacturing since our founding 114 years ago, and with this investment and manufacturing commitment we are ensuring that IBM remains the epicenter of the world's most advanced computing and AI capabilities.\"",

      "The investment comes as President Trump implements a sweeping tariff regime aimed at encouraging companies to expand their manufacturing\u00a0footprint in the U.S. Although not all the companies pledging to expand in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such corporate commitments as wins.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-trump-100-days-tariffs/",
    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 09:21:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump's ratings on economy are lower, but his deportation plan keeps majority support.",
    "story": [
      "Is 100 days enough time to evaluate this president? His supporters generally don't think so, but others do \u2014 perhaps because most Americans think President Trump is already making major changes to how the government \u2014 and the U.S. economy \u2014 work.",
      "Those opening days, in public opinion terms, have been marked by Mr. Trump's continued support from a loyal base of supporters, but also a widespread and growing belief among others that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. That's weighing on his approval ratings on the economy and inflation, which have gone down.",
      "Alongside that, he continues to get majority approval for his deportation program, though more Americans prioritize the economy in their evaluations of him.",
      "MAGA Republicans, in contrast, say their evaluations are based more on immigration and overwhelmingly approve of his efforts there. Plus they have a much rosier outlook on the U.S. economy than Americans overall now that Trump is in office, and most of them say it is too soon to judge him.",
      "Others who voted for him, but who don't identify as MAGA, have become a little less approving of his handling of the economy and inflation in recent months. And since the start of his term, his approval rating has slid among some groups he made gains with in the 2024 election, including independents, young people, and Hispanic people.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump sees disapproval on the economy from those who think he's put too much focus on tariffs.",
      "And meanwhile, Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove of what they see from him, want their party to oppose him more and say they're \"frustrated\" with the Democratic Party's response so far. Mr. Trump's approval rating among people who sat out the '24 election started out higher, too.",
      "Those perceived changes elicit different judgments, though. Republicans say they are for the better, and Democrats, the worse. Asked how Trump's presidency so far has made them feel, most Republicans say they're satisfied, while Democrats and independents say they're frustrated and nervous.",
      "Measuring a president at 100 days is something of a contrivance that is based on a marker set during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first term back in the 1930s. Then again, many presidents come in promising a lot of action quickly. Most Americans do think they can judge this administration in that time frame. Mr. Trump's 2024 voters, and most of his current approvers, are less likely to think it's enough time, whereas his disapprovers think it's enough.",
      "Tariffs, promises and prices",
      "Mr. Trump's voters widely believe he's doing what he promised in the campaign. Most of the public agrees \u2014 whether or not they like what he's doing \u2014 though the percentage is down from the early weeks of his term.",
      "People who think Mr. Trump is putting too much focus on tariffs are more likely to say he's doing different things from what he promised.",
      "Here's how differences on economics play out:",
      "MAGA Republicans stand apart in their outlook for the U.S. economy. While most Americans say it is getting worse, MAGA Republicans say it is getting better. They also rate the current economy much better than others do. So, while evaluations of the economy remain mostly bad, Republicans' views have pushed the overall ratings up a bit, with an even larger partisan gap now.",
      "Overall, more Americans continue to say Trump's policies are making them financially worse off than better off. Expectations at the start of his term were different \u2014 more expected his policies to improve their finances.",
      "Two-thirds of those who think they're being made worse off say he isn't doing what he promised.",
      "And that has led to declining approval of his handling of the economy and inflation, specifically. Both ratings are now their lowest levels of the term so far. His rating on inflation is driven very much by the impact of his policies people see on prices.",
      "Support for tariffs has been declining, as a rising number of Americans feel the administration is focusing too much on the issue. And over recent weeks, fewer now believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan for tariffs and trade.",
      "When asked to pick what issue is most important to them in judging the Trump administration, the economy and immigration top the list. Those judging Mr. Trump on immigration heavily approve of his overall job performance, while those judging him on the economy disapprove in large numbers.",
      "Mr. Trump's overall approval rating is down from the high at the start of this term.",
      "Immigration and deportation",
      "Most Americans think Mr. Trump's policies have reduced border crossings. Most also continue to approve of his deportation program in general.",
      "Meanwhile, three-quarters say it isn't acceptable if some legal residents are detained by mistake as part of that program. A large 8 in 10 say it wouldn't be acceptable if some legal residents are deported to foreign countries.",
      "And most who don't think these things would be acceptable disapprove of his overall handling of immigration.",
      "(On this, MAGA Republicans do stand differently from others, coming in about twice as likely as Americans overall to say legal residents being detained would be acceptable.)",
      "It may be that the perceived implementation of the deportation plan is affecting larger views of how Mr. Trump is handling immigration, even as a majority approve of the deportation program in general. On balance, his handling of immigration, generally, is lower than it was earlier in term. Independents, especially those with college degrees, have become less approving over time.",
      "Most Americans also think Mr. Trump is trying to expand the powers of the presidency \u2014 a view driven heavily by Democrats and those who disapprove of his job performance. And those who think he is are more likely to feel democracy and rule of law in the U.S. is threatened.",
      "Most Americans do support limits to Mr. Trump's powers as president, though. A majority think he should get his policies enacted by working with Congress to pass legislation rather than through executive orders, and majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents alike feel Mr. Trump should follow a Supreme Court ruling if it goes against his administration. Republicans also say their party in Congress should push back on Mr. Trump if they disagree with him.",
      "And on the other side of the aisle, many Democrats describe their feelings about how their party is handling the Trump administration as making them feel frustrated and nervous.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,356\u00a0 U.S. adults interviewed between April 23-25, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-deportation-flights-avelo-airlines/",
    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 15:19:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Avelo Airlines says it's counting on a new federal contract for deportation flights to help the discount carrier grow its regular passenger service.",
    "story": [
      "Avelo Airlines is targeting a new passenger segment: migrants being sent to detention centers across the U.S. The budget carrier will also use its planes to fly migrants out of the country under the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.",
      "Avelo has signed a contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to handle deportation flights for U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE), the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Avelo, which launched in 2021, said the move is necessary for the Houston-based airline to remain financially stable.",
      "\"We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy said in a statement to CBS News earlier this month after the company struck a deal with ICE. \"After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.\"",
      "The domestic and international flights ferrying migrants will begin May 14 out of a new hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where Avelo will station three Boeing 737-800 planes to handle the transports. Unlike the company's regular commercial flights, the aircraft used for the trips will not bear Avelo's logo, the company said.",
      "Avelo described the agreement with ICE as a \"long-term charter program.\" The exact terms of the deal were not made public.",
      "The airline is now recruiting flight attendants to staff the flights, according to a\u00a0job posting\u00a0for what it calls a \"charter program for the Department of Homeland Security.\" The job pays $28 an hour for the first year of service.",
      "\"We are seeking energetic, highly motivated Flight Attendants who wish to join a committed group of safety and service professionals at Avelo Airlines,\" the listing reads.",
      "\"Flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS's deportation efforts,\" the post adds, although it makes no references to migrants.",
      "Avelo offers flights across the U.S. and to international destinations including the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico. It operates out of eight hubs across the U.S., flying out of the following airports: Concord-Padgett Regional Airport in North Carolina; Hollywood Burbank Airport in California; Lakeland International Airport in Florida; Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina; Sonoma County Airport in California; Tweed-New Haven airport in Connecticut; Wilmington Airport in New Hampshire; and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina.",
      "The company previously operated charter flights as Casino Express Airlines before rebranding as Avelo in 2021, according to S&P Capital IQ.",
      "Avelo declined to comment further on its contract with the government. DHS confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch that Avelo is contracting with ICE to assist with deportation flights.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has long contracted with CSI Aviation, an aviation broker that provides private air charter services, medical flights for patients in emergencies and government flight services. Under its new contract with ICE, Avelo will operate as a sub-carrier of CSI.",
      "DHS also subcontracts with other air charter companies, which provide planes and operate the flights. One such charter outfit is GlobalX. It handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to immigrant advocate Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "GlobalX did not reply to a request for comment on its work with DHS.",
      "Cartwright, who tracks ICE flights through publicly available sources, expressed surprise at Avelo agreeing to shuttle migrants destined for detention centers or deportation.",
      "\"I have never seen a retail airline that sells to consumers being used in this way,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Typically, charter companies that don't fly retail-type flights. They are not selling tickets directly to consumers.\"",
      "According to data on USAspending.gov, a U.S. government website that tracks federal spending, DHS' roughly 6-month contract this year with CSI Aviation is worth at least $78.1 million. Its value could rise to as much as $162.2 million.",
      "The purpose of the agreement, the site states, \"is to provide daily scheduled large aircraft & special high risk charter flights to facilitate ICE's enforcement and removal of operations of illegal aliens.\"",
      "CSI Aviation did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on its contract with the federal government.",
      "Cruising for revenue",
      "Airline industry experts said charter outfits like CSI typically aren't familiar to the general public.",
      "\"Nobody has usually ever heard of the airlines,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals site, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are charter airlines that don't have a set schedule on a website,\" he said.",
      "However, an upstart airline hunting for additional revenue streams outside of selling tickets to members of the flying public is not unusual.",
      "\"It's very difficult to compete with the Deltas and Uniteds of the world, so they try any number of tactics,\" Keyes explained. \"They fly to and from smaller cities, they offer bargain-basement prices. There are all different types of counter-positioning things they do.\"",
      "But Avelo's move is more surprising because most commercial airlines don't have enough spare aircraft and crew for specialized operations like migrant flights, noted Seth Miller, founder and editor in chief of PaxEx Aero, an aviation consulting service. Miller said he opposes Avelo working with U.S. immigration authorities on ethical grounds.",
      "Avelo's contract with DHS is also drawing criticism from an immigrant advocacy group. A petition started by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition urging people to boycott Avelo until it severs ties with ICE has collected more than 34,650 signatures.",
      "\"We reject the Trump Administration's inhumane deportation practices, reject cooperation from the State of Connecticut in support of Avelo as long as they are complicit in these practices and pledge to boycott Avelo as long as they are profiting from ICE flights,\" the petition states.",
      "Although federal contracts can provide steady business for airlines and charter carriers, Avelo's partnership with DHS poses a reputational risk, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I still think it's morally questionable to run these charters for the federal government and think it poses a very real reputational risk for Avelo,\" Miller said, citing protests against the airline at some of Avelo's hubs.",
      "Will Humphries, a traveler at Sonoma County Airport, in Santa Rosa, California, where Avelo operates, is among those members of the flying public who plan to boycott Avelo because of its work with ICE.",
      "\"There's not much I can do as an individual, so the limited choices I can make, like switching an airline, is definitely within my ability,\" he told CBS News Bay Area.",

      "Harris gave the keynote address at the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America, an organization that assists Democratic women in running for office.",
      "In her speech, which comes on the heels of\u00a0Mr. Trump's 100th day in office, Harris took aim at her former opponent, saying that \"instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals.\"",
      "Harris said that the Trump administration and his allies are \"counting on the notion that fear can be contagious. They are counting on the notion that if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others.\"",
      "Harris called Mr. Trump's trade war the \"greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history,\" describing the president's tariffs as \"reckless.\"",
      "Harris said the tariffs instituted by the Trump administration have \"hurt workers and families by raising the cost of everyday essentials\" and are paralyzing \"American businesses, large and small, forcing them to lay off people, to stop hiring or pause investment decisions.\"",
      "She later added that \"the tariffs, as I predicted, are clearly inviting a recession.\"",
      "\"But please, let us not be duped into thinking everything is chaos. It may feel like that,\" Harris said. \"But understand: What we are, in fact, witnessing is a high velocity event, where a vessel is being used for the swift implementation of an agenda that has been decades in the making.\"",
      "Harris also touched on Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown, saying \"it is not OK to detain or disappear American citizens without due process.\"",
      "The Trump administration has faced ongoing controversy over the removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who the Justice Department has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security last week also sent a 2-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras with her mother, who is undocumented.",
      "The former vice president praised \"the courage of judges to uphold the rule of law in the face of those who would jail them,\" a reference to the federal arrest of a Wisconsin judge last week accused of obstructing immigration agents.",
      "Harris ended her speech by acknowledging that \"things are going to get worse before they get better,\" but called on Americans to \"stand together\" and \"gear up for the hard work ahead.\"",
      "\"Always remember: This country is ours. It doesn't belong to whoever is in the White House. It belongs to you. It belongs to us. It belongs to we the people.\"",
      "The former vice president focused her speech on criticizing the Trump administration, stopping short of announcing a run for California governor or any other office.",

    "summary": "A ruling by the Supreme Court in favor of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would lead to the country's first religious charter school.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court\u00a0on Wednesday appeared divided over efforts in Oklahoma to create an online Catholic charter school, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools.",
      "A ruling in favor of the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, could lead to the country's first religious charter school and upend laws in at least 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has warned.",
      "Eight of the nine justices are considering the case, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself. Following arguments, it seemed likely that the outcome hinges on Chief Justice John Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in its charter school program during the arguments. If the Supreme Court deadlocks 4-4, it would leave intact the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which ruled that the contract establishing St. Isidore's as a Catholic charter school was a violation of state and federal law.",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh appeared most sympathetic to St. Isidore's argument that excluding it from Oklahoma's charter school system unconstitutionally discriminated against the school.",
      "Kavanuagh said religious institutions can't be treated as \"second class\" and said keeping sectarian schools from operating charter schools, when the program is open to nonreligious private entities, seems like \"rank discrimination\" based on religion.",
      "\"They're not asking for special treatment. They're not asking for favoritism. They're just saying don't treat us worse because we're religious,\" he said of the school.",
      "But the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, seemed concerned that a decision allowing the religious charter school would weaken the wall between church and state.",
      "\"The state is running these schools,\" Kagan said. Jackson said charter schools are \"a creation and creature of the state.\"",
      "But there was some concern about how a ruling allowing St. Isidore's to be established as a religious charter school would impact the systems in other states, and specifically the level of oversight and control over them. Justice Neil Gorsuch warned such a result could lead states to impose more requirements on charter schools, such as mandating public officials to serve on their boards and boosting state involvement in their creation.",
      "\"Have you thought about that boomerang effect?\" he asked James Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which joined St. Isidore's in the case.",
      "A decision will follow the Supreme Court's three\u00a0rulings in recent years that were in favor of religious plaintiffs, which all allowed public funds to be used for religious institutions.",
      "\"This would really be the first time that the Supreme Court sanctions, if it rules in favor of the charter school, the direct flow of funds from the government and financial support from the government to a religious entity for religious activities,\" said Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who focuses on the law and religion.",
      "St. Isidore, she said, is asking the state to \"quite literally establish a religious school. It's essentially making a religious school, creating an affiliation between the religious entity and the state that we haven't seen before.\"",
      "But backers of St. Isidore argue that its position is simply an application of those decisions and would not create any new principles.",
      "\"The unifying thread is the idea that once the government decides to open up a program and to distribute benefits or to contract with people, it can't single out religious people or institutions for special disadvantage,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who directs its Program on Church, State and Society.",
      "The formation of a Catholic charter school",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like at least 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation, according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond warned against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an earlier analysis from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Drummond also warned that approving St. Isidore's application to become a charter school \"will create a slippery slope.\"",
      "\"I doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a religious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own faith,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approval of a charter school by one faith will compel the approval of charter schools by all faiths, including even those most Oklahomans would consider reprehensible and unworthy of public funding.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "\"The state will be directly funding a religious school and encouraging students to attend it,\" the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which split 6-2, found.",
      "The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore's both asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so in January.",
      "A \"major breach\" in the wall",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in a string of recent decisions sided with religious families and institutions that challenged state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "In 2017, the court said that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said Maine cannot limit a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "Citing those decisions, Roberts said the programs at issue in Missouri, Montana and Maine were also creations and creatures of the state. But he also said they involved \"fairly discrete\" state involvement, as opposed to the \"much more comprehensive involvement\" of Oklahoma in funding and overseeing its charter schools.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Drummond argued that the justices have drawn a clear line through those decisions: If the state offers tuition assistance that parents can direct to the school of their choosing, it cannot exclude religious private schools. But when it comes to public schools, he said, states can provide a secular education.",
      "Drummond said the Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution's Establishment Clause allows \"direct aid for religious instruction in public schools,\" and added that creating and funding a religious public school would violate that provision of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Religious education is an invaluable benefit for millions of Americans who choose it,\" Drummond wrote. \"But our Constitution has never required the creation of religious public schools. There is no basis to change that now.\"",
      "He warned that if the Supreme Court rules for St. Isidore, \"state funds will pour into religious public charter schools just as they do traditional public schools,\" and the firewall between public funds flowing to a school because of private choice versus a direct subsidy would be damaged.",
      "\"A ruling for petitioners would eliminate the buffer this court has long enforced between religious instruction and public schools \u2014 including in areas where charter schools are the only or default public-school option,\" Drummond argued, noting that the issue is direct aid.",
      "A crucial question in the court fight is whether Oklahoma's charter schools are public schools.",
      "Drummond says they are, because the state's charter schools have to comply with anti-discrimination laws; they are free, open to all students, created and funded by the state, and are subject to government regulation and oversight regarding curriculum, testing and other issues. And because charter schools are public schools, the attorney general said they are government entities.",
      "Gregory Garre, who argued on behalf of Drummond, said that St. Isidore's is seeking special status compared to secular charter schools, because it said it can only comply with laws that are consistent with its constitutional rights as a religious school under the direction of the Catholic Church.",
      "He warned that a decision in favor of the school would render the laws in nearly all states and the federal charter school program unconstitutional because they all require charter schools to be nonsectarian.",
      "Such an outcome would \"create uncertainty, confusion and disruption\" for the millions of charter school students across the country.",
      "He warned that allowing religious institutions to participate in state charter school systems would open the door to more litigation over issues like who can be admitted, who can teach at the schools and over their curriculum.",
      "But lawyers for the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore disagree. Backing them in the case are Oklahoma's GOP governor, Kevin Stitt, and the state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters.",
      "The board and school said St. Isidore is a privately operated school providing free publicly funded education through a contract with the state, and the Free Exercise Clause protects its right to participate in the charter school program.",
      "\"The state did not design the school. It did not create or encourage St. Isidore's religious character. It did not appoint any member of St. Isidore's board. It did not instruct the school to offer an education in the Catholic tradition. And it will not hire or supervise the school's teachers and administrators,\" lawyers for St. Isidore wrote in a filing.",
      "Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, told the justices that St. Isidore's was created not by the state, but by two Catholic organizations, and it's controlled by a privately selected board of directors.",
      "The restrictions in state law, lawyers for St. Isidore's and the charter school board said, amount to unconstitutional religious discrimination because Oklahoma is excluding religious observers from otherwise available public benefits and programs. And because the state's charter school program is neutrally administered, the Establishment Clause doesn't prevent public dollars from flowing to religious schools.",
      "\"This is particularly true when private choice directs government dollars to religious schools,\" they said.",
      "Garnett, of Notre Dame Law School, said that public money would only go to St. Isidore if a parent made the choice to send their child to the virtual school.",
      "\"If the court thinks that what Oklahoma has done is create a program that private entities are eligible to participate in, then it's straightforward to say once they do that, they can't discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said.",
      "But professor Hill, like Drummond, said charter schools are public schools, and warned there's always been a line where the Supreme Court did not allow the direct flow of government funds to religious schools for religious instruction. She said the case is part of a progression that began with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling and comes as traditional public schools are being starved of resources in many states.",
      "\"The agenda has been to require, not just allow, direct government funding of religious schools in particular,\" she said. \"Vouchers are one thing, but I do think it's a major breach in the wall of separation if the charter school wins.\"",
      "Barrett's recusal from the case could create a situation in which the Supreme Court renders a 4-4 decision, leaving the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling intact. She did not provide a reason for her stepping aside, though it may be because the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Clinic is representing St. Isidore.",
      "Barrett taught at Notre Dame before she was appointed to the federal bench and was an adjunct professor at the law school in 2023, according to her most recent financial disclosure report. Barrett is also close friends with Nicole Stelle Garnett, an associate dean at Notre Dame Law School who authored a paper that suggested that as a result of a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause.",

    "summary": "An effort aimed at blocking President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in the Senate fell short Wednesday, with Senate Republicans largely united in opposition.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An effort aimed at blocking President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in the Senate amid anxiety over how the wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy fell short on Wednesday, with Senate Republicans largely united in their opposition.",
      "In a 49 to 49 vote, all but three Republicans opposed the measure, in a victory for the White House and GOP leadership in the Senate as the party seeks to remain united on the issue. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, did not vote.",
      "\"Senator Whitehouse is on his way back from representing the United States at the Our Ocean summit, where he was the sole American official,\" a spokesperson for the Senator said in a statement explaining his absence. \"The Senator expressed America's continued support for the Blue Economy, climate solutions, fisheries, and maritime security, even as the Trump administration cedes leadership on the oceans to the rest of the world.\"",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, would terminate the April 2 national emergency that the president is using to impose the tariffs, effectively blocking the sweeping levies on foreign imports. Along with Paul, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Democrats and independents in support of the measure, falling short of the majority needed for passage.",
      "The measure almost certainly wouldn't have been taken up in the GOP-controlled House, making the vote largely a symbolic one.",
      "The vote came after the president on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of other countries. Days later, as investors appeared spooked, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, keeping the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China.",
      "Wyden told CBS News ahead of the vote of the measure's chances that \"this is a choice for senators.\"",
      "\"They've been home and they've heard from their constituents, like small businesses, that are getting clobbered by these tariffs,\" Wyden said. \"If they're going to listen to their constituents, we'll get their support, and if they're more concerned about Donald Trump being mean to them, they'll go with opposition.\"",
      "Paul admonished his fellow Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Wednesday, saying \"this should not be a partisan issue\" and noting that \"Congress didn't debate these tariffs, Congress didn't vote to enact these tariffs \u2014 the tariffs are simply imposed by presidential fiat",
      "\"If Americans are to live under this emergency rule, it will not be because the president sought too much power,\" Paul said. \"It will be because Congress let it happen.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Senate approved another resolution to block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, which fall under an earlier national emergency. At the time, four Republicans joined all Democrats and independents to support the measure \u2014 Murkowski, Collins and McConnell, along with Paul. The House did not vote on the measure.",
      "Mr. Trump had put pressure on Senate Republicans to oppose the measure, calling out the senators expected to support it by name. But those senators held fast in their opposition.",
      "Ahead of the vote this time around, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Vice President JD Vance joined the conference during their launch meeting on Tuesday, where senators said Greer told them the administration is making progress on trade deals.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Earlier this month, Republicans included in a key piece of legislation a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block the tariffs announced on April 2, after also doing so with the earlier tariffs. And any measure to roll back the tariffs would need the president's signature, leaving opponents in Congress with little likelihood of reining in his levies.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that it isn't appropriate for Congress to \"jump in\" a handful of weeks into the administration's tariff policy, saying at an Axios event that \"the executive has a broad array of authority that's been recognized over the years\" on trade. But he suggested limited openness to stepping in down the road.",
      "\"If it gets close to where the imbalance is there, then we would step in,\" Johnson said, while adding that the first step would be for him to call the president to discuss the concerns. \"But right now I think ultimately this policy is going to achieve the desired outcome and it's going to be good for the country, and so we're applauding that.\"",
      "Still, anxieties continued to run high over the economic impact of the tariffs. And economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2025, the Commerce Department reported in its estimate of the nation's gross domestic product Wednesday.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday following the GDP report that \"the tariff issue is one that's probably going to take some time to realize the results and the benefits from.\"",
      "\"Overall, the things we're going to be doing to support a healthy economy, on taxes and regulations and energy, are going to have a positive impact long term,\" Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said. \"The tariff issue is something that's, like I said, it's an open question, but we're giving them some space to negotiate and see if they can get some good deals.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian and U.S. officials have signed a joint economic investment deal that includes granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare earths minerals, the Treasury Department\u00a0announced Wednesday.",
      "A Treasury Department press release said the two countries have agreed to establish a \"United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund,\" referring to it as an \"economic partnership.\" The statement did not include more detail about the agreement.",
      "Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economic development minister, confirmed that she signed the deal. In a series of posts on X written in Ukrainian, she described it as a 50/50 partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine that includes development of\u00a0mineral, oil and gas projects. She said the deal would be funded through direct investment, future U.S. aid and revenue from new mineral licensing deals \u2014 and does not set up any Ukrainian debt obligations.",
      "According to a Ukrainian fact sheet, the U.S. would contribute to the fund \"either through direct financial input or through new military assistance,\" and the agreement \"focuses on further, not past U.S. military assistance.\" Ukraine would contribute 50% of any royalties from future \u2014 but not existing \u2014 oil, gas and mineral licenses.",
      "Under the deal, Ukraine would hold onto ownership of its natural resources, and the fund can only be invested in resource and infrastructure projects within Ukraine. Profits from the fund would be reinvested in the Ukrainian economy for the first decade, and can be \"distributed between the partners\" after that, the fact sheet also said.",
      "An official at the Development Finance Corporation \u2014 a U.S. government agency helping to oversee the deal \u2014 said the joint fund will \"make strategic investments in critical minerals, hydrocarbons, natural resources, and natural resources-related infrastructure in Ukraine, which will help diversify and secure supply chains essential to U.S. economic prosperity and national security.\"",
      "The fund will also \"select vital critical minerals to the United States for offtake,\" the official said.",
      "President Trump had\u00a0pressed\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about an economic deal that would include access to Ukraine's minerals, framing it as a way of paying the U.S. back for aiding the Ukrainian military in its war with Russia. Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's reserves of rare earth elements, which are used in electronics, defense technology and energy projects. Some of the country's reserves are located in parts of eastern Ukraine that are occupied by Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in an interview with NewsNation late Wednesday. \"They have things that a lot of places don't have. It's a big asset that they have,\" Trump said, of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves.",
      "Zelenskyy initially traveled to Washington in February to sign a mineral deal with Mr. Trump. Those plans were\u00a0derailed\u00a0after an explosive Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy and U.S. officials including Vice President JD Vance. During the meeting, Vance accused Zelenskyy of being\u00a0insufficiently grateful\u00a0for U.S. military aid.",
      "Negotiations continued despite the public acrimony. Earlier Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a Cabinet meeting the U.S. was prepared to sign a deal, but Ukraine had requested \"last minute changes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has cast the mineral deal as a key part of his broader gambit to broker an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.",
      "Those talks have proven rocky: At least twice in recent weeks, Trump administration officials have threatened to pull out of negotiations unless more progress is made. Mr. Trump has lashed out at Zelenskyy repeatedly, calling him a \"dictator\" earlier this year and accusing him last week of prolonging the war by refusing to recognize Russia's occupation of Crimea, which Russia took from Ukraine in 2014. The two leaders held a private meeting Saturday in the Vatican while attending the funeral of Pope Francis.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has threatened to tighten sanctions on Russia unless Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees to a deal. Russia launched deadly strikes last week on Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv, angering Mr. Trump, who posted \"Vladimir, STOP!\" on Truth Social.",

      "Jennifer Vasquez sought and received a temporary protective order in civil court against Kilmar Abrego Garcia in May 2021, per court records filed in Prince George's County District Court. The order alleges Abrego Garcia \"punched and scratched\" Vasquez, \"ripped off\" her shirt and \"grabbed and bruised\" her \u2014 though she has since said she didn't move forward with the court process because the situation \"did not escalate.\"",
      "In a court petition, Vasquez describes multiple incidents over the course of several days in May 2021. In one case, Vasquez wrote that Abrego Garcia got angry with her at a gas station, insulted her and drove very fast. Days later, Vasquez alleges Abrego Garcia yelled at her to turn off her laptop, and when she said she wasn't tired, she said he \"got angry\" and threw her laptop on the floor.

      "\"After surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship, I acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar by seeking a civil protective order in case things escalated,\" Vasquez said. \"Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling. Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect. That is not a justification for ICE's action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation. Kilmar has always been a loving partner and father, and I will continue to stand by him and demand justice for him.\"",

      "According to the Department of Homeland Security, Vasquez also sought a protective order against Abrego Garcia in 2020, accusing him of verbally abusing her, kicking and slapping her. She said when police arrived at their home, he became more violent, breaking her phone in front of an officer. She also stated that there had been other incidents in 2019 and 2020 when he became violent and broke electronic devices and doors in the house.",

      "The case has prompted a string of legal wrangling that made its way to the Supreme Court, which last week upheld a lower court decision that the Trump administration be required to \"facilitate\" his release.",
      "Despite the Supreme Court's ruling, the case has appeared to languish. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has repeatedly rebuked the Trump administration for stonewalling her and not complying with her order to both provide information on Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and facilitate his return to the U.S.",
      "Abrego Garcia was among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadoran migrants that were placed aboard three March 15 deportation flights to El Salvador after the White House alleged, often without evidence, that the men are members of transnational gangs.",
      "President Trump invoked the wartime 1798 Alien Enemies Act as justification for deporting many of the migrants to El Salvador. Another federal judge who had ordered the three flights to El Salvador be turned around found Wednesday that there was probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for defying his orders.",
      "The men are reportedly being held in the notorious Salvadoran supermax prison, known as CECOT, under an agreement with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.",
      "During a White House meeting with Mr. Trump Monday, Bukele told reporters he would not be returning Abrego Garcia to the U.S., and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that same day it is \"up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old.",
      "In 2019, he was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but an immigration judge barred his removal from the U.S. after determining that he could face persecution by gangs if deported to El Salvador. The judge granted him what is known as \"withholding of removal\" status.",
      "He was arrested again on March 12 following a traffic stop. Citing information from an informant who officials have said is credible, the Department of Homeland Security has alleged that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim his family and attorneys deny. Abrego Garcia has no criminal record in the U.S. or El Salvador, according to government documents.",
      "In an interview with CBS News earlier this month, Vasquez said that Abrego Garcia is \"not a criminal. My husband is an amazing person. An amazing father.\"",

The so-called investment tracker currently lists 47 projects involving 50 companies based on the size of their financial commitments.",

    "summary": "Despite President Trump's promise of cuts, the federal government has spent more than $200 billion more in his first 100 days than the same time period last year.",
    "story": [
      "Despite promises to cut spending during the campaign and his first few months in office, President Trump's federal government has spent more than $200 billion more in his first 100 days compared to the same time period last year.",
      "In fact, the government is now spending more, day to day, than was spent in nine of the last 10 years. The exception: 2021, when the government was spending trillions to fight the coronavirus pandemic and prevent an economic disaster.",
      "CBS News analyzed the Treasury Department's daily financial reports to track the money flowing out of every government account each day since Mr. Trump returned to office. Here's a breakdown of what we found for spending through April 29. We will be tracking and updating the spending throughout the year.",
      "Some might ask how that's possible given the high-profile repeated announcements of layoffs, canceled contracts, claims of fraud elimination by Mr. Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and belt-tightening across the administration.",
      "The answer partly lies in the fundamentals of the government's budget when it comes to big-ticket expenditures that the White House can't fully control or massive changes to the way the U.S. pays for aging Americans' retirements and medical care.",
      "The rest of the answer is politics. The conservative base that elected Mr. Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress may not support cutting the other biggest share of federal spending, the operations of the U.S. military and caring for veterans.",
      "Take a look at some of the areas representing the largest spending and largest increases in Mr. Trump's first 100 days compared to the same time period in prior years.",
      "According to our analysis of the Treasury Department's daily reports on accounts, many of the largest persistently rising costs are direct payments to the military and seniors.",
      "The federal government's habit of spending more money than it takes in means the national debt is growing. Paired with higher interest rates, the daily price tag of paying the interest on the debt is skyrocketing. The amount over the last three months is about double the amount paid out just three years earlier.",
      "And the daily payments on bonds and other securities that show up in the Treasury Daily Statement cover only cash interest paid to public debt holders. There are other elements of the government's debt obligations that only add to the cost.",
      "One way the Trump administration can impact the budget is through the civilian workforce, and that's been a focal point of Musk and DOGE via layoffs and buyouts. But many of those attempts are facing legal challenges that have delayed or reversed firings.",
      "Despite the announced staff reductions, one of the biggest areas of the increasing spending in the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term remains federal salaries. Workers were given a 2% raise when then-President Biden signed an executive order two days before Christmas, a move allowed because of Congress' inaction on permanent federal budgets.",
      "Combined, it's the military and veterans, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt payments driving the lion's share of federal spending over the last decade. In the last full fiscal year, they accounted for nearly two-thirds of federal government outlays. That breakdown has barely changed over the last decade.",
      "The vast majority of the attempted cutting so far by DOGE has been outside those areas, focused on smaller targets that might prove popular with President Trump's political base, such as foreign aid, the Education Department and grants to colleges and universities.",
      "\"If the savings are rather small and the pain is high, DOGE is going to be a liability,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, who has been tracking DOGE's work.",
      "\"If you really want to cut federal spending, you're going to have to cut into the programs where the lion's share of the money is. That's Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security and we spend a lot of money on interest,\" Malkus said.",
      "There are some significant one-year spending reductions in some agencies and spending categories.",
      "Here's a look at some of the largest reductions since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"The fiscal year ends September 30. There's still a lot more year left so let's see where we are at the end of the year,\" said Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy.",
      "A look at DOGE cuts advertised",
      "Musk's DOGE team has focused its attention on many smaller spenders among federal programs.",
      "DOGE's website claims the task force has already saved that much, at $160 billion, between canceling grants, contracts and leases and making cuts to the federal workforce. On its \"wall of receipts\" site online, the office reports the largest reductions so far come from the Department of Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Department of Education, Department of Labor and Office of Personnel Management.",
      "Only about $60 billion, or less than 40%, of that alleged savings are itemized on the office's online \"wall of receipts\" and even those itemizations have included errors and lax documentation.",
      "In his work at the American Enterprise Institute, Malkus said his review indicates the savings is more likely to be around $80 billion.",
      "Even the $160 billion advertised as saved so far by DOGE would be tiny in the context of the larger federal budget and national debt.",
      "The administration has already spent more than $200 billion more than last year in a little over three months, according to CBS News' analysis of Treasury reports.",
      "The advertised savings represents less than 2% of a full year's national budget. That's akin to a family with $10,000 in monthly spending trimming its bills by $200 a month.",
      "The supporters of the administration's cost-cutting efforts have characterized it as necessary to root out fraud and waste and to take a bite out of the national debt. However, the Treasury Department reports that debt stands at $36 trillion as of this week.",
      "The $160 billion advertised DOGE savings is about 0.5% of the debt, so the reduction from DOGE's efforts would be like a family with $10,000 in credit card balances paying it down by $50.",
      "An independent analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, also reported recently that the disruptions caused by the DOGE cuts may have cost taxpayers $135 million.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump appeared on Wednesday to acknowledge that his high tariffs on China may lead to fewer goods on shelves and at higher prices.",
      "As economists warn that Mr. Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports will disrupt the supply chain and lead to higher prices, Mr. Trump insisted the real pain is being shouldered by China, while recognizing consumers may see fewer toys on shelves and at slightly higher prices for a while. Speaking during a Cabinet meeting at the White House, the president said Americans don't need many of the goods coming from China.",
      "\"I told you before, they're having tremendous difficulty because their factories are not doing business,\" the president said of China. \"They made a trillion dollars with Biden, a trillion dollars, even a trillion one with Biden, selling us stuff, much of it we don't need. You know, somebody said, 'Oh, the shelves are going to be open.' Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. But we're not talking about something that we have to go out of our way. They have ships that are loaded up with stuff, much of which, not all of it, but much of which we don't need.\"",
      "U.S. imports of goods made in China expand far beyond toys to include electronics, clothes, household goods, appliances, construction materials and more. The president has said he believes tariffs on Chinese goods will ultimately be substantially lower than 145%.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks came hours after the Commerce Department reported U.S. domestic gross product shrank at an 0.3% annual rate in the first quarter of 2025, down from growth of 2.4% at the end of 2024. It was the country's worst quarterly performance since early 2022. Despite taking credit for a strong stock market after his election victory and inauguration, Mr. Trump on Wednesday insisted the new economic numbers had nothing to do with him, and were the fault of his predecessor.",
      "\"This is Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's,\" the president wrote Wednesday on his social media platform Truth Social. \"I didn't take over until January 20th. Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden 'Overhang.' This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, the president took that statement a step further, telling reporters, \"You could even say the next quarter is sort of Biden.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has dismissed the possibility of higher prices stemming from tariffs before. Last month, he told NBC News in a phone interview that he \"couldn't care less\" if automakers raised prices as a result of his new tariffs. This week, the president took executive actions to soften the impact\u00a0of the 25% tariffs he's imposing on foreign cars and foreign auto parts.",
      "A recent CBS News/YouGov poll\u00a0found most Americans \u2014 69% \u2014 say the Trump administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, and 62% say he's focusing too much on implementing tariffs.",

    "summary": "State Rep. Laurel Libby said she has not been allowed to vote in the Maine House of Representatives since she was censured for a Facebook post criticizing the state's policy on transgender athletes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A member of Maine's House of Representatives is asking the Supreme Court for emergency relief after she was censured for criticizing the state for allowing transgender athletes at public high schools to participate in girls sports.",
      "Laurel Libby, a Republican who represents the state's House District 90, asked the high court to issue an injunction that would require the chamber's clerk to count her votes. She argued that her constituents are being disenfranchised as a result of the punishment imposed on her for refusing to apologize after she was censured by the state House in a party-line vote last month.",
      "\"Without emergency relief from this court, Maine House District 90's residents are without equal representation for the rest of their chosen legislator's term,\" lawyers for Libby wrote in their emergency appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "They said that the sanctions imposed by Maine's House speaker leave her constituents \"without a voice or vote for every bill coming to the House floor for the rest of her elected term, which runs through 2026.\" Libby was first elected to the state legislature in 2020.",
      "The dispute stems from a post Libby shared to Facebook in February that called attention to a transgender athlete who placed first in the girls' pole vault at the state's track-and-field championship. In Maine, transgender students are eligible to participate in athletics in accordance with their gender identity. The Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against Maine's Department of Education earlier this month over its policy, which it says discriminates against women in violation of Title IX. The lawsuit came after President Trump signed an executive order in February barring transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that align with their gender identity.",
      "In response to Libby's post, which included photos and the name of the athlete, a minor, the Maine House voted 75 to 70 to censure her. The censure resolution stated that Libby refused to remove her post after she was warned it may endanger the athlete and said \"it is a basic tenet of politics and good moral character that children should not be targeted by adult politicians, especially when that targeting could result in serious harm.\"",
      "The resolution also directed Libby to \"accept full responsibility for the incident and publicly apologize to the House and to the people of the state of Maine.\" Libby, it concluded, \"must comport herself in a manner that pursues the highest standards of legislative conduct.\"",
      "After the censure resolution was approved, Libby was brought to the well of the House chamber and directed to apologize. When she refused to do so, the speaker found her in violation of a Maine House rule that prohibits a member guilty of a violation of the legislature's rules and orders from voting or speaking \"until the member has made satisfaction.\"",
      "Since then, roll call votes denote a \"Z\" for Libby's district. Her lawyers have said her seat has not had a vote on the state's budget or on bills Libby sponsored herself.",
      "Libby and six of her constituents filed a lawsuit in federal court to have her vote restored, alleging violations of the Constitution, including the First Amendment. A federal district court declined to provide her with preliminary relief, finding that legislative immunity precluded it because her sanction by Maine's House speaker was a legislative act, and the disenfranchisement of her district's voters could not overcome that immunity.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit also rejected a request to order the clerk to count Lobby's votes.",
      "In her request for the Supreme Court's intervention, Libby's lawyers said the relief they are seeking would restore \"the status quo of equal representation, bringing the Maine House back into conformity with every other state and Congress.\"",
      "They have asked the high court to weigh in by May 6, when the House will convene for another floor session, or hear oral arguments on her request next month.",
      "\"Without this court's intervention, District 90's residents have no equal representation in the House \u2014 indefinitely,\" they said. \"And there is no political solution for defendants' unconstitutional acts.\"",
      "Libby's lawyers said she remains the representative for District 90 with \"no constitutional mechanism to restore her vote unless, contrary to our most basic First Amendment freedoms, she recants her views to the speaker's liking.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 22:19:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wants the congressional watchdog agency to examine what the FBI spent on Patel's personal travel.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats have asked the U.S. Government Accountability Office to review the FBI Director Kash Patel's personal travel on government aircraft, according to GAO and congressional sources.",
      "The review will examine Patel's use of the FBI's private fleet of jets, as well as every director's approach since 2013, when the GAO last studied the issue. Investigators at the congressional watchdog agency are expected to examine Patel's flight records to determine the purpose of his travel, how much the bureau spent and whether Patel reimbursed the government for personal trips.",
      "Last week, both CBS News and The New York Times reported on questions swirling within the FBI about the degree to which Patel has used government aircraft for purely personal reasons, including trips to visit his girlfriend and attend hockey games and other sporting events.",
      "Asked about the inquiry, the FBI declined to comment.",
      "FBI directors are required by executive branch policy to use government aircraft for air travel, whether official or personal. That allows them to maintain access to secure communications wherever they travel and to move quickly in the event of an emergency. They must reimburse the government for personal flights at coach fare rates. Directors are permitted to take family or friends on personal trips, but the cost of their trips must be reimbursed to the government, as well.",
      "The FBI wouldn't share Patel's flight schedule, citing security concerns, and officials declined to confirm his presence on a number of flights to destinations that matched his appearances in those same places. During the first week of April, for example, a Boeing 757 leased by the Justice Department made two round-trip flights to New York.",
      "On April 5, the narrow-bodied jet took a 57-minute flight to Stewart International Airport, a short drive from West Point, where Patel participated in a charity hockey game hosted by the FBI. The next day, the 757 was back in the air to JFK Airport, landing just hours before Patel showed up in box seats next to hockey legend Wayne Gretzky to watch Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin break the NHL scoring record.",
      "Patel also has apparently made use of the FBI's Gulfstream 5 jets to travel to Las Vegas, where he has a home, and to Nashville, where Patel's girlfriend, a country singer, lives. Sources familiar with Patel's travel confirmed to CBS News that the director was on the plane for several trips captured by public flight trackers, including a weekend jaunt to Las Vegas on March 7 and a weekend in Nashville on March 24.",
      "On some occasions, Patel appeared to travel for both business and pleasure. An FBI jet flew on March 21 from Washington, D.C., to Nashville. That day, Patel participated in a roundtable meeting with state and local law enforcement there, and also visited the FBI field office. The plane returned to Washington later that afternoon. It is unclear whether Patel also visited his girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins.",
      "In a statement to CBS News after Patel's travel patterns became public last week, Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said \"the Judiciary Committee must investigate Director Patel's apparent misuse of taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, did not respond to a question about whether the committee would probe Patel's use of FBI planes for personal travel.",
      "It is at the director's discretion how often to use government aircraft for personal travel and for what specific purposes. In 2013, the GAO last investigated the use of FBI planes for \"non-mission\" purposes and laid out a detailed accounting of how often the aircraft were being used by the director as well as the attorney general, who also has access to the planes. While the probe found little wrongdoing, the report cautioned against excessive use of the planes for personal travel.",
      "Diana Maurer, a director at GAO and author of the 2013 report, told CBS News that the same principles that were at play when the government watchdog agency did its review, remain relevant today.",
      "\"I don't know what the current FBI director did or didn't do,\" Mauer said in an interview. \"But just because you're allowed to do something doesn't mean you necessarily should.\"",
      "She pointed out that operating government aircraft costs considerably more than commercial flights and that officials shouldn't abuse their privileges at the expense of taxpayers.",
      "\"I hope the FBI and the Department of Justice are considering the implications for taxpayers when the director uses government aircraft for non-mission purposes,\" Maurer said in the interview.",
      "Use of the FBI's aircraft for personal travel has been a flashpoint between Congress and the bureau in recent years. When Christopher Wray, Patel's predecessor, ran the FBI, his personal use of the executive jets became a focus of Republicans on Capitol Hill and conservative critics.",
      "Wray was hit for flying back and forth from Washington to his hometown of Atlanta, where his family maintained its residence. (Wray rejected the criticism at the time, noting that he was a \"required-use traveler,\" and that he reimbursed the government in every instance he used the planes for personal purposes.)",
      "Wray also drew criticism from GOP lawmakers and from some former FBI agents for summoning the G5s to Reagan National Airport from Manassas, a 15-mile flight, rather than being driven 30 miles to the Virginia airport where the FBI maintains a hangar.",
      "Patel himself was a vocal critic of Wray's use of FBI aircraft for personal travel. Two years ago, on his podcast \"Kash's Corner,\" he admonished the FBI to \"ground Chris Wray's private jet that he pays for with taxpayer dollars to hop around the country.\" Now that he has replaced Wray at the top of the FBI, he is staying mum about his own use of the bureau's fleet of private aircraft for personal use.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk and DOGE amassed vast power in President Trump's administration \u2014 reshaping federal agencies and spearheading deep cuts to the federal workforce.",
    "story": [
      "Since President Trump returned to office 100 days ago, Elon Musk has amassed vast power \u2014 leading the administration's efforts to shutter government agencies and slash the federal workforce.",
      "Musk's ruthless approach to leading the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 epitomized by a speech in which the Tesla CEO brandished a chainsaw \u2014 has drawn lawsuits, pushback from federal workers and criticism from Tesla investors. But he's also held onto broad support from Republican voters and, at least publicly, from Mr. Trump himself.",
      "Musk gained influence \u2014 and spent heavily \u2014 in 2024 race",
      "Musk \u2014 the world's richest person \u2014 endorsed Mr. Trump minutes after the then-presidential candidate's July 2024 assassination attempt. Musk had oscillated on backing Mr. Trump: The one-time Obama backer suggested Mr. Trump \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset\" in 2022, and later supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's 2024 GOP primary bid.",
      "The alliance between the two billionaires was defined by campaign cash. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Mr. Trump and other GOP candidates in 2024, much of it through Musk's America PAC. The group helped lead Mr. Trump's get-out-the-vote efforts, and became known for using its massive war chest in unorthodox and often controversial ways. One plan to dole out $1 million a day to swing state voters who signed a petition drew a lawsuit from Philadelphia's district attorney, who accused Musk's super PAC of running an illegal lottery.",
      "Mr. Trump floated a Musk-led \"government efficiency commission\" during the later months of the campaign. The scope of Musk's role was initially unclear: In a post-election statement, Mr. Trump framed DOGE as an external body that would offer \"advice and guidance,\" a far more limited role than the one Musk took on.",
      "Musk promises $2 trillion in cuts but slashes far less",
      "In an October campaign rally, the billionaire predicted he could find at least $2 trillion in annual savings, which would require him to slash the budget by nearly 30% \u2014 a daunting goal considering that almost half of all government spending goes toward the military, Medicare and Social Security, three politically difficult-to-cut areas. Earlier this year, Musk cited a still-ambitious $1 trillion as his target.",
      "So far, DOGE's stated cost savings haven't come close to the trillion-dollar mark. Musk said earlier this month he anticipates $150 billion in savings in the 2026 fiscal year by cutting waste and fraud. Meanwhile, the DOGE website says it has saved $160 billion through a combination of cancelling contracts and grants, selling assets and ferreting out fraud.",
      "But many of the cost savings touted by DOGE have been called into question. DOGE keeps a running tally of spending cuts on its website, but this \"wall of receipts\" has included errors and unverified claims, including an $8 million cancelled contract that was erroneously listed at $8 billion, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields defended DOGE's cost-cutting goals and called $1 trillion a year an achievable benchmark. He also said mistakes are rare and \"corrected immediately,\" and the statistics on DOGE's site go through a \"lengthy assessment and analysis.\" The $8 billion mistake dates back to the prior administration, DOGE has argued.",
      "\"The goal is to cut as much waste, fraud and abuse from the federal government as possible,\" Fields told CBS News. \"The president is very happy and supportive of the achievements of DOGE, and knows that we are just now getting started.\"",
      "Some of Musk's claims about the size of the government's fraud problem are also difficult to prove. He told Fox Business' Larry Kudlow last month the government could save $500 billion to $700 billion by cutting fraud and waste from entitlement programs, but there's little evidence that fraud exists on anywhere near that scale, which would equal 20% to 30% of all annual spending on Social Security and Medicare. The Government Accountability Office estimates the government loses $233 billion to $521 billion per year due to fraud. When asked about Musk's $700 billion fraud estimates, Fields said \"I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility.\"",
      "And DOGE's efforts to slash the federal workforce could end up costing $135 billion due to paid leave and productivity costs, an analysis by the Partnership for Public Service estimates.",
      "That estimate was dismissed by the White House. \"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" Fields told CBS News last week.",
      "Thousands of federal workers cut since Trump and Musk's \"fork in the road\"",
      "When the Trump administration emailed millions of federal workers in January to offer months of pay in exchange for quitting their jobs, the message's subject line \u2014 \"Fork in the Road\" \u2014 was identical to the one Musk used to coax staff into leaving Twitter after he bought the site.",
      "Since then, Musk has played a central role in efforts to cut up to 10% of the civilian workforce.",
      "The White House says 75,000 people took the \"Fork in the Road\" deferred resignation deal, which offered to pay employees until the end of September if they resigned from their positions by early February. As many as 200,000 workers were expected to participate. Tens of thousands of federal employees have also been laid off, including large numbers of probationary workers with less than one or two years of service.",
      "The job cuts have hit across the federal government. DOGE staffers visited the Pentagon in February as the military plans to eliminate tens of thousands of civilian roles. The Social Security Administration has lost thousands of workers, and the Internal Revenue Service could cut its staff by 25% according to the Associated Press.",
      "Health agencies have been hit by the administration's cuts. The National Institutes of Health is expected to face steep budget cuts, a move former NIH Director Francis Collins warned could have dire consequences for public health in an interview with \"60 Minutes.\" The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has lost 10% of its staff, CBS News reported.",
      "Some 1,000 National Park Service workers were laid off, raising fears about understaffing.",
      "Fields told CBS News the Trump administration's job cuts are designed to avoid any disruption to critical government services, but added: \"To a bureaucracy that has gone untouched for decades, it's going to be disruptive.\"",
      "In some cases, laid-off probationary workers have been rehired due to now-paused court orders that halted the job cuts, causing confusion. \"We're supposed to be OK. But one minute we're in a good space, and the next minute we could just lose everything,\" one rehired Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services staff member told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, Musk has publicly blasted the federal workforce, claiming DOGE is on a mission to eliminate a \"dictatorship of the bureaucracy\" that's hostile to Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "In February, federal employees received an email with the subject line, \"What did you do last week?\" instructing them to reply with a list of five things they'd accomplished. Musk warned on X that any non-responses \"will be taken as a resignation.\" The move set off confusion, with some agencies telling workers not to respond. Musk later called the emails a \"pulse check\" designed to root out dead or nonexistent people that he claims are collecting paychecks.",
      "DOGE tries to shut down agencies: USAID, CFPB and more",
      "Even if DOGE's cuts could fall short of Musk's goals, its influence has been sweeping.",
      "Within days of Mr. Trump's inauguration, DOGE began touting canceled contracts, and its staff became embedded in scores of departments. Musk told Fox Business last month his team of over 100 people was in \"pretty much\" every agency. Many of the funding cuts have been abrupt, and Musk has admitted DOGE has made mistakes in its rapid push to slash spending.",
      "In some cases, Musk's team has participated in the near-dismantling of federal agencies. The gambit has often begun with DOGE staffers accessing an agency's offices \u2014 in some cases clashing with employees \u2014 followed by mass job cuts.",
      "The U.S. Agency for International Development, a foreign aid agency that Musk described as a \"criminal organization\" awash with fraud, was one of his earliest targets. Two USAID security officials were put on leave for trying to stop DOGE staffers from accessing internal systems (a Trump administration spokesperson said at the time classified information wasn't accessed without security clearances). The Trump administration later placed many of USAID's staff on leave, halted foreign aid programs and began absorbing what remained of USAID into the State Department.",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also drawn Musk's ire. In early February, DOGE personnel entered the financial regulator's office and \"camped out in the basement,\" a former agency staffer told CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\" Hours later, Musk posted on X, \"CFPB RIP.\" The administration has tried to lay off 90% of CFPB staff and halt the agency's work, though a federal judge has temporarily blocked those moves.",
      "DOGE's efforts at the U.S. Institute of Peace triggered a legal standoff, with several fired board members suing the administration and accusing DOGE personnel of engaging in a \"literal trespass and takeover by force\" at the agency's headquarters. The White House defended cuts to the organization at the time, telling CBS News, \"Taxpayers don't want to spend $50 million per year on a publicly-funded 'research institute' that has failed to deliver peace.\"",
      "Musk accesses federal data",
      "Personnel at DOGE gained access to the Treasury Department's internal payment system in the first few weeks of Mr. Trump's term, which Musk cast as a way to catch fraud. The move prompted concern from Democrats due to the sensitive personal data handled by the system and the possibility that DOGE could try to cut off spending authorized by Congress. The Trump administration said at the time Musk's team has \"read-only\" access.",
      "In mid-February, a staffer linked to DOGE also sought access to the Internal Revenue Service's taxpayer data system, drawing criticism from Democratic lawmakers. Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller said the administration is planning a \"basic anti-fraud review to ensure that people are not engaging in large scale theft of federal taxpayer benefits.\"",
      "Musk has scrutinized the Social Security Administration, which he claims is rife with fraud, suggesting tens of millions of dead people are receiving payments and immigrants are abusing the system en masse, though he's never offered any evidence for either of these assertions. He's described Social Security as a \"Ponzi scheme,\" though both Musk and Mr. Trump have said they would not cut benefits. At one point earlier this year, the SSA considered requiring Social Security recipients to verify their identities in person instead of over the phone, but the agency reversed course after seniors and their advocates objected.",
      "Musk clashes with Democrats, courts \u2014 and even Trump allies",
      "Musk's rise to power has drawn outrage from Democrats, who argue DOGE has unilaterally slashed spending appropriated by Congress. Most Republican lawmakers defended DOGE, though some have raised concerns about sweeping cuts to public health agencies and programs important to their districts.",
      "Public opinion on Musk is similarly divided. Some 52% of Americans said in late February Musk and DOGE had too much influence over federal worker firing decisions, including 81% of Democrats and 57% of independents but just 21% of Republicans, according to a CBS News poll with a margin of error of 2.5 points.",
      "Musk has occasionally clashed with other Trump loyalists. His pick for interim IRS leader \u2014 Hunter Biden whistleblower Gary Shapley \u2014 left the role after just 48 hours, after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent privately complained to Mr. Trump. And Musk publicly feuded with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro over tariffs, calling him \"dumber than a sack of bricks.\"",
      "DOGE's aggressive moves have also drawn lawsuits arguing the agency has exceeded its authority. At various points, judges have halted DOGE's efforts to lay off workers and access the Treasury payment system, though in many cases, those rulings were stayed.",
      "Some legal challenges have zeroed in on Musk's official status in the administration. The White House says Musk is a \"special government employee,\" which allows him to serve for up to 130 days in a single yearlong period. The administration has argued in court papers that Musk isn't officially DOGE's administrator and \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "DOGE clashes with Musk's business interests",
      "Musk's business empire benefits heavily from federal programs. Tesla sells billions of dollars a year in credits to automakers that fall short of federal emission rules, and its cars are subsidized by tax incentives for electric vehicles \u2014 though Mr. Trump has called for a rollback of electric car subsidies. Mr. Trump has also offered his public endorsement, promising to buy a Tesla in a White House event. Musk's aerospace company SpaceX has valuable contracts with NASA, and its satellite internet division Starlink could take over a contract to modernize the air traffic control system, The Associated Press reports.",
      "Musk has pushed back on conflict-of-interest concerns, saying in an Oval Office appearance with Mr. Trump, \"all of our actions are maximally transparent.\"",
      "But DOGE has caused agita for Tesla investors, some of whom fear Musk is too distracted to run the company or his polarizing image could hurt the carmaker's brand. The company's sales and profits have fallen over the past year, and its share price is down nearly 25% from early January, prompting some investors to urge him to step back from the Trump administration.",
      "Musk said on a Tesla earnings call last week that his \"time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly\" in May. But he added that he'll remain involved for the rest of Mr. Trump's term.",
      "There's no indication DOGE or Musk's work at the White House will end next month. \"Elon Musk will still be a common face here,\" Fields said.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 19:43:53 -0400",
    "summary": "California and nearly two dozen other states are suing the Trump administration over drastic cuts to the AmeriCorps agency.",
    "story": [
      "Two dozen states filed a lawsuit Tuesday over dramatic cuts to AmeriCorps, alleging the Trump administration is trying to \"dismantle\" the volunteer service organization as part of its sweeping federal cost-cutting campaign.",
      "AmeriCorps has put 85% of its staff on administrative leave ahead of planned job cuts, the lawsuit says. The agency has also allegedly slashed its National Civilian Community Corps, which sends volunteers to work on conservation, natural disaster response and other projects, and cut hundreds of millions in grants, covering 41% of the agency's budget.",
      "The lawsuit argues the cuts \u2014 which it links to President Trump's federal cost-cutting push, led by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 violate federal law and constitutional separation of powers, since Congress created and funded AmeriCorps.",
      "\"If the Defendants' actions are permitted to stand despite their statutory and constitutional defects, then the gutting of AmeriCorps will inflict immediate and irreparable harms on the Plaintiff States, their residents, and the public at large,\" reads the lawsuit, which was filed in Maryland federal court and led by California, Colorado, Delaware and Maryland.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement: \"Americorps has failed eight consecutive audits and identified over $45 million in improper payments in 2024 alone. President Trump has the legal right to restore accountability to the entire Executive Branch.\"",
      "AmeriCorps' inspector general said in November the agency \"has been unable to produce auditable financial statements for the last eight years,\" and recommended changes to the agency's financial practices.",
      "Founded in 1993, AmeriCorps oversees around 200,000 members, most of whom receive living stipends, and employs hundreds of people. It funds both directly operated programs, like the National Civilian Community Corps and grant-funded programs overseen by states.",
      "The AmeriCorps grants targeted to be eliminated by the Trump administration amount to nearly $400 million, hitting volunteer programs in all 50 states, according to the nonprofit America's Service Commissions.",
      "In a statement, America's Service Commissions said the cuts came late Friday with no advanced notice.",
      "\"Thousands of people who have steadfastly dedicated their lives to serving their country through AmeriCorps are finding their livelihoods suddenly thrown into jeopardy, and hundreds of communities are losing critical services they rely on,\" ASC CEO Kaira Esgate said.",
      "After the drastic cuts to grants were announced last week, every California service-based program with AmeriCorps was told to stop working.",
      "\"These actions by President Trump and Elon Musk not only threaten our funding \u2013 they vandalize our values. We're going to fight to stop them,\" California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement about the AmeriCorps cuts.",
      "California's AmeriCorps volunteers amassed a total of 4,397,674 of service hours during the 2023-24 year, according to the governor's office.",
      "Newsom noted that California has already been recruiting for its own California Service Corps program, a pool of volunteers that he says is now larger than the Peace Corps.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 19:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump delivered a speech marking the first 100 days of his second term in Warren, Michigan.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump marked the first 100 days in office of his second term with a Tuesday evening\u00a0rally\u00a0outside Detroit \u2014 spending much of his 90-minute speech touting his administration's record on immigration and lashing out against judges, Biden-era officials and other foes.",
      "\"We're here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country, and that's according to many, many people,\" Mr. Trump said to kick off his speech at Macomb Community College in Warren, Michigan. \"This is the best, they say, 100-day start of any president in history, and everyone is saying it. We've just gotten started. You haven't even seen anything yet.\"",
      "The president chose to give his speech in the heart of the auto industry, as he hopes the tariffs he's imposing on imports from other countries will bring auto companies and other manufacturers back to the U.S., despite economists' warnings that the president's policies will increase prices. On Tuesday, the president signed executive orders to provide some relief from the 25% tariffs he's imposing on imported foreign cars and parts.",
      "As the president's approval numbers have slipped since his inauguration, Mr. Trump particularly homed in on his administration's border enforcement policies. Immigration continues to be one of the president's strongest issues in polling.",
      "\"There's never been such a difference in anything as the difference between the border today and the border what it was just six months ago, so I want to say congratulations, America, it's about time,\" he said.",
      "As the Trump administration faces a slew of lawsuits over its mass deportations and other immigration policies, the president said, \"the courts are giving us a hard time.\" Mr. Trump said his administration has significantly increased arrests of \"known and suspected terrorists,\" appearing to reference suspected gang members.",
      "\"We tried to get it higher, we tried to get it higher, but the courts are giving us a hard time, can you believe?\" Mr. Trump said. \"You know, I won on the basis of, I think, the number one thing was on illegal immigration, the border. \u2026 I think that was the number one thing, and now the courts are trying to say that you know, that doesn't matter. I don't think it's going to be allowed to stand.\"",
      "\"I hope for the sake of our country that the Supreme Court is going to save this,\" Mr. Trump said later.",
      "As nations scramble to reach deals with the White House over the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed, the president boasted that leaders from around the world are traveling to meet with him.",
      "\"Now, we're respected all over the world,\" he said. \"They're coming from all over the world to see your president. They're coming from India, they're coming from France, they're coming from Spain. Yeah, they're coming from China, too, yeah, they're coming from China. They're coming from all over to see your president. They want to make a deal. They want to make a deal. And you know, we'll make deals, but we don't have to.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also touted slower inflation, but criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, saying he's \"not really doing a good job.\" The Fed has drawn Mr. Trump's ire for declining to speed up interest rate cuts so far this year, which could boost economic growth at the cost of higher inflation. Powell has also warned Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs could push up consumer prices and harm the economy.",
      "The president also touted his administration's work to slash government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development. He also mentioned his administration's instruction to federal employees to return to the office, saying some federal workers improved their golf handicap while working remotely.",
      "\"They weren't working at home. Who the hell would work at home? How do you work at home?\" he said.",
      "The president called multiple aides on stage, including special assistant to the president Margo Martin. \"Trump 2028, anybody?\" she said, to cheers from the crowd. Mr. Trump has periodically floated seeking a third term \u2014 and his online store sells \"Trump 2028\" merchandise \u2014 though the Constitution only allows presidents to be elected to two terms.",
      "Mr. Trump also touted his administration's work on hot-button social issues.",
      "\"I ended all of the lawless so-called diversity, equity and inclusion bulls***, all across the federal government and the private sector,\" the president claimed. \"And I made it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female. And the really easy one, this was the easiest one I had, I banned men from competing in women's sports.\"",
      "The president doesn't have the authority to do all those things in the private sector and at the local level, but the administration has sought to influence those spheres.",
      "As Republicans struggle to figure out how to pay for the president's tax cuts, making cuts to Medicaid has been a possible pay-for. But the president insisted he'll protect Medicaid.",
      "\"We will always protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors, with no cuts, and we will defend Medicaid for those great people that are in need,\" Mr. Trump said as he neared the end of his speech. \"House Republicans are working to invest more money in Medicaid than we spend today. The only thing we're going to cut is the corruption and the crooks that take advantage of some of the illegal schemes. So we want to preserve Medicaid for the most vulnerable, for our kids, pregnant women, the poor and disabled Americans.\"",
      "What to know about Trump's first 100 days",
      "In his Michigan speech, Mr. Trump hit many of the highlights of his second term so far, including mass deportation operations, efforts to shrink the size and scope of government and the changes he's making to the global trade landscape. Those endeavors have not gone unopposed, prompting scores of lawsuits filed by ousted government employees, migrants fighting their deportation and business owners who argue the president's tariffs are unlawful.",
      "\"[I]nflation has cooled, consumer prices dropped month-over-month for the first time in three years, and gas prices are lower across the country,\" the White House said in announcing the speech, and it went on to praise the Department of Government Efficiency for rooting out \"waste, fraud, and abuse across the executive branch\" and canceling \"numerous discriminatory DEI contracts.\"",
      "DOGE's work continues apace, with billionaire Elon Musk unofficially guiding efforts to downsize government. So far, however, DOGE's cuts aren't anywhere close to approaching the $2 trillion Musk initially said he'd slash from annual spending. Those efforts have also landed the federal government in multiple courtrooms over the firings, downsizing and elimination of government-funded programs.",
      "The Trump administration claims it has done more to secure the border in the president's first 100 days in office than any other president in history. Illegal border crossings\u00a0have reached\u00a0lows not seen in decades, and the administration has been working to deport migrants accused or convicted of violent crimes and drug-related offenses. But Mr. Trump's decision to invoke wartime authorities to send migrants to an El Salvador prison without due process has resulted in lawsuits, as has the president's efforts to end\u00a0birthright citizenship.",
      "The 100-day mark comes as the Trump administration is hashing out trade negotiations with countries across the world after Mr. Trump levied nearly worldwide tariffs on foreign imports, tariffs that most economists say will make goods more expensive and worsen economic prospects. Mr. Trump claimed in an interview with TIME that he's reached 200 trade deals with other countries since April 2, but declined to name any of the countries. Americans are skeptical of the president's tariff approach, CBS News polling shows, and most worry they'll contribute to higher prices at a time when high prices are a top concern for voters.",
      "It's unclear how much the president will focus on foreign policy matters, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued the administration has made significant progress on the foreign policy front. After repeatedly saying he would end the war in Ukraine before even taking office, Mr. Trump is now saying those comments were made in \"jest.\"",
      "\"We are closer today to a peace deal in Russia and Ukraine, certainly, than we were when we took office on Jan. 20,\" Leavitt told reporters Monday. \"If you look at the situation in the Middle East, Israel has never had a stronger friend than they do right now in the Oval Office with President Trump. We've had more than 75 hostages who have returned home from around the world who were wrongfully detained individuals.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Tuesday he's ending a program at the Defense Department that promoted the participation of women in peace building and was signed into law by President Trump in 2017.",
      "In his initial post on X, Hegseth called the Women, Peace and Security program \"yet another woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative that overburdens our commanders and troops.\" In a follow-up post, he clarified that the program had been \"ruined\" by the Biden administration.",
      "Hegseth said the Defense Department would comply with the minimum requirements under the law, but would \"fight to end\" the program when Congress sets its next budget.",
      "Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and national security adviser Mike Waltz, supported the efforts when they were in Congress. It was also championed by Mr. Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, who served in the White House during his first term.",
      "Earlier this month, Rubio touted the bill, saying in remarks at the State Department that he was proud to support it. He referred to it as \"the first law passed by any country anywhere in the world focused on protecting women and promoting their participation in society.\"",
      "The program, according to the strategy released during Mr. Trump's first term, seeks to increase women's participation in decision-making processes as well as promote the protection of women and girls' human rights around the world.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who introduced the legislation for the program, said the defense secretary is \"short sighted and doesn't really understand what he's doing\" when asked by CBS News about Hegseth's post on X.",
      "\"We have data that shows what a difference it makes to have women at the table in negotiations,\" Shaheen said. \"We know that peace agreements that are made with women at the table last 35% longer, longer than 15 years if women are at the table.\" On \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, Shaheen was critical of\u00a0Hegseth, who she said has \"created chaos\" at the Pentagon amid a recent staff shakeup.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:59:43 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposal from Republican lawmakers would eliminate the popular SAVE repayment plan, which helped lower costs for millions.",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",
      "The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know.",
      "How could income-based repayment plans change?",
      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",
      "SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it was paused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\"",
      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",
      "The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school.",
      "The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount \u2014 $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently \u2014 before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college.",
      "The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0 Forty-five days into a U.S. air campaign against Iranian-backed Houthis, American forces have hit more than 1,000 targets in Yemen. Yet, despite promises from Trump administration officials to run \"the most transparent Defense Department in history,\" the Pentagon has held just one formal briefing in the first 100 days of President Trump's second term.",
      "\"In line with the secretary's vision to make this the most transparent Department of Defense in history, I gave you my personal commitment to make these briefings more routine,\" said top Pentagon public affairs aide Sean Parnell on March 17, during the only formal briefing conducted so far.",
      "During the same period, the White House and State Department have held 18 and 13 briefings, respectively, as of April 28.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Pentagon had 34 on-camera briefings in its first 100 days while Biden's White House and State Department held 61 and 34 briefings, respectively. During the first 100 days of Mr. Trump's first term, reporters received five on-camera briefings from the Defense Department.",
      "The Pentagon has a long history of briefing the media about military operations. Until his departure in 1968, Barry Zorthian would climb to the rooftop of Saigon's Rex Hotel to give reporters the Pentagon's official version of the Vietnam War. The briefings were branded the \"Five O'Clock Follies\" by skeptical reporters, but even so, the dialogue between spokesperson and journalist provided a critical stream of information about what the government was doing on behalf of American citizens.",
      "The tradition stretched across wars \u2014 from Desert Storm in 1991 to the 1999 Kosovo air campaign \u2014\u00a0 and even during the Biden administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Pentagon continued to brief the press regularly.",
      "Retired Rear Adm. T. McCreary, who ran the Navy's public affairs office as the chief of naval information from 2003 to 2006, told CBS News there are three reasons to hold news briefings: To get your story out first, so the public reacts to you; second, to stop the spread of the enemy putting out disinformation to spin the story; and third, to inform the taxpayers what the Pentagon, which has the largest discretionary budget of any department, is doing with its money.",
      "\"Every time the Pentagon and the [Defense Department] establishments start being less forthcoming with information, it erodes the trust and transparency that was built up over years to where the faith and the establishment sometimes starts getting questioned,\" McCreary said.",
      "The Office of the Secretary of Defense's Principles of Information details the Pentagon's guidelines for public affairs. Included is the promise to \"make available timely and accurate information so that the public, the Congress, and the news media may assess and understand the facts about national security and defense strategy.\"",
      "The single on-camera briefing the Pentagon held 43 days ago took place in the days after U.S. Central Command launched the ongoing campaign against the Houthis. Parnell, the chief spokesperson, and the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt. Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich answered questions on the operation.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has held news conferences and short question and answer sessions with a small group of reporters while traveling but has not yet conducted an on-camera briefing in the Pentagon Briefing Room, which accommodates about 60 reporters. He has, however, used the briefing room on at least four separate occasions as a backdrop for live interviews with Fox News.",
      "On Sunday, U.S. Central Command issued a press release boasting of hundreds of enemy fighters killed and dozens of command and storage centers destroyed under Operation Rough Rider. The targets, officials said, included advanced missiles, drones, and vessels used in Houthi attacks on commercial shipping lanes\u2014claims offered with little public scrutiny and even fewer questions answered as the total cost of the campaign nears $1 billion, CNN reported.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Pentagon and U.S. Central Command with questions on Monday, but neither one has responded.",
      "Soon after the campaign against the Houthis began, Hegseth was embroiled in controversy over sensitive details he shared over Signal on March 15 ahead of the initial strikes.",
      "Hegseth has denied sending any classified information, but over a month later, his use of Signal is still under scrutiny, following the revelation that he shared similar updates in a second chat that included his wife, brother and personal attorney.",
      "In that same month, five officials in Hegseth's inner circle have either been fired or left their positions, including John Ullyot, who briefly served as Pentagon Press Secretary and wrote an op-ed after his departure claiming there is \"total chaos\" at the Pentagon.",
      "Hegseth and Parnell, the chief spokesperson, have both denied these claims and have on social media blamed the stories on the media and disgruntled employees, but they have not briefed journalists to address questions.",
      "\"I think the administration would like to talk about something besides Signal, but the problem is they keep screwing it up,\" a former senior defense official told CBS News. \"You know the first thing about being in a bad news cycle is to stop creating news.\"",
      "During the Biden administration, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in the aftermath of his hospitalization scandal, took questions from the podium in the Pentagon press briefing room. For about 40 minutes, he answered questions and apologized for not disclosing his hospitalization and cancer diagnosis.",
      "\"It is hard to overstate the importance of having the Pentagon hold regular press briefings,\" said Howard Altman, president of the Military Reporters and Editors association in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"The American public has a right to know how and why taxpayer dollars are spent, how those in uniform are faring and, within the boundaries of operational security, the dangers our troops and nation face\u2026this is not a partisan issue,\" he said. \"It is an American one. A well-informed public is a cornerstone of our democracy.\"",
      "Parnell has been going to X to provide weekly situation reports \u2014 or sitreps \u2014 where he talks straight to the camera about Pentagon updates as part of the administration's promise of transparency. The videos released each week do not provide the opportunity for the media to ask questions.",
      "Instead of regular press engagements, the Pentagon in February created DOD Rapid Response, a social media account on X. The account's bio states it is \"Supporting The Mission of SecDef [Hegseth] And Fighting Against Fake News!\"",
      "The account commonly attacks news publications and\u00a0 posts comments criticizing reporting about Hegseth and the Defense Department. The X account has omitted context from its statements, touting an increase in U.S. military recruiting numbers between February 2024 through February 2025, even though much of the credit for improved recruitment numbers belongs to Biden administration, as CBS News' Confirmed team found.",
      "The account also posted misleading statements about the Signal chat scandal reported by The Atlantic. The account is overseen by conservative podcaster and Army veteran Graham Allen, who is now the Pentagon's digital media director.",
      "\"Holding your policies up to the light of media scrutiny is a good, healthy thing,\" a second former senior defense official said. \"Over time, that scrutiny is very good for the policymaking process because reporters are going to think of things, and they're going to approach the way to ask questions in ways that the policy thinkers and the policy makers may not have done.\"",

    "story": [
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, citing a report that Amazon plans to display tariff charges on imported goods, called the move \"a hostile and political act.\"",
      "The e-commerce giant plans to display new tariff costs next to products' prices, political news site Punchbowl\u00a0reported earlier Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. The move would provide shoppers with clarity into the cost of the new levies on imported goods.",
      "\"Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?\" Leavitt said during a press briefing Tuesday.",
      "However, Amazon pushed back on the report, saying in a Tuesday statement to CBS News that its Amazon Haul store \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\" Amazon Haul was introduced late last year by the e-commerce giant to sell low-cost goods to compete with Temu and Shein.",
      "\"This was never approved and is not going to happen,\" said Tim Doyle, an Amazon spokesperson.",
      "President Trump confirmed to reporters that he spoke with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on the phone Tuesday morning.",
      "\"Jeff Bezos was very nice,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly. And he did the right thing.\"",
      "The president has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on goods imported from China, while he lowered a range of tariffs on most other nations to a 10% baseline rate during a 90-day pause that began earlier this month. Tariffs are import duties that are paid by U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, which typically pass on the added fee to consumers in the form of higher costs.",
      "The duties are already making foreign-made goods more expensive for U.S.-based consumers.",
      "Earlier this month, data showed that\u00a0Amazon sellers had already hiked prices on nearly 1,000 of the top 100,000 selling products on the site, according to SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike was about 30%.",
      "At the time, Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement earlier this month to CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump repeatedly distanced himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail, saying he had \"nothing to do with\" the initiative spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, had not read it and didn't have any plans to.",
      "But as the president marked 100 days in the White House, many of the plans he has rolled out since the start of his second term closely align with those in the pages of Project 2025's sprawling, 900-page policy blueprint, which lays out an overhaul of the executive branch.",
      "Overseen by the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 was an initiative that was designed to provide a roadmap for the next Republican president, now Mr. Trump. On the campaign trail, the president called some of its proposals \"abysmal\" and said he knew nothing about it, though CBS News' analysis showed many of its proposals were similar to his own.",
      "The authors of some of the policy guide's chapters served in his first administration and have returned for the second. Russ Vought is leading the Office of Management and Budget, and John Ratcliffe is in place as CIA director, while Peter Navarro, who was a top trade adviser to Mr. Trump in his first administration, returned for a second stint in the White House.",
      "Some of Mr. Trump's actions taken in his first days in office reinstate measures he put in place during his first term that were revoked by President Biden. But in other instances, Mr. Trump has taken new executive actions that echo policies outlined in Project 2025's policy book.",
      "Abolishing the Department of Education",
      "Republicans have long called for the Department of Education to be dismantled, and that recommendation was also made in Project 2025, which declared that \"federal education policy should be limited and, ultimately, the federal Department of Education should be eliminated.\"",
      "Mr. Trump took steps to begin that process with an executive order he signed in March. The administration has already cut the Education Department's staff and is making plans to move some of its functions to other agencies.",
      "Shuttering the Department of Education, however, would require an act of Congress.",
      "Ending diversity, equity and inclusion practices",
      "The president frequently rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices, and he signed an executive order on the day he returned to the White House ending all DEI programs within the federal government.",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in his order that DEI policies can violate federal civil rights laws and shut out Americans \"who deserve a shot at the American dream\" because of their race or sex.",
      "Project 2025 likewise calls for the \"DEI apparatus\" at a variety of agencies to be dismantled.",
      "Project 2025's policy book also calls for deleting a variety of terms, including DEI, abortion and gender equality \"from every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.\"",
      "Some of the Trump administration's early efforts to purge mentions of gender or race resulted in missteps that prompted a public outcry and were later reversed.",
      "Shifting FEMA costs to the states",
      "Shortly after the start of his second term, Mr. Trump established a review council to advise him on the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, \"to capably and impartially address disasters occurring within the United States.\" The council will also advise the president on recommended changes related to FEMA, his order states.",
      "Mr. Trump's directive came after he suggested that he could \"get rid\" of FEMA and leave disaster response management to the states.",
      "\"That's what states are for, to take care of problems,\" he said in late January.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in March that declares it is the policy of the U.S. that \"state and local governments and individuals play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness,\" and says that his administration will \"enable state and local governments to better understand, plan for and ultimately address the needs of their citizens.\"",
      "The overhaul at FEMA has sparked concerns about the agency's capabilities to deliver disaster assistance ahead of hurricane season. FEMA has already denied requests for federal aid in response to severe storms and tornadoes\u00a0in Arkansas, flooding in parts of\u00a0West Virginia and storms\u00a0in Washington.",
      "Project 2025's sweeping book of policy proposals calls for \"reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.\"",
      "It also urges Congress to change the cost-sharing arrangement so the federal government covers 25% of the costs for small disasters and up to 75% for \"truly catastrophic disasters.\" Currently, for Public Assistance, which provides financial and direct assistance to state and local governments for disaster response and recovery work, FEMA covers a minimum of 75% of costs, and the president can increase the federal cost-share at his discretion, according to a 2023 report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The recommendation follows a warning from Project 2025's authors that FEMA is \"overtasked, overcompensates for the lack of state and local preparedness and response, and is regularly in deep debt.\" Project 2025's book also calls on Congress to end preparedness grants for states and localities.",
      "\"DHS should not be in the business of handing out federal tax dollars: These grants should be terminated,\" it states.",
      "Targeting PBS and National Public Radio",
      "Brendan Carr, head of the Federal Communications Commission, informed the heads of National Public Radio and PBS in a letter earlier this year that the agency had opened an investigation into the airing of their programming across their roughly 1,500 broadcast member stations, according to The New York Times.",
      "Those stations are licensed by the FCC to operate, but are limited to operating as noncommercial educational broadcast stations. These stations, or NCEs, are exempt from licensing fees and operate on a specific \"reserved\" frequency band. Federal law prohibits these noncommercial educational broadcast stations from airing commercial advertisements.",
      "In his letter, Carr wrote that he is \"concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials. In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements.\"",
      "Carr also said that he also does not see a reason for Congress to continue approving federal dollars for NPR and PBS \"given the changes in the media marketplace.\" PBS CEO Paula Kerger said the cuts \"would devastate PBS member stations and the essential role they play in communities, particularly smaller and rural stations.\"",
      "Carr authored the section of Project 2025's policy book that deals with the FCC, but another portion of the blueprint urges Congress to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides grants to NPR and PBS.",
      "According to Project 2025, \"stripping public funding would, of course, mean that NPR, PBS, Pacifica Radio, and the other leftist broadcasters would be shorn of the presumption that they act in the public interest and receive the privileges that often accompany so acting.\" The outlets should therefore no longer be qualified as noncommercial educational broadcast stations, according to the book.",
      "Freezing federal assistance",
      "One of Mr. Trump's first actions as president was to establish the White House's Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 DOGE \u2014 run by Elon Musk, to slash regulations and spending, and restructure federal agencies.",
      "On the heels of that move, the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, issued a two-page memo in January that ordered a freeze on grant, loan or federal assistance programs covered by Mr. Trump's executive orders, which would allow his administration \"time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the president's priorities.\"",
      "The memo sparked widespread confusion and prompted concerns about whether programs providing meals for the elderly, pre-school funding for low-income children, medical research and other priorities approved by Congress would be impacted by the order.",
      "The White House then rescinded the memo but maintained the funding pause \"to end any confusion\" created by a federal court order temporarily pausing implementation of the freeze. Federal courts have since ordered the administration to reinstate any money that was frozen subject to the memo.",
      "Vought, the head of OMB, authored the section of Project 2025's policy book covering the Executive Office of the President, which includes the agency he has been tapped to lead.",
      "In it, he likens the budget office to an air-traffic control system for the president \"with the ability and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course.\"",
      "The memo may have been aimed at sparking a legal challenge to the Impoundment Control Act, a 1974 law that limits the president's ability to unilaterally freeze certain funds appropriated by Congress, and in most cases requires the president instead to ask Congress to rescind spending legislation.",
      "In Project 2025's policy blueprint, Vought also wrote the director of OMB must have \"sufficient visibility into the deep caverns of agency decision-making,\" and can achieve this by ensuring political appointees on his staff sign off on apportionments of funding authorized by Congress.",
      "Vought cited a 1870 law known as the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending federal dollars in advance and requires funding be doled out in installments.",
      "\"This process, whereby agencies come to OMB for allotments of appropriated funding, is essential to the effective financial stewardship of taxpayer dollars,\" he wrote. \"OMB can then direct on behalf of a president the amount, duration, and purpose of any apportioned funding to ensure against waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure consistency with the president's agenda and applicable laws.\"",
      "Restricting gender-affirming care for minors",
      "Mr. Trump issued an executive order in January that seeks to bar the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care \u2014 puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures \u2014 for people under the age of 19.",
      "Called \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" the order directs certain executive agencies to take steps to ensure medical institutions that receive federal grants \"end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\"",
      "It also instructs the secretary of defense to take regulatory action to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from insurance coverage provided by TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and federal employee health benefit programs.",
      "Mr. Trump's order directs the head of the Department of Health and Human Services to withdraw March 2022 guidance on gender-affirming care.",
      "Project 2025's chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services calls for its Office of Civil Rights to \"remove all guidance issued under the Biden administration concerning sexual orientation and gender identity,\" including the March 2022 document.",
      "The book generally criticizes gender-affirming care as causing \"irreversible physical and mental harm to those who receive them\" and argues there is a lack of evidence surrounding it.",
      "Many families and doctors who care for transgender youth dispute that assessment, and a group of families filed a lawsuit claiming the order is discriminatory. Two different federal district courts have blocked the president's directive, and those injunctions are being appealed.",
      "Revoking security clearances",
      "Mr. Trump took executive action to start the process of revoking the security clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming emails found on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign. He also announced he would revoke the security clearances of a number of prominent Democrats including former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton.",
      "Project 2025 also proposed stripping former intelligence officials of security clearances, under a more narrow set of circumstances, in a section on the intelligence community authored by Dustin Carmack, who worked at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "\"The president should immediately revoke the security clearances of any former directors, deputy directors, or other senior intelligence officials who discuss their work in the press or on social media without prior clearance from the current director,\" he wrote.",
      "Stripping civil servants of employment protections",
      "Among the slew of actions Mr. Trump took on his first day back in the White House was to reinstate an executive order issued during his first term that created \"Schedule F in the Excepted Service.\" The order creates a new employment category for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of employment protections.",
      "The order states that in recent years, \"there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership.\"",
      "\"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character,\" Mr. Trump's order reads.",
      "The order makes some minor changes to the president's prior measure from October 2020. But it notably adds a section that states that while employees in these new \"Schedule Policy/Career Positions,\" are not required to personally or politically support the current president or his policies, they are \"required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the president.\"",
      "Failure to do so is grounds for termination of employment, Mr. Trump's executive order states. Critics say the change would enable the administration to fire government employees for no cause and replace them with Trump loyalists.",
      "Project 2025 repeatedly calls for Mr. Trump's Schedule F proposal to be reinstated.",
      "Reinstating service members who refused COVID-19 vaccines",
      "The president directed the secretaries of Defense or Homeland Security to reinstate service members, both active-duty and reserve, who were discharged after refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. (The vaccine requirement was lifted in 2023.) His order also states they should be reverted to their former rank and receive full back pay, benefits, bonus payments or compensation.",
      "The Project 2025 blueprint's section on the Defense Department, authored by Chris Miller, calls for the next administration to \"reinstate servicemembers to active duty who were discharged for not receiving the COVID vaccine, restore their appropriate rank, and provide back pay.\"",
      "Miller served as acting defense secretary in the final weeks of Mr. Trump's first term. His chief of staff, Kash Patel, is now serving as director of the FBI.",
      "Banning transgender people from the military",
      "During his first four years in the White House, Mr. Trump prohibited transgender people from serving in the military. President Biden repealed that ban, but Mr. Trump has issued an order that effectively bars transgender people from serving in the armed forces and withdraws his predecessor's order.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order states that \"expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\" Identifying as transgender, it continues, \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\"",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria,\" the president's order states. \"This policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual's sex.\"",
      "Project 2025 calls for a reversal of policies \"that allow transgender individuals to serve in the military. Gender dysphoria is incompatible with the demands of military service.\"",
      "SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit group comprising thousands of transgender service members, veterans and their supporters, disputed such claims, saying: \"Transgender Americans have served openly and honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces for nearly a decade. Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve.\"",
      "The transgender military ban has since been blocked by two different federal courts, though the decisions have been appealed. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in one of those cases and is seeking to begin enforcing the ban.",
      "There are more than 1.2 million active-duty members of the military, according to the Defense Department. A January report from the Congressional Research Service found that roughly 1,892 active-duty service members received gender-affirming care from the Pentagon between January 2016 and May 2021. A Feb. 26 memo from the Pentagon found that between 2015 and 2024, it spent $52 million on care for active-duty members of the military to treat gender dysphoria.",
      "A hiring freeze",
      "On his first day in the White House, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum freezing hiring of federal civilian employees, which he extended to July 15. Positions that were vacant as of his inauguration at noon on Jan. 20 should also not be filled, he said.",
      "The order was part of his plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce, also a recommendation made in the Project 2025 policy roadmap.",
      "The book, though, warns that while \"reducing the number of federal employees seems an obvious way to reduce the overall expense of the civil service,\" prior attempts to do so by presidents of both parties \"did not lead to permanent and substantive reductions in the number of nondefense federal employees.\"",
      "Instead, Project 2025 suggests a \"freeze on all top career-position hiring to prevent 'burrowing-in' by outgoing political appointees.\"",
      "Withdrawing from World Health Organization",
      "Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization in 2020 due to what his first administration said was a mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden reversed that decision when he took office, and Mr. Trump rolled back that move on his first day back in the White House.",
      "His latest order directed the secretary of state to inform the secretary-general of the United States and World Health Organization leadership of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the group. Health officials in the U.S. and around the world have warned the move will leave people at greater risk of dangerous outbreaks and give China a more dominant role at the World Health Organization.",
      "Project 2025, too, criticized the World Health Organization for its handling of the pandemic.",
      "\"The manifest failure and corruption of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the danger that international organizations pose to U.S. citizens and interests,\" its book states.",
      "It said that when institutions act contrary to U.S. interests, the government \"must be prepared to take appropriate steps in response, up to and including withdrawal.\"",
      "Sending active-duty troops to the southern border",
      "Immigration was the topic of several executive actions taken by Mr. Trump on the first day of his presidency, including one order that assigns troops \"the mission to seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of the United States.\"",
      "The chapter of Project 2025's blueprint that covers the Department of Homeland Security was authored by Ken Cuccinelli, who served in the first Trump administration, and it, too, sees a role for the Defense Department in securing the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The Pentagon, Cucinelli writes, should \"explicitly acknowledge and adjust personnel and priorities to participate actively in the defense, including using military personnel and hardware to prevent illegal crossings between ports of entry and channel all cross-border traffic to legal ports of entry.\"",
      "A section on the Justice Department urges the next administration to \"take a creative and aggressive approach\" to tackling criminal organizations at the southern border.",
      "\"This could include use of active-duty military personnel and National Guardsmen to assist in arrest operations along the border \u2014 something that has not yet been done,\" Project 2025's chapter on the Justice Department states.",
      "Limiting refugee admissions",
      "Entry into the U.S. by refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program was suspended earlier this year in accordance with an order by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20. His directive also orders the secretary of Homeland Security to suspend decisions on applications for refugee status.",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed that during the Biden administration, the U.S. has been \"inundated\" with high levels of migration, including through the Refugee Admissions Program.",
      "Project 2025, too, blames the Biden administration for overseeing what it says was a \"collapse\" of U.S. border security and immigration enforcement. To address this \"crisis,\" Project 2025 calls for \"rightsizing refugee admissions.\"",
      "\"The federal government's obligation to shift national security\u2013essential screening and vetting resources to the forged border crisis will necessitate an indefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP refugee admissions,\" its chapter on the State Department reads.",
      "The policy book calls for the State Department bureau that administers the Refugee Admissions Program to shift resources to challenges \"until the crisis can be contained and refugee-focused screening and vetting capacity can reasonably be restored.\"",
      "Rescinding temporary protected status designations",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, his administration has moved to end the Temporary Protected Status program for Haitians and Venezuelans.",
      "The TPS designation was created by Congress in 1990, and it allows the federal government to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants from countries facing war, environmental disasters or other crises that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program allows beneficiaries to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "A federal judge in late March agreed to delay the Trump administration's attempt to end the TPS program that shields roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants, and a federal appeals court declined to pause that order while proceedings continue.",
      "Project 2025 calls on Congress to \"repeal temporary protected status designations.\"",
      "Capping indirect costs for university-based research",
      "The National Institutes of Health announced in a February memo that it would be capping the amount of funding for \"indirect costs\" at 15%, a cut from an average of between 27% and 28%. Indirect costs cover general expenses like facilities and administration.",
      "NIH said in its memo that it has spent billions on indirect costs for more than 2,500 universities, medical schools and other research institutions across the country, and noted that \"most private foundations that fund research provide substantially lower indirect costs than the federal government, and universities readily accept grants from these foundations.\"",
      "Project 2025 also focused on indirect costs and called on Congress to \"cap the indirect cost rate paid to universities so that it does not exceed the lowest rate a university accepts from a private organization to fund search efforts.\"",
      "\"This market-based reform would help reduce federal taxpayer subsidization of leftist agendas,\" the policy book read.",
      "While Project 2025 said it is up to Congress to cap the indirect cost rate, the Trump administration took this step unilaterally, prompting legal challenges from universities, states and organizations that represent medical colleges and schools.",
      "Universities and the NIH said the cuts will have a \"dire impact\" on lifesaving research, including clinical trials for cancer and Alzheimer's patients.",
      "Requiring disclosures of foreign gifts to universities",
      "As part of a series of executive orders addressing the education system, Mr. Trump issued a directive on April 23 that directs the education secretary to enforce a provision of the Higher Education Act that requires higher education institutions that receive federal dollars to disclose any gifts of contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year.",
      "The move is also part of Project 2025, which calls on the next administration to enforce that statute, investigate higher education institutions that do not honor the obligations laid out in the law and make \"appropriate referrals\" to the Justice Department.",
      "Asserting the president's power to remove federal officials",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to fire the members of independent agencies and inspectors general, despite federal laws that lay out the grounds for their removals.",
      "The terminations have sparked multiple court fights that appear aimed at asserting what the Trump administration believes is the president's unrestricted power to remove executive branch officials. But a 90-year-old Supreme Court decision, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "In a February letter to Congress, then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said the Justice Department \"intends to urge the Supreme Court to overrule that decision, which prevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the executive branch who execute the laws on the president's behalf, and which has already been severely eroded by recent Supreme Court decisions.\"",
      "Project 2025, too, suggested the next Republican presidential administration should seek the reversal of Humphrey's Executor.",
      "\"The next conservative administration should formally take the position that Humphrey's Executor violates the Constitution's separation of powers,\" it states.",
      "Targeting NOAA",
      "Project 2025's policy book calls for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, known as NOAA, to be \"dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.\"",
      "The guide says NOAA's six main components should either be downsized or broken up, including Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, or OAR, which Project 2025 claims is the \"source of much of NOAA's climate alarmism.\"",
      "The Trump administration has proposed sweeping changes and job cuts for NOAA, including a 25% cut to its 2026 budget, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News in April. The proposal calls for OAR to be eliminated as an office, as well as funding for climate, weather and ocean laboratories, cooperative institutes and other programs.",
      "Current and former officials with NOAA have said the memo's objectives are \"devastating,\" and have argued that research is crucial to improving services such as severe weather forecasts\u00a0for the public.",

    "summary": "A majority of Latino voters disapprove of Trump's handling of the economy.",
    "story": [
      "In 2024, President Trump made historic inroads with the Latino community. But as the Trump administration reaches the 100-day mark, polling finds dissatisfaction among registered Latino voters who disapprove of Mr. Trump's handling of the economy, according to a bipartisan poll testing where Hispanic voters stand on key issues.",
      "Among Latino voters, 60% believe the country is heading in the wrong direction. Only 19% indicated they feel the U.S. economy is \"better\" compared to 2024, and looking ahead to next year, 29% of Latino voters believe the economic policies currently being implemented will make them better.",
      "The state of the economy ranks as Latino voters' number one priority, with the cost of living, jobs, housing costs and healthcare among the top concerns. Of those polled, 60% believe Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans are not focusing enough attention on bringing down costs of everyday goods, and 66% believe tariffs \u2014 a core part of Mr. Trump's agenda \u2014 will reduce their economic opportunity and security by raising the prices for goods and services.",
      "Three of the country's largest Latino organizations \u2014 UnidosUS, Voces Unidos and LULAC \u2014 along with advocacy group Climate Power, released the findings, which polled 1,002 Hispanic registered voters. The survey involved pollsters Matt A. Barreto, who conducted polling for Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign, and Daron R. Shaw, a University of Texas pollster who worked on George W. Bush campaigns and is now behind Fox News' polls.",
      "\"Latino voters are frustrated that their economic priorities are being ignored and that a key promise made by President Trump during the election is not being kept,\" said UnidosUS President Janet Murgu\u00eda. \"Economic discontent was the most potent driver in the 2024 election, helping President Trump increase support among Latinos.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made significant gains among Latino voters last year. Just 53% of Latino voters backed Harris, compared to the 65% won by former President Joe Biden in 2020, according to exit polling data. Some 54% of Latino men voted for Mr. Trump, with the economy ranking as their top issue.",
      "Aside from the economy, according to Murgu\u00eda, deportations are contributing to the overall negative sentiment. The majority of Latinos polled support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. for a long time or who were brought into the country as children. Some 78% said they believe it's important to deport dangerous criminals but Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans should not target long-residing undocumented immigrants without criminal records.",
      "Of those polled, 43% said they fear immigration authorities will arrest them even if they're U.S. citizens or have legal status.",
      "According to the latest CBS News poll released Sunday, Mr. Trump continues to get majority approval for his deportation program among all Americans, but 56% of Hispanic voters disapprove. Some 81% of respondents say it is not acceptable if legal U.S. residents are mistakenly deported, including 84% of Hispanic respondents.",
      "While there is dissatisfaction with the current administration and Republicans in Congress, Barreto and Shaw indicate there is room for both parties to work on improving trust among the Latino community. When asked to describe the party's attitude toward Latinos, 35% said Democrats \"don't care too much\" and 37% said the same for Republicans, according to Barreto and Shaw's poll.",
      "\"We identified this particular finding as a message for both political parties to be able to position themselves so that they actually look like they care about the Hisapnic community,\" said Barreto.",
      "As for policies floated during Mr. Trump's first 100 days, Latinos showed support for requiring proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections and renewing 2017 tax cuts that lower federal income tax rates for those making less than $200,000 a year.",
      "Latino voters largely opposed allowing federal enforcement of immigration laws in public schools, and granting Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to tax identification numbers used by undocumented immigrants to pay taxes for the purposes of mass deportations.",
      "\"Our poll confirms that with the polarized electorate and slim margins in Congress, neither party can afford to ignore or take for granted the Latino vote,\" said Murgu\u00eda. \"Doing the work to understand and meaningfully engage this increasing and critically important electorate must be a priority.\"",
      "Looking ahead to 2026's midterm elections, Republicans are in trouble if the economy does not show major improvement and Latinos continue to live in fear over deportations, according to the pollsters behind the findings. The warning signs for the Democratic party, however, also lie in the 60% of Latino voters who said they believe Democrats should fight hard against the Trump administration and his policies.",

      "Food and Drug Administration officials have told some scientists and inspections staff that their layoffs will be reversed, after the job cuts led to disruptions in drug and food safety work.",
      "The move marks a significant reversal of a portion of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs. Kennedy initially planned to cut 3,500 employees from the FDA.",
      "In team-wide meetings that started last week, multiple FDA employees said they were informed by their supervisors that they should expect to have their layoffs reversed.",
      "Among the laid-off staff told they would be brought back are scientists for drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit as well as food safety labs\u00a0in Chicago and San Francisco. A handful of support staff for the FDA's inspectors are also being brought back.",
      "Multiple FDA scientists said they were eager to go back to work, though they had yet to receive official paperwork for reversing the layoffs.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the FDA's food safety labs were being reinstated.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services blamed errors in the layoffs on inaccurate data from the department's \"siloed HR divisions.\"",
      "\"This is exactly why HHS is reorganizing its administrative functions to streamline operations and fix the broken systems left to us by the Biden Administration. Streamlining this into one operation will allow for enhanced data integrity and coordination,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said some layoffs would be walked back, like to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's lead poisoning teams. But that reversal never ended up happening, leaving the agency's lead poisoning work largely abandoned.",

      "FDA inspections falling behind",
      "Around two dozen of the support staff for the FDA's inspectors have been told their layoffs would be reversed, out of nearly 200 who were cut. The employees being restored are focused on booking travel for foreign inspections.",
      "Cuts to the FDA's Office of Inspections and Investigations have taken a steep toll on the agency's inspections, especially for overseas manufacturers of drugs and food products.",
      "A pilot program started under the Biden administration to expand unannounced foreign inspections stalled due to the cuts, multiple officials said. In a recent week, one FDA official said less than 60% of the agency's planned foreign inspections had been completed.",
      "Sidelined inspectors of foreign firms have been asked to find ways to \"pivot to\" local inspections they can do within the U.S. instead, according to internal emails shared with CBS News. More than $700,000 of expenses incurred by inspectors have also yet to be paid, an official said, due to the layoffs to support staff.",
      "Hopes by FDA leaders to increase inspections have also run up against an ongoing federal hiring freeze, officials said, especially as the ranks of supervisors for inspectors have been depleted by early retirements and resignations.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary had initially greenlighted a plan to use contractors to fill the gap, before the department moved to reverse some of the layoffs.",
      "FDA drug safety work stalls",
      "Multiple current and laid-off FDA employees said the abrupt layoffs had resulted in delays and disruptions to the agency's drug safety work. Virtually all the scientists in the FDA's San Juan and Detroit labs were cut, leaving only labs in New York and Irvine, California.",
      "The FDA labs in Detroit and San Juan had also been responsible for checking the shelf life of medical treatments stockpiled by the federal government for the military and pandemics, under a program administered by the Department of Defense.",
      "The layoffs also cut chemists based out of the labs who worked as foreign inspectors for the FDA, often assigned to travel with badge-carrying investigators to help with more complex or urgent frontline inspections of drugmakers.",

      "Tuesday will mark 100 days in office for Mr. Trump. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president will sign two executive orders on Monday to empower law enforcement to pursue criminals and to publish a list of U.S. jurisdictions \"that obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration laws.\"",

Homan told Brennan that due process was afforded, saying that U.S. citizens are not deported, but rather, their parents were given the choice to take their children.",
      "A recent CBS News poll found 56% of respondents approved of the Trump administration's program to deport immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally.

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:39:24 -0400",
    "summary": "A large brood of periodical cicadas is due to emerge in the spring of 2025. These maps show where people should expect to see and hear the bugs this year.",
    "story": [
      "Cicadas are poised to return at some point in the spring of 2025, potentially bringing billions of bugs to neighborhoods across the eastern United States.",
      "The group of cicadas set to appear has been labeled Brood XIV. Emerging once every 17 years, Brood XIV is the second-largest group of periodical cicadas \u2014 which rise from underground en masse \u2014 and will be the only group this spring. That means\u00a0there will likely be fewer cicadas\u00a0above ground than there were in 2024, when\u00a0multiple broods of cicadas\u00a0emerged at the same time.",
      "Where will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "Cicadas this year will likely be concentrated in Kentucky and much of Tennessee. The insects from Brood XIV are also expected to show up in parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, in addition to smaller pockets farther north in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, central Pennsylvania and Long Island, New York.",
      "CBS News' data team created an interactive map that shows where cicadas are expected to be this year. The map uses information from the University of Connecticut's Cicada Project, which plots the brood's spread based on its known locations in the past.",
      "When will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "The huge groups of cicadas emerge when the soil reaches about 64 degrees Fahrenheit, according to University of Connecticut researchers. In warmer states, cicadas usually come out in late April or May. In cooler states, their arrival tends to occur in May or early June.",
      "How long will cicadas be above ground?",
      "Researchers say cicadas typically remain in a given area for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Most individual cicadas live for just a few weeks, but, since the emergence itself happens over two weeks, their eventual fading will also be staggered.",
      "What are cicadas?",
      "Cicadas are a type of insect, related to stink bugs, bed buds and aphids. The ones expected to arrive in droves this year are a variety called periodical cicadas, which appear in huge swarms and often create loud buzzing sounds, according to the National Wildlife Federation. Annual cicadas exist as well.",
      "Periodical cicadas have earned a reputation across eastern North America because of their conspicuous recurrence. Individual \"broods\" are biologically synchronized to crop up simultaneously in 13- or 17-year intervals, when they rise from their burrows underground in populations that can reach up to the trillions. Between intervals, they live in soil as larvae and feed on fluids from plant roots, the wildlife federation explains.",
      "There are three species of cicadas that emerge every 17 years, and four species that materialize every 13 years, according to researchers at the University of Connecticut. When cicadas share the same emergence year, they're considered part of a brood.",

      "Active periodical cicada broods in the U.S.",
      "Select a brood:",
      "Why do cicadas make noise?",
      "The noise people often hear from cicadas is a mating tactic, according to the wildlife foundation, which notes that male cicadas tend to crowd together and produce raucous choruses in efforts to attract females. Once the mating process has ended, female cicadas deposit their eggs in tree branches. When they hatch, the larvae fall to the ground, burrow into the soil, and the cycle starts again.",

    "summary": "A notably large brood of periodical cicadas will emerge from the underground across parts of the eastern U.S. this spring.",
    "story": [
      "A massive brood of periodical cicadas will emerge soon across the eastern United States, with the notoriously raucous springtime insects due for their 2025 appearance.",
      "Known for their buzzing hordes and ability to rapidly infiltrate the environments where they show up, cicadas are expected to swarm parts of Kentucky and Tennessee\u00a0this year, while arriving in smaller quantities in various places along the East Coast, from Massachusetts and New York down to western Georgia.",
      "Here's what to know about the infamous creatures.",
      "What are periodical cicadas?",
      "Periodical cicadas are moderately sized bugs with red eyes and translucent wings, usually measuring about an inch long with a wider wingspan. They are sometimes mistakenly associated with locusts, like grasshoppers, but cicadas are actually an entirely different sort of insect, part of the same family as stink bugs and bedbugs.",
      "The synchronized behavior of periodical cicadas is their most defining characteristic. Compared with annual cicadas, which appear in generally modest amounts each summer, periodical cicadas emerge in the spring and essentially rise from the ground in unison, in either 13-year or 17-year intervals. Cicadas that emerge on the same schedule are called a brood, and each is labeled using Roman numerals.",
      "This year, the group belongs to Brood XIV, the second-largest brood of periodical cicadas known to scientists, according to the University of Connecticut. Researchers with the university's Cicada Project note that, while they cannot technically know with certainty where a particular brood is going to emerge next, its last known locations during previous emergence events usually provide valuable insights. Because periodical cicadas typically lay their eggs in or near the areas where they've just emerged, the next generation of broods tend to emerge themselves in similar places.",
      "Cicada map predicts where they will emerge in 2025",
      "Based on University of Connecticut research, CBS News' data team created an interactive map that charts the expected spread of Brood XIV, which last arose 17 years ago and is the only brood emerging in 2025.",
      "The map shows the cicadas primarily concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee, in addition to parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Farther north, the brood is also expected to take shape in smaller pockets, in Cape Cod, Massachusetts; Long Island, New York; and central Pennsylvania.",
      "When will Brood XIV emerge?",
      "The brood will emerge before the end of spring on June 21, but cicadas' arrivals in different parts of the U.S. will likely vary.",
      "Cicada expert Matthew Kasson told CBS News in 2024 that\u00a0the exact timing of a brood's emergence\u00a0is linked to the temperature of the soil they're in before moving above ground. Kasson said cicadas are prompted to exit the soil when it reaches 64 degrees, so groups within the larger brood may travel to the surface sooner than others in cooler locations.",
      "What do cicadas do?",
      "The life cycles of periodical cicadas are closely tied to how and where they emerge. Before a brood materializes on land, each of its members \u2014 sometimes trillions of them \u2014 exist underground as larvae, subsiding on fluids from plant roots, according to the National Wildlife Federation. They live in those conditions for 13 or 17 years, depending on their brood. Then, almost all at once, the insects burrow upward and break through the surface of the soil, often making their presence known by erupting in loud and at times constant choruses.",
      "Conspicuous noises from cicada swarms are a mating tactic, the wildlife federation writes, as the male insects gather in groups and create loud sounds to attract females. The mating process begins within a few days of cicadas emerging. When it ends, the females cut shallow grooves into tree branches and lay their eggs inside. Researchers at Arizona State University say\u00a0those eggs usually hatch\u00a0within 8 weeks, and newly born cicadas fall from the branches down to the ground. Called nymphs at that point, the young bugs proceed to dig their way back underneath the soil, where they remain until it's time to emerge again.",
      "Adult cicadas typically remain above ground in a given location for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Researchers note that most of the individual insects live for less time, but that window accounts for some degree of staggering when the brood emerges, since that happens over a period of about two weeks.",
      "Are cicadas dangerous?",
      "Cicadas are not dangerous to humans or pets, experts say. They don't bite or sting and they aren't poisonous or venomous.",
      "\"If dogs or cats eat many cicadas, this may temporarily cause an upset stomach or vomiting, but there is no need to worry if a pet eats a small number of cicadas,\" the Environmental Protection Agency says.",
      "They are also largely beneficial to the ecosystem. They are a food source for birds and other predators that eat insects. They can aerate soil, and when they decompose, they provide nutrients that can help trees grow.",
      "Cicadas may harm young trees, which can be protected with mesh or netting. They don't eat leaves, flowers, fruits or garden produce, the EPA says.",

      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",

In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",

      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",

      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",
      "According to the new procedural guidelines issued by the agency this week, companies seeking a permit are required to confirm in writing that they want their project covered by the expedited process \u2014 meaning that not everyone will necessarily opt in. Those that do could stand to lose big, Manuel said.",

      "The satellite, named Biomass, launched with a rocket from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, New Guinea, and separated from the rocket less than an hour after launch,\u00a0 the ESA said in a news release. About 75 minutes after the launch, ESA satellite controllers received Biomass' first signal, indicating that the satellite is working as expected in orbit.",
      "Over the next few days, controllers will carry out the satellite's \"launch and early orbit\" phase, making sure that all systems are working well, the ESA said, and the satellite will make a \"series of intricate maneuvers\" to deploy a nearly 40-foot-wide mesh reflector. That reflector will receive data from the world's forests, the ESA said.",
      "Forests on Earth collectively absorb and store about 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, the ESA said. That regulates the planet's temperature. Deforestation and degradation, especially in tropical regions, means that stored carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, the ESA said, which can contribute to climate change. There's a lack of accurate data on how much carbon the planet's estimated 1.5 trillion trees store and how much human activity can impact that storage, the ESA said.",
      "To \"weigh\" the planet's trees and determine their carbon dioxide capacity, Biomass will use a P-band synthetic aperture radar. It's the first such piece of technology in space. The radar can penetrate forest canopies and measure woody biomass, including trunks, branches and stems, the ESA said. Most forest carbon is stored in these parts of the trees. Those measurements will act as a proxy for carbon storage, the ESA said.",
      "\"With Biomass, we are poised to gain vital new data on how much carbon is stored in the world's forests, helping to fill key gaps in our knowledge of the carbon cycle and, ultimately, Earth's climate system,\" said Simonetta Cheli, the ESA's director of Earth observation programs.",
      "Once the radar takes the measurements, the data will be received by the large mesh reflector. It will then be sent to the ESA's mission control center.",
      "The satellite is currently over the Amazon, one of several rainforests it will study, according to CBS News partner BBC News.",
      "The satellite's tools can be used in other environments, the ESA said, including mapping \"subsurface geology in deserts, ice sheet structures, and forest floor topography.\"",

    "story": [
      "A group of students accused of being involved in an apparent hazing scheme in upstate New York have turned themselves in after they were given 48 hours to do so or else face kidnapping charges for the incident, which authorities say targeted younger members of the Westhill High School boys lacrosse team.",
      "Eleven students who allegedly played a part in the event turned themselves in on Wednesday, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said. The district attorney previously told CBS News that the deadline for the perpetrators to turn themselves in was \"close of business Thursday.\"",
      "\"This is criminal activity, and this is hazing on steroids,\" Fitzpatrick said Tuesday during a news conference, noting it \"could have resulted in such tragedy.\"",
      "An attorney representing the 11 students said in a statement to CBS News late Wednesday night that the \"young men deeply regret their involvement in what began as a misguided attempt at a prank. They recognize that their actions were inappropriate, and do not minimize the fear and distress experienced by the other students.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick said his office and the county sheriff's department are working together to prosecute the case, after the sheriff received a call from the high school's resource officer reporting that a newer member of the boys lacrosse team had been tied up and thrown into the back of a teammate's vehicle. The incident seemed to be an example of hazing or, if not, some sort of extreme prank, Fitzpatrick said.",
      "Older lacrosse players allegedly set up their plot by arranging an evening out with five younger members of the Westhill team, Fitzpatrick said, which was supposed to include watching a lacrosse game and picking up food from McDonald's. An older player was driving the younger ones and pretended to get lost in an isolated section of the county, where a group of accomplices emerged in masks and black clothing, imitating an abduction with at least one gun and one knife, according to the district attorney.",
      "All of the younger players escaped except for one, whose hands were tied while a pillowcase was placed over his head, and he was thrown into the trunk of the car, Fitzpatrick said.",
      "\"I could imagine a deputy coming upon a scene, seeing a kid with a hood over his head being abducted at gunpoint by a series of individuals all dressed in black and masked,\" he said. \"If that individual opened fire, you know, would that be outside the realm of possibility? I think the opposite would be true.\"",
      "No injuries have been reported in connection with the incident, and the perpetrators returned the student to his home at the end of the night, Fitzpatrick said. Citing a video, he said authorities believe 11 people, who appear to be on the boys lacrosse team, carried out the scheme and urged them to come forward in order to avoid facing kidnapping charges and being tried as adults. The identities or exact ages of the people involved have not been released.",
      "\"I have seen the videotape of what happened to this young man. It is not a rite of passage. It is not a trivial matter,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I don't know how long this young man will be affected by what happened to him. Frankly, I find it incomprehensible that in this day and age somebody could have thought that they would have gotten away with something like this.\"",
      "After the 11 people turned themselves in, Fitzpatrick said he would not be releasing the video at this time.",
      "No charges had been filed as of Tuesday. The district attorney previously said that those who choose to turn themselves in will likely avoid criminal records and face prosecution in family court instead. A representative for the school district told CBS News in a statement that it is cooperating with law enforcement's investigation.",
      "\"We are aware of the District Attorney's statement and are continuing to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation,\" Lisa O'Reilly, president of the Westhill Central School District's board of education, said in a statement to CBS News. \"At this time, the District has no additional information to share.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court\u00a0on Wednesday appeared divided over efforts in Oklahoma to create an online Catholic charter school, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools.",
      "A ruling in favor of the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, could lead to the country's first religious charter school and upend laws in at least 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has warned.",
      "Eight of the nine justices are considering the case, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself. Following arguments, it seemed likely that the outcome hinges on Chief Justice John Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in its charter school program during the arguments. If the Supreme Court deadlocks 4-4, it would leave intact the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which ruled that the contract establishing St. Isidore's as a Catholic charter school was a violation of state and federal law.",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh appeared most sympathetic to St. Isidore's argument that excluding it from Oklahoma's charter school system unconstitutionally discriminated against the school.",
      "Kavanuagh said religious institutions can't be treated as \"second class\" and said keeping sectarian schools from operating charter schools, when the program is open to nonreligious private entities, seems like \"rank discrimination\" based on religion.",
      "\"They're not asking for special treatment. They're not asking for favoritism. They're just saying don't treat us worse because we're religious,\" he said of the school.",
      "But the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, seemed concerned that a decision allowing the religious charter school would weaken the wall between church and state.",
      "\"The state is running these schools,\" Kagan said. Jackson said charter schools are \"a creation and creature of the state.\"",
      "But there was some concern about how a ruling allowing St. Isidore's to be established as a religious charter school would impact the systems in other states, and specifically the level of oversight and control over them. Justice Neil Gorsuch warned such a result could lead states to impose more requirements on charter schools, such as mandating public officials to serve on their boards and boosting state involvement in their creation.",
      "\"Have you thought about that boomerang effect?\" he asked James Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which joined St. Isidore's in the case.",
      "A decision will follow the Supreme Court's three\u00a0rulings in recent years that were in favor of religious plaintiffs, which all allowed public funds to be used for religious institutions.",
      "\"This would really be the first time that the Supreme Court sanctions, if it rules in favor of the charter school, the direct flow of funds from the government and financial support from the government to a religious entity for religious activities,\" said Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who focuses on the law and religion.",
      "St. Isidore, she said, is asking the state to \"quite literally establish a religious school. It's essentially making a religious school, creating an affiliation between the religious entity and the state that we haven't seen before.\"",
      "But backers of St. Isidore argue that its position is simply an application of those decisions and would not create any new principles.",
      "\"The unifying thread is the idea that once the government decides to open up a program and to distribute benefits or to contract with people, it can't single out religious people or institutions for special disadvantage,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who directs its Program on Church, State and Society.",
      "The formation of a Catholic charter school",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like at least 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation, according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond warned against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an earlier analysis from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Drummond also warned that approving St. Isidore's application to become a charter school \"will create a slippery slope.\"",
      "\"I doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a religious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own faith,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approval of a charter school by one faith will compel the approval of charter schools by all faiths, including even those most Oklahomans would consider reprehensible and unworthy of public funding.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "\"The state will be directly funding a religious school and encouraging students to attend it,\" the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which split 6-2, found.",
      "The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore's both asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so in January.",
      "A \"major breach\" in the wall",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in a string of recent decisions sided with religious families and institutions that challenged state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "In 2017, the court said that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said Maine cannot limit a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "Citing those decisions, Roberts said the programs at issue in Missouri, Montana and Maine were also creations and creatures of the state. But he also said they involved \"fairly discrete\" state involvement, as opposed to the \"much more comprehensive involvement\" of Oklahoma in funding and overseeing its charter schools.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Drummond argued that the justices have drawn a clear line through those decisions: If the state offers tuition assistance that parents can direct to the school of their choosing, it cannot exclude religious private schools. But when it comes to public schools, he said, states can provide a secular education.",
      "Drummond said the Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution's Establishment Clause allows \"direct aid for religious instruction in public schools,\" and added that creating and funding a religious public school would violate that provision of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Religious education is an invaluable benefit for millions of Americans who choose it,\" Drummond wrote. \"But our Constitution has never required the creation of religious public schools. There is no basis to change that now.\"",
      "He warned that if the Supreme Court rules for St. Isidore, \"state funds will pour into religious public charter schools just as they do traditional public schools,\" and the firewall between public funds flowing to a school because of private choice versus a direct subsidy would be damaged.",
      "\"A ruling for petitioners would eliminate the buffer this court has long enforced between religious instruction and public schools \u2014 including in areas where charter schools are the only or default public-school option,\" Drummond argued, noting that the issue is direct aid.",
      "A crucial question in the court fight is whether Oklahoma's charter schools are public schools.",
      "Drummond says they are, because the state's charter schools have to comply with anti-discrimination laws; they are free, open to all students, created and funded by the state, and are subject to government regulation and oversight regarding curriculum, testing and other issues. And because charter schools are public schools, the attorney general said they are government entities.",
      "Gregory Garre, who argued on behalf of Drummond, said that St. Isidore's is seeking special status compared to secular charter schools, because it said it can only comply with laws that are consistent with its constitutional rights as a religious school under the direction of the Catholic Church.",
      "He warned that a decision in favor of the school would render the laws in nearly all states and the federal charter school program unconstitutional because they all require charter schools to be nonsectarian.",
      "Such an outcome would \"create uncertainty, confusion and disruption\" for the millions of charter school students across the country.",
      "He warned that allowing religious institutions to participate in state charter school systems would open the door to more litigation over issues like who can be admitted, who can teach at the schools and over their curriculum.",
      "But lawyers for the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore disagree. Backing them in the case are Oklahoma's GOP governor, Kevin Stitt, and the state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters.",
      "The board and school said St. Isidore is a privately operated school providing free publicly funded education through a contract with the state, and the Free Exercise Clause protects its right to participate in the charter school program.",
      "\"The state did not design the school. It did not create or encourage St. Isidore's religious character. It did not appoint any member of St. Isidore's board. It did not instruct the school to offer an education in the Catholic tradition. And it will not hire or supervise the school's teachers and administrators,\" lawyers for St. Isidore wrote in a filing.",
      "Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, told the justices that St. Isidore's was created not by the state, but by two Catholic organizations, and it's controlled by a privately selected board of directors.",
      "The restrictions in state law, lawyers for St. Isidore's and the charter school board said, amount to unconstitutional religious discrimination because Oklahoma is excluding religious observers from otherwise available public benefits and programs. And because the state's charter school program is neutrally administered, the Establishment Clause doesn't prevent public dollars from flowing to religious schools.",
      "\"This is particularly true when private choice directs government dollars to religious schools,\" they said.",
      "Garnett, of Notre Dame Law School, said that public money would only go to St. Isidore if a parent made the choice to send their child to the virtual school.",
      "\"If the court thinks that what Oklahoma has done is create a program that private entities are eligible to participate in, then it's straightforward to say once they do that, they can't discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said.",
      "But professor Hill, like Drummond, said charter schools are public schools, and warned there's always been a line where the Supreme Court did not allow the direct flow of government funds to religious schools for religious instruction. She said the case is part of a progression that began with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling and comes as traditional public schools are being starved of resources in many states.",
      "\"The agenda has been to require, not just allow, direct government funding of religious schools in particular,\" she said. \"Vouchers are one thing, but I do think it's a major breach in the wall of separation if the charter school wins.\"",
      "Barrett's recusal from the case could create a situation in which the Supreme Court renders a 4-4 decision, leaving the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling intact. She did not provide a reason for her stepping aside, though it may be because the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Clinic is representing St. Isidore.",
      "Barrett taught at Notre Dame before she was appointed to the federal bench and was an adjunct professor at the law school in 2023, according to her most recent financial disclosure report. Barrett is also close friends with Nicole Stelle Garnett, an associate dean at Notre Dame Law School who authored a paper that suggested that as a result of a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause.",

    "summary": "An effort aimed at blocking President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in the Senate fell short Wednesday, with Senate Republicans largely united in opposition.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An effort aimed at blocking President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in the Senate amid anxiety over how the wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy fell short on Wednesday, with Senate Republicans largely united in their opposition.",
      "In a 49 to 49 vote, all but three Republicans opposed the measure, in a victory for the White House and GOP leadership in the Senate as the party seeks to remain united on the issue. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, did not vote.",
      "\"Senator Whitehouse is on his way back from representing the United States at the Our Ocean summit, where he was the sole American official,\" a spokesperson for the Senator said in a statement explaining his absence. \"The Senator expressed America's continued support for the Blue Economy, climate solutions, fisheries, and maritime security, even as the Trump administration cedes leadership on the oceans to the rest of the world.\"",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, would terminate the April 2 national emergency that the president is using to impose the tariffs, effectively blocking the sweeping levies on foreign imports. Along with Paul, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Democrats and independents in support of the measure, falling short of the majority needed for passage.",
      "The measure almost certainly wouldn't have been taken up in the GOP-controlled House, making the vote largely a symbolic one.",
      "The vote came after the president on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of other countries. Days later, as investors appeared spooked, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, keeping the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China.",
      "Wyden told CBS News ahead of the vote of the measure's chances that \"this is a choice for senators.\"",
      "\"They've been home and they've heard from their constituents, like small businesses, that are getting clobbered by these tariffs,\" Wyden said. \"If they're going to listen to their constituents, we'll get their support, and if they're more concerned about Donald Trump being mean to them, they'll go with opposition.\"",
      "Paul admonished his fellow Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Wednesday, saying \"this should not be a partisan issue\" and noting that \"Congress didn't debate these tariffs, Congress didn't vote to enact these tariffs \u2014 the tariffs are simply imposed by presidential fiat",
      "\"If Americans are to live under this emergency rule, it will not be because the president sought too much power,\" Paul said. \"It will be because Congress let it happen.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Senate approved another resolution to block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, which fall under an earlier national emergency. At the time, four Republicans joined all Democrats and independents to support the measure \u2014 Murkowski, Collins and McConnell, along with Paul. The House did not vote on the measure.",
      "Mr. Trump had put pressure on Senate Republicans to oppose the measure, calling out the senators expected to support it by name. But those senators held fast in their opposition.",
      "Ahead of the vote this time around, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Vice President JD Vance joined the conference during their launch meeting on Tuesday, where senators said Greer told them the administration is making progress on trade deals.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Earlier this month, Republicans included in a key piece of legislation a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block the tariffs announced on April 2, after also doing so with the earlier tariffs. And any measure to roll back the tariffs would need the president's signature, leaving opponents in Congress with little likelihood of reining in his levies.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that it isn't appropriate for Congress to \"jump in\" a handful of weeks into the administration's tariff policy, saying at an Axios event that \"the executive has a broad array of authority that's been recognized over the years\" on trade. But he suggested limited openness to stepping in down the road.",
      "\"If it gets close to where the imbalance is there, then we would step in,\" Johnson said, while adding that the first step would be for him to call the president to discuss the concerns. \"But right now I think ultimately this policy is going to achieve the desired outcome and it's going to be good for the country, and so we're applauding that.\"",
      "Still, anxieties continued to run high over the economic impact of the tariffs. And economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2025, the Commerce Department reported in its estimate of the nation's gross domestic product Wednesday.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday following the GDP report that \"the tariff issue is one that's probably going to take some time to realize the results and the benefits from.\"",
      "\"Overall, the things we're going to be doing to support a healthy economy, on taxes and regulations and energy, are going to have a positive impact long term,\" Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said. \"The tariff issue is something that's, like I said, it's an open question, but we're giving them some space to negotiate and see if they can get some good deals.\"",

      "The nation's gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of products and services \u2014 shrank at a 0.3% annual rate, down from growth of 2.4% in the final three months of 2024, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday in its initial GDP estimate. It's the worst quarterly performance for the U.S. economy since early 2022, when the economy was in recovery after cratering during the COVID pandemic.",
      "The U.S. economy was forecast to show 0.8% growth in the first three months of 2025, according to the average estimate of economists polled by FactSet.",
      "The slowdown comes amid growing concerns that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy, with some economists raising the chances of the U.S.\u00a0slipping into a recession in 2025. Although the Trump administration's blanket tariffs were announced on April 2 \u2014 after the end of the quarter \u2014 businesses sought to get ahead of the impact of the import duties by front-loading purchases early in the year.",
      "The report may not fully reflect the state of economic growth, economists cautioned, noting that the figures are likely to be noisy because of the surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs. A rise in imports may appear to lower economic growth and show a shift away from domestic consumption, but that doesn't tell the whole story, economists note.",
      "Nevertheless, concerns about the tariffs caused businesses and consumers to change their behavior at year start, signaling that the rollout of steep import fees could create headwinds for the economy later in 2025, experts said.",

      "Economists expect the U.S. economy to slow in 2025, partly due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which are import duties paid by American companies like Walmart or Target.

    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",

      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",

      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",
      "The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school.",
      "The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount \u2014 $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently \u2014 before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college.",
      "The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.",

      "However, Amazon pushed back on the report, saying in a Tuesday statement to CBS News that its Amazon Haul store \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\" Amazon Haul was introduced late last year by the e-commerce giant to sell low-cost goods to compete with Temu and Shein.",

Tariffs are import duties that are paid by U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, which typically pass on the added fee to consumers in the form of higher costs.",
      "The duties are already making foreign-made goods more expensive for U.S.-based consumers.",
      "Earlier this month, data showed that\u00a0Amazon sellers had already hiked prices on nearly 1,000 of the top 100,000 selling products on the site, according to SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike was about 30%.",
      "At the time, Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement earlier this month to CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Ukrainian and U.S. officials have signed a joint economic investment deal that includes granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare earths minerals, the Treasury Department\u00a0announced Wednesday.",
      "A Treasury Department press release said the two countries have agreed to establish a \"United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund,\" referring to it as an \"economic partnership.\" The statement did not include more detail about the agreement.",
      "Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economic development minister, confirmed that she signed the deal. In a series of posts on X written in Ukrainian, she described it as a 50/50 partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine that includes development of\u00a0mineral, oil and gas projects. She said the deal would be funded through direct investment, future U.S. aid and revenue from new mineral licensing deals \u2014 and does not set up any Ukrainian debt obligations.",
      "According to a Ukrainian fact sheet, the U.S. would contribute to the fund \"either through direct financial input or through new military assistance,\" and the agreement \"focuses on further, not past U.S. military assistance.\" Ukraine would contribute 50% of any royalties from future \u2014 but not existing \u2014 oil, gas and mineral licenses.",
      "Under the deal, Ukraine would hold onto ownership of its natural resources, and the fund can only be invested in resource and infrastructure projects within Ukraine. Profits from the fund would be reinvested in the Ukrainian economy for the first decade, and can be \"distributed between the partners\" after that, the fact sheet also said.",
      "An official at the Development Finance Corporation \u2014 a U.S. government agency helping to oversee the deal \u2014 said the joint fund will \"make strategic investments in critical minerals, hydrocarbons, natural resources, and natural resources-related infrastructure in Ukraine, which will help diversify and secure supply chains essential to U.S. economic prosperity and national security.\"",
      "The fund will also \"select vital critical minerals to the United States for offtake,\" the official said.",
      "President Trump had\u00a0pressed\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about an economic deal that would include access to Ukraine's minerals, framing it as a way of paying the U.S. back for aiding the Ukrainian military in its war with Russia. Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's reserves of rare earth elements, which are used in electronics, defense technology and energy projects. Some of the country's reserves are located in parts of eastern Ukraine that are occupied by Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in an interview with NewsNation late Wednesday. \"They have things that a lot of places don't have. It's a big asset that they have,\" Trump said, of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves.",
      "Zelenskyy initially traveled to Washington in February to sign a mineral deal with Mr. Trump. Those plans were\u00a0derailed\u00a0after an explosive Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy and U.S. officials including Vice President JD Vance. During the meeting, Vance accused Zelenskyy of being\u00a0insufficiently grateful\u00a0for U.S. military aid.",
      "Negotiations continued despite the public acrimony. Earlier Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a Cabinet meeting the U.S. was prepared to sign a deal, but Ukraine had requested \"last minute changes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has cast the mineral deal as a key part of his broader gambit to broker an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.",
      "Those talks have proven rocky: At least twice in recent weeks, Trump administration officials have threatened to pull out of negotiations unless more progress is made. Mr. Trump has lashed out at Zelenskyy repeatedly, calling him a \"dictator\" earlier this year and accusing him last week of prolonging the war by refusing to recognize Russia's occupation of Crimea, which Russia took from Ukraine in 2014. The two leaders held a private meeting Saturday in the Vatican while attending the funeral of Pope Francis.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has threatened to tighten sanctions on Russia unless Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees to a deal. Russia launched deadly strikes last week on Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv, angering Mr. Trump, who posted \"Vladimir, STOP!\" on Truth Social.",

Pakistan announced similar, reciprocal measures a day later.",
      "Kashmir is claimed in full by both India and Pakistan, but each nation has controlled its own portion of the mountainous region for decades. The two nations have fought three wars over the region, which is now divided by a de-facto border called the Line of Control (LoC).",

      "The scenic Himalayan region has been hit regularly by militant violence since an armed anti-Indian insurgency began in 1989. The simmering conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives over more than three decades.",

      "Iran hanged a man on Wednesday who was convicted of working as a spy for Israel's foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, and assisting in the 2022 assassination of a Revolutionary Guard colonel in Tehran, according to the Islamic republic's official\u00a0IRNA news agency. An activist group says his confession was forced.",
      "Mohsen Langarneshin, identified by the news agency as one of the Mossad's \"top spies inside Iran,\" allegedly provided \"technical support\" in the killing of Col. Hassan Sayyad Khodaei, who was shot five times by two unidentified gunmen on a motorbike \u2014 said to have been purchased by Langarneshin \u2014 near his home in Tehran.",
      "At the time of his killing, Iranian media identified Khodaei only as a \"defender of the shrine,\" according to The Associated Press. The term is a euphemism used by Iran to refer to Iranians fighting against ISIS in Syria and Iraq within the Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force.",
      "IRNA said Langarneshin had also provided support for an attack on an industrial center linked to the Iranian defense ministry, purchased vehicles and equipment \"to create a secure environment for Mossad elements in Iran,\" transferred money from Mossad officers to contacts inside the country and rented safe houses in several Iranian provinces. One of those homes was in Isfahan, where, in January 2023, bomb-carrying drones targeted what Iran described as a military workshop. Iran has accused Israel of masterminding the attack.",
      "Langarneshin was recruited by the Mossad in 2020 and worked for the Israelis for two years, according to Iran's state-run media, during which time he met with Mossad officers in the nation of Georgia and Nepal, \"and received his missions.\"",
      "IRNA said Langerneshin confessed \"during all stages of the interrogation, prosecution and court proceedings,\" after being \"confronted with extensive case documents.\"",
      "The Human Rights Activists News Agency, a non-profit group focused on rights issues in Iran,\u00a0said\u00a0Wednesday that a source close to Langerneshin's family had recently told the organization that he \"had been promised that if he repeated what the interrogators wanted on camera, he would only face imprisonment. As a result, the confessions were extracted under pressure and coercion.\"",
      "The organization quoted another source whom it said was close to Langarneshin as saying that he \"was taken to the specified location and forced to narrate a prewritten script by interrogators, which was filmed.\"",
      "Masoud Langarneshin, Mohsen's father, released a video in the days before the execution claiming his son had been sentenced to death without a fair trial. His mother, who issued a public appeal for help to human rights organizations, had her last visit with her son at the Ghezel Hesar prison on Karaj, west of Tehran, on April 29.",
      "Iran's Revolutionary Court, which sentenced Langarneshin to death, was established in the aftermath of the 1979 Islamic Revolution and is known for its brutal punishments of political opponents of the country's clerical rulers. The court usually provides a court-appointed lawyer and doesn't allow any press access.",
      "\"After going through legal procedures at various stages of the case, Langarneshin was sentenced to death, and his sentence was carried out this morning,\" IRNA reported Wednesday.",

      "The Museum of East Bohemia said the hikers found gold coins, jewelry and tobacco bags. The found objects weighed about 15 pounds, the museum said on social media.",
      "The treasure was found in two containers in a man-made stone wall, the museum said. First, the hikers spotted an aluminum jar, which contained 598 gold coins, divided into columns and wrapped in black fabric. Local media\u00a0reported\u00a0the treasure was valued at 7.5 million Czech crowns, which is about $341,000.",
      "About three feet away, they found 16 tobacco bags, 10 bracelets, a bag made of fine wire mesh, a comb, a powder coat and a chain with a key. These items were made of yellow metal and were found in a metal box, the museum said.",
      "The coins appear to have been \"hidden in the ground for over a hundred years,\" according to a museum expert, and are dated from 1808 to the early 19th century.\u00a0Local media reported that the coins, which were likely buried after 1921, include currency from France, Belgium, the Ottoman Empire and former Austria-Hungary. Small marks on the currency indicate that they were minted for use in former Yugoslavia, which existed from 1918 to 1992. The museum called the collection a \"very specific set.\"",

      "The satellite, named Biomass, launched with a rocket from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, New Guinea, and separated from the rocket less than an hour after launch,\u00a0 the ESA said in a news release. About 75 minutes after the launch, ESA satellite controllers received Biomass' first signal, indicating that the satellite is working as expected in orbit.",
      "Over the next few days, controllers will carry out the satellite's \"launch and early orbit\" phase, making sure that all systems are working well, the ESA said, and the satellite will make a \"series of intricate maneuvers\" to deploy a nearly 40-foot-wide mesh reflector. That reflector will receive data from the world's forests, the ESA said.",
      "Forests on Earth collectively absorb and store about 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, the ESA said. That regulates the planet's temperature. Deforestation and degradation, especially in tropical regions, means that stored carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, the ESA said, which can contribute to climate change. There's a lack of accurate data on how much carbon the planet's estimated 1.5 trillion trees store and how much human activity can impact that storage, the ESA said.",
      "To \"weigh\" the planet's trees and determine their carbon dioxide capacity, Biomass will use a P-band synthetic aperture radar. It's the first such piece of technology in space. The radar can penetrate forest canopies and measure woody biomass, including trunks, branches and stems, the ESA said. Most forest carbon is stored in these parts of the trees. Those measurements will act as a proxy for carbon storage, the ESA said.",

      "As many as 400 Yedi Kule prisoners were executed, according to historians and the Greek Communist Party. Items found with the bodies \u2014 a woman's shoe, a handbag, a ring \u2014 offer glimpses into the lives cut short.",

      "Etched on the newly excavated bones in Thessaloniki, then, is a playbook that went on to produce decades of repression, societal divisions and more unmarked graves in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Governments later addressing the Cold War-era abuses and atrocities faced a painful choice: to unearth the past \u2014 as attempted with investigative commissions in Eastern Europe and many Latin American countries \u2014 or suppress it for fear of fresh division.",
      "Greek emergency laws were gradually lifted and only fully abolished in 1989. Records of summary trials and executions were never made public. No political force pushed for the excavation of suspected burial sites.",
      "Politicians still use highly cautious language when addressing the past and the Thessaloniki discovery was met with a subdued public reaction. The find has not been directly addressed by the country's center-right government \u2014 a reminder that many Greeks still find it easier to walk past the country's ghosts than confront them.",
      "Decades ago, the neighborhood park in Thessaloniki \u2014 a densely populated port city of a million with ruins from the ancient Greek, Roman and Ottoman eras, with historically strong Balkan and Jewish influences \u2014 was a field on the outskirts of the city. Today, it's frequented by retirees and ringed by apartment buildings filled with middle-class families. During construction, residents whispered that bones had been discovered when foundations were laid, but no inquiry was conducted.",

      "Executions by army firing squads extended into the 1950s and were publicly announced, but graves were unmarked and secret. Author and historian Spyros Kouzinopoulos, a Thessaloniki native, spent decades researching the executions at Yedi Kule, including the indignities endured by prisoners in their final hours.",
      "After a military tribunal issued a death sentence, the chief guard would take the condemned prisoner to solitary confinement in tiny cells barely big enough to stand. Many would use their last hours to write letters to their families. At dawn, the chief guard and two others would retrieve the prisoner and hand them over to the firing squad. Most were loaded onto trucks to avoid attracting public attention. Sometimes they were led to their death on foot.",
      "Most of the victims were barely adults \u2014 youth Kouzinopoulos called \"flowers of their generation.\"",

Spending in Europe, including Russia, was a big factor behind the global surge in spending, SIPRI said.",
      "European nations' collective spending increased by 17% to $693 billion amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, the organization's data show.",
      "Russia's government increased its military spending by 38% to an estimated $149 billion last year, while Ukraine's grew by 2.9% to $64.7 billion. The Ukrainian spending amounted to 34% of the country's GDP, the largest military expenditure by percentage of GDP of any nation last year, according to SIPRI.",
      "\"Russia once again significantly increased its military spending, widening the spending gap with Ukraine,\" said Diego Lopes da Silva, a senior researcher at SIPRI. \"Ukraine currently allocates all of its tax revenues to its military. In such a tight fiscal space, it will be challenging for Ukraine to keep increasing its military spending.\"",
      "All NATO member nations increased their military spending, too, with 18 countries spending at least 2% of their GDP during 2024, which SIPRI said was the highest number of NATO members to hit that threshold since the alliance adopted it as a spending guideline in 2014.",
      "\"The rapid spending increases among European NATO members were driven mainly by the ongoing Russian threat and concerns about possible U.S. disengagement within the alliance,\" said Jade Guiberteau Ricard, another SIPRI researcher. \"It is worth saying that boosting spending alone will not necessarily translate into significantly greater military capability or independence from the USA. Those are far more complex tasks.\"",
      "In the Middle East, Israel and Lebanon significantly increased their military spending. Israel boosted its defense investment by 65% to $46.5 billion, while Lebanon increased its own by 58%, to $635 million.",
      "\"Despite widespread expectations that many Middle Eastern countries would increase their military spending in 2024, major rises were limited to Israel and Lebanon,\" said SIPRI researcher Zubaida Karim. \"Elsewhere [in the region], countries either did not significantly increase spending in response to the war in Gaza or were prevented from doing so by economic constraints.\"",
      "SIPRI said Iran's military expenditure fell in real terms by 10% to $7.9 billion, despite its involvement in regional conflicts.",
      "U.S. military spending grew by 5.7% to $997 billion, amounting to 66% of NATO spending in 2024 and 37% of global military spending.",
      "China was the world's second largest military spender last year behind the U.S., accounting for half of all military spending in Asia and Oceania, SIPRI said. China increased its spending by 7% to $314 billion.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/angelo-becciu-conclave-withdrawal-embezzlement-conviction/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 21:08:35 -0400",
    "summary": "Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, who was convicted of embezzlement and fraud in 2023, said on Tuesday he will not take part in the secret conclave to elect the new pope.",
    "story": [
      "The Italian cardinal at the heart of the Vatican's \"trial of the century,\" Angelo Becciu, announced Tuesday he was withdrawing from participating in the upcoming conclave to elect a new pope for \"the good of the church,\" ending days of drama that had overshadowed the proceedings.",
      "The status of Cardinal Becciu, who was convicted of fraud and embezzlement in 2023, has dominated discussions in the days after Pope Francis' death amid questions about whether he would participate in the conclave to elect Francis' successor or not.",
      "After his 2020 downfall, Becciu had said he would not participate in any future conclave. But in recent days he had asserted he had a right to enter the Sistine Chapel with other cardinals on May 7.",
      "On Tuesday, the 76-year-old Italian issued a statement through his lawyers that said: \"Having at heart the good of the church, which I have served and will continue to serve with fidelity and love, as well as to contribute to the communion and serenity of the conclave, I have decided to obey as I have always done the will of Pope Francis not to enter the conclave while remaining convinced of my innocence.\"",
      "Who is Angelo Becciu?",
      "Before allegations of embezzlement and nepotism surfaced about five years ago, Becciu was considered one of Francis' top advisers.",
      "He was once an influential Vatican chief of staff who was a leading papal contender himself.",
      "Born in 1948 in Pattada, Sardinia, the 76-year-old was ordained to the priesthood in 1972, according to the\u00a0College of Cardinals Report, an independent research website which profiles cardinals. In 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Becciu as Substitute for General Affairs in the Secretariat of State, the third most powerful official in the Vatican, the report said.",
      "Pope Francis later ordained Becciu as cardinal in 2018 and appointed him as Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. But he fell from grace in 2020 when Francis forced him to resign his job as head of the Vatican's saint-making office and his rights as a cardinal because of allegations of financial misconduct.",
      "\"The trial of the century\"",
      "The trial\u00a0focused on the Vatican secretariat of state's 350 million euro investment in developing a former Harrod's warehouse into luxury apartments. Prosecutors alleged Vatican monsignors and brokers, including Becciu, fleeced the Holy See of tens of millions of euros in fees and commissions and then extorted the Holy See for 15 million euros to cede control of the London building.",
      "Becciu was convicted in December 2023 of embezzlement stemming from the original investment of 200 million euros in a fund that bought into the property, as well as for his 125,000 euro donation of Vatican money to a charity run by his brother in Sardinia, a large Italian island in the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "Becciu was also convicted of using Vatican money to pay an intelligence analyst, Cecilia Marogna, who in turn was convicted of using the money for herself.",
      "Becciu denied wrongdoing and is appealing the conviction and 5 \u00bd-year prison sentence and had participated in the pre-conclave meetings, including on Monday.",
      "How does Becciu's withdrawal impact the conclave?",
      "Becciu's withdrawal doesn't affect the Vatican's official statistics about the conclave because internally it never considered him eligible to vote.",
      "There remain 135 cardinal electors, though Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni confirmed Tuesday that two had formally announced they weren't coming due to health reasons, bringing the number of electors down to 133.",
      "Becciu is under the age limit of 80 and technically eligible to vote, but the Vatican's official statistics list him as a \"non-elector.\"",
      "The Vatican document regulating a conclave, known by its Latin name Universi Dominici Gregis, lays out the criteria for electors, making clear that cardinals under 80 have the right to elect the pope, except those who have been \"canonically deposed or who with the consent of the Roman Pontiff have renounced the cardinalate.\" It adds that after a pope has died, \"the College of Cardinals cannot readmit or rehabilitate them.\"",
      "There has never been any clarity on what exactly Becciu renounced or how: The one-line statement issued by the Vatican press office on Sept. 24, 2020, said merely that Francis had accepted Becciu's resignation as prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints \"and his rights connected to the cardinalate.\" There is no indication he has been sanctioned canonically.",
      "Francis' letters to Becciu before he died",
      "Italian daily Domani reported last week that during the initial pre-conclave discussions, Becciu was presented with two letters signed by Francis before he died saying he should not participate in the conclave. Becciu's reference to Francis' will in his statement Tuesday suggests that the letters were the tipping point that convinced him to withdraw from the vote.",
      "Becciu rose to prominence and power under conservative Pope Benedict XVI and is very much affiliated with the conservative Vatican old guard. While he initially became a close adviser to Pope Francis, Becciu's subsequent downfall at the hands of Francis might suggest he would have voted for someone keen to undo some of Francis' reforms.",
      "After he forced Becciu's resignation, Francis visited Becciu on occasions and allowed him to participate in the life of the Vatican. But Francis also changed Vatican law to allow the city state's criminal tribunal to prosecute him.",
      "Pope's absolute power and the trial's fairness",
      "Questions, meanwhile, have continued to swirl about the integrity of the trial that convicted Becciu and eight others. During the proceedings, the court heard that Francis intervened on several occasions on behalf of the prosecutors and that the prosecution's prime witness against Becciu was coached and manipulated by outsiders.",
      "Defense lawyers discovered that the pope had secretly issued four decrees during the investigation to benefit prosecutors, allowing them to conduct intercepts and detain suspects without a judge's warrant.",
      "Lawyers cried foul, arguing such interference by an absolute monarch in a legal system where the pope exercises supreme legislative, executive and judicial power violated their clients' fundamental rights and robbed them of a fair trial.",
      "The tribunal rejected their objections, but in recent weeks even more evidence has emerged about the outside manipulation of the witness and apparent collusion with Vatican prosecutors and gendarmes to target Becciu.",
      "Becciu is free pending the appeal, which is scheduled to begin in September.",

    "summary": "Avelo Airlines says it's counting on a new federal contract for deportation flights to help the discount carrier grow its regular passenger service.",
    "story": [
      "Avelo Airlines is targeting a new passenger segment: migrants being sent to detention centers across the U.S. The budget carrier will also use its planes to fly migrants out of the country under the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.",
      "Avelo has signed a contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to handle deportation flights for U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE), the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Avelo, which launched in 2021, said the move is necessary for the Houston-based airline to remain financially stable.",
      "\"We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy said in a statement to CBS News earlier this month after the company struck a deal with ICE. \"After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.\"",
      "The domestic and international flights ferrying migrants will begin May 14 out of a new hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where Avelo will station three Boeing 737-800 planes to handle the transports. Unlike the company's regular commercial flights, the aircraft used for the trips will not bear Avelo's logo, the company said.",
      "Avelo described the agreement with ICE as a \"long-term charter program.\" The exact terms of the deal were not made public.",
      "The airline is now recruiting flight attendants to staff the flights, according to a\u00a0job posting\u00a0for what it calls a \"charter program for the Department of Homeland Security.\" The job pays $28 an hour for the first year of service.",
      "\"We are seeking energetic, highly motivated Flight Attendants who wish to join a committed group of safety and service professionals at Avelo Airlines,\" the listing reads.",
      "\"Flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS's deportation efforts,\" the post adds, although it makes no references to migrants.",
      "Avelo offers flights across the U.S. and to international destinations including the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico. It operates out of eight hubs across the U.S., flying out of the following airports: Concord-Padgett Regional Airport in North Carolina; Hollywood Burbank Airport in California; Lakeland International Airport in Florida; Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina; Sonoma County Airport in California; Tweed-New Haven airport in Connecticut; Wilmington Airport in New Hampshire; and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina.",
      "The company previously operated charter flights as Casino Express Airlines before rebranding as Avelo in 2021, according to S&P Capital IQ.",
      "Avelo declined to comment further on its contract with the government. DHS confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch that Avelo is contracting with ICE to assist with deportation flights.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has long contracted with CSI Aviation, an aviation broker that provides private air charter services, medical flights for patients in emergencies and government flight services. Under its new contract with ICE, Avelo will operate as a sub-carrier of CSI.",
      "DHS also subcontracts with other air charter companies, which provide planes and operate the flights. One such charter outfit is GlobalX. It handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to immigrant advocate Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "GlobalX did not reply to a request for comment on its work with DHS.",
      "Cartwright, who tracks ICE flights through publicly available sources, expressed surprise at Avelo agreeing to shuttle migrants destined for detention centers or deportation.",
      "\"I have never seen a retail airline that sells to consumers being used in this way,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Typically, charter companies that don't fly retail-type flights. They are not selling tickets directly to consumers.\"",
      "According to data on USAspending.gov, a U.S. government website that tracks federal spending, DHS' roughly 6-month contract this year with CSI Aviation is worth at least $78.1 million. Its value could rise to as much as $162.2 million.",
      "The purpose of the agreement, the site states, \"is to provide daily scheduled large aircraft & special high risk charter flights to facilitate ICE's enforcement and removal of operations of illegal aliens.\"",
      "CSI Aviation did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on its contract with the federal government.",
      "Cruising for revenue",
      "Airline industry experts said charter outfits like CSI typically aren't familiar to the general public.",
      "\"Nobody has usually ever heard of the airlines,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals site, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are charter airlines that don't have a set schedule on a website,\" he said.",
      "However, an upstart airline hunting for additional revenue streams outside of selling tickets to members of the flying public is not unusual.",
      "\"It's very difficult to compete with the Deltas and Uniteds of the world, so they try any number of tactics,\" Keyes explained. \"They fly to and from smaller cities, they offer bargain-basement prices. There are all different types of counter-positioning things they do.\"",
      "But Avelo's move is more surprising because most commercial airlines don't have enough spare aircraft and crew for specialized operations like migrant flights, noted Seth Miller, founder and editor in chief of PaxEx Aero, an aviation consulting service. Miller said he opposes Avelo working with U.S. immigration authorities on ethical grounds.",
      "Avelo's contract with DHS is also drawing criticism from an immigrant advocacy group. A petition started by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition urging people to boycott Avelo until it severs ties with ICE has collected more than 34,650 signatures.",
      "\"We reject the Trump Administration's inhumane deportation practices, reject cooperation from the State of Connecticut in support of Avelo as long as they are complicit in these practices and pledge to boycott Avelo as long as they are profiting from ICE flights,\" the petition states.",
      "Although federal contracts can provide steady business for airlines and charter carriers, Avelo's partnership with DHS poses a reputational risk, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I still think it's morally questionable to run these charters for the federal government and think it poses a very real reputational risk for Avelo,\" Miller said, citing protests against the airline at some of Avelo's hubs.",
      "Will Humphries, a traveler at Sonoma County Airport, in Santa Rosa, California, where Avelo operates, is among those members of the flying public who plan to boycott Avelo because of its work with ICE.",

      "Kara Schmiemann of Red Banyan PR told Fox News Digital, \"This type of strategy, flooding the market with appearances as an attempt to show normalcy and appear[ing] unbothered or unaffected by the drama, is typically not well-advised in crisis response planning.\"",
      "\"While there is certainly a time and place for this approach, and it can sometimes be very effective, in this case it doesn't allow for the heat to die down. The public can be forgiving, but they need time and a reason to forgive and forget. Blake and Ryan seem to be continuing to fan the flames, and it is not landing particularly well for all circles.\"",
      "\"If the PDA-filled images were all that the public saw, their PDA would have definitely helped their image amid the ongoing Baldoni lawsuit drama, because they have always been celebrated as a Hollywood \u2018it couple\u2019 with an amazing relationship,\" relationship expert Nicole Moore said. \"The issue for Blake and Ryan's image is that a large portion of the public no longer gets their information solely from media outlets but from social media and online commentators.\"",

      "\"When the public sees Blake and Ryan looking lovey-dovey at an event, but then goes on TikTok and sees a video about a lip-reader sharing that Blake ordered Ryan to kiss her, for instance, it creates mistrust in the couple and plants seeds of doubt that their relationship is staged,\" she explained. \"So much of the public opinion regarding the Baldoni lawsuit drama has been shaped by voices outside of traditional media, and that's been to Blake and Ryan's detriment.\"",

      "Crediting her mother for influencing her with her \"unwavering bravery,\" Lively said her mom \"never got justice\" from the incident and explained she survived the incident because she had heard stories from women in similar circumstances, particularly a story shared on a radio show.",
      "\"And because of hearing that woman speak to her experience instead of shutting down in fear and unfair shame, my mom is alive today,\" Lively said.",
      "\"Unlike her public displays of affection with her husband, which has been par for the course throughout their courtship and marriage, the timing of this revelation hits the 'funny bone' of armchair skeptics, causing them to jerk in response,\" Doug Eldridge, founder of Achilles PR, told Fox News Digital.",
      "He continued, \"Given all the scrutiny surrounding her demeanor during the press tour for 'It Ends With Us,' why not bring this incredibly personal experience up then? Wouldn't that have lent a sense of authenticity and relatability in terms of her passion and commitment to a film that was tackling such a difficult topic as domestic abuse?",

      "\"Sadly, whether accurate or not, this comes off as a thinly veiled attempt at garnering public sympathy by repositioning herself as the 'victim' in hopes of distracting and reframing the audience's focus.\"",
      "Schmiemann agreed, saying, \"If this was a ploy to gain sympathy, that can be easily sussed out by the public and could be even more damaging. And in this particular case, the irony of discussing assault now, when she previously received backlash for not sufficiently highlighting the horrors of domestic violence in her movie promotion strategy, it is a tough one to\u00a0reconcile.\"",
      "\"The public can be forgiving, but they need time and a reason to forgive and forget.\"",
      "While public opinion remains divided on Lively and Reynolds, they have at least one famous name offering support: Reynolds\u2019 \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" co-star Hugh Jackman.",

      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "Moore says, \"Hollywood actors are often obsessed with protecting their image and profitability, so the fact that Hugh is supporting Blake and Ryan publicly likely means that he doesn't\u00a0anticipate doing so will hurt his own brand.\u00a0There has been extensive media coverage on the close friendly relationship between Hugh and Ryan, so it would\u00a0likely\u00a0appear weird to the public if Hugh didn't support his friend.\"",
      "\"If the lawsuit ends up going in Baldoni's favor and the public starts to see\u00a0Blake and Ryan as perpetrators of harm due to the verdict, that's likely when Hugh will need to distance himself from the couple in order to\u00a0protect his image,\" she added.",
      "Just as Lively and Reynolds have continued to step out in public, Justin Baldoni has remained largely hidden from view.",
      "\"Baldoni is making the right move by avoiding the public eye because he's mitigating any\u00a0damage that\u00a0might occur from a misstep at a\u00a0public\u00a0appearance,\" Moore said. \"Right now,\u00a0Baldoni appears to have the favor of the\u00a0public, and he's wise to ride the wave of that\u00a0favor without adding any potentially negative press or attention to the mix.\"",

      "JUSTIN BALDONI CALLS OUT BLAKE LIVELY FOR DEMANDING PRIVACY AFTER PUBLICIZING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS",
      "She continued, \"Baldoni's strategy appears to be mostly defending back after\u00a0he's directly attacked\u00a0rather than\u00a0attempting to position himself favorably through public\u00a0appearances,\u00a0and this appears to be working as it makes the public see him as the little guy defending\u00a0himself against Hollywood giants.\"",
      "In Eldridge\u2019s opinion: \"Baldoni's moves have been flawless up to this point. From an optics standpoint, he had an accuser make the first move with a splashy, long-form piece in the New York Times. His response was measured and meaningful; ironically, it centered mostly on a series of indelible 'receipts' as well as allowing fans to find the cracks in Lively's sidewalk, knowing she'd eventually trip up.\"",
      "Schmiemann said, \"Time and silence cannot be underestimated when dealing with as much nuance and public criticism as Blake and Ryan seem to be facing. Of course, they must still live their lives and work and care for their family, but being strategic about the when and where is incredibly important. If they continue to step out too frequently, you create additional opportunities for the story to remain in the public eye and for a repeated resurgence of criticism and hate.\"",

      "The conservative high court in recent years has, in select cases, allowed taxpayer funds to be spent on religious organizations to provide \"non-sectarian services\" like adoption or food banks.",
      "In the courtroom public session, the justices debated what limits on curriculum supervision and control would be placed on the religious charter school, if its contract with the state was allowed to move forward.",
      "\"Our [prior] cases have made very clear,\" said Justice Brett Kavanaugh. \"You can't treat religious people and religious institutions and religious speech as second class in the United States. And when you have a program that's open to all comers except religion, no, we can't do that. We can do everything else. That seems like rank discrimination against religion. And that's the concern.\"",

      "\"What you're saying is the free exercise clause trumps the essence of the establishment clause,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor told the attorney for the state\u2019s charter school board. \"The essence of the establishment clause was, 'We're not going to pay religious leaders to teach their religion.'\"",

      "He has the backing of some GOP state lawmakers and parents' groups, who argue that funding parochial charter schools would drain resources from public education \u2013 especially in rural areas already struggling with limited funding.",
      "When it signed a contract with the state charter school board in 2023, St. Isidore \u2013 formed as a nonprofit corporation by the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa \u2013 agreed it would be free and open to all students \"as a traditional public school,\" and would comply with local, state and federal education laws.",

      "Some Catholic sources note the namesake seventh-century archbishop and scholar is now known as the patron saint of the internet, given the title by Pope John Paul II in 1997.",

      "The Supreme Court has previously said states may require public schools be secular, but also cannot prevent private religious institutions from public benefits and contracts.",
      "The issue now is whether those precedents apply to charter schools.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said charter schools are \"a creation and creature of the state.\"",
      "Justice Elena Kagan said contracts signed by schools like St. Isidore have basic requirements to meet state classroom standards, with state oversight.",

      "\"I'm suggesting to you is this notion that the state can do this while still maintaining all its various curricular requirements. I mean, either that sort of fantasy land, given the state of religious belief and religious practice in this world or if it's not, it's only because what's going to result is treating, shall we call them majoritarian, religions very differently from minority religions,\" said Kagan.",
      "But Justice Clarence Thomas noted: \"The argument that St. Isidore and the board are making is that it's a private entity that is participating in a state [charter] program. It was not created by the state program.\"",

      "Protecting yourself from scams starts with these critical defenses; each is designed to shut down fraudsters before they gain a foothold on your personal information or money.",
      "1. Stay calm: If you think a scammer is calling you, it's important to stay calm and not let yourself get emotional. It's very easy to get worked up when you're in the middle of this situation. If it happens, you can always say you will get back to them and hang up the phone. If they become aggressive and try to exploit you, tell them you will report them and hang up.",
      "2. Avoid unknown contact numbers:\u00a0Never call phone numbers that appear in pop-ups, unsolicited texts or emails. These numbers often belong to scammers trying to trick you into sharing personal information or making payments. Instead, always verify contact details through official websites or trusted sources before reaching out.",
      "3. Download warning: Do not download software at the request of unknown individuals who contact you. Installing unknown programs can introduce malware or give scammers a way to steal your personal information.",
      "4. Security precaution: Do not allow unknown individuals access to your computer. Granting remote access can give scammers control over your files and personal information, putting your security at serious risk.",
      "5. Don't click that link and have strong antivirus software: Do not click on unsolicited pop-ups on your computer, links sent via text messages or email links and attachments. As scammers weaponize AI and deepfake technologies, strong antivirus software becomes your first line of defense. The best way to protect yourself from clicking on malicious links that install malware that may access your private information is to have strong antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you to any phishing emails or ransomware scams.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Remove your personal information from the web:\u00a0Your personal information is out on the web. If you want to make your personal information inaccessible, you might want to look into removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "7. Never send money or valuables to strangers: Avoid wiring cash, sending gift cards, cryptocurrency or any other assets to people you\u2019ve only met online or over the phone. Scammers often pressure victims for these untraceable payments, so always be cautious and verify who you\u2019re dealing with before sending anything.",
      "8. Consider identity theft protection services:\u00a0These services monitor your personal information across credit reports, the dark web and public records, alerting you quickly if your data is exposed or misused. These services offer valuable early warnings and access to experts who can help recover your identity if fraud occurs.

      "Starlink: With over 7,000 satellites already in orbit and plans for a constellation of up to 42,000, Starlink currently leads in deployment. Its satellites orbit at approximately 248 miles, allowing for lower latency but requiring more satellites for global coverage.",
      "Project Kuiper: Kuiper plans to deploy over 3,200 satellites orbiting at 311 miles. This higher altitude provides broader coverage per satellite but results in a 40% reduction in signal strength compared to Starlink due to increased distance. To compensate, Kuiper\u2019s satellites use larger antennas to maintain performance.",

      "Cybercriminals always find new ways to scam you, whether it\u2019s mimicking a government agency, creating a fake website or delivering malware disguised as a software update. Just when you think you\u2019ve seen it all, they come up with a new trick.",
      "This time, the FBI has issued an alert: Hackers are using a \"time-traveling\" technique to bypass your device\u2019s security measures. No, we\u2019re not talking about actual time travel (though wouldn\u2019t that be something?). This is a sophisticated cyberattack where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to sneak past security defenses.",

      "A man working on his laptops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The concept of \"time-traveling hackers\" refers not to literal time travel but to a sophisticated cyberattack technique where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to bypass security measures. This attack is reportedly tied to the Medusa ransomware gang.",
      "In this type of attack, hackers exploit expired security certificates by altering the system date on a targeted device to a time when those certificates were still valid. For example, a security certificate that expired in, say, 2020 could be made usable again if the system's clock is set back to 2019. This allows malicious software signed with these outdated certificates to be recognized as legitimate by the system, effectively \"traveling back in time\" from a security perspective.",
      "This technique was notably used in the Medusa ransomware attacks, which targeted critical infrastructure and prompted an\u00a0FBI cybersecurity advisory (AA25-071A) earlier in 2025. The campaign has affected over 300 critical infrastructure targets. The attackers combined this method with social engineering and exploited unpatched vulnerabilities, amplifying the threat.",
      "The FBI has warned that such attacks pose a significant risk, as they can disable modern security protections like Windows Defender by tricking the system into accepting outdated drivers or software.",

      "What does the FBI recommend?",
      "The FBI is urging organizations to take action quickly, warning that this technique can slip past traditional defenses by taking advantage of how systems trust old certificate data.",
      "To stay protected, they recommend turning on two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere, especially for important stuff like webmail and VPNs. It also helps to have strong endpoint protection and clear security policies and to keep an eye out for any weird changes to system settings, like the device clock suddenly jumping back in time.",

      "1) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A strong antivirus isn\u2019t just for catching old-school viruses anymore. It can detect phishing links, block malicious downloads and stop ransomware before it gets a foothold. Since the Medusa gang uses fake updates and social engineering to trick users, having strong antivirus software adds a critical layer of protection against threats you might not see coming. Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0The FBI specifically recommends\u00a0enabling 2FA across all services, especially for high-value targets like webmail accounts, VPNs and remote access tools. 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to break in, even if they\u2019ve managed to steal your username and password through phishing or other tactics.",
      "3)\u00a0Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Many ransomware groups, including Medusa, rely on reused or weak passwords to gain access. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk.

      "The Medusa attack is a good example of how cybercriminals are shifting tactics. Instead of relying on traditional methods like brute force or obvious exploits, they are targeting the basic logic that systems depend on to function. In this case, it is something as simple as the system clock. This kind of strategy challenges the way we think about security. It is not just about building stronger defenses but also about questioning the default assumptions built into the technology we use every day.",

      "Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit (MIT Lincoln Laboratory) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is SPROUT?",
      "SPROUT, short for Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit, is a flexible, vine-like robot developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory in collaboration with the University of Notre Dame. Unlike rigid robots or static cameras, SPROUT can \"grow\" into tight, winding spaces that are otherwise inaccessible, giving first responders a new way to explore, map and assess collapsed structures.",

      "ELECTRIC SUV IS THE ULTIMATE LIFELINE FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSIONS",
      "How does SPROUT work?",
      "SPROUT is made of an airtight fabric tube that inflates with air, allowing it to extend from a fixed base. As it grows, it can flex around corners and squeeze through narrow gaps, mimicking the movement of a plant vine. Operators control SPROUT using a joystick, steering it through debris while watching a live video feed from a camera mounted at the tip. This setup lets responders see and map hidden void spaces without entering dangerous areas themselves.",
      "Three pouch motors along the vine\u2019s length enable SPROUT to bend and turn, while an internal reel system allows the robot to be compactly stored and precisely deployed as needed. In addition to cameras, SPROUT can carry other sensors to image, map and even assess hazards within the collapsed structure.",

    "story": [
      "These scams can catch Facebook veterans and novices off guard.",
      "Healthcare institutions and insurers arguably collect the most sensitive information about you, including IDs, contact details, addresses and medical records. But they often don\u2019t put in the same level of effort to protect that data.",
      "That\u2019s clear from the growing number of healthcare data breaches we\u2019ve seen recently. In most of those cases, a bad actor was involved.",

      "A person doing a Google search\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson))",
      "What you need to know",
      "Blue Shield of California just admitted to a major data privacy slip that went on for almost three years, from April 2021 to January 2024. It was using Google Analytics to track how people used its member websites. This is totally normal since every business does it. But the tool was accidentally sharing sensitive info with Google Ads because it wasn\u2019t set up properly.",
      "What I find extremely shocking is that it took the company three years to realize it was sharing its user data with Google to run ads. This says a lot about how much these healthcare giants care about protecting your data.",
      "The shared data included a broad array of protected health information (PHI), including names, zip codes, gender, medical claim dates, online account numbers, insurance plan names, group numbers, family data and even search criteria used in its \"Find a Doctor\" feature.",
      "\"Google may have used this data to conduct focused ad campaigns back to those individual members. We want to reassure our members that no bad actor was involved, and, to our knowledge, Google has not used the information for any purpose other than these ads or shared the protected information with anyone,\"\u00a0the company\u00a0said in a notice on its website.",
      "This incident is not isolated. Over the past few years, healthcare and tech companies have come under scrutiny for similar missteps. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have already issued warnings about the use of tracking technologies in healthcare, especially those that might expose patient data to third parties without adequate transparency or safeguards.",
      "A Google spokesperson provided the following comment to CyberGuy when asked about the Blue Shield data breach:",
      "\"Businesses, not Google, manage the data they collect and must inform users about its collection and use. By default, any data sent to Google Analytics for measurement does not identify individuals, and we have strict policies against collecting private health information (PHI) or advertising based on sensitive information.\"",

      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",

      "Since the data was only shared with Google and not any other party, the overall risk is relatively low, apart from the clear privacy violation. It\u2019s highly unlikely that anyone else will gain access to it, so the chances of the data being misused are slim. Google says it doesn\u2019t allow ads to be served based on sensitive information like health, so there\u2019s a good chance your data wasn\u2019t even used for advertising.",
      "Blue Shield's case follows a string of similar breaches. Companies like GoodRx, BetterHelp and Kaiser have all faced regulatory and legal consequences for sharing sensitive user data with advertising vendors. Some even settled for millions of dollars. Despite the risks, many healthcare organizations have continued using these tools due to the lack of clear regulatory guardrails, a situation complicated further by a federal court ruling that blocked the Biden administration\u2019s attempts to curb the use of online trackers in healthcare settings.",

      "1. Limit what you share on health portals:\u00a0Avoid entering more personal details than absolutely necessary on insurance or provider websites. Tools like \"Find a Doctor\" might log your search terms, so keep inputs vague when possible.",
      "2. Use privacy-focused browsers:\u00a0Browsers like Brave or Firefox offer built-in privacy protections, such as blocking third-party trackers that could expose health-related browsing activity.",
      "3. Turn off ad personalization:\u00a0Visit\u00a0Google\u2019s Ad Settings and disable ad personalization. This won\u2019t stop tracking, but it can reduce how your data is used for targeting.",
      "4. Opt out of tracking where possible:\u00a0Many healthcare sites use cookies and tracking tools. Choose \"reject all\" or the strictest privacy settings in cookie banners. If a tracking opt-out tool is available, use it.",
      "5. Read privacy policies (yes, really):\u00a0Look for language like \"third-party sharing,\" \"advertising,\" or \"analytics.\" If a healthcare provider mentions tools like Google Analytics or Meta Pixel, that\u2019s a cue to proceed cautiously.",
      "6. Monitor your accounts and credit:\u00a0Keep an eye out for unusual insurance claims or medical charges. Set up credit alerts or monitoring services if your provider offers them, especially after a breach.",
      "7. Ask questions:\u00a0Call or email your healthcare provider or insurer. Ask what tracking tools they use and how they protect your data. The more consumers push for transparency, the more pressure there is to improve standards.",

      "If you want to go beyond the basics, here are some additional steps that can help reduce your digital footprint and catch misuse early:",
      "Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Consider identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you\u2019re concerned about fraud or medical identity theft, you'll want to consider using identity theft protection services. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0To guard against malware or phishing attacks that could compromise access to your online health accounts, be sure to use strong antivirus software. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It baffles me how careless most companies are when it comes to protecting user data. Blue Shield \"mistakenly\" shared your data with Google, which then used it to show personalized ads. It took the company three years to realize this. While most cyber incidents involve an attacker, this breach didn\u2019t need one.

      "The CyberGuy shows you how to strengthen your passwords on your Google account.",
      "The RockYou2024 leak, which exposed almost 10 billion passwords in July of last year, might seem like old news, but its impact is still felt today.",
      "It's considered the largest password compilation ever released.\u00a0With such a vast collection of breached credentials circulating, the risk of credential stuffing, identity theft and unauthorized access to online accounts and systems remains high. For anyone still reusing passwords, the dangers are real \u2014 and growing.",
      "That's why password security has never been more critical, and the big question remains, how secure is my password?",

      "Username and password on tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why does password strength matter?",
      "Think of weak passwords as an open door for hackers. Recent reports show that many common passwords can be cracked in literally seconds. Simple or reused passwords are especially vulnerable to automated attacks, and once one account is breached, others are often quickly compromised.",
      "If a company you\u2019re signed up with experiences a\u00a0data breach and your login info is leaked, attackers can try that same password on other platforms, potentially unlocking a lot more than just one account.",
      "Strong passwords act as your first line of defense. They\u2019re long, complex and unique, making it significantly harder for attackers to guess or force their way in. When every account has its own strong password, even if one gets leaked, the rest stay safe.",
      "Think of it this way. A weak password is like using the same key for your house, car and office and leaving it under the doormat. A strong password? It\u2019s like a unique, high-security key for every door in your digital life.",

      "How secure is your password, really? It\u2019s time to put it to the test. Grab a pen (or just keep a mental tally) and score yourself based on this 7-point password strength test.\u00a0Each \"yes\" earns you a point.\u00a0So, let\u2019s see how your password holds up in today\u2019s threat landscape.",
      "Length is your first line of defense. Short passwords \u2014 think six or eight characters \u2014 can be cracked in minutes by modern hacking tools. At 12 characters or more, you\u2019re making it exponentially harder for attacks to succeed.",
      "Mixing uppercase and lowercase letters strengthens your password by increasing complexity. For example, instead of using something like \"t8g5k9w2,\" use \"T8g5K9w2\" \u2014 same characters, just more variety. Mix it up.",
      "Adding numbers makes your password harder to crack. Instead of sticking to just letters \u2014 like \"Trkplmsh\" \u2014 try something like \"Tr8k5Plm2sh.\" Randomly placed numbers increase complexity and make your password much more secure.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Symbols like !, @, #, and $ add another layer of security. For example, a password like \"T8g5K9w2\" becomes even stronger as \"T8g5#K9w2!.\" Special characters increase complexity and help defend against attacks.",
      "Reusing passwords is like handing hackers a master key. If one account gets breached, and you\u2019ve reused that password elsewhere, you\u2019re toast. One password, one purpose. No exceptions.",
      "Your name, birthday or \"Fluffy1990\" (your dog\u2019s name and birth year) might feel clever, but they\u2019re goldmines for attackers who can scrape social media or breached data. Keep it impersonal and unpredictable.",
      "Even good passwords can go stale. It\u2019s a smart move to update them every 90 days, or sooner if a site you use has a security issue.",

      "What should I do if my password strength is low?",
      "If your score didn\u2019t quite hit that seven out of seven mark, no worries. The good news? You\u2019ve already taken the first step by identifying the weak spots. Now, you\u2019ve got two options:",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To keep your passwords secure, use ones that are at least 12 characters long with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using personal information or common patterns. Always use a different password for each account, and enable\u00a0two-factor authentication whenever it's available.",
      "While you can build a strong password on your own, let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s not always easy. Coming up with something that\u2019s at least 12 characters long, includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special symbols and isn\u2019t based on anything personal? That\u2019s a tall order. And even if you do manage to craft the perfect one, you\u2019ve still got to remember it, especially if you\u2019re using a different strong password for every account (which you absolutely should be).",
      "This is the easier, faster and frankly smarter route. A password generator creates long, complex, completely random passwords for you \u2014 no guesswork or mental gymnastics required. These tools are designed to pump out passwords that check all the boxes, making them far harder to crack. If you want an easy and secure option, many password managers include built-in password generators that follow best practices for maximum strength.",
      "Either way, the key takeaway is this: Don\u2019t settle for weak or recycled passwords. Whether you go DIY or use a tool, upgrading your password strength is one of the simplest ways to protect yourself online.",
      "Illustration of online banking login on laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is the best password manager?",
      "Password security can seem like a tough thing to maintain manually. The good news is that password managers take the hassle out of it by generating, storing and autofilling strong, unique passwords for you.",
      "We recommend a password manager that is secure, user-friendly and includes features like a password health tool, data breach monitoring and a built-in password generator to help you create strong, unique passwords. Essentially, they are a digital safe designed to encrypt and store your login credentials, passkeys, credit card details, personal information and even sensitive files. It remembers everything for you, organizes your credentials neatly and fills in login forms with a single click. When you sign up for a new site, it autosaves the password with no effort required.",
      "The best part? A password manager puts an end to password reuse. Instead of leaning on that tired old \"Fluffy1990\" for every account, it generates strong, unique passwords tailored to each site, boosting security for both your personal and professional life. So, with a password manager, you\u2019ll no longer have to ask yourself, how secure is my password?",

      "With data breaches becoming increasingly common, it's clear that password security isn't a \"set it and forget it\" task. It's an ongoing process.

    "story": [
      "Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity.",
      "Most companies use different vendors to run different parts of their business, such as customer management, finances, payroll and social media. To do this, they share access to customer data with these platforms. The issue is that not all vendors take cybersecurity seriously, and hackers are well aware of that.",
      "More and more, attackers are going after these weaker links in the digital supply chain. These kinds of breaches often happen quietly, exposing large amounts of customer information without touching a company\u2019s main systems. It\u2019s becoming a serious concern for both businesses and their customers.",
      "One of the latest cases involves Hertz, the car rental giant, which recently confirmed that customer data was exposed because of a cyberattack on one of its software vendors.",

      "Hertz rental location (Hertz)",
      "What happened at Hertz?",
      "Hertz, the global car rental company that also operates Dollar and Thrifty, has\u00a0disclosed a data breach affecting thousands of its customers. The incident stems from a cyberattack on one of its third-party vendors, software provider Cleo, in October 2024 and December 2024. The breach did not compromise Hertz\u2019s internal systems directly but involved data that had been shared with the vendor as part of its operational workflow.",
      "The compromised data varies by region but includes sensitive personal information such as names, dates of birth, contact details, driver\u2019s license numbers and, in some cases, Social Security numbers and other government-issued IDs. Certain financial information, including payment card details and workers\u2019 compensation claims, was also among the stolen records.",
      "In the U.S., disclosures were filed with regulatory bodies in California, Texas and Maine. Specifically, 3,457 individuals were affected in Maine and 96,665 in Texas. The total global impact, however, is believed to be far greater. Customers in Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand and the U.K. were also notified via breach notices on Hertz\u2019s regional websites.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The breach is believed to be the work of the Clop ransomware gang, a well-known Russia-linked hacking group. Clop exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Cleo\u2019s enterprise file transfer software, technology used by many large organizations to securely transmit sensitive business data. In 2024, the gang launched a mass-hacking campaign targeting Cleo users, ultimately stealing data from more than 60 companies, including Hertz.",
      "Interestingly, while Hertz was named on Clop\u2019s dark web leak site in 2024, the company initially stated it had \"no evidence\" its systems or data had been compromised.",
      "When contacted by CyberGuy, a Hertz spokesperson said, \"At Hertz, we take the privacy and security of personal information seriously. This vendor event involves Cleo, a file transfer platform used by Hertz for limited purposes. Importantly, to date, our forensic investigation has found no evidence that Hertz's own network was affected by this event. However, among many other companies affected by this event, we have confirmed that Hertz data was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zero-day vulnerabilities within Cleo's platform in October 2024 and December 2024.\"",
      "Hertz rental location (Hertz)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "What does this mean for customers?",
      "While Hertz\u2019s internal systems were not breached, the exposure of personal data, including driver\u2019s license numbers, contact details and government-issued IDs, poses serious risks. Affected individuals may be vulnerable to identity theft, fraudulent account openings and targeted\u00a0phishing attempts. If Social Security numbers were involved, the potential for harm increases significantly. Anyone who rented from Hertz, Dollar or Thrifty between October and December 2024 should be on high alert.",

      "If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Hertz data breach.",
      "1. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Hertz breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Hertz breach, including Social Security numbers, driver's license and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",

      "Cyber risk doesn\u2019t always come from a company\u2019s own network. It often originates in unseen corners of the digital supply chain. Even as companies double down on internal cybersecurity, they must be equally rigorous in how they vet and monitor third-party vendors. For consumers, it\u2019s no longer enough to trust the big brand on the label. The data trail is wider, the attack surface larger and the consequences far more opaque.",

      "Trump last week conceded that his pledge to end the three-year-old war in Ukraine within 24 hours of taking office was \"figurative,\" acknowledging it was never a realistic goal. The conflict has claimed a reported 1 million casualties.",
      "\"I said that as an exaggeration,\"\u00a0he told reporters.",
      "While Trump has faced criticism over his ability to bring Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, his team \u2014 led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Antony Rubio \u2014 has made some headway, securing a 30-day ceasefire protecting Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure.",
      "But Putin has so far refused to enter any other brokered agreements, despite Kyiv\u2019s willingness to play ball even after the historic Oval Office blow-up between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February.",
      "Though Trump appeared to hold a grudge against Zelenskyy after Ukraine rejected a proposed mineral deal \u2014 even blaming him in part for Russia\u2019s illegal invasion \u2014 relations between the two leaders appeared to improve over the weekend. Trump also set a new ultimatum for Putin, issuing a deadline to reach a ceasefire deal.",
      "\"Two weeks or less,\"\u00a0Trump told reporters Sunday, though he later added a bit more time would be acceptable. \"We'll see what happens over the next few days. We'll probably learn a lot.\"",
      "TRUMP AND ZELENSKYY HAVE 'VERY PRODUCTIVE' TALK AS THEY ATTEND POPE FRANCIS' FUNERAL",
      "Trump said he was \"surprised and disappointed\" after Putin last week levied a barrage of missiles at Ukraine\u2019s capital city of Kyiv in a strike that killed 12 civilians and injured nearly 100 more.",
      "\"I want him to stop shooting, sit down and sign a deal,\" Trump said in reference to Putin. \"We have the confines of a deal, I believe, and I want him to sign it and be done with it and just go back to life.\"",
      "Trump has not said how or whether he will hold Putin accountable if he doesn\u2019t agree to a ceasefire and the White House has not responded to Fox News Digital\u2019s repeated questions regarding the issue.",

      "Before entering office, Trump repeatedly threatened Hamas that \"all hell\" would break out if they didn\u2019t return all hostages by the time he arrived at the White House.",
      "But the Palestinian terror group has ignored his threats and rejected Trump's February proposal to turn the Gaza Strip into the \"Riviera of the Middle East,\" saying it would adhere to a ceasefire agreement brokered between the terrorist organization and Israel, mediated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt.",
      "Trump has not hit Hamas, nor have his negotiations to release hostages looked all that different from his predecessor's.",
      "The first phase of what was intended to be a three-phase ceasefire saw the return of 33 hostages taken by Hamas, the majority of whom were abducted in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, as well as the release of 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held by Jerusalem.",
      "But 59 hostages remain in Gaza, including American-Israeli Edan Alexander, and hopes of a second phase collapsed after negotiations stalled on terms surrounding future hostage releases, and in March Israel reignited military operations in the Gaza Strip.",
      "A Qatari official on Sunday said the main hiccup in securing a ceasefire following the latest round of talks last week is that Israel has not presented a clear solution to end the war in exchange for hostage releases, Reuters reported.",

      "Details on nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and Iran in Oman on Saturday, in which the third round of talks were held, remain nil, though Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reportedly told Iranian state media they were \"very serious and work-focused.\"",

      "Beijing responded by slapping reciprocal tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods, mostly targeting U.S. agricultural products worth some $16.5 billion \u2014 a trade war that saw the loss of a quarter of a million U.S. jobs by January 2021, according to the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC).",
      "From the campaign trail, Trump threatened to hit China with 60% tariffs \u2014 which he nearly did in early April when he announced an additional 34% tariff on top of the existing taxes already in place.",
      "But what had already sent geopolitical shockwaves and sparked near-immediate market concerns was further escalated just over a week later when Trump ratcheted up tariffs on Beijing to 145%.",
      "China has responded by hitting Washington with its own 125% reciprocal tariffs on U.S. imports and, according to a Bloomberg report on Monday, cargo supply shipments have already dropped by 60%.",

Now, America is strong again, hostages are free from Gaza, Marc Fogel and Ksenia Karelina are home, hundreds of Houthi and other terrorists have been eliminated, and we are closer to peace than ever before.",

      "The idea floated was that Biden would give a speech directly to the Israeli public, presenting two options, according to his Middle East advisor Ilan Goldenberg. \"A lot of people were talking about, including in the Oval Office at times, the idea of, like, the President going out and giving a speech.

Your sons and daughters are going to keep fighting. Most of the hostages are going to come home dead. The idea would be either to force Netanyahu to come on board with that or scramble Israeli politics and see if you could trigger elections. That's what people were saying, like, \u2018let's just break this up because it's not going anywhere good.\u2019\"",

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the agreement, established as the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, will allow the United States to \"invest alongside Ukraine\" to unlock its growth assets and ultimately accelerate its economic recovery.",
      "\u201cAs the President has said, the United States is committed to helping facilitate the end of this cruel and senseless war. This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\" Bessent said in a statement. \"President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides\u2019 commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.",

      "Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, provided more details about the minerals deal outlined in the agreement, first saying on X that \"it is the Ukrainian state that determines what and where to extract\" and that \"subsoil remains under Ukrainian ownership.\"",
      "Ukraine and the United States will jointly manage and maintain co-ownership of the investment fund, with neither side holding a dominant vote, Svyrydenko said. It will be financed by new Ukrainian oil, gas and critical mineral licenses, with 50% of all revenue from the licenses going toward the fund.",
      "\"The fund will then invest in extraction projects for critical materials, oil, and gas \u2014 as well as in related infrastructure and processing. Specific investment projects will be selected jointly by Ukraine and the US. Importantly, the Fund may invest exclusively in Ukraine,\" she said on X.",
      "Svyrydenko indicated in her post that the United States will also contribute to the fund, through it is unclear exactly how much. She added that contributions to the fund will not be taxed in either Ukraine or the United States to ensure \u201cmaximum effectiveness of the investment process.\"",
      "Trump said earlier Wednesday that the agreement would serve as an avenue for the United States to recoup funds it has provided to Ukraine throughout its war with Russia, a figure the State Department has placed at $66.5 billion in terms of military assistance.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t want to make a complicated deal,\" Trump said at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday. \"Rare earth is called rare for a reason, and they have a lot, and we made a deal where our money is secure, where we can start digging and doing what we have to do.\"",
      "It is unclear how much of the money will go toward repaying the United States. Svyrydenko said in her post that the agreement \"includes no provisions regarding any Ukrainian debt obligations to the United States.\"",
      "The agreement was signed days after Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Rome on the sidelines of Pope Francis\u2019 funeral. Trump suggested the pair\u2019s relationship had improved since their Oval Office clash in February, characterizing the meeting as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and expressing confidence that Zelenskyy \u201cwants to make a deal\" to end the war.",

      "Putin met with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff on Friday for roughly three hours in Moscow, with a Putin aide later describing their discussion as \"productive.\"",
      "After the meeting, Trump urged Ukraine and Russia to hold \"very high-level\" ceasefire talks, adding that the two sides are \"very close to a deal\" to end the war. The two countries have not held direct talks since the\u00a0early days of Russia\u2019s invasion."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A bipartisan measure that sought to undo the sweeping tariffs President Donald Trump imposed on most countries this month failed in the GOP-led Senate on Wednesday.",
      "The vote ended in a tie, 49-49, with three Republicans \u2014 Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 joining all Democrats present in support of the resolution, which was designed to terminate the national emergency Trump declared to implement his global tariffs.",
      "Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who voiced support for the measure, were absent for the vote. It needed a simple majority to pass.",

      "Later Wednesday evening, the Senate voted 50-49 \u2014 with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote \u2014 to table a Democratic motion that would allow them to force another vote next week on the tariffs resolution.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Even if it passed, the resolution most likely wouldn't have been taken up in the GOP-controlled House. Republicans there recently voted to add a hurdle for lawmakers seeking to quickly take up resolutions related to Trump's tariff authority. The White House also said Tuesday that Trump would veto the resolution if it reached his desk.",
      "In a 51-48 vote in early April, the Senate approved a similar but more limited resolution that aimed to block the U.S. tariffs on Canada. The three Republicans who joined with Democrats on Wednesday, along with McConnell, voted for that measure, too, offering a rare rebuke of Trump.",
      "On the day most took effect this month, Trump abruptly announced that he would pause higher targeted tariffs for most countries for 90 days to allow for negotiations. Meanwhile, Trump raised tariffs on China to 145%.",
      "The vote came the day the Commerce Department revealed that the U.S. economy contracted 0.3% in the first quarter of the year, a development that Trump and White House officials tried to downplay. In response, Trump told the public to \"BE PATIENT!!!\" on Truth Social.",
      "Trump administration officials have repeatedly claimed in recent days that they've been making progress in negotiations to reach trade deals with some of the countries that have faced higher U.S. tariffs. But they haven't disclosed any details, and they have dodged questions about when exactly announcements could be made about agreements reached.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that countries are calling him to negotiate trade deals and that he is \u201coptimistic\u201d they will settle with several of them in the next few weeks, according to two senators who attended the meeting with Greer and Vance.",
      "Senate GOP Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., criticized the senators who forced a vote Wednesday, saying it's wasting time.",
      "\u201cThey know it\u2019s not going to go anywhere. They know it\u2019s not going to become law,\u201d Barrasso told NBC News on Tuesday. \u201cAll they\u2019re trying to do is slow down the process, preventing us from getting more members of the president\u2019s leadership team confirmed and in place.\u201d",
      "Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., also announced a bill targeting Trump's tariffs. Rather than halt them immediately, the measure would make the tariffs expire after 60 days unless Congress voted to explicitly approve them.",
      "\u201cI think the only thing that keeps us from growing bigger is that sort of the Grassley bill is an off-ramp for people who want to symbolically oppose the tariffs but don\u2019t want to, in reality, stop them,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd they might want to, but they\u2019re not willing to vote to stop them.\u201d",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who faces a tough re-election race next year, said he continues to work with Grassley on his legislation, but he didn't support the measure from Paul and Wyden.",

      "Voters returned Donald Trump to the White House in November believing he would be better for the economy than his opponent, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "Yet 100 days into Trump\u2019s second presidential term, voters now face an economic landscape rife with uncertainty.",
      "Among its attributes: recession odds of as high as 60%, inflation rates that have barely budged and a stock market that, until recently, was beset by volatility.",
      "At issue is Trump\u2019s tariffs strategy.",
      "Though he said throughout his campaign that he planned to impose tariffs on goods brought into the United States, consumers and businesses alike have reacted with shock at what Trump has implemented and the speed with which he has done it: a 10%-across-the-board tariff, 25% duties on autos and auto parts and steel and aluminum products, and duties of as high as 145% on goods from China, the third-largest source of imports into the United States behind the European Union and Mexico.",
      "\u201cA lot of economic policy has been made in these first 100 days \u2014 more than any other administration I can think of,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.",
      "The tariffs rollout has also been marked by starts and stops, with different rationales offered up for each duty and tariff levels sometimes changing within a single day.",
      "To this day, Trump\u2019s tariffs plan continues to evolve. He has paused the country-by-country tariffs he announced in his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d Rose Garden ceremony this month, which he said has prompted hundreds of countries to approach the United States about signing new trade deals.",
      "And on Tuesday, in a speech marking the first 100 days of his second term, he also softened some of the tariffs on cars and auto parts.\u00a0During a rally in Warren, Michigan, Trump called it \u201cthe most successful first 100 days of administration in the history of our country.\u201d",
      "Overall, the rollout of the tariffs and the uncertainty it has created have caused significant economic and financial turbulence.",
      "Take high prices, which were top of mind for many voters in November. The Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of price growth remains stuck at about 2.5%. While that is within range of historical averages, it is above the central bank\u2019s official 2% goal. Grocery price growth surged in the initial weeks of Trump\u2019s administration amid soaring egg costs, but they have since come down.",
      "Still, across-the-board 10% tariffs Trump has placed on imports to the United States, along with other duties on countries like China and Mexico from which the United States imports food, could raise grocery costs further, some experts say.",
      "Gas prices, too, have remained at Biden-era levels. Airfare prices have fallen \u2014 though that is largely a function of reduced demand as consumers pull back on nonessential spending.",
      "While mortgage rates have declined year on year, the pace of home sales is glacial, and in March \u2014 the start of a usually busy spring season\u00a0for the real estate industry \u2014 sales of previously owned homes fell to their slowest rate since 2009.",
      "NBC News\u2019 home price affordability index has in the first three months of Trump\u2019s second term shown modest improvement in consumers\u2019 ability to buy homes, but it remains far above its pre-pandemic levels.",
      "As for stocks, the S&P 500 has lost about 8% since Jan. 20.",
      "Some data has held up. Retail sales have remained brisk, while the unemployment rate is steady at about 4.2%.",
      "Barclays financial group said Monday that its daily credit card transaction data, as well as job-openings trends, \u201cthus far show little cause for concern about U.S. activity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe most recent momentum in spending and new-job postings is about in line with \u2014\u00a0and never far below\u00a0\u2014\u00a0point-in-time comparisons with prior years,\u201d the firm said.",
      "Overall, it is difficult to find a measure of economic activity that has improved dramatically since Trump\u2019s second term began. And while many data points show the economy hanging on for now, there has been significant deterioration in business and consumer sentiment and outlook. While such surveys do not always translate into slower economic growth, they suggest even rougher conditions may lie ahead.",
      "Nearly every measure of consumer confidence tracked by Wall Street firms, including the more conservative-leaning National Federation of Independent Business\u2019 monthly survey of smaller businesses, has shown a decline in economic optimism.",
      "\u201cThe implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months,\u201d the federation\u2019s chief economist, Bill Dunkelberg, said in a statement this month. \u201cSmall business owners have scaled back expectations on sales growth as they better understand how these rearrangements might impact them.\u201d",
      "The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer confidence survey has likewise plunged, showing the largest three-month decline since the 1990s.",
      "\u201cExpectations worsened for vast swaths of the population across age, education, income, and political affiliation,\u201d survey director Joanne Hsu said in a statement.",
      "\u201cConsumers perceived risks to multiple aspects of the economy, in large part due to ongoing uncertainty around trade policy and the potential for a resurgence of inflation looming ahead. Labor market expectations remained bleak. Even more concerning for the path of the economy, consumers anticipated weaker income growth for themselves in the year ahead.\u201d",
      "Some uptick in economic activity could simply be the result of consumers\u2019 and businesses\u2019 trying to get ahead of tariffs by stocking up on goods for their households or inventory for their businesses as tariffs bear down, experts say.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a front-running effect,\u201d said Bob Elliott, CEO of Unlimited Funds investment group. \u201cYou hear a lot of anecdotal stories related to that \u2014 like auto demand, there\u2019s been a lot of pulled-forward auto demand,\u201d he said, referring to consumers shopping for new vehicles currently on dealership lots that are not subject to Trump\u2019s tariffs. \u201cBut even smaller-scale items, we\u2019re seeing indications of pre-buying on worries that price rises are ahead.\u201d",
      "The latest edition of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Beige Book survey of economic conditions in the United States shows cracks starting to form, especially in sectors and regions that depend on foreign tourism, which has fallen off sharply as Trump has ramped up his immigration crackdowns at U.S. borders.",
      "\u201cLarge attractions that normally draw international visitors saw a drop in travelers from abroad, particularly Canada, and airports and airlines reported a notable decline in foreign passengers to the U.S.,\u201d the Atlanta Fed said.",
      "In a statement, a White House spokesman noted there had actually been negative month-on-month inflation in March\u2019s Consumer Price Index \u2014 meaning that on average, a typical price declined from February. The spokesman, Kush Desai, also pointed to investment commitments from firms like Apple, Nvidia and Hyundai designed to reshore manufacturing back to the United States.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s America First policies are delivering much-needed economic relief for everyday Americans while laying the groundwork for a long-term restoration of American Greatness,\u201d Desai said.",
      "And at a news conference marking Trump\u2019s first 100 days, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt waved off any concerns about the economy.",
      "\u201cThe actual data has been quite good,\u201d Bessent said. \u201cThe job data is good, [and] Americans keep spending.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrust in President Trump,\u201d Leavitt said when a reporter asked how Americans should be thinking about this period of economic turmoil. \u201cThere is a reason he was re-elected to this office. It\u2019s because of the historic success of his economic formula in the first term.\u201d",
      "It is not the tariffs themselves that have created the troublesome economic environment, said David Seif, chief economist at Nomura Holdings financial group. Rather, it is the uncertainty that has accompanied their imposition that is preventing businesses from spending and hiring and allowing the economy to settle back onto a more stable footing.",
      "For any concerns Trump may have about how Americans view his performance on the economy, there are ways he can regain positive momentum, Seif said. If Trump manages to dial back his ambitions or finds a way to stand down from his more provocative stances, the memories of the initial months of his second term could fade fast.",
      "\u201cUncertainty is the worst aspect of all of this,\u201d Seif said. \u201cIf a plan were announced today, as long as it was seen as a totally definitive thing, that would allow companies to start investing again.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration wants to bring more auto manufacturing back to the United States with stiff tariffs. That could mean untangling supply chains that crisscross the border repeatedly, leaving some industry players unsure how their bottom lines will be affected.",
      "Take Brendan Lane\u2019s striker plates, which move between the United States and Canada four times before they\u2019re installed. The common component \u2014 one of the roughly 30,000 individual parts that go into a single vehicle \u2014 is a small metal loop attached to a slab of steel allowing car doors to latch securely in place.",
      "\u201cThe system is set up where we\u2019re across the border all the time,\u201d said Lane, the general manager of Lanex Manufacturing in Windsor, Ontario, across the river from Detroit. His parts are sold to suppliers of major American automakers, including Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, and Lane said he has been making cross-border trips for his family-run company since he was 16.",
      "Recent months have been a roller coaster ride for Lanex as President Donald Trump introduced tariffs on auto parts, steel and aluminum and Canadian imports.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump adjusted his vehicle tariffs to offer some relief from import taxes that in many cases had threatened to stack up on top of one another. Under the revised policy, automakers paying tariffs on imported cars can get reimbursed for some other levies, including on foreign-made metals, though country-specific tariffs could still apply.",
      "The system is set up where we\u2019re across the border all the time.",
      "Brendan Lane, general manager, Lanex Manufacturing, Windsor, Ontario",
      "Lane welcomed the changes but said tariffs are \u201cnot good\u201d for his business. He said he remains worried about how the still-fluid U.S. trade policies will affect costs and jobs across the industry.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s thousands of people involved that it\u2019s their everyday life,\u201d he said.",
      "American automakers have largely outsourced their parts manufacturing, mainly building only high-value components like engines, transmissions and bodies within the United States. Most other components \u2014 especially minor parts such as hoses, springs and striker plates \u2014 come from external suppliers, many of them abroad.",
      "Reshoring more of that extensive global supply chain is \u201cnot as easy as just flipping a switch,\u201d Lane said.",
      "His striker plates are spared the 25% U.S. duties on auto imports, which remain on track to take effect Sunday, because they comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump negotiated during his first term. But Lane said he still isn\u2019t sure what the long-term impacts on his business might be.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tough to plan for,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to navigate it yet.\u201d",
      "Even General Motors said Tuesday that it was \u201creassessing\u201d its business outlook to account for tariff impacts that are still likely to be \u201csignificant.\u201d It promised to share more with investors \u201cwhen we have greater clarity.\u201d",
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley told CNN on Wednesday that the latest tariff plan \u201cclarifies things, but boy, do we have a lot of work to do with the administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cAffordability of parts is a really important thing for America because we\u2019ve got to keep the vehicles affordable,\u201d Farley said. Ford saw double-digit sales growth in March and April as people rushed out to buy cars, he added, and the company is extending its employee pricing offer through July 4.",
      "The White House has indicated that the confusion is tactical.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump creates what I would call strategic uncertainty in the negotiations,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters Tuesday. \u201cThe aperture of uncertainty will be narrowing,\u201d he said, \u201cand as we start moving forward announcing deals, then there will be certainty.\u201d",
      "Lane\u2019s striker plates start with imported steel from Wixom, Michigan. Relying on American-made metal has already entailed a 25% cost hike due to Canada\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel, a response to equivalent levies on foreign steel that Trump imposed in February.",
      "The Michigan steel travels across the border to the Lanex\u2019s Windsor plant, which shapes it into striker plates. The components are then handed off to another Canadian company, in nearby Brampton, for heat treating.",
      "Afterward, Lane drives the parts back over the border to Warren, Michigan, for plating, a process that applies a rust-protective coating. Finally, he brings them once more to Windsor, for inspection and packaging in his warehouse. Only then are the striker plates shipped to a vehicle assembly plant in the United States, where they\u2019re mounted onto door frames."

Trump and his allies have contended that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang in justifying his deportation \u2014 which Abrego Garcia's lawyers deny.",
      "\"I'm not the one making this decision,\" Trump added. \"We have lawyers that don't want to do this.\"",
      "At a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Trump said he had not spoken to Bukele about sending Abrego Garcia back.",
      "\"I really leave that to the lawyers,\" he said, adding, \"They know the laws, and we follow the laws exactly.\"",
      "A federal judge, an appeals court and the Supreme Court have all ordered the administration to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return after he was deported to a prison in El Salvador on March 15. Lawyers for the Justice Department have acknowledged in court filings that the deportation was a mistake because an immigration judge had ruled that while Abrego Garcia could be deported, he could not be sent back to his native El Salvador. But administration officials have also said that, because Abrego Garcia is in custody in El Salvador, the United States does not have the legal authority to bring him back.",
      "\"Abrego Garcia is being held in the sovereign, domestic custody of the independent nation of El Salvador. DHS does not have authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation,\" the Department of Homeland Security's general counsel said in one court filing.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi put it more succinctly this month: \u201cThat\u2019s up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That\u2019s not up to us. ... If they wanted to return him, we would facilitate it.\"",
      "Trump suggested in the ABC News interview that the admission of the mistake was the issue, not the error itself.",
      "\"Well, the lawyer that said it was a mistake was here a long time, was not appointed by us\" and \"should not have said that,\" he said, appearing to refer to a Justice Department lawyer who was removed from the case after having called Abrego Garcia's deportation an \"administrative error.\"",
      "Other Justice Department attorneys on the case have also acknowledged it was a mistake in court filings, including Solicitor General D. John Sauer, formerly Trump's personal lawyer.",
      "It's unclear what impact Trump's remarks might have on Abrego Garcia's case. The Justice Department referred a request for comment to the White House. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Justice Department tried this month to introduce a meeting Trump had in the Oval Office with Bukele as evidence in the case. Bukele told reporters he would not return Abrego Garcia and called the question \"preposterous.\"",
      "Drew Ensign, a lawyer for the government, told U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis that the exchange showed that the subject of Abrego Garcia's return was \"raised at the highest possible levels.\"",
      "Xinis noted that in the transcript the government provided her, it was a reporter \u2014 not Trump or the other officials there with him \u2014 who brought up the return. She also said that what happened in the Oval Office \"is not before this court\" and that she would rely on \"sworn, under oath testimony.\"",
      "David Leopold, an attorney and the former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said Xinis is likely to take a similar position if Abrego Garcia's attorneys try to use Trump's comments to ABC News as evidence.",
      "\"The judge is probably going to do the same thing here,\" Leopold said, although Trump's remarks are in clear conflict with the Justice Department's position that the United States has no say in Abrego Garcia's detention.",
      "Abrego Garcia is in the \"sovereign, domestic custody\" of El Salvador, and the United States has no say in his detention, the government has said.",
      "Leopold said Trump \"said what everybody knows\" and what Abrego Garcia's lawyers have been arguing in court \u2014 that since the United States is paying for the deportees to be kept in Salvadoran prisons, it has the ability to get them released.",
      "\"They subcontracted the detention of the folks they sent to El Salvador,\" Leopold said. \"There's no question he's in the constructive custody of the United States. We're paying the bills.\"",
      "In the ABC News interview, Trump also doubled down on his assertion that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13. He pointed to a picture he posted on social media in which the letters and numbers M-S-1-3 appeared to have been digitally added to Abrego Garcia's knuckles.\"He said he wasn't a member of a gang, and then they looked, and on his knuckles, he has MS-13,\" Trump said. \"He had MS-13, on his knuckles, tattooed.\"",
      "When Moran said that the image had been altered and that Abrego Garcia did not have the tattoo in other pictures, Trump called him \"fake news.\"",
      "Oscar Giron, a retired Maryland police investigator who says he worked on hundreds of MS-13 cases on the East Coast, said other tattoos on Abrego Garcia's hand in the picture did not strike him as indicating membership in the gang.",
      "\"I have not seen those before,\" he said.",
      "Giron added that in his experience, members of the gang had largely stopped getting affiliated tattoos in recent years because they wanted to avoid detection by law enforcement.",
      "Leopold said the accusations about the tattoos show the importance of the courts' second directive in Abrego Garcia's case \u2014 that he be given the due process he should have had before he was shipped off to El Salvador.",
      "\"The term sounds legalistic, but it means a notice and an opportunity to be heard by a court. Mr. Abrego Garcia did not get that,\" Leopold said.",
      "\"Due process would have given him a chance to defend himself\" and to \"test the government\u2019s evidence against him,\" he added.",
      "The Supreme Court ruled that Abrego Garcia\u2019s removal was \u201cillegal\u201d and that Xinis\u2019 order \u201cproperly requires the Government to \u2018facilitate\u2019 Abrego Garcia\u2019s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\u201d",
      "In an interview with CBS News that aired Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said,\u00a0\"If he were to be brought back to the United States of America, we would immediately deport him again.\u201d",
      "At an April 15 court hearing, Xinis said she was frustrated at the government's failure to comply with her orders about what efforts it had taken and would take to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia, and she suggested she was weighing contempt proceedings down the road.",
      "She directed government officials to answer questions under oath and sit for depositions, a directive she paused after the government put in a sealed filing asking for more time. The Justice Department put in a second such request this week, which she denied Wednesday.",
      "Xinis ordered the administration to comply with her discovery orders by May 9.",
      "In a statement, the law firm representing Abrego Garcia, Murray Osorio PLLC, said it \"will seek to determine who in the U.S. government has taken action to facilitate Mr. Abrego Garcia\u2019s return, what specific steps they\u2019ve taken, and who may have worked to block those efforts. These questions demand answers\u2014and through discovery, we intend to obtain them.\"",
      "It added that \"we will pursue every legal avenue to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia\u2019s return home to his family, so that he can get a full and fair trial on the allegations against him, and we won\u2019t rest until that day comes.\""

      "\u201cWe\u2019re citizens. That\u2019s what I kept saying. We\u2019re citizens,\u201d the woman told KFOR, an NBC-affiliated local TV news station. \u201cThey were very dismissive, very rough, very careless.\"",
      "According to KFOR, which first reported the story, the immigration agents raided the home last week. They had a search warrant for the home, but the suspects listed on the warrant were not living in the house anymore.",
      "About 20 armed agents busted through the door in the middle of the night, KFOR reported.",
      "At first, the mother didn't know who they were. \u201cIt was dark. All the lights were off,\u201d she said. \"My initial thought was we were being robbed \u2014 that my daughters, being females, were being kidnapped.\"",
      "The mother, whose identity was not revealed and who KFOR referred to by the pseudonym \"Marisa\" in its reporting, told the TV station the men who entered her home identified themselves as federal agents with the U.S. Marshals Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigations and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"The U.S. Marshal Service was not involved in the incident,\" Brady McCarron, deputy chief of public affairs at the United States Marshals Service, told NBC News in an email Tuesday.",

      "\u201cThe search warrants included the location of an address where U.S. citizens recently moved. The previous residents were the intended targets,\" the official said.",
      "The mother and her daughters wrongly targeted had recently moved from Maryland, settling in the rented home in Oklahoma City just a couple of weeks ago \u2014 hoping for a slower, more affordable lifestyle, KFOR reported. The father was set to join the family in their new home this weekend.",
      "Though none of the family members were the subjects of the warrant, federal agents raided their home and confiscated their belongings. They took their phones, laptops and all their cash savings as \"evidence,\" KFOR reported.",
      "\"I said you took my phone. We have no money. I just moved here,\u201d the mother said. \u201cI have to feed my children. I\u2019m going to need gas money. I need to be able to get around. Like, how do you just leave me like this? Like an abandoned dog.\u201d",
      "\u201cI kept pleading. I kept telling them we weren\u2019t criminals. They were treating us like criminals. We were here by ourselves. We didn\u2019t do anything,\" the mother added.",
      "She said the agents ordered her and her daughters to step outside, even though it was raining and they barely were given time to put on clothes.",
      "\u201cThey wanted me to change in front of all of them, in between all of them,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband has not even seen my daughter in her undergarments \u2014 her own dad, because it\u2019s respectful. You have her out there, a minor, in her underwear,\u201d the woman told KFOR.",
      "\u201cOne of them said, \u2018I know it was a little rough this morning,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so denigrating. That you do all of this to a family, to women, your fellow citizens. And it was a little rough? You literally traumatized me and my daughters for life. We\u2019re going to have to go get help or get over this somehow.\u201d",
      "Before the agents left, the mother asked when could the family get their belongings back and they said it could be days or even months, KFOR reported.",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long claimed a secret database holds the truth about vaccines and autism. Now that he's in charge, his anti-vaccine supporters wonder \u2014 can he deliver?",
    "story": [
      "For as long as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has falsely claimed that vaccines cause widespread harm \u2014 from autism to sudden death \u2014 he has pointed to the one source he says could immediately prove it.",
      "In speeches, interviews and writings, Kennedy has repeatedly claimed that the evidence of a massive public health cover-up lies buried in a little-known database of medical records of some 12 million Americans: the Vaccine Safety Datalink, or VSD.",
      "\u201cFor decades, the CDC has kept a tight grip on the Vaccine Safety Datalink, concealing vital vaccine safety information from the public,\u201d Kennedy said in 2023.",
      "Kennedy now oversees the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 including the Vaccine Safety Datalink \u2014 and one of his first initiatives as health secretary was to launch his long-dreamed-of study using the VSD to investigate the link between childhood vaccines and autism. It\u2019s a theory that has already been disproven in dozens of studies, many using VSD data.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to get into these databases and give answers to the American public,\u201d Kennedy said last month. He told President Donald Trump at recent Cabinet meeting that he would reveal the cause of autism by September.",
      "However, in recent weeks, Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine allies have begun casting doubt on this pledge, once again alleging a government conspiracy to block access to the truth.",
      "Without evidence, anti-vaccine lawyer Aaron Siri and activist Del Bigtree have claimed on the internet show \"The HighWire\" that the CDC scattered the vaccine safety data after Kennedy took office, making it unavailable for Kennedy\u2019s team to examine. The goal, according to Siri, was to \u201cthwart the ability for the current administration to actually conduct a study in the VSD.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a pattern that has echoed through the first months of the Trump administration: Onetime outsiders who had long asserted that the federal government was hiding the truth suddenly had access to all the government documents they could want \u2014\u00a0only to reveal that, perhaps, there were no nefarious secrets after all. The JFK assassination files exposed little about his killing that wasn\u2019t already known. The release of records in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case was a dud. Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s claims that millions of people over 100 were receiving Social Security quickly fell apart.",
      "Now, it appears that anti-vaccine activists are similarly girding for the possibility that Kennedy\u2019s promises may fall short \u2014\u00a0and they\u2019re already laying the groundwork for someone to blame.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been saying that database is where the answers are,\u201d Bigtree, who was communications director for Kennedy\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign, said of the VSD on \u201cThe HighWire\u201d last week. \u201cYou could do the study in probably minutes with AI and computer learning and everything that\u2019s possible. Then the moment before Bobby gets in there to be able to do that study, what did they do? They obliterated it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not clear exactly what Bigtree and Siri meant; neither responded to requests for comment. Kennedy also didn\u2019t respond. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services initially said he would \u201clook into it,\u201d but did not respond to further requests for comment.\u00a0A CDC spokesperson confirmed that nothing about the stewardship of VSD data had changed in the last year.",
      "There\u2019s one thing that Bigtree and Siri have right: The data in the VSD is not actually housed at the CDC \u2014\u00a0but that\u2019s not a recent change.",
      "The VSD is a collaboration between a small team at the CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office and 11 private health care organizations. Since the 1990s, it\u2019s been used to monitor vaccine safety and conduct studies of rare side effects.",
      "\u201cThese studies that use the VSD are able to tell the difference between a condition that coincidentally happens after vaccination and a condition that may actually be the result of vaccination,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.",
      "The health care organizations used to send their anonymized medical data to the CDC each year for analysis, but since 2001, the organizations have kept the data on their own servers, to ensure it stays secure.",
      "\u201cSometimes people have the image that if there\u2019s a vaccine safety study, there must be one giant database with all the information in it,\u201d Sharfstein said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with how distributed networks of data are designed and used in studies, then it can be confusing. Because there is no one big dataset. There is no single file that can just be sent or released.\u201d",
      "The conspiracy lore around the VSD began in the early aughts, around the time that Kennedy, then an environmental lawyer, was being introduced to the anti-vaccine movement.",
      "At that point, the only groups with access to the VSD were the CDC and the participating health care organizations. The studies they produced relied on the data they collected, including from doctor and hospital visits, vaccinations, pharmacies and lab results.",
      "Then in 2002, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who had a grandson he believed had been injured by vaccines, allied with several parent-led autism groups. Frustrated with anti-vaccine researchers\u2019 lack of access to data that might prove the link, Burton threatened to subpoena the VSD\u2019s patient records.",
      "At a hearing on the topic, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., urged Burton not to do it.",
      "\u201cA subpoena could have the effect of driving HMOs from the program and destroying CDC\u2019s ability to scientifically test hypotheses relating to adverse events potentially associated with vaccines,\u201d Waxman warned, referring to the health care organizations. (Burton and Waxman left Congress in the mid-2010s.)",
      "Subpoenaing millions of medical records \u201cwould have been a profound invasion of privacy,\u201d said Johns Hopkins\u2019 Sharfstein.",
      "The CDC offered a solution: It would work with the participating health organizations to get independent researchers access to the data. Among the earliest beneficiaries \u2014 with the help of  former Rep. Dave Weldon, R-Fla., the recently withdrawn CDC director nominee \u2014 were the anti-vaccine researchers Mark and David Geier, a father-son pair who baselessly theorized that autism was the result of an interaction between a preservative in vaccines and testosterone.",
      "(Mark Geier died this year in Florida, over a decade after being stripped of his medical license in several states, partly for improperly treating autistic children with hormone blockers. David Geier, who was disciplined by the Maryland Board of Physicians for practicing medicine without a license in 2012, was hired at HHS this year as a senior data analyst to reanalyze vaccine safety data under Kennedy, according to two sources familiar with the plan.)",
      "The Geiers' work with VSD data was marked by alleged ethical breaches. In 2003 and\u00a02004, the Geiers visited the CDC\u2019s Maryland data center to access VSD data for a study looking at whether the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine increased risks for harmful side effects.",
      "Instead, according to a letter of complaint from one of the health care groups, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, the Geiers violated protocol and began comparing rates of autism in children who received vaccines with different amounts of a preservative. Further, Kaiser Permanente said the Geiers tried to merge datasets in a way that would have risked patients\u2019 confidentiality, then tried to remove files from the datacenter. Subsequently, Kaiser Permanente suspended the Geiers' access to the VSD.",
      "The Geiers denied the accusations and published their findings in journals known more for conspiracy theories than rigorous science. At an Institute of Medicine panel in 2004, Mark Geier claimed the VSD data they analyzed showed that vaccines were linked to autism. Their published papers have been widely criticized by scientists and their findings never replicated or supported by mainstream research.",
      "In 2006, they were approved for another study using VSD data, and again, stopped after violating protocol, according to lawyers representing the government in a set of test cases known as the Omnibus Autism Proceedings. Lawyers representing the parents of autistic children \u2014 for whom the Geiers had been providing research \u2014 suggested in legal filings that the Geiers had been unfairly banned at the whims of CDC.",
      "For the Geiers, the experience was one of oppression. At anti-vaccine conferences, they presented PowerPoints alleging that the CDC had \u201crestricted\u201d their access to data and \u201cattacked\u201d their findings.",
      "At the same conferences, Kennedy, who has consistently praised the Geiers, told a similar story.",
      "\u201cOh, they\u2019ve hidden it, and they won\u2019t let anybody in it, except their own guys who cherry-pick and design these fabricated studies and change the protocols constantly to try to use it to defend vaccines,\u201d Kennedy said in a 2017 keynote at AutismOne, an anti-vaccine conference for parents of autistic children where the Geiers also presented. \u201cIt\u2019s being used instead to craft these fabricated, fraudulent studies,\u201d he said, \u201cto fool the public about vaccine safety.\u201d",
      "That same year, as Trump considered chairing a committee to review vaccine safety, Kennedy and a group of anti-vaccine activists met with Francis Collins, then the director of the National Institutes of Health, to ask him to \u201copen up\u201d the VSD to scientists who would \u201cinvestigate whether vaccines are associated with the epidemic of health disorders plaguing our children today.\u201d",
      "In a letter following the meeting, Collins, who resigned from the NIH last month, told Kennedy that because of privacy concerns, access was limited to researchers who made formal requests and met certain criteria. Further, Collins said the kind of study Kennedy had suggested would be difficult because the sample population of unvaccinated children in the VSD \u2014 already just a fraction of the U.S. population \u2014 would be too small.",
      "Now, with Kennedy at the helm of HHS and Geier working for him, there are no roadblocks left."

    "story": [
      "A Florida-based Christian organization with a history of child sex abuse allegations against it has been hit with a lawsuit claiming one of its missionaries sexually assaulted a minor overseas 15 years ago.",
      "Ethnos360, a nonprofit formerly known as New Tribes Mission, sends missionaries and their families throughout the globe. In 2019, multiple women told NBC News that they had been sexually abused decades earlier by their \u201cdorm dads\u201d \u2014 missionaries who were supposed to care for children at the mission\u2019s boarding schools while their parents served in foreign countries.",
      "The group settled several suits related to those allegations and issued a public apology to the abuse survivors following the 2019 NBC News report. It also said it had \u201cincorporated significant child safety training\u201d after an independent party commissioned by New Tribes Mission shared recommendations in 2010 amid the abuse allegations.",
      "But Wednesday's lawsuit, filed in Circuit Court in Seminole County, Florida, says the group \u201cfailed to offer any care or professional assistance\u201d to the family of an American child who came forward to report inappropriate sexual conduct in 2012, two years after those recommendations were issued.",
      "The girl, Kayla McClain, is now 24, lives in Michigan and recently graduated from nursing school. NBC News does not normally identify alleged victims of sexual assault, but McClain opted to be identified by her full name in the legal filing.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m tired of being quiet and tired of being invisible,\u201d McClain said in her first public remarks about the case. \u201cI just want people to know what really happened and that there\u2019s actually a face and a name behind what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "David Doyle, an attorney for Ethnos360, said the group \u201ctakes allegations of this nature very seriously\u201d\u00a0and \u201ccategorically denies any merit to allegations made against it.\u201d",
      "McClain was around 5 years old in 2005 when she met her alleged abuser, Nate Horling, the lawsuit said. Like McClain and her family, Horling lived with his wife and children in housing in Indonesia provided by what was then New Tribes Mission. He had a child about McClain\u2019s age whom McClain would play with, the legal complaint said, adding that the alleged abuse by Horling started with inappropriate touching while McClain was playing with his child. Afterward, Horling would allegedly tell McClain \u201che was sorry and instructed her not to tell anyone and blamed her for what occurred,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The abuse escalated after both families relocated to a different part of Indonesia in 2009, where Horling later allegedly sexually assaulted McClain in a closet, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Horling, who is not named as a defendant, told NBC News in an email that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d denies all allegations.",
      "The lawsuit comes less than a year after another legal filing against Ethnos360, which alleged the group failed to protect a girl from repeated sexual misconduct by a peer at its missionary training center in Missouri in 2016 and failed to adequately investigate the abuse allegations.",
      "That lawsuit is ongoing, though Ethnos360 has filed a motion to dismiss it, arguing in court documents that because the alleged abuse occurred in private residences on Ethnos360 property, not while children were under Ethnos360 staff supervision, the group did not have \u201cany right and /or duty to control, occupy, or monitor the families and activities within the residences.\u201d",
      "Boz Tchividjian, the attorney who filed last year\u2019s lawsuit as well as Wednesday\u2019s, said Ethnos360 needs to examine why it has faced so many allegations of inappropriate behavior.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not in a vacuum. This is over, and over, and over again,\u201d said Tchividjian, who was the founder and former executive director of Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment, or GRACE, the group hired to make the 2010 recommendations on handling abuse to Ethnos360 when it was called New Tribes Mission. He is no longer part of GRACE.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s lawsuit said the GRACE report outlined multiple instances of sexual abuse within Ethnos360 and accused the organization\u2019s leadership of failing to properly respond to child sexual abuse allegations. On its website, Ethnos360 acknowledges past missteps and has a section dedicated to child safety, in which it says it has safeguards to protect kids, including background checks for anyone applying for Ethnos360 membership and specialized training for all new members.",
      "Yet the lawsuit claims that when McClain\u2019s family contacted Ethnos360\u2019s child safety leadership team in Indonesia, there was limited response.",
      "McClain said her father had reached out to the child safety team in 2012 after she disclosed to her parents that she was engaging in sexual conduct with other children \u2014 a behavior that can be an indicator of a child being abused by an adult. The lawsuit said that several members spoke with her parents in the months that followed but did not open an investigation into the sexualized behavior. It also said Ethnos360 did not offer any care or help to McClain or the other minors and acted as if the conduct \u201cwas typical sexual exploration between children.\u201d",
      "McClain said it was not until years later that her parents found out she had been sexually abused by an adult. Her attorney said that, at that time, her emotional state was too fragile to consider filing charges.",
      "\u201cThe child safety team never talked to me. I really needed someone who was trained to and knew how to talk to a kid in this situation, because I didn\u2019t know how to share what had happened,\u201d McClain said.",
      "McClain started struggling profoundly with her mental health in 2018 once she and her family returned to the United States from Indonesia, the lawsuit said, adding that she had flashbacks of her alleged abuse and attempted to take her own life in 2019. After undergoing treatment, she decided to report her experience to Ethnos360 in 2021 through IHART, a review team commissioned by Ethnos360 to investigate claims of abuse, according to the lawsuit. After several hours-long interviews, Ethnos360 allegedly offered no counseling to McClain and did not report the allegations to child protection agencies, the lawsuit said.",
      "The lawsuit accuses Ethnos360 of negligence in failing to protect McClain from abuse and failing to provide adequate training to its employees to identify and report child abuse. It seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial.",
      "McClain said her experience has caused her to have post-traumatic stress disorder and has made her question her view of God.",
      "\u201cThe abuse that happened was horrible, but what has really affected me is the response from Ethnos and the child safety team and IHART,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to be held accountable. I want the silence to stop.\u201d",

      "YORK, Pa. \u2014 An officer killed while responding to a Pennsylvania hospital siege was struck by a shotgun blast fired by police that also hit an armed man holding hostages, a prosecutor disclosed at a news conference Wednesday.",
      "The attacker and West York Patrolman Andrew W. Duarte were killed in the gunfire in York on Feb. 22, while several other people were injured.",
      "The shotgun blast also wounded a second officer responding to the intensive care unit, York County District Attorney Tim Barker said in announcing the results of his investigation.",
      "Barker called the officers heroes who ran into a dangerous situation, ready to risk their lives and save hostages. He said attacker Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz \u201cunleashed a torrent of evil\u201d and directly caused Duarte\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cI looked at every moment of video and I saw on every person\u2019s face that willingness to walk into, to run into the path of gunfire and potential death. They were willing to lay down their lives for every single person at that hospital,\u201d Barker said. He called their actions \u201c100% justified and legally appropriate.\u201d",
      "The attack at UPMC Memorial Hospital occurred after the gunman learned from a doctor that the woman he lived with had died after treatment there, Barker told reporters. Investigators seeking a motive in Archangel-Ortiz\u2019s \u201cmental state\u201d came up empty, he said.",
      "\u201cThere was no description provided whatsoever that would lead anyone to have believed that the actor was going to commit this type of mass violence,\u201d Barker said.",
      "Duarte\u2019s last act was to run toward the threat, Chief Matthew Millsaps had said previously at the officer\u2019s funeral.",
      "Archangel-Ortiz, 49, had purchased zip ties and a knife that morning and used a gun stolen in 2017 from a neighboring county during the attack, Barker said. He said Archangel-Ortiz appeared to become nauseous when a doctor told him the woman had been moved to the hospital morgue.",
      "Moments later, he displayed a gun and announced: \u201cThis is what we\u2019re going to talk about,\u201d Barker said. Archangel-Ortiz shot the doctor, grazing his arm and piercing a jacket. The doctor, who had texted to warn colleagues of the gunman, fled from the ICU.",
      "What ensued was a chaotic series of events in which Archangel-Ortiz threatened hostages and patients and made one hospital worker zip tie others. A hospital worker who had been shot in the leg was able to flee and lock herself in a bathroom.",
      "Barker said Archangel-Ortiz also called his brother during the siege, telling him to clean up his home and give away his jewelry. \u201cThis is how I\u2019m going out,\u201d Archangel-0rtiz told his brother, Barker said.",
      "Police tried to negotiate and de-escalate the crisis, Barker said, as they also organized teams at the intensive care doors and formulated a plan to have officers follow someone with a tactical shield into the unit.",
      "He said Duarte was hit in the shoulder and chest.",
      "In all, Barker said, four workers were hurt \u2014 the doctor and worker who were shot, a third person with head trauma and a fourth with a minor injury. Two police officers were shot, a third was injured by shrapnel and Duarte was killed. He did not disclose the name of the officer who fired the shotgun.",
      "When police recovered Archangel-Ortiz\u2019s 9mm handgun, it was not loaded.",
      "Barker said they had no details on why Archangel-Ortiz did what he did, noting, \u201csometimes there is no \u2018why.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only thing that we can state is that he, on his own, decided to enter UPMC that day, fully prepared to take hostages and kill people,\u201d Barker said.",
      "Some of the nurses who survived the attack have shared their accounts in social media, disclosing details about injuries and treatment and how the attack has haunted the survivors. The attack highlighted rising violence against U.S. health care workers and the challenges of protecting them.",
      "Nurse Tosha Trostle said in a Facebook post that she was held against him as a shield at gunpoint, arms zip-tied behind her back, as they walked through a doorway and encountered a phalanx of responding police officers. She said she begged Archangel-Ortiz to let her go and that he pushed the gun against her neck and spine. She heard gunshots and fell onto the floor under his body, then was able to get to safety."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans are already hitting some snags as they begin the work of crafting a bill for President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping domestic policy agenda. And they haven\u2019t even made some of their hardest decisions yet.",
      "Fresh off a two-week recess, House committees have begun marking up their respective pieces of the package, which aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, boost funding for immigration enforcement and the military, and increase the debt ceiling. In their hunt for steep savings to pay for it all, Republicans are starting with some of the lowest-hanging fruit when it comes to spending cuts.",
      "But that process has already sparked some skirmishes among Republican lawmakers, offering a preview of the bigger intraparty fights \u2014 such as whether to slash funding for anti-poverty programs like Medicaid \u2014 that are still to come.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., the chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, on Wednesday was forced at the eleventh hour to yank a provision out of his panel\u2019s portion of the package that would have created a new $20 annual fee on nearly all passenger vehicles after conservatives revolted.",
      "Separately, on the Judiciary Committee, a push by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., to codify Trump\u2019s proposal of a \u201cgold card\u201d visa for wealthy foreigners was rejected by conservatives opposed to expanding visa programs.",
      "And on the Education and Workforce Committee, Chairman Tim Walberg, R-Mich., on Tuesday pushed through an overhaul of student loan programs that would cut $351 billion in federal spending, drawing criticisms from Democrats. The most contentious part of that overhaul, Walberg said, is a \u201crisk-sharing\u201d provision that would make colleges, universities and trade schools partially responsible for unpaid student loan balances.",
      "\u201cAll the committees are making tough decisions, and we\u2019re gonna build this bill,\u201d said Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest caucus of conservatives on Capitol Hill.",
      "After passing their budget framework for Trump\u2019s \u201cone big beautiful bill\u201d earlier this month, House Republicans are now trying to fill out the details.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he thinks the House can cobble together all the separate pieces and send the package to the Senate by Memorial Day \u2014 an ambitious but not impossible deadline. But it means Republican leaders, committee chairpeople and rank-and-file members are now having the politically tricky conversations about how to pay for the bill and what might get cut.",
      "And every House Republican\u2019s opinion matters in the process because of the party's fragile 220-213 majority.",
      "\u201cJust about every step of the way has been difficult with a small majority,\u201d Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters, adding that he\u2019s also had \u201ca lot\u201d of conversations with senators as well to make sure both chambers are on the same page.",
      "Perhaps the trickiest issue Republicans still need to resolve is how to handle potential Medicaid cuts, which vulnerable and moderate Republicans have strongly warned against.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the program and is responsible for finding a whopping $880 billion in cuts for the bill, is planning to hold a markup on May 7, but has to finalize its portion of the package. The committee\u2019s chairman has been meeting with members from all across the ideological spectrum as they try to find a solution.",
      "But even smaller, less innocuous issues can trip up the entire process. The vehicle fee was an example of an issue that unexpectedly blew up at the last minute. Graves, the Transportation Committee chairman, had included the provision in his panel\u2019s package to help meet the committee\u2019s so-called \"reconciliation\" instructions, which dictate what each panel is required to cut or allowed to spend.",
      "Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., the former chair of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, offered an amendment to kill it as conservatives disparaged it as a \u201ccar tax.\u201d Graves\u2019 team checked in with committee members to gauge support for the fee, two Republican sources said, but it became clear there was too much opposition and Graves made the call Tuesday night to pull it from the package.",
      "The committee was then forced to find other ways to hit its saving goals. The package will now boost an annual fee for electric vehicles to $250, up from the originally proposed $200, as well as reduce funding for air traffic control modernization to $12.5 billion, down from the initial $15 billion that was proposed.",
      "\u201cEV owners have not been paying anything into the highway trust fund and justifiably, now they will,\u201d said Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, who opposed the $20 passenger car fee. \u201cI\u2019m very glad there won\u2019t be any fees on gasoline driven vehicles whose owners and drivers have already been paying their fair share into the highway trust fund through the federal gasoline tax.\u201d",
      "Another GOP spat emerged on the Judiciary Committee over visas. Issa, a senior member of the panel, had hoped to include in Wednesday\u2019s committee\u2019s markup Trump\u2019s idea to sell $5 million gold card visas that would offer immigrants legal permanent residency and a path to citizenship.",
      "Issa argued the proposal could bring in at least an additional $150 billion to pay for the bill. But Issa said another member of the panel, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, effectively vetoed the idea.",
      "\u201cI got screwed out of the gold card because a few of our members wouldn\u2019t go along with having an expansion of revenue related to visas, EB-5 and H-1,\u201d Issa said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cThe president\u2019s point [is] that we should be able to generate revenue by bringing the investors in to invest, and we have a program that brings in very little by comparison. But Chip killed it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would be voting for reconciliation,\u201d Issa added, \u201cbut I would be disappointed when it\u2019s left out.\u201d",
      "Roy did not respond to a request for comment. A Judiciary Committee spokesman suggested that Republicans still could revisit the gold card issue.",
      "\"We are working hand-in-glove with the White House and totally support President Trump's agenda,\" spokesman Russell Dye said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "These types of decisions, however, are the easy ones. The hard ones will need to be resolved in the coming days and weeks. On Wednesday afternoon, Johnson hosted a meeting with Republicans from blue states like New York, New Jersey and California who are aggressively pushing to raise the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction in the package.",
      "The House Ways and Means Committee, where that issue will be decided, will likely meet sometime next week.",
      "\"It was a lively discussion but we're still far away from a deal,\" Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., said as he left the nearly hourlong SALT meeting. \"I want to ensure we make whole as many of our middle class families as possible.\"",
      "On Medicaid, Republicans facing tough re-election fights in the 2026 midterm elections are worried it\u2019s not mathematically possible to achieve their spending targets without a steep cut to Medicaid, citing estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Republican leaders have said they only want to target waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicaid system. Leaving a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chair of the Budget Committee, reiterated that the GOP wants to impose work requirements for Medicaid eligibility to raise the revenue needed to fund Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cThe whole idea of using Medicaid to help able-bodied people who could be working, most Americans will say no to,\u201d Graham said. \u201cMedicaid was designed to help poor people and disabled people \u2026 We got a chance to fix it. And if we fail, I think we\u2019ll pay a heavy price.\u201d"

      "The White House announced Wednesday night that it had signed an economic partnership with Ukraine that includes an agreement on the ownership and extraction of natural resources from the war-torn nation.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the agreement, established as the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, will allow the United States to \"invest alongside Ukraine\" to unlock its growth assets and ultimately accelerate its economic recovery.",
      "\u201cAs the President has said, the United States is committed to helping facilitate the end of this cruel and senseless war. This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\" Bessent said in a statement. \"President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides\u2019 commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.",
      "\"And to be clear, no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine,\" he added.",

      "Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, provided more details about the minerals deal outlined in the agreement, first saying on X that \"it is the Ukrainian state that determines what and where to extract\" and that \"subsoil remains under Ukrainian ownership.\"",
      "Ukraine and the United States will jointly manage and maintain co-ownership of the investment fund, with neither side holding a dominant vote, Svyrydenko said. It will be financed by new Ukrainian oil, gas and critical mineral licenses, with 50% of all revenue from the licenses going toward the fund.",
      "\"The fund will then invest in extraction projects for critical materials, oil, and gas \u2014 as well as in related infrastructure and processing. Specific investment projects will be selected jointly by Ukraine and the US. Importantly, the Fund may invest exclusively in Ukraine,\" she said on X.",
      "Svyrydenko indicated in her post that the United States will also contribute to the fund, through it is unclear exactly how much. She added that contributions to the fund will not be taxed in either Ukraine or the United States to ensure \u201cmaximum effectiveness of the investment process.\"",
      "Trump said earlier Wednesday that the agreement would serve as an avenue for the United States to recoup funds it has provided to Ukraine throughout its war with Russia, a figure the State Department has placed at $66.5 billion in terms of military assistance.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t want to make a complicated deal,\" Trump said at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday. \"Rare earth is called rare for a reason, and they have a lot, and we made a deal where our money is secure, where we can start digging and doing what we have to do.\"",
      "It is unclear how much of the money will go toward repaying the United States. Svyrydenko said in her post that the agreement \"includes no provisions regarding any Ukrainian debt obligations to the United States.\"",
      "The agreement was signed days after Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Rome on the sidelines of Pope Francis\u2019 funeral. Trump suggested the pair\u2019s relationship had improved since their Oval Office clash in February, characterizing the meeting as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and expressing confidence that Zelenskyy \u201cwants to make a deal\" to end the war.",
      "Trump\u2019s ire was instead directed at Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Trump criticized for carrying out widespread strikes on Kyiv despite U.S. officials' ongoing effort to secure a plan to end the war, which began in February 2022.",
      "Putin met with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff on Friday for roughly three hours in Moscow, with a Putin aide later describing their discussion as \"productive.\"",
      "After the meeting, Trump urged Ukraine and Russia to hold \"very high-level\" ceasefire talks, adding that the two sides are \"very close to a deal\" to end the war. The two countries have not held direct talks since the\u00a0early days of Russia\u2019s invasion."

It also said it had \u201cincorporated significant child safety training\u201d after an independent party commissioned by New Tribes Mission shared recommendations in 2010 amid the abuse allegations.",
      "But Wednesday's lawsuit, filed in Circuit Court in Seminole County, Florida, says the group \u201cfailed to offer any care or professional assistance\u201d to the family of an American child who came forward to report inappropriate sexual conduct in 2012, two years after those recommendations were issued.",
      "The girl, Kayla McClain, is now 24, lives in Michigan and recently graduated from nursing school. NBC News does not normally identify alleged victims of sexual assault, but McClain opted to be identified by her full name in the legal filing.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m tired of being quiet and tired of being invisible,\u201d McClain said in her first public remarks about the case. \u201cI just want people to know what really happened and that there\u2019s actually a face and a name behind what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "David Doyle, an attorney for Ethnos360, said the group \u201ctakes allegations of this nature very seriously\u201d\u00a0and \u201ccategorically denies any merit to allegations made against it.\u201d",
      "McClain was around 5 years old in 2005 when she met her alleged abuser, Nate Horling, the lawsuit said. Like McClain and her family, Horling lived with his wife and children in housing in Indonesia provided by what was then New Tribes Mission. He had a child about McClain\u2019s age whom McClain would play with, the legal complaint said, adding that the alleged abuse by Horling started with inappropriate touching while McClain was playing with his child. Afterward, Horling would allegedly tell McClain \u201che was sorry and instructed her not to tell anyone and blamed her for what occurred,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The abuse escalated after both families relocated to a different part of Indonesia in 2009, where Horling later allegedly sexually assaulted McClain in a closet, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Horling, who is not named as a defendant, told NBC News in an email that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d denies all allegations.",
      "The lawsuit comes less than a year after another legal filing against Ethnos360, which alleged the group failed to protect a girl from repeated sexual misconduct by a peer at its missionary training center in Missouri in 2016 and failed to adequately investigate the abuse allegations.",
      "That lawsuit is ongoing, though Ethnos360 has filed a motion to dismiss it, arguing in court documents that because the alleged abuse occurred in private residences on Ethnos360 property, not while children were under Ethnos360 staff supervision, the group did not have \u201cany right and /or duty to control, occupy, or monitor the families and activities within the residences.\u201d",
      "Boz Tchividjian, the attorney who filed last year\u2019s lawsuit as well as Wednesday\u2019s, said Ethnos360 needs to examine why it has faced so many allegations of inappropriate behavior.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not in a vacuum. This is over, and over, and over again,\u201d said Tchividjian, who was the founder and former executive director of Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment, or GRACE, the group hired to make the 2010 recommendations on handling abuse to Ethnos360 when it was called New Tribes Mission. He is no longer part of GRACE.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s lawsuit said the GRACE report outlined multiple instances of sexual abuse within Ethnos360 and accused the organization\u2019s leadership of failing to properly respond to child sexual abuse allegations. On its website, Ethnos360 acknowledges past missteps and has a section dedicated to child safety, in which it says it has safeguards to protect kids, including background checks for anyone applying for Ethnos360 membership and specialized training for all new members.",
      "Yet the lawsuit claims that when McClain\u2019s family contacted Ethnos360\u2019s child safety leadership team in Indonesia, there was limited response.",
      "McClain said her father had reached out to the child safety team in 2012 after she disclosed to her parents that she was engaging in sexual conduct with other children \u2014 a behavior that can be an indicator of a child being abused by an adult. The lawsuit said that several members spoke with her parents in the months that followed but did not open an investigation into the sexualized behavior. It also said Ethnos360 did not offer any care or help to McClain or the other minors and acted as if the conduct \u201cwas typical sexual exploration between children.\u201d",
      "McClain said it was not until years later that her parents found out she had been sexually abused by an adult. Her attorney said that, at that time, her emotional state was too fragile to consider filing charges.",
      "\u201cThe child safety team never talked to me. I really needed someone who was trained to and knew how to talk to a kid in this situation, because I didn\u2019t know how to share what had happened,\u201d McClain said.",
      "McClain started struggling profoundly with her mental health in 2018 once she and her family returned to the United States from Indonesia, the lawsuit said, adding that she had flashbacks of her alleged abuse and attempted to take her own life in 2019. After undergoing treatment, she decided to report her experience to Ethnos360 in 2021 through IHART, a review team commissioned by Ethnos360 to investigate claims of abuse, according to the lawsuit. After several hours-long interviews, Ethnos360 allegedly offered no counseling to McClain and did not report the allegations to child protection agencies, the lawsuit said.",
      "The lawsuit accuses Ethnos360 of negligence in failing to protect McClain from abuse and failing to provide adequate training to its employees to identify and report child abuse. It seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial.",
      "McClain said her experience has caused her to have post-traumatic stress disorder and has made her question her view of God.",
      "\u201cThe abuse that happened was horrible, but what has really affected me is the response from Ethnos and the child safety team and IHART,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to be held accountable. I want the silence to stop.\u201d",
      "If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, call the National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673. The hotline, run by the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), can put you in contact with your local rape crisis center. You can also access RAINN\u2019s online chat service at www.rainn.org/get-help. Confidential chats are available in English and in Spanish.",

    "summary": "Nearly every NBA first round playoff series has featured a skirmish of some sort.",
    "story": [
      "A common refrain from NBA players and coaches this time of year is that the playoffs are a completely different sport than the regular season.",
      "The pace of play slows down, referees swallow their whistles in favor of physicality, and the familiarity that grows between teams over the course of a series makes it harder and harder to win.",
      "This year, that familiarity has also bred contempt, as nearly every series in the first round has featured a skirmish of some sort, or at the least spirited trash talk. Let\u2019s run through some of the postseason\u2019s more charged moments so far.",
      "Milwaukee Bucks vs. Indiana Pacers",
      "The Pacers won their series against the Bucks, 4-1, with a thrilling, come-from-behind victory Tuesday night. Except that\u2019s not what anyone is talking about after Milwaukee star Giannis Antetokounmpo got into an altercation with \u2014 of all people! \u2014 Indiana guard Tyrese Haliburton\u2019s dad after Game 5.",
      "Don\u2019t worry, Antetokounmpo also had a dustup with an actual player after the game as well.",
      "These two teams have a longstanding feud dating to last season. This series started with a war of words between Haliburton and Bucks guard Damian Lillard, who wasn\u2019t even suited up for Game 1.",
      "Predictably, that spilled over onto the floor the next game.",
      "Haliburton has since apologized for his father\u2019s actions. Haliburton and the Pacers also sent well wishes to Lillard after he tore his Achilles in Game 4.",
      "Houston Rockets vs. Golden State Warriors",
      "In the least surprising development of the playoffs, a matchup featuring the Warriors' Draymond Green and longtime pest Dillon Brooks of the Rockets has gotten a little extra physical. Tempers especially flared in Game 4, which featured technical fouls on both Green and Brooks, as well as a flagrant foul on Green.",
      "Warriors forward Jimmy Butler III made his feelings on Brooks clear after the Game 4, saying: \u201cGet me on the record with this: I don\u2019t like Dillon Brooks. We\u2019re never having fun. I\u2019m a fierce competitor. He\u2019s a fierce competitor. There ain\u2019t nothing fun about that.\u201d",
      "Denver Nuggets vs. Los Angeles Clippers",
      "The Nuggets and Clippers have also had some smoke for each other.",
      "Things started relatively tame in Game 1, when Los Angeles assistant coach Jeff Van Gundy wouldn\u2019t let go of the ball to stop Denver center Nikola Jokic from quickly starting a possession.",
      "The chippiness escalated in Game 3, when a hard foul by Denver's Christian Braun led to some shoving and six techs.",
      "New York Knicks vs. Detroit Pistons",
      "Not to be outdone, the battle between two historically nasty Eastern Conference teams, the Knicks and the Pistons, has also featured some fireworks. In Game 3, three technicals were handed out after some shoving.",
      "The first five games of the series have been very physical, to the point where refs may be missing some clear fouls.",
      "Minnesota Timberwolves vs. Los Angeles Lakers",
      "Compared to the feistiness elsewhere, this has been a relatively respectful series. But that didn\u2019t stop Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert from elbowing Lakers star LeBron James in the back of the head after Gobert took exception to a hard boxout.",
      "Boston Celtics vs. Orlando Magic",
      "The defending champion Celtics won their series against the Magic, 4-1, though not without a cost. The Magic committed three significant flagrant fouls in the series.",
      "In Game 1, Boston's Jayson Tatum injured his wrist on a foul by Orlando's Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, causing Tatum to miss Game 2.",
      "In Game 2, Boston's Kristaps Porzingis was bloodied after an elbow to the face.",
      "And in Game 3, Orlando's Cole Anthony dislocated one of Boston's Jaylen Brown\u2019s fingers with a flagrant foul.",
      "Miami Heat vs. Cleveland Cavaliers",
      "For fans of nonviolence, the Heat and Cavaliers had them covered.",
      "After Game 2, Cleveland guard Darius Garland said the team\u2019s game plan was to attack Miami\u2019s Tyler Herro.",
      "Herro responded before Game 3, saying Garland himself wasn\u2019t a very good defender.",
      "There was no showdown on the court, however, as Garland missed the last two games of the series as the Cavaliers cruised to a sweep."

      "Just before a judge ordered it to do so, the Trump administration agreed to resume paying for attorneys for migrant children who come to the United States alone.",
      "But groups that have been struggling to keep such unaccompanied children from being deported said the legal help is still in jeopardy under a Republican proposal put forward in a House committee Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI have been doing this work for a very long time, and what I read in this bill took by breath away,\u201d said Jennifer Podkul, vice president for policy and advocacy at Kids in Need of Defense. \u201cThis bill not only makes it impossible for children to access protection in the United States, but it would make the government responsible for putting children in even more compromised and dangerous conditions.\u201d",
      "The White House, the Department of Health and Human Services and the House Judiciary Committee, which considered the measure, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "U.S. District Judge Araceli Mart\u00ednez-Olguin, in California\u2019s Northern District, issued a preliminary injunction late Tuesday ordering the administration to resume the money for the legal assistance, which it had stopped in March.",
      "Several groups that provided the legal help sued after they were forced to abruptly lay off workers and scramble to find other help for unaccompanied migrant children with pending cases \u2014 including some who are victims of trafficking \u2014 and, in some instances, withdraw from the cases.",
      "Mart\u00ednez-Olguin had ordered the administration to resume paying for the attorneys in the case. But the plaintiff groups filed additional complaints with the court saying the administration refused to comply with that temporary restraining order. During that time, the administration appealed and also tried to have the judge recuse herself.",
      "Monday, on the eve of the deadline for Mart\u00ednez-Olguin's decision on the preliminary injunction, the administration signed a modified contract with the Acacia Center for Justice, said Adina Appelbaum, program director for the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights Immigration Impact Lab, which is representing some of the plaintiffs.",
      "Acacia had subcontracted more than 100 groups around the country to provide legal help to about 26,000 unaccompanied children.\u00a0The new contract is for a shorter period, Appelbaum said.",
      "But how long the funding will last could depend on what Congress does in the budget legislation currently being written. The measure considered by the House committee would omit money for attorneys for unaccompanied children, which Congress has paid for since 2009, according to immigration and anti-trafficking groups that reviewed the legislation, attorneys with the groups said.",
      "The measure also proposed a number of fees that would charge unaccompanied children and their parents or guardians whom they could end up with in the United States. They included $5,000 for arriving at the border between legal ports of entry, as well as sponsorship fees of up to $8,500.",
      "'A huge gift to traffickers'",
      "Members of organizations that assist unaccompanied children said the proposal, if it became law, would \u201cdismantle\u201d protections for unaccompanied children, with \"catastrophic\" implications for children seeking safety in the United States, including many who are trafficking victims within and outside the country.",
      "Jean Bruggeman, executive director of the Freedom Network, the country's largest coalition of anti-trafficking advocates and experts, said the United States has made \"impressive\" progress against human trafficking over the past 25 years.",
      "The measure considered by the committee, Bruggeman said, would be \"a huge gift to traffickers and an increase in vulnerability for children and families in the United States that will lead to more abuse and exploitation.\""

Economists were expecting the GDP to grow 0.4% in the first three months of the year, following an increase of 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024.",
      "The report also showed that consumer spending climbed 1.8%, the weakest pace since mid-2023, and that inflation remained firm.",
      "Following the GDP report, stock markets saw heavy declines, but finished the day higher.",

      "\u201cThis is Biden\u2019s Stock Market, not Trump\u2019s,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cI didn\u2019t take over until January 20th. Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers.\u201d",
      "Trump made a similar argument during a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, encouraging critics to \u201cgive us a pass on the first month,\u201d saying that they were \u201cgetting used to things, right?\u201d",
      "\u201cYou probably saw some numbers today, and I have to start off by saying that\u2019s Biden \u2014 that\u2019s not Trump,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe came in and I was very against everything that Biden was doing in terms of the economy. \u2026 We took over his mess in so many different ways.\u201d",

      "On Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued what sounded like an ultimatum to both sides, authorizing his spokesperson to announce: \u201cWe are now at the time to deliver concrete proposals. If there is not progress, the U.S. will step back as mediators.\u201d",
      "It was a harder line than Rubio had taken days earlier on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d when he told Kristen Welker: \u201cThis week is going to be a really important week in which we have to make a determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in.\u201d",
      "Fueling the president\u2019s frustration, according to aides, is Russia\u2019s bombing of Kyiv and other civilian targets more than a month after Ukraine accepted a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire.",
      "Trump\u2019s impatience also contributed to his unprecedented one-on-one with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at the Vatican, captured in that powerful image of the two leaders sitting knee-to-knee under the Michelangelo frescoes. And it was amplified when, on the flight home from Rome, Trump posted on Truth Social that Vladimir Putin\u2019s attacks on Ukrainian\u2019s cities \u201cmakes me think\u2026 he\u2019s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through \u2018Banking\u2019 or \u2018Secondary Sanctions?\u2019\u201d",

Notably, in Rubio\u2019s demand that both sides now had to produce concrete proposals or else the U.S. would withdraw from the talks, he put the onus on both Russia and Ukraine, not acknowledging Ukraine had already put a new proposal on the table.",
      "The U.S. and Ukraine agreed to the minerals deal Trump wanted Wednesday, one that was revised after the Oval Office blowup between him and Zelenskyy last month.",

    "story": [
      "The weight loss drug Wegovy treated a serious form of liver disease in about two-thirds of patients in a major clinical trial, according to the findings published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease \u2014 previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease \u2014 affects about 33% of adults in the U.S. About 5% to 7% have a more advanced form of the disease, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH. (Another type of liver disease, alcohol-associated liver disease, is caused by drinking.)",
      "Both conditions are the result of the body storing too much fat in the liver, said Dr. Sobia Laique, a liver doctor and the director of the Multidisciplinary MASLD Clinic at Cleveland Clinic. In people with MASH, the excess fat has started to cause inflammation, which over time can lead to scarring, or fibrosis.",
      "Left untreated, it can progress to liver failure and liver cancer, Laique said.",
      "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease is more common in people with obesity or Type 2 diabetes, according to the National Institutes of Health. An estimated 75% of overweight people and more than 90% of people with obesity have the disease.",
      "There\u2019s only one FDA-approved medication for MASH, called resmetirom, Laique said. However, the medication only helps about a quarter of patients and doesn\u2019t address the underlying conditions that drive the disease. Bariatric surgery is often the recommended treatment for those who can\u2019t resolve the condition through lifestyle changes, she added.",
      "\u201cThis is fairly monumental and really is going to be paradigm-changing,\u201d Laique said of the Wegovy trial results, \u201cbecause at least in the pharmacotherapy space, you don\u2019t have a comparable drug yet.\u201d She was not involved with the clinical trial.",
      "The trial, funded by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, included 800 patients with MASH from 37 countries. Patients either got a weekly 2.4 milligram dose of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, or a placebo, for 72 weeks.",
      "The trial found that about 63% of patients in the semaglutide group saw a reduction in liver inflammation, compared with 34.3% of people who got a placebo.",
      "Prior to starting the trial, the participants also had moderate to high levels of scar tissue in the liver, known as stage 2 or 3 fibrosis.",
      "About 37% of the semaglutide group saw improvements in their fibrosis, compared with 22.4% in the placebo group. The semaglutide group also saw other benefits, including a 10.5% average weight loss.",
      "Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina who was not involved in the study, said she was impressed, noting that once fibrosis has developed in patients, it\u2019s often difficult to reverse or treat the inflammation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly good news that semaglutide not only reduced inflammation but also that fibrosis regressed,\u201d Spratt said.",
      "Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina, said in an email that the results may offer hope for a condition with few treatment options but added that long-term data is to determine whether the improvements from the drug will reduce liver-related complications and death.",
      "\u201cThese findings represent a very promising step forward in the fight against a common, progressive, and often silent disease,\u201d McGowan said.",
      "The trial results add to the growing list of conditions that GLP-1s \u2014\u00a0 the class of drugs that includes Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic and Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro and Zepbound \u2014 can treat beyond diabetes and weight loss.",
      "Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved Wegovy to reduce heart disease risk in people with obesity. The agency also approved Zepbound for obstructive sleep apnea in December, and Ozempic to treat chronic kidney disease in patients with Type 2 diabetes in January. Researchers are also investigating whether the drugs are effective against Alzheimer\u2019s and alcohol addiction.",
      "Insurance companies are often reluctant to cover the drugs for weight; however, they\u2019ve shown willingness to cover them when approved for other conditions, such as heart disease risk and sleep apnea.",
      "In a release Wednesday, Novo Nordisk said the FDA could make a decision on whether to approve Wegovy for MASH as early as the end of the year.",
      "The FDA has granted the drug a priority review designation, the drugmaker said, meaning it will review the application in six months, rather than the standard nine-month window.",
      "Spratt noted that side effects can be a barrier for some who want to take Wegovy and similar weight loss drugs.",
      "The drug was well tolerated, according to the trial results. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, including nausea, diarrhea, constipation and vomiting. Side effects leading to people dropping out of the trial were 2.6% for the semaglutide group and 3.3% for the placebo group.",
      "Laique questioned whether patients would continue to see improvement after 72 weeks. She also noted that patients would likely have to continue taking the medication, or risk MASH coming back.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s significant weight loss, but then is it also durable weight loss?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the part people often forget about obesity management, it\u2019s two battles.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said in an interview with ABC News that he \"could\" have Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to the United States with one phone call, even though the administration has argued in court that the government has no ability to get him back.",
      "\u201cIf he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that. But he is not,\u201d Trump told ABC News' Terry Moran on Tuesday when he was asked whether he could not simply call Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and ask for Abrego Garcia's return. Trump and his allies have contended that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang in justifying his deportation \u2014 which Abrego Garcia's lawyers deny.",
      "\"I'm not the one making this decision,\" Trump added. \"We have lawyers that don't want to do this.\"",
      "At a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Trump said he had not spoken to Bukele about sending Abrego Garcia back.",
      "\"I really leave that to the lawyers,\" he said, adding, \"They know the laws, and we follow the laws exactly.\"",
      "A federal judge, an appeals court and the Supreme Court have all ordered the administration to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return after he was deported to a prison in El Salvador on March 15. Lawyers for the Justice Department have acknowledged in court filings that the deportation was a mistake because an immigration judge had ruled that while Abrego Garcia could be deported, he could not be sent back to his native El Salvador. But administration officials have also said that, because Abrego Garcia is in custody in El Salvador, the United States does not have the legal authority to bring him back.",
      "\"Abrego Garcia is being held in the sovereign, domestic custody of the independent nation of El Salvador. DHS does not have authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation,\" the Department of Homeland Security's general counsel said in one court filing.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi put it more succinctly this month: \u201cThat\u2019s up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That\u2019s not up to us. ... If they wanted to return him, we would facilitate it.\"",
      "Trump suggested in the ABC News interview that the admission of the mistake was the issue, not the error itself.",
      "\"Well, the lawyer that said it was a mistake was here a long time, was not appointed by us\" and \"should not have said that,\" he said, appearing to refer to a Justice Department lawyer who was removed from the case after having called Abrego Garcia's deportation an \"administrative error.\"",
      "Other Justice Department attorneys on the case have also acknowledged it was a mistake in court filings, including Solicitor General D. John Sauer, formerly Trump's personal lawyer.",
      "It's unclear what impact Trump's remarks might have on Abrego Garcia's case. The Justice Department referred a request for comment to the White House. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Justice Department tried this month to introduce a meeting Trump had in the Oval Office with Bukele as evidence in the case. Bukele told reporters he would not return Abrego Garcia and called the question \"preposterous.\"",
      "Drew Ensign, a lawyer for the government, told U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis that the exchange showed that the subject of Abrego Garcia's return was \"raised at the highest possible levels.\"",
      "Xinis noted that in the transcript the government provided her, it was a reporter \u2014 not Trump or the other officials there with him \u2014 who brought up the return. She also said that what happened in the Oval Office \"is not before this court\" and that she would rely on \"sworn, under oath testimony.\"",
      "David Leopold, an attorney and the former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said Xinis is likely to take a similar position if Abrego Garcia's attorneys try to use Trump's comments to ABC News as evidence.",
      "\"The judge is probably going to do the same thing here,\" Leopold said, although Trump's remarks are in clear conflict with the Justice Department's position that the United States has no say in Abrego Garcia's detention.",
      "Abrego Garcia is in the \"sovereign, domestic custody\" of El Salvador, and the United States has no say in his detention, the government has said.",
      "Leopold said Trump \"said what everybody knows\" and what Abrego Garcia's lawyers have been arguing in court \u2014 that since the United States is paying for the deportees to be kept in Salvadoran prisons, it has the ability to get them released.",
      "\"They subcontracted the detention of the folks they sent to El Salvador,\" Leopold said. \"There's no question he's in the constructive custody of the United States. We're paying the bills.\"",
      "In the ABC News interview, Trump also doubled down on his assertion that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13. He pointed to a picture he posted on social media in which the letters and numbers M-S-1-3 appeared to have been digitally added to Abrego Garcia's knuckles.\"He said he wasn't a member of a gang, and then they looked, and on his knuckles, he has MS-13,\" Trump said. \"He had MS-13, on his knuckles, tattooed.\"",
      "When Moran said that the image had been altered and that Abrego Garcia did not have the tattoo in other pictures, Trump called him \"fake news.\"",
      "Oscar Giron, a retired Maryland police investigator who says he worked on hundreds of MS-13 cases on the East Coast, said other tattoos on Abrego Garcia's hand in the picture did not strike him as indicating membership in the gang.",
      "\"I have not seen those before,\" he said.",
      "Giron added that in his experience, members of the gang had largely stopped getting affiliated tattoos in recent years because they wanted to avoid detection by law enforcement.",
      "Leopold said the accusations about the tattoos show the importance of the courts' second directive in Abrego Garcia's case \u2014 that he be given the due process he should have had before he was shipped off to El Salvador.",
      "\"The term sounds legalistic, but it means a notice and an opportunity to be heard by a court. Mr. Abrego Garcia did not get that,\" Leopold said.",
      "\"Due process would have given him a chance to defend himself\" and to \"test the government\u2019s evidence against him,\" he added.",
      "The Supreme Court ruled that Abrego Garcia\u2019s removal was \u201cillegal\u201d and that Xinis\u2019 order \u201cproperly requires the Government to \u2018facilitate\u2019 Abrego Garcia\u2019s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\u201d",
      "In an interview with CBS News that aired Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said,\u00a0\"If he were to be brought back to the United States of America, we would immediately deport him again.\u201d",
      "At an April 15 court hearing, Xinis said she was frustrated at the government's failure to comply with her orders about what efforts it had taken and would take to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia, and she suggested she was weighing contempt proceedings down the road.",
      "She directed government officials to answer questions under oath and sit for depositions, a directive she paused after the government put in a sealed filing asking for more time. The Justice Department put in a second such request this week, which she denied Wednesday.",
      "Xinis ordered the administration to comply with her discovery orders by May 9.",
      "In a statement, the law firm representing Abrego Garcia, Murray Osorio PLLC, said it \"will seek to determine who in the U.S. government has taken action to facilitate Mr. Abrego Garcia\u2019s return, what specific steps they\u2019ve taken, and who may have worked to block those efforts. These questions demand answers\u2014and through discovery, we intend to obtain them.\"",
      "It added that \"we will pursue every legal avenue to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia\u2019s return home to his family, so that he can get a full and fair trial on the allegations against him, and we won\u2019t rest until that day comes.\""

      "Former \u201cProject Runway\u201d production assistant Miriam Haley was back on the witness stand Wednesday testifying in graphic detail how disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her 19 years ago at his Manhattan apartment and, later, for a second time, at a New York City hotel.",
      "Sobbing on the stand, Haley told the court that during the first alleged assault in June 2006 she repeatedly told Weinstein \u201cno\u201d and that she was menstruating, but that did not deter the Hollywood producer who \u201cjust continued pushing, continued insisting, pushed me onto bed holding me down.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe put his mouth on my vagina, before and after he pulled out the tampon, he put his mouth on my vagina forcefully,\u201d Haley testified. \u201cI was mortified, I was embarrassed, in disbelief.\u201d",
      "Haley said the next month Weinstein, who had arranged for her to get the TV production assistant job, lured her to his room at the Tribeca Grand Hotel where he immediately \u201cpulled me towards the bed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was just like, \u2018Oh no, no again,\u2019 and he basically proceeded to undress me,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt so stupid. I kind of just went numb and he proceeded to have intercourse with me and I just lay there like a dead fish.\u201d",
      "Haley\u2019s account was a reprise of the testimony she provided five years earlier at Weinstein\u2019s first trial, which resulted in a landmark 2020 conviction that was overturned last year.",
      "Then and now, Haley insisted that Weinstein would not take no for an answer and that he violated her in June 2006 in a bedroom with what appeared to be kid\u2019s drawings on the walls.",
      "\u201cI could not get off or get away from his grip, and I realized that I\u2019m getting raped,\u201d she told the court.",
      "Haley said she wondered whether \u201cscreaming rape, will anyone hear me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy brain was calculating what was the best course of action at that moment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe risk of him turning to violence, and I decided in that moment that the smartest thing to do is just to check out and endure it and leave.\u201d",
      "Haley, 48, took the stand for the second time to recount the alleged assaults after the state Court of Appeals in April 2024 overturned Weinstein\u2019s conviction after concluding that the judge at his first trial tipped the scales against him by allowing women to testify about allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case.",
      "Weinstein is charged with one count of engaging in a criminal sex act in connection with Haley\u2019s allegations that he forcibly performed oral sex on her in June 2006. He is also charged with one count of third-degree rape for allegedly assaulting actress\u00a0Jessica Mann\u00a0in 2013.",

      "Sokola, who was not part of the 2020 trial,\u00a0claimed in a lawsuit\u00a0that she was 16 when Weinstein in 2006 performed oral sex on her without her consent at a Manhattan hotel. She, too, is expected to testify at Weinstein\u2019s retrial.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has denied assaulting the three women.",
      "Prosecutors contend Weinstein used his Hollywood clout to prey on young women like Haley who were searching for jobs in the TV and film industry \u2014 and to silence them after the alleged assaults.",
      "\u201cHe knew how addictive Hollywood dreams were,\u201d Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey said during opening arguments. \u201cHe knew how the promises of success worked.\u201d",
      "Under questioning by Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg, Haley said she was too embarrassed and afraid of what Weinstein would do to her to go report the alleged assaults to the police.",
      "\u201cI had no idea there were other people in the same situation,\u201d Haley said. \u201cI thought it was just me.\u201d",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lead lawyer, Arthur Aidala, then objected and moved for a mistrial saying \u201cshe just told the jury there were others.\u201d",
      "Manhattan Judge Curtis Farber denied Aidala\u2019s request for a mistrial.",
      "Aidala has characterized Weinstein\u2019s sexual encounters with the accusers as \u201ctransactional\u201d and \u201cconsensual.\u201d",

    "summary": "An executive at Meta has issued an apology to conservative influencer Robby Starbuck, who said Meta\u2019s AI chatbot gave responses defaming him.",
    "story": [
      "A top executive at tech giant Meta has issued a public apology to conservative influencer Robby Starbuck after Starbuck filed a lawsuit alleging that Meta\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot produced responses containing false and defamatory information about him.",
      "Joel Kaplan, Meta\u2019s chief global affairs officer, told Starbuck in a post on X Tuesday night that he was personally involved with trying to fix the situation.",
      "\u201cRobby \u2014 I watched your video \u2014 this is unacceptable. This is clearly not how our AI should operate,\u201d Kaplan wrote on X, which is one of Meta\u2019s competitors. He referred to a 20-minute video in which Starbuck laid out his claims, including that Meta\u2019s AI falsely associated him with the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and the QAnon conspiracy theory.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sorry for the results it shared about you and that the fix we put in place didn\u2019t address the underlying problem,\u201d Kaplan continued. \u201cI\u2019m working now with our product team to understand how this happened and explore potential solutions.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unusual for a C-suite corporate executive to apologize so publicly and so quickly to one individual, let alone someone who had just sued his company. Kaplan\u2019s apology came a few hours after\u00a0Starbuck sued Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook, in state court in Delaware. In 2021, Adam Mosseri, the Meta executive in charge of Instagram, apologized for a software bug that had deleted posts by Indigenous activists, and last year he apologized for the company taking action against a transgender user. Lower-level staff also sometimes apologize for Meta errors, and last year Kaplan admitted two mistakes by the company without issuing an apology.",
      "But Starbuck\u2019s claims and his stature are also unusual. A rising figure in right-wing media, Starbuck says that Meta\u2019s AI invented false information about him seemingly out of thin air \u2014 a problem that he says undermines the value of Meta\u2019s AI technology.",
      "Meta has become increasingly attentive to the concerns of American conservatives over the past year, after President Donald Trump won the Republican nomination and then the White House. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pivoted the company to align more closely with Trump, including by promoting Kaplan, a longtime Republican operative, to be Meta\u2019s head of lobbying.",
      "Starbuck said the apology from Kaplan was not enough. In a statement to NBC News on Wednesday, Starbuck said he wanted a public apology from Zuckerberg, changes to Meta\u2019s AI systems and compensation for the damages he says Meta had caused him.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day these lies harmed me, my wife and my kids,\u201d Starbuck said. \u201cThis put them in danger. I want to ensure that never happens to anyone else no matter what their political beliefs are.\u201d",
      "Asked for a response to the lawsuit Wednesday, a Meta spokesperson pointed to Kaplan\u2019s apology.",
      "Starbuck, a former music video producer based in Tennessee, has ridden to prominence in the conservative media ecosystem in recent years with videos attacking diversity, equity and inclusion programs (DEI) at major corporations, including Walmart. He sought a House seat as a Republican in 2022.",
      "In his lawsuit, Starbuck says he learned that Meta\u2019s AI chatbot was saying false things about him last August. That\u2019s when a motorcycle dealership in Vermont posted a screenshot on X of Meta\u2019s chatbot saying that Starbuck was at the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and had been \u201clinked to\u201d the QAnon conspiracy theory \u2014 two claims that Starbuck says are not true. He says he was in Tennessee the day of the Capitol riot and that he\u2019s a longtime critic of QAnon.",
      "Starbuck says in the lawsuit that he contacted Meta and its lawyers about the claims. According to the suit, a Meta lawyer responded to Starbuck\u2019s lawyer last August by email, saying in part: \u201cMeta takes the assertions set forth in your letter seriously, and an investigation into them is underway.\u201d",
      "But Meta ultimately did not implement changes or take responsibility over the ensuing months, the lawsuit alleges. Instead, the suit says, the problem got worse as the chatbot produced additional serious allegations about him.",
      "The lawsuit claims defamation. It asks for $5 million in general damages plus unspecified punitive damages and an injunction against future defamatory statements by Meta about Starbuck. The lawsuit was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "Internet companies have for decades enjoyed a kind of shield against many defamation lawsuits, thanks to a 1996 law commonly known as Section 230. Legal experts, though, say it\u2019s unclear whether that law applies to output from generative AI software, and courts have not yet weighed in.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how Meta\u2019s chatbot came up with its information about Starbuck. According to the lawsuit, Starbuck searched for potential sources of information that might have shaped Meta\u2019s AI but came up empty. On Wednesday, according to checks by NBC News, Meta\u2019s chatbot declined to talk about Starbuck at all, responding to questions about him with: \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t help you with this request right now. Is there anything else I can help you with?\u201d",
      "So-called hallucinations, in which AI chatbots give unexpected and incorrect responses to questions, are a notorious and somewhat mysterious feature of AI software.",
      "Starbuck filed his lawsuit at an especially inconvenient moment for Meta\u2019s ambitious AI plans. Tuesday was LlamaCon, a conference for AI developers hosted by Meta at its corporate headquarters in Menlo Park, California. Zuckerberg gave a keynote address, and the company announced several updates to its AI model, called Llama, which competes with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Google\u2019s Gemini and others.",

      "\"The men in (Ransom Canyon) are flawed and still love their family and land even when they are arguing,\" Thomas tells TODAY.com over email. \"This series has something for everyone.\"",
      "Thomas compliments the show, which premiered on April 17, particularly showrunner April Blair's depiction of the series, noting that she tells the story \"through a woman's gaze\" but the focus remains on \"character, family, love and legacy.\"",
      "\"It's about ranches and problems, but told in a different way,\" she says.",
      "Thomas says the way the series characters \u2014 particularly some of its leads like Staten Kirkland (Josh Duhamel), Quinn O'Grady (Minka Kelly) and Cap Fuller (James Brolin) \u2014 have come to life is exactly as she \"envisioned them\" when she wrote them, even if their plot lines differ from the books.",

It was really a thrill and so impressive. Netflix has treated me and my book well.\"",
      "Whether its book or show, \"Ransom Canyon\" is full of romance, just as Thomas intended.",

      "\"I would love to touch your heart and not just your mind,\" she continues. \"My wish is that my books and this show give people hope and good feelings and that\u2019s really the point of entertainment in my mind. At the end of the day we want to feel deeply and care.\"",
      "The main love story in the books and the show belongs to Staten and Quinn. Their romance comes from her belief that \"people love long and never stop.\"",
      "\"I've always written love stories because I really believe in the power of love,\" she says.",
      "Thomas believes Staten's character keeps people reading the books and watching the show as he gives you something to root for. When viewers first meet Staten in the show, he's a lonely rancher still grieving the loss of his wife and child.",
      "\"He was definitely a rich rancher, but he\u2019s lost all he really valued,\" Thomas says. \"I\u2019ve always written about people that have gone through a lot because that\u2019s where the really great stories come from. The reader cares deeply about such flawed characters and is rooting for them.\"",

    "story": [
      "Hulu\u2019s \u201cGood American Family\u201d is closely inspired by the true story of Natalia Grace and her adoptive families over the years.",
      "While the series explores her relationship with her most recent set of adoptive parents, Antwon Mans (Jerod Haynes) and Cynthia Mans (Christina Hendricks), the show does not include depiction of recently surfaced allegations of abuse against the real-life Manses.",
      "A card at the end of the series briefly mentions the allegations, which emerged earlier this year in Season 3 of the Investigation Discovery documentary \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace.\u201d",
      "In the docuseries, multiple people who knew Grace and the Manses accused the family of physically and financially abusing Natalia and other children in their care.",
      "The Manses have denied these abuse claims. TODAY.com has reached out to the Mans family for comment and has not heard back.",
      "How does the show address allegations against the Mans family?",
      "A disclaimer at the end of \u201cGood American Family\u201d acknowledges the recently surfaced allegations.",
      "\u201cSince this series was completed, abuse allegations against Antwon and Cynthia Mans have come to light,\u201d the note reads. \u201cThey maintain their innocence, and to this day, so does (Grace\u2019s other former adoptive mother) Kristine Barnett.\u201d",
      "The show\u2019s creators have opened up about the abuse allegations, with executive producer Sarah Sutherland calling the claims against the Manses \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think Natalia had been in a really bad state when Cynthia met her, and I think that there was a lot of love there. So it was really devastating to learn late after the fact, after we\u2019d been shooting, that there were these abuse allegations,\u201d she tells TODAY.com.",
      "Sutherland says the show\u2019s plotline is \u201cvery specific to a certain time period\u201d and that the recently surfaced allegations \u201cdidn\u2019t affect the current time period we were covering.\u201d",
      "Creator Katie Robbins also notes that the show\u2019s ending, while it doesn\u2019t incorporate the latest real-life allegations against the Manses, captures what her team set out to achieve with the series.",
      "\u201cThe themes that we\u2019re grappling with are the elusive nature of truth and the pervasiveness of bias, and so ending the story where we do felt like the most potent way to get at those issues,\u201d she says.",
      "Hendricks has also shared her views on how the show handles the allegations against the real-life inspiration for her character, Cynthia Mans, acknowledging the challenges of fictionally portraying a story that is still unfolding in the real world.",
      "\u201cOur story ends before those allegations came. So we wanted to make sure that, as we were taking the audience on this sort of wild journey and looking at it from all these different angles, that it is a very set specific time, because this show could go on forever, right?\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cBecause it is an ongoing story,\u201d she continues. \u201cSo we had to make sure that there was, you know, a beginning, middle and end, so ours cuts off before those allegations.\u201d",
      "What are the Manses accused of?",
      "The most recent season of \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace,\u201d which aired in January, includes claims that the Manses financially exploited Grace over the years, alleging that Cynthia Mans made herself the payee of Grace\u2019s monthly benefit payments.",
      "The documentary includes footage from a 2014 FBI interview of Grace, in which she talks about signing over roughly $700 per month in benefits to her adoptive family, including 10% tithes to the church run by her adoptive dad, Antwon Mans.",
      "Another person interviewed in the documentary, Robert Madewell, whose son was previously cared for by the Manses, accuses the couple of being \u201cfraudsters\u201d and \u201cscammers.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey adopt and get kids for money,\u201d he says in the docuseries. \u201cIt\u2019s not about love; it\u2019s all about the money, what they can get.\u201d",
      "The documentary also includes allegations that the Manses physically abused Grace and other children under their care.",
      "Anna Newlin, who had a child under the Manses\u2019 care at the time she was interviewed, told the documentary\u2019s producers that Grace \u201cused to get beat on all the time,\u201d and claimed the Manses were \u201cviolent\u201d toward Grace, alleging that they \u201chit her with a belt\u201d and \u201cknocked her down the stairs.\u201d",
      "Newlin walked back these claims in a subsequent interview and said the Manses have been falsely accused.",
      "Grace herself has not alleged that the Manses physically abused her.",
      "When asked by a producer on camera whether she or other children were beaten by the Manses, Grace says in the documentary, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that.\u201d",
      "In the docuseries, Cynthia Mans denies allegations against her and her family, calling them \u201csick, twisted lies.\u201d",
      "She and Antwon Mans have not responded to request for comment from TODAY.com.",
      "Grace moved in with the Manses in 2013, after she was left living alone in an apartment by her previous adoptive parents, Michael and Kristine Barnett.",
      "The Manses formally adopted Grace in 2023. The Mans family appeared to be initially supportive of Grace, but their relationship seemed to take a turn not long after she was adopted.",
      "That year, Cynthia and Antwon Mans called the producers of \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace,\u201d claiming that a man named Neil, whom Grace was speaking to online, had \u201cjust completely flipped Natalia\u2019s mind against her family.\u201d",

      "Katy Perry wrote a long response to a fan-made ad congratulating her for finishing the first week of her \"Lifetimes\" tour, amid backlash about the tour and her recent trip to space.",
      "Perry responded to a video of the ad posted to a fan account on Instagram, writing in a comment that she is able to remain true to herself, \"heart open and honest,\" because of the bond she has with her fans.",
      "\"Please know I am ok, I have done a lot work around knowing who I am, what is real and what is important to me,\" she said. \"My therapist said something years ago that has been a game changer, 'No one can make you believe something about yourself that you don\u2019t already believe about yourself,' and if I ever do have any feelings about it then it\u2019s an opportunity to investigate the feeling underneath it.",
      "\"When the 'online' world tries to make me a human Pi\u00f1ata, I take it with grace and send them love, cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for unhinged and unhealed,\" she continued.",

      "Earlier this month, Perry was also part of the all-female flight crew that took a roughly 10-minute trip to space aboard a Blue Origin spacecraft. The flight quickly garnered controversy, as everyday people, fast-food companies and celebrities, like Olivia Munn and\u00a0Emily Ratajkowski, questioned the sustainability of a trip to space.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d Munn said while co-hosting TODAY With Jenna & Friends on April 3. \u201cIs it historic that you guys are going on a ride? I think it\u2019s a bit gluttonous. ... Space exploration was to further our knowledge and to help mankind. What are they going to do up there that has made it better for us down here?\u201d",

      "Ferrante, an anonymous Italian author, is also known for writing \"The Days of Abandonment.\" In 2024, the New York Times published a list of the 100 best books of the 21st century, and \"My Brilliant Friend\" topped the list at No. 1.",
      "Europa Editions Executive Publisher Michael Reynolds said in statement, \"This single-volume edition reflects more truly the author\u2019s conception of the story of Lila and Len\u00fa as one long saga.\"",
      "\"Designed and printed in Italy, this is going to be a beautiful object and a worthy celebration of an unforgettable, history-making work of literature,\" Reynolds said.",

      "\"It occurred to me that Elena Ferrante\u2019s true strength lies in her words, and that perhaps there was no need to add anything else,\" Rapisardi said. \"The opening of 'My Brilliant Friend' is wonderful and immediately evokes the tone and intensity of the story.

      "Rapisardi said the design team also considered another \"iconic\" line from the books, \"You\u2019re my brilliant friend, you have to be the best of all, boys and girls,\" but noted it was \"quite short.\" Instead, those words can be found on the endpapers of the special edition, printed over the continued motif of the Gulf of Naples from the book's edges.",
      "The special edition, which is currently available for preorder for $65, is clothbound, and the words on the cover are \"hot-stamped,\" meaning they are engraved into the fabric, Rapisardi said.",
      "\"The legacy of 'My Brilliant Friend' is that of a universal story, one that has spoken to readers around the world with an authentic, profound, and powerful voice,\" Rapisardi said. \"The new cover aims to convey precisely that: the power of the written word.\""

    "story": [
      "Christie Brinkley, one of the most recognizable faces in modeling, offers a revealing glimpse into the challenges of being one of the world's original supermodels in her new memoir, \"Uptown Girl.\"",
      "Gracing the cover of more than 500 magazines and appearing in memorable movies like the 1983 hit film, \"National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation,\" Brinkley's career spans five decades, and she delves into much of it in her new book.",
      "\"I just want to tell some stories,\" Brinkley tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview. \"I hope it'll be a nice diversion in a world that can use a good book every now and then, take you away on a little adventure.\"",
      "From being discovered at a payphone in Paris to being kicked out of Frank Sinatra's hotel room, \"Uptown Girl\" offers insight behind Brinkley's upbringing in Southern California and her ascent to the top of the modeling world. The book also explores her four marriages (and divorces), including 11 years she spent with Billy Joel.",
      "It's the music legend who penned \"Uptown Girl,\" the song that inspired the memoir's title, which has become Brinkley's enduring nickname \u2014 in spite of the fact that, according to the supermodel, it wasn't initially written for her.",
      "Brinkley writes in her memoir that it started out as a song for a \"mystery girl\" Joel had been having phone conversations with, but when his relationship with Brinkley began, he finished it in her honor. Their relationship was then immortalized in the hit song's iconic music video, in which Brinkley appears in.",
      "'Dancing in the kitchen' with Billy Joel",
      "In \"Uptown Girl,\" Brinkley, 71, opens up about her various heartbreaks, difficult early childhood with an abusive father and the helicopter accident that almost claimed her life in 1994. However, the model says that opening up about her marriage to Joel was the most difficult part of penning the memoir.",
      "\"The hardest thing to include was criticism of Billy, because I do care about my friendship with him,\" she says of the chapters that reveal Joel's heavy drinking and suggested affairs, which has been making headlines since her book came out.",
      "\"In the book, I feel like I balanced, very much, about how happy we were and how joy-filled our days were,\" she says of their marriage. \"It was literally dancing in the kitchen as we cooked, singing together, and making each other laugh. It was a beautiful, wonderful relationship.\"",
      "According to the memoir, that relationship became strained, in part, after Joel sued Frank Weber, his former manager, for having allegedly siphoned off his profits. It was a betrayal that Brinkley writes left Joel \"withdrawn and stressed\" as singer-songwriter felt immense pressure to recoup his financial loss.",
      "\"He was going through extraordinary circumstances in his life, things most people wouldn't ever have to deal with,\" she describes.",
      "Despite the vulnerable nature of the admissions, Brinkley says they were important to include in the memoir. \"I did have to go there because that was the reality.\"",
      "Brinkley tells TODAY.com that Joel had given his blessing to talk candidly about the ups and downs of their longtime relationship.",
      "\"He said, 'Just say what you need to say,'\" Brinkley recalls. \"And I think that's part of his healing, so I applaud him for all of that. It takes a lot of courage.\"",
      "The new memoir reveals some darker times in their relationship, including instances of Brinkley waking up in the middle of the night to discover Joel was missing, then him returning home in the wee hours of the morning after being out drinking all night.",
      "She also writes about the growing distance in their marriage that ultimately left her feeling \"lonely, despite the fact that he was right there.\" It was a loneliness so pervasive that Brinkley was thinking about Joel as she boarded a helicopter in Colorado, shortly after their separation in 1994, and wondered if the crooner would be worried about her embarking on a trip to go heli-skiing.",
      "\"For a moment I thought about my husband, Billy, whom I'd split with again, and hoping this trip to Telluride would wake him up to the reality that he might actually lose me,\" she writes.",
      "What she didn't know was that shortly after, the helicopter would crash into the San Juan mountains, leaving Brinkley and several companions temporarily stranded until they were rescued.",
      "Though Joel ultimately flew to her side and jetted her back to Long Island aboard a private plane, her dream of their reunion was dashed when she overheard him on the phone saying to an unknown caller, 'No, don't worry. I'm not going back to her. I just need to see her through this.'\"",
      "The revelation brought home the fact that their marriage was over. Two weeks later, they announced their divorce and as she penned in her memoir, \"the dream broke apart like debris.\"",
      "Despite their divorce, Brinkley tells TODAY.com that they still remain friends.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a very loyal guy. He\u2019s loyal to his friends, he\u2019s generous. He just had a lot of stresses on him at the point when we were together and it just kind of came crashing down on us.\u201d",
      "'I was raised to be grateful'",
      "Outside of her marriage, the helicopter crash changed her life in other ways.",
      "\"I went through a phase of post-traumatic stress disorder,\" she says of the accident that left her clinging to the side of a mountain amid a pile of helicopter wreckage.",
      "\"One of the hallmarks is bad decision-making. And I made quite a few, which I lay out in the book and that chapter was hard to write just because I didn't want to think about any of (the helicopter crash). I didn't want to go back to that place.

Oh, and then, Wendi's character, Joyce, has the most complex relationship because she's doing PR also, always. So I think that's an interesting question, the authenticity of the characters.",

In that scene where I'm trying to expose him for being a fake chaplain (in Episode 3). Dude, he's like, this close to my face in like five of those takes, and I couldn't do it. I felt really bad, because when somebody's doing brilliant work, the worst thing you can do is laugh in their face. But it was just too funny.",
      "And then also, (Kahyun) and I sometimes have this problem, not because we're trying to do really good comedy for each other, but because we hang out too much. When we're trying to have these more emotional beats \u2014 that's when we can't stop laughing, which is no good.",
      "KK: It's disgusting, and it's so hard.",
      "Definitely Mekki for me.",
      "KK: There's so many, it's so hard. But I would (laughs) have to say, when we were filming the pilot, and Wendi started doing cartwheels. It was our last day of filming, I think. I don't know what the direction exactly was from the writers, but it was like, 'Do a Wendi take.' I think it was something like that, or 'fun take.' And Wendi just started cheerleading for the office break room scene. And I just could not believe what was happening.",
      "ML: When she did a cartwheel for real, and we didn't know she was going to, and the gasp that's in the pilot of everybody in the room is totally real.",
      "I have, like, a ton. I love just getting to fall down on stuff. I think my favorite thing actually might be them letting me fall down more. Because similarly on the pilot, the first take that I think we shot of almost anything was, it's like me entering ... and I kept doing it falling down. And they were like, 'Hey, like, insurance, like, the lawyers are telling us you're not allowed to fall down. Don't do those kinds of jokes. Stop doing that.' (Laughs)",
      "KK: Did they actually say that?",
      "ML: Yes. Yeah they told me I had to stop falling down. But then over time, they're like, 'If he wants to fall down, like, let him do it then, fine.'",
      "KK: I think she's thinking, 'Ugh, him?' I think that's the first reaction. It's shocking. But I also think she, in that episode, she comes to the realization that he is indeed a good person. He is indeed a cute person. I think it just wasn't a possibility. The way I saw it, it didn't cross her mind. But, now that it has, it's like a little seed planted in her head.",
      "ML: I don't think that that's what he wants, but I do think that an event like what happened in the finale, it was kind of a refocusing thing. And he's like, I mean, it's literally what he says, it's like, I might be able to sort of date my job. And that's a big win.",
      "You know, can't get a girlfriend, but I do have a job, and I've barely I been able to do that the whole season, so it's pretty nice to start something.",
      "KK: (Laughing) I forgot that you say that.",
      "ML: When people are like, 'Hey, so we were thinking that you guys are maybe kind of as likable as the most likable TV couple in history \u2014\u00a0do you think you can be charming on that level?' It's a little like, 'No, man, I'm not John Krasinski, damn.' So it was nerve-wracking at first.",
      "But then, you know, they write these really brilliant characters, and you kind of focus more, I think for me, like I'm just being Matt. And then it becomes really natural. Like, oh, if I'm this kind of sheltered, nervous guy, it's very easy to figure out how he would be with Serena.",
      "But yeah, at first it was just kind of like, 'What are we going to do?'",
      "KK: Speak for yourself, because I was like, 'I got this.'",
      "ML: (Laughs)",
      "KK: I think it's fun. I think the writers do such a good job at establishing the characters. ... \u00a0It's different for me, because I think Serena really had no (idea). I don't have to play the crush. I don't have the romantic part yet.",
      "Now being Season 2, now that the awareness is there, I\u2019m wondering how different it will feel as Serena and as an actor.",
      "But, I mean, it's really easy. All jokes aside, it's really easy to act with Mekki ... It's like, so, so hard to watch, but at the same time, it's so cute. And I think Mekki does such a good job. He's so likable. Like, it's insane, because in real life, he's a terrible person. So it's crazy.",
      "ML: That is true. I really put it on. I lock in. Sometimes they do prosthetics to make me seem like a kind person. CGI, whatever it takes.",

    "story": [
      "More than a decade after TLC\u2019s \u201cWhat Not to Wear\u201d hung up its final structured jacket and statement necklace in 2013, style gurus Stacy London and Clinton Kelly are hosting a new makeover show called \u201cWear Whatever the F You Want.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s all in the title: This new show will take a completely different approach to wardrobe transformation. This time around, there\u2019s no secret filming of unwitting style offenders, no ambush makeovers and zero outfit shaming.",
      "Instead, the new show is about empowering people to discover and embrace their unique style, even if their dream looks don\u2019t follow any conventional fashion guidelines.",
      "\u201cWe are no longer applying rules that come from our perspective,\u201d London tells TODAY.com. \u201cWe are asking our clients what their dream style is, why they haven\u2019t been able to achieve it and really help them along the way and guide them, rather than make it about geometry or looking thinner.\u201d",
      "A new premise...",
      "London says she and Kelly don\u2019t see themselves as style experts but as \u201cfairy godmothers,\u201d helping people express themselves through fashion.",
      "That\u2019s not to say there\u2019s anything wrong with some good old color, texture, pattern and shine \u2014 or that \u201cWhat Not to Wear\u201d standby, the pointy-toe shoe.",
      "It\u2019s just that now, London and Kelly are digging a little deeper.",
      "\u201cLike, pointy-toe shoes do make your legs look longer, but why do you want to wear a pointy-toe shoe? What\u2019s the style that you\u2019re going for? What do you want to communicate to other people?\u201d London says. \u201cSo we talk to them pretty significantly about what\u2019s holding them back psychologically.\u201d",
      "Eight clients from all walks of life nominated themselves for the show\u2019s first season, which premiered on Prime Video April 29, including a young mom hoping to reclaim her style identity, a grandmother and breast cancer survivor discovering her \"inner diva\u201d and a young transgender man exploring style identity.",
      "In each episode, the client puts together their own dream outfits from a curated closet, then road tests the looks at an event in the real world. All the while, Kelly and London are rooting them on without judgment.",
      "\u201cOur job was to make it as safe as possible, and we were there every step of the way,\u201d Kelly tells TODAY.com.",
      "After clients try out their initial fantasy looks, they have the opportunity to refine their style further and to brainstorm with Kelly and London what outfits might work for them in their daily lives.",
      "This process of collaboration with each client is \u201ca lot closer to what stylists do in real life,\u201d Kelly says.",
      "... And a long-awaited reunion",
      "With their bubbly on-screen chemistry, the co-hosts seem to be picking up right where they left off from their \u201cWhat Not to Wear\u201d days.",
      "But for years after the TLC show ended, there were rumors of a feud between the two, fueled partly by comments Kelly made about working with London in his 2017 collection of essays, \u201cI Hate Everyone, Except You.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor the first five years we worked together, I either adored her or despised her, and never anything in between,\u201d he wrote at the time.",
      "He also wrote that \u201cthere\u2019s a part of me that will love Stacy forever, and a part of me that would be just fine if I never saw her again for the rest of my life.\u201d",
      "The same year, London blocked Kelly on Twitter, which Kelly said at the time felt like \u201cgetting a little slap in the face.\u201d",
      "But all that is clearly behind them now. The pair announced their reconciliation in 2023 and said they had worked through any sticking points in their relationship.",
      "\u201cSo I reached out to Stacy and I was like, \u2018Can we put this behind us? Let\u2019s talk it out.\u2019 And we had a really emotional conversation. It was during the pandemic, sort of as the pandemic was ending. And we just talked through it all,\u201d Kelly said during a joint visit to TODAY with London in September 2023.",
      "\u201cOh, I sobbed my eyes out,\u201d London recalled, saying she \u201clet it all hang out\u201d as she and Kelly made up.",
      "\u201cI told Clinton everything that made me sad, everything that hurt me, every way I thought I hurt him. All the petty grudges, all the stupid crap,\" she said.",
      "The pair kicked off their renewed collaboration with The Stacy & Clinton show, a multi-city live tour that ran from October to November 2023, in which they shared behind-the-scenes stories from \u201cWhat Not to Wear\u201d and offered updated style advice to audience members.",
      "And with \u201cWear Whatever the F You Want,\u201d it\u2019s clear they are back to finishing each other\u2019s sentences.",
      "Teaming up again for the new show \u201cwas like riding an old bicycle,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cStacy, I\u2019m the old bicycle. You jumped on \u2014\u201d",
      "\u201cI jumped on your back,\u201d London chimes in with a laugh. \u201cWe really, really enjoyed our time together \u2026 For what everybody has said, and all the clickbait and all the press and all of that silly stuff, we work really well together, and we just know how to do it.\u201d",
      "She adds that this time around, she and Kelly were \u201cjust happier on the set.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re both older, we\u2019re in a different place,\u201d she says. \u201cI just feel like this was a real, true collaboration.\u201d",
      "All eight episodes of \u201cWear Whatever the F You Want\u201d are available to stream on Prime Video."

      "The White House announced Wednesday night that it had signed an economic partnership with Ukraine that includes an agreement on the ownership and extraction of natural resources from the war-torn nation.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the agreement, established as the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, will allow the United States to \"invest alongside Ukraine\" to unlock its growth assets and ultimately accelerate its economic recovery.",
      "\u201cAs the President has said, the United States is committed to helping facilitate the end of this cruel and senseless war. This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\" Bessent said in a statement. \"President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides\u2019 commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.",

      "Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, provided more details about the minerals deal outlined in the agreement, first saying on X that \"it is the Ukrainian state that determines what and where to extract\" and that \"subsoil remains under Ukrainian ownership.\"",
      "Ukraine and the United States will jointly manage and maintain co-ownership of the investment fund, with neither side holding a dominant vote, Svyrydenko said. It will be financed by new Ukrainian oil, gas and critical mineral licenses, with 50% of all revenue from the licenses going toward the fund.",
      "\"The fund will then invest in extraction projects for critical materials, oil, and gas \u2014 as well as in related infrastructure and processing.

      "Svyrydenko indicated in her post that the United States will also contribute to the fund, through it is unclear exactly how much. She added that contributions to the fund will not be taxed in either Ukraine or the United States to ensure \u201cmaximum effectiveness of the investment process.\"",
      "Trump said earlier Wednesday that the agreement would serve as an avenue for the United States to recoup funds it has provided to Ukraine throughout its war with Russia, a figure the State Department has placed at $66.5 billion in terms of military assistance.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t want to make a complicated deal,\" Trump said at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday. \"Rare earth is called rare for a reason, and they have a lot, and we made a deal where our money is secure, where we can start digging and doing what we have to do.\"",
      "It is unclear how much of the money will go toward repaying the United States. Svyrydenko said in her post that the agreement \"includes no provisions regarding any Ukrainian debt obligations to the United States.\"",
      "The agreement was signed days after Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Rome on the sidelines of Pope Francis\u2019 funeral. Trump suggested the pair\u2019s relationship had improved since their Oval Office clash in February, characterizing the meeting as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and expressing confidence that Zelenskyy \u201cwants to make a deal\" to end the war.",

      "\u201cWe were both raised Conservative and we both kind of thought, Conservative is just what you do,\u201d Derek Ouellette, a 46-year-old insurance broker from Belle River, near Windsor, Ontario, said in a phone interview late Tuesday.",
      "But Ouellette said he was proud to have done the once unthinkable, voting for Liberal leader and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is projected to have secured a minority victory in this week's poll.",
      "Across social media, a number of once-dedicated Conservatives said that they would be casting their ballots for the Liberal Party this week for the first time in their lives. Many described their vote as a rejection of \"Canada's Trump\" \u2014 Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre \u2014 and his aggressive campaign, which experts say appeared to pull from the playbook of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThere were some elements of his campaign that echoed Trump,\u201d Roland Paris, director of the University of Ottawa\u2019s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, said Wednesday.",
      "That included talking \u201cabout eliminating wokeism\u201d and \u201creferring to his political opponents with nasty nicknames,\u201d Paris added. \u201cNone of these features of his campaign helped him once Trump came to be seen by many Canadians as an enemy of Canada.\u201d",
      "Just weeks ago, the pugnacious approach of Poilievre, who had previously allied himself with the so-called Freedom Convoy that protested vaccine mandates for truck drivers, appeared to be working.",
      "His campaign, during which he focused on small-government and libertarian issues, combined with dissatisfaction at the scandal-hit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's handling of the economy to see the Conservatives move 24 points ahead of the Liberals in January, according to a poll tracker run by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "But within a matter of weeks, everything changed: Trudeau announced his resignation Jan. 6, while Trump swept back to power in the U.S., threatening to use economic pressure to annex Canada as the \u201c51st state,\u201d before imposing sweeping 25% tariffs on goods from America\u2019s northern neighbor and sparking outrage across the country.",
      "Trump's bellicose remarks gave a huge boost to Canadian nationalism, with many vowing to boycott the U.S. and its products.",
      "As anti-Trump sentiment grew across Canada, Poilievre's own bullish rhetoric rapidly lost its sheen for many Canadian Conservatives.",
      "When Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, was named Canada\u2019s interim prime minister and the Liberal candidate for the 2025 election, distaste for Trudeau and worries about the Liberals' ability to handle the economy quickly evaporated.",
      "When it did, a new way forward emerged for those who had felt politically homeless.",
      "Poilievre, now the former leader of the opposition, even lost the parliamentary seat he had held for two decades to a Liberal neophyte Monday.",

      "By comparison, he added, Carney \u201chas shown himself to be very decisive in dealing with Trump\u201d by billing himself as candidate who could stand up to the president.",
      "\u201cI just cannot support the hate rhetoric ... and this \u2018Maple MAGA\u2019 movement that\u2019s happening here in Canada,\u201d said Chantal Dugdale, 57, another Conservative who voted Liberal for the first time in her life Monday.",
      "Dugdale said she found parallels between Poilievre\u2019s campaign and support base, and Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement particularly off-putting.",
      "\u201cWe need unity. We need to be together. We need positive messaging,\u201d said Dugdale, who is from Barrie, just north of Toronto, and works in marketing and sales.",
      "Trump appeared aware of his likely impact on Canada\u2019s election, saying in an interview conducted last week and published Monday by The Atlantic that until he \u201ccame along, remember, that the Conservative was leading.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I was disliked by enough of the Canadians that I\u2019ve thrown the election into a close call, right?\u201d he said.",
      "A close call indeed, with Ouellette, Dugdale and political experts noting that Carney\u2019s victory was far from a landslide, with the next Liberal government projected to fall short of winning the majority of seats in Parliament.",
      "And while lifelong Conservatives may have helped propel the Liberal leader forward, Paris said he believed \u201cMark Carney would likely not have won if not for Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cCanadians were tired of the Liberal Party after 10 years, but they were even more concerned about Trump\u2019s threats,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Dugdale pointed out, the election\u2019s projected outcome was a far cry from the Conservative victory that felt increasingly certain just weeks ago, with Poilievre now out of a job.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so ironic. Paul was shouting, \u2018we need change,\u2019\u201d Dugdale said. \u201cHe got change alright.\u201d"

      "At the opening of the hearings at the U.N.\u2019s top court, the U.N.\u2019s legal counsel said Israel had a clear obligation as an occupying force to allow and facilitate humanitarian aid for the people in Gaza.",
      "\u201cIn the specific context of the current situation in the occupied Palestinian Territories, these obligations entail allowing all relevant U.N. entities to carry out activities for the benefit of the local population,\u201d Elinor Hammarskjold said.",
      "Palestinian representative Ammar Hijazi said Israel was using humanitarian aid as \u201ca weapon of war\u201d, while people in Gaza were facing starvation.",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel had submitted its position in writing to the hearings, which he described as a \u201ccircus\u201d.",
      "Speaking in Jerusalem on Monday, Saar said the court was being politicized, while the U.N. was failing to root out employees of its Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA who are members of Gaza militant groups.",
      "\u201cThey are abusing the court once again to try and force Israel to cooperate with an organization that is infested with Hamas terrorists,\u201d Saar said. \u201cThe goal is to deprive Israel of its most basic right to defend itself.\u201d",
      "The U.N. said in August that nine UNRWA staff may have been involved in Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023 assault and had been fired. Another Hamas commander, confirmed by UNRWA as one of its employees, was killed in Gaza in October, according to Israel.",
      "The\u00a0ICJ, also known as the World Court, was tasked in December to form an\u00a0advisory opinion\u00a0on Israel\u2019s obligations to facilitate aid to Palestinians that is delivered by states and international groups, including the United Nations.",
      "Israel has repeatedly said it would not allow the entry of goods and supplies into Gaza until Hamas releases all remaining hostages. It has accused Hamas of hijacking humanitarian aid, which the militant group denies.",
      "\u201cThis case is about Israel destroying the fundamentals of life in Palestine, while it blocks the U.N. and other providers of humanitarian aid from providing life-saving aid to the population,\u201d Hijazi, the head of the Palestinian mission to the Netherlands, told the hearing.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he had\u00a0pushed\u00a0Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow food and medicine into Gaza. Germany, France and Britain last week\u00a0called\u00a0to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid into the besieged Palestinian territory.",
      "Advisory opinions of the\u00a0ICJ\u00a0carry legal and political weight, although they are not binding and the court has no enforcement powers.",
      "After the hearings, the World Court will likely take several months to form its opinion."

      "The U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, in a statement early Monday before news of the alleged strike broke, sought to defend its policy of offering no specific details of its extensive airstrike campaign.

      "The rebels\u2019 Civil Defense organization said at least 68 people had been killed and 47 others wounded in the attack.",
      "Footage from the site analyzed by the AP suggested some kind of explosion took place there, with its cement walls seemingly peppered by debris fragments and the wounds suffered by those there.",
      "A woman\u2019s voice, soft in the footage, can be heard repeating the start of a prayer in Arabic: \u201cIn the name of God.\u201d An occasional gunshot rang out as medics sought to help those wounded.",
      "Ethiopians and other African migrants for years have landed in Yemen, braving the war-torn nation to try and reach Saudi Arabia for work. The Houthi rebels allegedly make tens of thousands of dollars a week smuggling migrants over the border."

      "Kalthia, who was with her husband and their two children, said they \u201csensed that something was wrong and ran to hide behind the tent, but they suddenly were standing in front of us.\u201d",
      "Militants armed with rifles had descended on tourists in the meadow from the surrounding woods, identifying non-Muslims and then separating the men from the women and children.",
      "One of the militants \u201cshot six to seven men in front of me,\u201d Kalthia said, before shooting her husband, Shailesh.",
      "\u201cMy husband died in my lap, and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d she told reporters Thursday at his funeral in their hometown of Surat in the Indian state of Gujarat.",
      "Twenty-six people were killed in the Tuesday attack, which took place in one of Kashmir\u2019s top tourist destinations, the Baisaran Valley, whose lush green meadows, dense pine forests and snowcapped mountains have led it to be called India\u2019s \u201cmini Switzerland.\u201d",
      "It was the deadliest attack on Indian civilians in almost two decades, and took place while Vice President JD Vance and his family were visiting another part of India. All but one of those killed were Indian nationals; the other was from Nepal.",
      "The attack near the town of Pahalgam in Kashmir, a disputed Himalayan region that is the only Muslim-majority part of India, has devastated the local tourism industry on which many rely for their livelihood. It also undermined Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s insistence that the security situation had stabilized after a decadeslong separatist insurgency.",

      "Relations between the two nuclear powers, which both rule parts of Kashmir and have fought two wars over the region, are now at their lowest point in years after tit-for-tat treaty suspensions and the expulsion of diplomats and civilians. On Saturday, Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged gunfire for the second day in a row along the Line of Control that divides the two parts of Kashmir.",
      "Modi, a Hindu nationalist who has overseen a crackdown on dissent in Kashmir, vowed retribution for the attack. The family homes of several suspects have been demolished.",
      "\u201cI say to the whole world, India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers,\u201d he said Thursday.",
      "President Donald Trump, who is close with Modi, said the Indian leader has his \u201cfull support.\u201d",

      "Six years later, Indian nationalism is higher than ever, the Pakistan military\u2019s grip on power has weakened, and the U.S. is no longer in Afghanistan, which analysts say historically deterred violence between India and Pakistan.",
      "\u201cThat perhaps gives India a bit of a blank check to do whatever it pleases,\u201d said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "A region simmering with rage",
      "Resentment between India and Pakistan dates to 1947, when Hindu-majority India gained independence from British colonial rule and Muslim-majority Pakistan was established as a separate state in a deadly partition in which at least an estimated million people were killed while migrating across the newly formed border.",
      "The border lines were clearly defined and accepted except for the mountainous state of Jammu and Kashmir, which is among the most militarized places in the world. Both Pakistan and India lay full claim to it, but most of it is Indian-administered, while Pakistan controls a small chunk to the west.",
      "Tensions have escalated since Modi revoked Kashmir\u2019s semiautonomous status in 2019, effectively putting the region under direct control of the federal government in a move that was criticized by rights groups and raised fears that Kashmir\u2019s ethnic and religious identity would be diluted by Hindu settlers.",
      "Modi\u2019s government said the move ended decades of armed rebellion in the region. Elections were held last year and hailed as a sign of normalcy.",
      "\u201cOne indicator of normalcy that the government was always giving out was, look, there are so many tourists visiting,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Deependra Singh Hooda, former head of the Indian Army\u2019s Northern Command, who was stationed in Jammu and Kashmir from 2012 to 2016.",

      "The militants found them in the meadow.",
      "After her husband was shot in the head, Rao told reporters, she and her son asked the militants to kill them too. They refused, saying, \u201cWe won\u2019t kill you. Go tell Prime Minister Modi.\u201d",
      "A local pony handler, Syed Adil Hussain Shah, was also killed while trying to save the tourists.",
      "\u201cHe used to earn 300 rupees [$3.50] in a day, our only source of income in the family,\u201d Ravisa Hussain Shah, his younger sister, told NBC News in an interview at their home in the village of Hapatnur.",
      "Among the first to reach the scene was Sajad Ahmad Bhat, 31, a shawl seller and tour guide.",

      "Bhat carried one of the victims almost 2.5 miles to safety, video of which went viral online.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know who the boy was. But he was crying and seeking help. His hands and sweater were soaked in blood,\u201d he said.",
      "Since the attack, India has suspended a 1960 water treaty with Pakistan and closed the only functional land border crossing. Pakistan, which said any disruption to its water supply would be considered an \u201cact of war,\u201d has closed its airspace to Indian airlines and halted all trade with its neighbor.",
      "Analysts inside Pakistan say the government may use the situation to bring the Kashmir issue back into global discussions.",
      "\u201cPakistan can say, look, this happens because of India\u2019s human rights violations in Kashmir,\u201d said Farhan Siddiqi, a professor of international relations at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.",
      "On Wednesday, Kashmir observed a complete shutdown as locals and politicians marched through the streets denouncing the killings. Roads throughout Kashmir were deserted, with shops closed and no transport on the roads.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to exhibit that Kashmiris are nonviolent and peaceful people, and any innocent killings shouldn\u2019t take place on our soil,\u201d said Javed Ahmad Tenga, president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry.",
      "The United Nations has urged India and Pakistan to \u201cexercise maximum restraint\u201d and called for \u201cmeaningful, mutual engagement.\u201d But Donthi and others say strong Indian military action against Pakistan is likely.",
      "\u201cAnything less than the airstrikes in 2019 will not do. The public is seeking something much bigger,\u201d Donthi said. \u201cAfter riding the tiger of hypernationalism, the government has backed itself into a corner. This is their litmus test and they have to come out with flying colors.\u201d",

      "With 40,000 packed into Vatican City\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Square, another 250,000 in the surrounding streets and millions more watching on TV and online, world leaders, including President Donald Trump, were reminded of Francis\u2019 central messages during his funeral Saturday.",
      "\u201c\u2018Build bridges, not walls\u2019 was an exhortation he repeated many times,\u201d Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re said during the homily for the late pope. \u201cHis gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons are countless. His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant.\u201d",
      "And war \u201calways leaves the world worse than it was before: It is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone,\u201d Re said.",
      "Francis often railed against the geopolitical tides. He urged more compassion for immigrants and refugees at a time when the White House and other governments are cracking down. He called for an end to the war in Gaza and denounced climate change and exploitative capitalism \u2014 when those crises have only intensified.",
      "Under warm, blue skies with the world watching, the homily was a reminder of Francis\u2019 often lonely voice in a world characterized by economic and military hard power. It also brought to mind the unspoken questions, on this day at least, about whether the late pontiff\u2019s replacement will continue these progressive notes or revert to a more conservative bent.",
      "The relatively simple funeral for Francis, who died at age 88 on Monday, was attended by some 170 heads of state and other dignitaries. Trump sat among Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Britain\u2019s Prince William.",
      "Francis\u2019 casket was taken on a final journey in the so-called popemobile through the streets of Rome, past landmarks such as the Colosseum, to St. Mary Major Basilica, where he had chosen to be buried.",
      "The people lining the streets had come from all over the world.",
      "\u201cI could not have been anywhere else today. For me, Pope Francis was a wonderful pope, a gift that the lord gave us,\u201d said Katherine Gilligan, 59, who was visiting Rome last week from Jacksonville, Florida, and decided to postpone her return journey when Francis died. \u201cHe has loved us and taught us piety. It will be difficult for there to be another pope like him.\u201d",
      "At St. Mary Major Basilica, his casket was met, according to his wishes, by dozens of Rome\u2019s impoverished and needy, including prisoners, migrants, homeless and transgender people.",
      "It was just one reflection of a pope who did things a bit differently. He had even adjusted his own funeral plans: Whereas previous popes have been entombed in three nested coffins, made of cypress, lead and oak, Francis requested he be buried in a single, simple wooden casket lined with zinc.",
      "Even so, this was an event of epic majesty. From the arcing dome of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, one of the largest churches in the world, to the striking image of a square divided between a mass of red on one side \u2014 the cardinals and bishops \u2014 and black on the other \u2014 attending dignitaries.",
      "In life, Francis had declined to live in the Vatican\u2019s gilded Apostolic Palace, choosing instead its far more plebeian guesthouse, Casa Santa Marta, where he died after a period of well-publicized illness.",
      "Francis had plenty of critics, both conservatives who believed he focused too much on progressive causes, and more liberal audiences who felt he did not go far enough with his reforms.",
      "Either way, the absence of his frequent and outspoken interjections on world affairs will leave a void to be filled. And though he spoke with a freedom unafforded to more prominent global figures, his funeral was still a deeply political event.",
      "Re\u2019s reminder that Francis preferred bridges over walls conjured the late pope\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s first-term promise to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall.",
      "\u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges is not Christian,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "One day before his death, Francis met with Vice President JD Vance after sharply rebuking the Trump administration for cracking down on immigration and slashing international aid. In February, he said a \u201cmajor crisis\u201d was taking place in the United States, referring to \u201ca program of mass deportations.\u201d",
      "Perhaps inevitably with so many powerful figures in attendance, the funeral served as a forum for real-world geopolitics. Trump was seen locked in a sit-down discussion with Zelenskyy, two of the parties who say they are trying to negotiate a peace deal alongside Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said on X afterward that it was a \u201cgood meeting.\u201d But there was little immediate sign that Francis\u2019 death would solve a crisis he was unable to affect in life.",
      "Nevertheless, despite scandal within the church and uncertainty without, there was plenty of Francis\u2019 platform that few would disagree with.",
      "Re reflected this while closing the homily: \u201cEmbrace humanity that seeks the truth with a sincere heart and holds high the torch of hope.\u201d"

      "The U.S. is seeking access to more than 20 raw materials deemed strategically critical to its interests, including Ukraine\u2019s deposits of titanium, which is used for making aircraft wings and other aerospace manufacturing, and uranium, which is used for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons. Ukraine also has lithium, graphite and manganese, which are used to make electric vehicle batteries.",
      "After Kyiv felt the initial U.S. draft of the deal disproportionately favored American interests, it introduced new provisions aimed at addressing those concerns.",
      "According to Shmyhal, the latest version would establish an equal partnership between the two countries and last for 10 years. Financial contributions to a joint fund would be made in cash, and only new U.S. military aid would count toward the American share. Assistance provided before the agreement was signed would not be counted. Unlike an earlier draft, the deal would not conflict with Ukraine\u2019s path toward European Union membership \u2014 a key provision for Kyiv.",
      "The Ukrainian Cabinet was expected to approve the agreement\u2019s text before it could be signed in Washington. The deal would then need to be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament before it could take effect.",
      "The negotiations come amid rocky progress in Washington\u2019s push to stop the war.",
      "In Moscow, a senior Kremlin official said Wednesday that clinching a deal to end the war \u201cis far too complex to be done quickly,\u201d as the U.S. labors to bring momentum to peace efforts and expresses frustration over the slow progress.",
      "Meanwhile, a nighttime Russian drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city of Kharkiv wounded at least 45 civilians, officials said. The United Nations reported that the number of Ukrainian civilian casualties has surged in recent weeks."

      "When it roamed the Earth 80 million years ago, a 40-foot-long Tyrannosaurus rex was one of nature's most terrifying prospects. Soon, it could be a purse.",
      "A group of researchers and bio-engineers in the U.K. say they\u2019re working to produce high-end clutches and totes with T. rex skin grown from fossilized remains of the ancient carnivore.",
      "The team is seeking to grow sustainable leather using collagen from the beast sometimes known as the King of the Dinosaurs that last lived 68 million years ago in North America and Asia. If successful, the project will be the first example of leather developed from an extinct species.",
      "The project's developers say the lab-grown material will be fully biodegradable and structurally identical to traditional leather. It will also be \u201cinnovative and ethically sound,\u201d Che Connon, professor of tissue engineering at Newcastle University, said in a statement.",
      "Connon also works for biotechnology company Lab-Grown Leather, which is developing the project with Dutch creative agency\u00a0VML and genomic engineering firm The Organoid Company.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re unlocking the potential to engineer leather from prehistoric species, starting with the formidable T-Rex,\u201d added Connon, who is one of the project\u2019s leaders.",
      "Connon and his colleagues may be eyeing the fashion industry \u2014 market data provider Fortune Business Insights says the global $500 billion leather goods market will be worth $855 billion by 2032 \u2014 and sectors beyond, such as the automotive industry.",
      "But experts say the chances of their achieving results anytime soon look less than likely. When they do commercially produce lab-grown T. rex leather, it will be expensive.",
      "The \u201cgimmick\u201d is at a \u201cvery early stage,\u201d said Tom Ellis,\u00a0professor of synthetic genome engineering at Imperial College London. \u201cI doubt that our knowledge of dinosaur evolution is good enough to be able to design a collagen gene specifically from T. rex.\u201d",
      "Producing real T. rex leather is \u201cvery far-fetched,\u201d added Ellis, who explained that the properties of any collagen that results from the project are likely to be similar to that of a cow or a chicken.",
      "That means any ensuing products will look and feel like any other alternative leather, Ellis said. \u201cIt gives them something that is at least unique and can justify a much\u00a0higher price,\u201d he said.",
      "Scientists can, in theory, get collagen gene sequences from any animal \u2014 it is the most abundant protein in mammals, for example, \u2014 and companies such as Geltor and Modern Meadow have made leather-like materials from genetically engineered collagen, launching small batches\u00a0of expensive products.",
      "If achieved, sustainably engineered animal leather may have environmental benefits. Right now, most leather is a byproduct of the cattle industry, which is partly responsible for deforestation in places such as the Amazon. Many synthetic and vegan leathers, meanwhile, are made of fossil fuel-derived plastics that don\u2019t biodegrade, according to World Wide Fund.",
      "In the meantime, while scientists are preoccupied with whether they can make dinosaur purses, fashionistas have time to stop and think about whether they should buy them."

      "A 30-year-old man was arrested and charged with several counts of murder in connection with the attack that officials do not believe was an act of terrorism.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know:",
      "The crash",
      "The attack happened at East 41st Avenue and Fraser Street at  8:14 p.m. local time, police said on X. People were at the Lapu Lapu Day block party in East Vancouver, an annual event that celebrates the Filipino culture.",
      "Yoseb Vardeh, who co-owns a food truck at the festival, told the Vancouver Sun that he heard an engine revving moments before a speeding vehicle drove down a pedestrian-only area. He said when he walked out of his food truck, he saw \"bodies everywhere.\"",
      "Clothing vendor Kris Pangilinan told The Associated Press that he heard what sounded \"like an F1 car about to start a race\" immediately followed by screams. He said he could hear the sound of bodies hitting the hood of the SUV as it sped through the street.",

      "\"He just pushed the gas all the way through the whole block ... crashing into everyone in his way,\" another witness said on NBC\u2019s \"TODAY\" show.",
      "\"Last night, as members of Vancouver\u2019s Filipino community gathered for a celebration of community and culture in East Vancouver, their collective safety and security were stolen when a man in a vehicle drove through a festival,\" the city\u2019s interim police chief, Steve Rai, said Sunday.",
      "Before the festival, police worked with the city to assess risks and found \"no known threats to the event or to the Filipino community,\" Rai explained. He said that, as a result, it was determined that police officers and heavy vehicle barricades were not necessary at the festival site.",
      "Officials said they do not believe the attack was an act of terrorism.",
      "The city said the Canadian flag will be flown at half-staff at all city buildings until further notice to honor the victims.",
      "The death toll",
      "Eleven people, aged 5 to 65, were killed and more than two dozen injured, police said, warning that the death toll could climb.",
      "Authorities have not publicly named the victims but have said they were taken to nine hospitals.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Toan Le said that three of his relatives were killed. He identified them as his brother, Richard Le, 47; his sister-in-law, Linh Hoang, 30; and his niece, Katie Le, 5.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re just one of the many, many families that have been affected by this tragedy, so even though we have lost three loved ones, we have closure, we can take next steps,\u201d he said. \u201cOther families are not as lucky and are just waiting to see if their loved one is going to make it.\u201d",
      "What is Lapu Lapu Day?",
      "In 2023, the province of British Columbia declared April 27 to be Lapu Lapu Day to celebrate the legacy of Datu Lapu-Lapu, a fearless Indigenous Visayan chieftain who was the first to rise against the tide of Spanish colonization, the festival\u2019s website states. He is often regarded as the country's first national hero.",
      "Last year was the inaugural block party.",
      "Headliners for the event were Filipino American artists Apl.de.Ap and J. Rey Soul from the group Black Eyed Peas.",
      "Apl.de.Ap said he and J. Rey Soul had just finished performing and left the stage minutes before the crash.",
      "\"It\u2019s hard to describe the shock and the heaviness we feel,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Please keep the victims, their families, and the organizers in your prayers. They need all the love and strength right now. The one thing I have noticed \u2014 from the audience to the messages sent around, is the sense of community that wraps its loving arms around us. We love you all.\"",
      "\"We came to Vancouver to celebrate and be with our community ... devastated beyond words to learn about the tragedy that unfolded,\" J. Rey Soul said. \"Still in shock. Thoughts and prayers to everyone and all the families affected. Sending love and prayers to all the Filipinos in BC.\"",
      "Filipino BC said in a statement on Instagram: \"We are still finding the words to express the deep heartbreak brought on by this senseless tragedy. We are devastated for the families and victims.\"",
      "The suspect",
      "Police identified the driver as 30-year-old Kai-Ji Adam Lo. He\u2019s been charged with eight counts of second-degree murder, and police say further charges are anticipated.",
      "Festivalgoers subdued the man after the rampage until police arrived and took him into custody.",
      "Authorities said the suspect is a Vancouver resident who has a history of mental illness, and he is known to police.",
      "Mayor Sim said officials believe \"that mental health appears to be the underlying issue here.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) confirmed that Lo was under the care of a mental health team and was on extended leave under the Mental Health Act.",
      "When a person is on leave, they are monitored by a community mental health team that provides treatment and support as necessary, VCH said in a statement. If the person is not able to or refuses to follow their care plan, the mental health team can recall the person to the hospital.",
      "VCH said that an extended leave is intended to help people maintain their treatment plans while transitioning back into the community.",
      "\"In this situation, the care team followed established guidelines for a client on extended leave, and there was no indication this person was not following their treatment plan or presented a public safety risk,\" the statement read.",
      "At a news conference this week, police confirmed that Lo's brother, Alexander Lo, was murdered last year. CTV News reported that Lo set up a GoFundMe for funeral expenses and wrote that the death hit him with \"overwhelming force.\" The GoFundMe has been removed.",
      "A man was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in that case. CTV News, however, reported that the case is subject to a\u00a0publication ban, a court order that bars the media from sharing any information that could identify a victim, witness, or anyone else connected."

      "Video from Indian news agency ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake, showed\u00a0firefighters using megaphones to address those gathered on the ledges and the roof, requesting them to remain calm and wait for rescuers to reach them."

      "HONG KONG\u00a0\u2014\u00a0China\u2019s Shenzhou-19 crewed spacecraft landed in the north of the country on Wednesday, state broadcaster CCTV reported, after a one-day delay due to weather conditions at the landing site.",
      "The spacecraft and its three crew were sent into space in October last year to work on\u00a0China\u2019s \u201cTiangong\u201d permanently inhabited space station.",
      "Shenzhou crewed spaceflights have been a regular fixture of the country\u2019s space program for the past two decades and have increased in frequency in recent years after\u00a0China\u00a0officially completed \u201cTiangong\u201d in November 2022.",
      "The fast development of\u00a0China\u2019s manned and unmanned space program has alarmed the United States, which has encountered issues with its own crewed spaceflights.",
      "China\u00a0is aiming to achieve a manned landing on the moon by 2030.",
      "The Shenzhou-19 crew was made up of\u00a0two male\u00a0astronauts\u00a0ages 48 and 34\u00a0and\u00a0China\u2019s third female astronaut,\u00a0age 35. It was the first spaceflight for the two younger\u00a0astronauts.",
      "All part of the Chinese military\u2019s air force, the crew have been conducting experiments, some related to the construction of human habitats.",
      "One of these experiments was expected to involve exposing bricks made from simulated lunar soil to conditions in space.",
      "Should the tests prove successful, the bricks could be a key material used in the construction of a permanent lunar research station, which\u00a0China\u00a0hopes to complete by 2035.",
      "Shenzhou missions have involved trios of\u00a0astronauts\u00a0and six-month stays in space, with an overlap period of several days where the departing crew hand over the station to the newly arrived group."

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea said Wednesday that leader Kim Jong Un had observed the first test-firings of missiles from a recently launched destroyer \u2014 the first such warship for the North \u2014 and called for accelerating efforts to strengthen his navy\u2019s nuclear attack capabilities.",
      "North Korea last week unveiled the 5,000-ton destroyer equipped with what it called the most powerful weapons built in its warship industry. During Friday\u2019s launching ceremony at the western port of Nampo, Kim called the ship\u2019s construction \u201ca breakthrough\u201d in modernizing North Korea\u2019s naval forces.",
      "Outside experts say it is North Korea\u2019s first destroyer and that it was most likely built with Russian assistance. They say North Korea\u2019s naval forces lag behind South Korea\u2019s but still view the destroyer as a serious security threat as it could bolster North Korea\u2019s attack and defense capabilities.",
      "The official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday that Kim watched the tests of the destroyer\u2019s supersonic and strategic cruise missiles, anti-aircraft missile, automatic guns and electronic jamming guns earlier this week.",
      "He appreciated the ship\u2019s combination of powerful strike weapons and conventional defenses and set tasks to speed the nuclear-arming of his navy, the report said.",
      "During the ship\u2019s launching ceremony, Kim said the destroyer would be deployed early next year. He said the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine would be his next big step in strengthening his navy. He underscored the need to beef up North Korea\u2019s deterrence capability to cope with what he called escalating U.S.-led hostilities targeting the North.",
      "An analysis of photos of the warship shows that its anti-air radar system is most likely from Russia, said Lee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea. He said the warship\u2019s engine system and some of its anti-air weapons systems also most likely came from Russia.",
      "North Korea and Russia have been sharply expanding military and other cooperation in recent years, with the North supplying troops and conventional weapons to support Russia\u2019s war efforts against Ukraine. The U.S., South Korea and their partners worry Russia will most likely in return provide North Korea with high-tech weapons technologies that can enhance its nuclear program as well as shipping other military and economic assistance.",
      "Lee said the deployment of a warship with an advanced radar system off North Korea\u2019s west coast could sharply bolster its air defense capabilities for Pyongyang, the capital. Lee said South Korea, which has 12 destroyers, still vastly outpaces North Korea\u2019s naval forces. But he said the North Korean destroyer, which can carry about 80 missiles, can still pose a serious threat, as South Korea\u2019s navy has not likely braced for such an enemy warship.",
      "Animosities on the Korean Peninsula are running high as North Korea continues its weapons testing activities meant to enlarge its nuclear and missile arsenals. On Monday, North Korea confirmed for the first time that it had sent combat troops to Russia to support its war efforts against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked North Korea and promised not to forget the sacrifices of North Korean soldiers for Russia."
