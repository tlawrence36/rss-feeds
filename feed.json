    "story": [
      "Hip hop superstar Drake is now complaining about rival rapper Kendrick Lamar\u2019s performance of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d at this year\u2019s Super Bowl",
      "Hip hop superstar Drake is now complaining about rival rapper Kendrick Lamar's performance of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d at this year's Super Bowl, adding it to his defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group over the diss track and its allegations of pedophilia against Drake.",
      "\u201cThe Recording was performed during the 2025 Super Bowl and broadcast to the largest audience for a Super Bowl halftime show ever, over 133 million people, including millions of children, and millions more who had never before heard the song or any of the songs that preceded it,\" says the amended lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "It adds, \"It was the first, and will hopefully be the last, Super Bowl halftime show orchestrated to assassinate the character of another artist.\u201d",
      "Although Lamar removed the word \u201cpedophile\u201d that's in the track during the halftime show, the fact that it was omitted showed that \u201cnearly everyone understands that it is defamatory,\u201d the suit says. It also alleges Universal Music used financial benefits and leveraged business relationships to secure the headliner spot for Lamar at the Super Bowl, and promoted the performance.",
      "\u201cDrake\u2019s amended complaint makes an already strong case stronger,\u201d his lawyer, Michael Gottlieb, said in a statement. \"Drake will expose the evidence of UMG\u2019s misconduct, and UMG will be held accountable for the consequences of its ill-conceived decisions.\u201d",
      "This year's Super Bowl and its halftime show were the most-watched ever, according to Nielsen.",
      "In a statement responding to the court filing, Universal Music, the parent record label of both artists, continued to deny Drake's allegations.",
      "\u201cDrake, unquestionably one of the world\u2019s most accomplished artists and with whom we\u2019ve enjoyed a 16-year successful relationship, is being misled by his legal representatives into taking one absurd legal step after another,\" the company said. \u201cIt is shameful that these foolish and frivolous legal theatrics continue.\u201d",
      "The amended lawsuit also adds that defamatory portions of \u201cNot Like Us\" were played at the Grammy Awards in February, when the single won five awards, including song and record of the year. The suit claims that Universal Music also helped secure the Grammy nominations and allowed the song to be played at the ceremony.",
      "Drake sued Universal Music, but not Lamar, for undisclosed damages in January, saying the company published and promoted \u201cNot Like Us\u201d despite its false pedophilia allegations and suggestions that listeners should resort to vigilante justice.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard at Drake\u2019s Toronto home and two attempted break-ins there, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand\u2019s value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year. The amended lawsuit also adds more online comments indicating people believe the pedophilia allegations.",
      "Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner with 22 Grammy wins, have been beefing for years. The feud is among the biggest in hip hop in recent years.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year, as both launched diss tracks at each other, including Lamar's \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young / You better not ever go to cell block one,\u201d Lamar raps.",
      "In its motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Universal Music says Drake helped fuel the beef with his own inflammatory diss tracks aimed at Lamar.",
      "\u201cPlaintiff, one of the most successful recording artists of all time, lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated,\" the motion says. \"Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds.\u201d",

His final broadcast will be Aug. 30 \u2014 Week 1 of the 2025 college football season \u2014 and the network said additional programming to celebrate Corso is also planned.",
      "\"My family and I will be forever indebted for the opportunity to be part of ESPN and \u2018College GameDay\u2019 for nearly 40 years,\u201d Corso said in a statement to ESPN. \u201cI have a treasure of many friends, fond memories and some unusual experiences to take with me into retirement.\u201d",
      "Corso, who turns 90 in August, began his popular headgear segment in October 1995 at a game at Ohio State. Since then, he has gone 286-144 in 430 selections wearing everything from helmets and mascot heads to dressing up as the Fighting Irish leprechaun from Notre Dame, the Stanford tree and historic figures James Madison and Benjamin Franklin.",
      "\u201cNot so fast, my friend\u201d is one of his most well-known comments and his good humor alongside Kirk Herbstreit, Rece Davis and Desmond Howard and many others going back more than three decades helped make Corso and the show a beloved staple for millions on college football Saturdays.",
      "Corso's career has lasted through a health scare in 2009, when he suffered a stroke that left him unable to speak for a while. He returned to \u201cCollege GameDay \u201dlater that year. Though he hasn't joined his colleagues as much on the road in recent years, Corso was at the site of last year's national title game between Ohio State and Notre Dame in Atlanta.",
      "Corso was a college and pro football coach for 28 years before transitioning to broadcasting. He coached 15 years in college at Louisville, Indiana and Northern Illinois.",

      "Martindale said his many years as a radio DJ were helpful to him as a game show host because radio calls for constant ad-libs and he learned to handle almost any situation in the spur of the moment. He estimated that he hosted nearly two dozen game shows during his career.",
      "Martindale wrote in his memoir that the question he got asked most often was \u201cIs Wink your real name?\u201d The second was \u201cHow did you get into game shows?\u201d",
      "He got his nickname from a childhood friend. Martindale is no relation to University of Michigan defensive coordinator Don Martindale, whose college teammates nicknamed him Wink because of their shared last name.",
      "Born Winston Conrad Martindale on Dec. 4, 1933, in Jackson, Tennessee, he loved radio since childhood and at age 6 would read aloud the contents of advertisements in Life magazine.",
      "He began his career as a disc jockey at age 17 at WPLI in his hometown, earning $25 a week.",
      "After moving to WTJS, he was hired away for double the salary by Jackson\u2019s only other station, WDXI. He next hosted mornings at WHBQ in Memphis while attending Memphis State. He was married and the father of two girls when he graduated in 1957.",
      "Martindale was in the studio, although not working on-air that night, when the first Presley record \u201cThat\u2019s All Right\u201d was played on WHBQ on July 8, 1954.",
      "Martindale approached fellow DJ Dewey Phillips, who had given Presley an early break by playing his song, to ask him and Presley to do a joint interview on Martindale\u2019s TV show \u201cTop Ten Dance Party\u201d in 1956. By then, Presley had become a major star and agreed to the appearance.",
      "Martindale and Presley stayed in touch on occasion through the years, and in 1959 he did a trans-Atlantic telephone interview with Presley, who was in the Army in Germany. Martindale\u2019s second wife, Sandy, briefly dated Presley after meeting him on the set of \u201cG.I. Blues\u201d in 1960.",
      "In 1959, Martindale moved to Los Angeles to host a morning show on KHJ. That same year he reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with a cover version of \u201cDeck of Cards,\u201d which sold over 1 million copies. He performed the spoken word wartime story with religious overtones on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show.\u201d",
      "\u201cI could easily have thought, \u2019Wow, this is easy! I come out here, go on radio and TV, make a record and everybody wants to buy it!\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven if I entertained such thoughts, they soon dissipated. I learned in due time that what had happened to me was far from the ordinary.\u201d",
      "A year later he moved to the morning show at KRLA and to KFWB in 1962. Among his many other radio gigs were two separate stints at KMPC, owned by actor Gene Autry.",
      "His first network hosting job was on NBC\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s This Song?\u201d where he was credited as Win Martindale from 1964-65.",
      "He later hosted two Chuck Barris-produced shows on ABC: \u201cDream Girl \u201967\u201d and \u201cHow\u2019s Your Mother-in-Law?\u201d The latter lasted just 13 weeks before being canceled.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve jokingly said it came and went so fast, it seemed more like 13 minutes!\u201d Martindale wrote, explaining that it was the worst show of his career.",
      "Martindale later hosted a Las Vegas-based revival of \u201cGambit\u201d from 1980-81.",
      "He formed his own production company, Wink Martindale Enterprises, to develop and produce his own game shows. His first venture was \u201cHeadline Chasers,\u201d a coproduction with Merv Griffin that debuted in 1985 and was canceled after one season. His next show, \u201cBumper Stumpers,\u201d ran on U.S. and Canadian television from 1987-1990.",
      "He hosted \u201cDebt\u201d from 1996-98 on Lifetime cable and \u201cInstant Recall\u201d on GSN in 2010.",
      "Martindale returned to his radio roots in 2012 as host of the nationally syndicated \u201cThe 100 Greatest Christmas Hits of All Time.\u201d In 2021, he hosted syndicated program \u201cThe History of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll.\u201d",
      "In 2017, Martindale appeared in a KFC ad campaign with actor Rob Lowe.",
      "He is survived by Sandy, his second wife of 49 years, and children Lisa, Madelyn ad Laura and numerous grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his son, Wink Jr. Martindale's children are from his first marriage which ended in divorce in 1972.",

      "Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d has become a phenomenon",
      "Before Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d began airing Tuesday, Ulla Malmgren stocked up on coffee and prepared meals. She doesn't want to miss a moment of the 20-day, 24-hour event.",
      "\u201cSleep? Forget it. I don\u2019t sleep,\u201d she said.",
      "Malmgren, 62, isn't alone. The show, called \u201c Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen \u201d in Swedish and sometimes translated as \u201cThe Great Elk Trek\u201d in English, began in 2019 with nearly a million people watching. In 2024, the production hit 9 million viewers on SVT Play, the streaming platform for national broadcaster SVT.",
      "The livestream kicked off a week ahead of schedule due to warm weather and early moose movement. Malmgren was ready.",
      "From now until May 4, the livestream's remote cameras will capture dozens of moose as they swim across the \u00c5ngerman River, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) northwest of Stockholm, in the annual spring migration toward summer grazing pastures.",
      "Not much happens for hours at a time, and fans say that's the beauty of it.",
      "\u201cI feel relaxed, but at the same time I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a moose, oh! What if there\u2019s a moose? I can\u2019t go to the toilet!\u2019\u201d said William Garp Liljefors, 20, who has collected more than 150 moose plush toys since 2020.",
      "\u201cThe Great Moose Migration\" is part of a trend that began in 2009 with Norwegian public broadcaster NRK's minute-by-minute airing of a seven-hour train trip across the southern part of the country.",
      "The slow TV style of programming has spread, with productions in the United Kingdom, China and elsewhere. The central Dutch city of Utrecht, for example, installed a \u201c fish doorbell \u201d on a river lock that lets livestream viewers alert authorities to fish being held up as they migrate to spawning grounds.",
      "Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University in Sweden, said slow TV has roots in reality television but lacks the staging and therefore feels more authentic for viewers. The productions allow the audience to relax and watch the journey unfold.",
      "\u201cIt became, in a strange way, gripping because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,\" she said. \"But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.\u201d",
      "As an expert and a fan of \u201cThe Great Moose Migration,\u201d Hill said the livestream helps her slow down her day by following the natural rhythms of spring.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely a moment to have a calm, atmospheric setting in my own home, and I really appreciate it,\u201d she said.",
      "The calming effect extends to the crew, according to Johan Erhag, SVT's project manager for \u201cThe Great Moose Migration.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone who works with it goes down in their normal stress,\u201d he said.",
      "The moose have walked the route for thousands of years, making it easy for the crew to know where to lay some 20,000 meters (almost 12 miles) of cable and position 26 remote cameras and seven night cameras. A drone is also used.",
      "The crew of up to 15 people works out of SVT\u2019s control room in Ume\u00e5, producing the show at a distance to avoid interfering with the migration.",
      "SVT won't say how much the production costs, but Erhag said it's cheap when accounting for the 506 hours of footage aired last year.",
      "Erhag said Swedes have always been fascinated by the roughly 300,000 moose roaming in their woods. The Scandinavian country's largest animal is known as \u201cKing of the Forest.\u201d A bull moose can reach 210 centimeters (6 feet 10 inches) at shoulder height and weigh 450 kilograms (992 pounds).",
      "Despite their size, the herbivores are typically shy and solitary.",
      "\u201cWe actually don\u2019t see it very often. You often see it when you\u2019re out driving maybe once or twice in your life,\u201d Erhag said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing why it has been so, so popular. And then you bring in the nature to everyone\u2019s living room.\"",
      "Hanna Sandberg, 36, first began watching the show in 2019, though she didn't spot any moose. She tuned in the following year, finally saw some and got hooked.",
      "\u201cYou can watch them and be a part of their natural habitat in a way that you could never be otherwise,\u201d she said.",
      "After hours of showing an empty forest, a camera captures footage of a moose approaching the riverbank. Suddenly, slow TV turns urgent.",
      "The push alert hits SVT's app \u2014 \u201cF\u00f6rsta \u00e4lgarna i bild!\u201d which translates to \u201cFirst moose on camera!\u201d \u2014 as viewers worldwide tune in. The livestream's chat explodes as commenters type encouragement for the animal, now making its way into the water.",
      "\u201dI would actually like to be a little fly on the wall in every household that watches the moose migration. Because I think there is about a million people saying about the same thing: \u2018Go on! Yes, you can do it!\u2019\" Malmgren said.",
      "Mega-fans like Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, are committed to watching as many hours as possible.",
      "\u201cI was late to school because I saw moose and my teacher was like, \u2018What, you saw moose in the city?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018No, it\u2019s on the TV,\u2019\u201d Garp Liljefors said.",
      "Malmgren said friends and family have learned not to bother her when the moose are on the move.",
      "\u201cWhen someone asks me, \u2018What are you doing? Oh, never mind, it\u2019s the great migration,\u2019\" she said. \"They know.\u201d",

      "Five years after Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and hauled to jail in handcuffs, the disgraced movie mogul returns to a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday for a new trial covering the very same allegations",
      "NEW YORK -- Five years after Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and hauled to jail in handcuffs, the former movie mogul returns to a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday for a new trial covering the very same allegations \u2014 plus one that hasn't been tried before.",
      "It isn\u2019t double jeopardy, but rather a legal redo after a New York appeals court overturned the landmark #MeToo verdict a year ago.",
      "The state\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s convictions and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial after finding that the original one was tilted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",
      "Jury selection could take a few days. Opening statements and the start of testimony are expected next week. Judge Curtis Farber said that in addition to 12 jurors, six alternates will be picked. Prosecutors expect the retrial to last a month.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Weinstein\u2019s retrial:",
      "In some ways, the new trial will be two trials spliced into one.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faces charges involving two women from his original trial in 2020, Jessica Mann and Miriam Haley, and he\u2019s being tried for the first time on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t in the first case.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone. Prosecutors are not allowed to retry Weinstein on certain counts that he was acquitted of during his first trial, including charges of predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape.",
      "The judicial reboot will play out in a different climate than Weinstein\u2019s first trial, which drew intense media attention and saw protesters chanting \u201crapist\u201d outside the courthouse.",
      "The #MeToo movement, spawned by scores of allegations in 2017 against the ex-studio boss, has evolved and ebbed over time, and Weinstein has since been convicted in a separate rape case in Los Angeles \u2014 a verdict he is also appealing.",
      "While some stars are still facing a legal reckoning for alleged sexual misconduct \u2013 like Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who is set to go to trial next month \u2013 the drumbeat of allegations against powerful figures has abated from #MeToo\u2019s early days.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on two charges from his original trial: one count of criminal sex act for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and one count of third-degree rape for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Haley, a former production assistant on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway,\u201d testified at the 2020 trial that he pushed her onto a bed at his Manhattan apartment in June 2006 and forced oral sex on her, undeterred by her kicks and pleas of, \u201cNo, please don\u2019t do this, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, acknowledged that she kept in touch with Weinstein, exchanged warm messages with him, and accepted an invitation to his hotel room two weeks after the alleged assault, where he pulled her into bed for sex. Under New York law applicable at the time, Weinstein has not being charged with rape in connection with Haley\u2019s allegations.",
      "Mann, who said she saw Weinstein as a \u201cpseudo father\u201d figure as she pursued an acting career after a rough upbringing, testified at the 2020 trial that he trapped her in a hotel room in March 2013, ordered her to undress as he loomed over her, and then raped her. She alleges that Weinstein raped her again eight months later at a Beverly Hills hotel, where she worked as a hairdresser.",
      "Mann also kept in touch with Weinstein after the alleged assault, testifying that she sent him flattering emails, because \u201chis ego was so fragile,\u201d she said, and it \u201cmade me feel safe, worshipping him in this sense.\u201d",
      "In addition to Haley and Mann, Weinstein is also charged with one count of criminal sex act for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "That woman, who was not part of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, has not been named publicly. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Prosecutors said that the woman came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein's conviction, but revisited them and secured a new indictment after the first verdict was thrown out.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors shouldn't have waited nearly five years to bring the additional charge.",
      "New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction in April 2024.",
      "In a 4-3 decision, the court said then-Judge James Burke had denied Weinstein a fully fair trial by letting three women testify about allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case and his decision to let prosecutors confront Weinstein, if he had testified, over his history of brutish behavior.",
      "The court labeled the allegations against Weinstein \u201cappalling, shameful, repulsive conduct\u201d but warned that \u201cdestroying a defendant\u2019s character under the guise of prosecutorial need\u201d did not justify some trial evidence and testimony. Burke\u2019s term expired at the end of 2022, and he is no longer a judge.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Court of Appeals Judge Madeline Singas wrote that her colleagues in the majority were continuing a \u201cdisturbing trend of overturning juries\u2019 guilty verdicts in cases involving sexual violence.\u201d",
      "The ruling came at \u201cthe expense and safety of women,\u201d she wrote.",

      "McIntyre\u2019s attorneys had criticized the police investigation of the shooting, alleging the case relied too much on self-serving statements from witnesses in the car when the shooting happened.",
      "\u201cTaymor McIntyre is not guilty of capital murder, murder, or manslaughter, and the reason for that is very simple,\u201d John Hunter, one of McIntyre\u2019s attorneys, told jurors during closing arguments last week. \u201cYou have to do it right. You have to do the work. And this case clearly demonstrates the work wasn\u2019t done.\u201d",
      "The jury found McIntyre not guilty of capital murder, which would have meant a life sentence without the chance of parole. The jury will now hear evidence in the trial\u2019s punishment phase before deciding on a sentence.",

      "NAPLES, Italy -- Hundreds of once-missing artifacts, hunted down over decades by a special police unit, have been unveiled for the first time in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples, in southern Italy.",
      "In its vaults, the museum preserves 15,000 artifacts seized or confiscated from the black market over the years by a police unit focused on the protection of cultural heritage. It is the loot of raiders who for decades have targeted sites from classical antiquity in southern Italy, such as Pompeii and Herculaneum. Some even used underwater metal detectors, GPS, sonar and drones to extract treasures from the shipwrecks and archaeological sites submerged in the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "From its repository, the museum selected 600 pieces to display for visitors. Among them is a statue that had been in an apartment building's courtyard since the early 20th century until its theft in the 1980s, and which was found in 2009. There are artifacts from Pompeii that a French archaeologist bought from a local farmer in the 1990s for 50,000 lire (about $28 today). There are also ancient ceramics, coins, bronzes, marbles, pottery, furnishings, weapons and armor dating from the Archaic Period (approximately 650 to 480 BC) to the Middle Ages.",
      "\u201cIt is a beautiful exhibition that tells a beautiful story, a story also of redemption for our stolen archaeological artifacts, which often find their way into private property or even international museums,\" Massimo Osanna, the head of national museums at Italy\u2019s culture ministry, who helped curate the exhibition, said in an interview. \"Thanks to the work of the public prosecutor\u2019s office and the police, together with the ministry, (these artifacts) are finally coming home and to light.\u201d",
      "In 2023, the latest year for which there are complete records, the police unit recovered over 100,000 artifacts which it estimates are worth a total 264 million euros ($299 million).",

      "First, the nation\u2019s top law firms",
      "WASHINGTON -- First the nation\u2019s top law firms. Then its premier universities. Now, President Donald Trump is leaning on the advocacy groups that underpin U.S. civil society.",
      "Trump said Thursday that the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status not just of Harvard, but environmental groups and specifically the ethics watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. It could be a devastating financial blow to the nonprofit organizations \u2014 and his perceived political foes.",
      "The president\u2019s remarks, during an event at the White House, began to confirm what advocacy groups have been quietly warning: Trump\u2019s campaign of retribution is coming next for them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a charitable organization,\u201d Trump said about CREW, in particular. \u201cThe only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at a lot of things.\u201d",
      "Trump and his team have been working their way through the nation\u2019s institutions, threatening to chisel away at the independence and autonomy of the law firms, college campuses and now advocacy groups \u2014 or putting them at risk of losing their federal funds or professional livelihood.",
      "It's all coming quickly, not yet 100 days into the new administration, and in ways historically unheard of in this country for their speed and scope. And it's sending shock waves reverberating throughout the American system.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day in this country when organizations that provide critical services to their communities are under attack from their government,\u201d said Cole Leiter, executive director of the advocacy group Americans Against Government Censorship. \u201cNo administration, Republican or Democratic, should be able to weaponize the weight of the government against their political enemies.\"",
      "On their own, Trump's actions are an almost daily list of executive pronouncements from the White House. The Trump administration has issued orders against the law firms that had cases or attorneys perceived to be against him, and it has made demands of the universities over their rules around campus activism.",
      "Thursday brought potentially more to the stack: Trump singled out CREW, the watchdog group whose founder, Norm Eisen, played a pivotal role in Trump\u2019s first impeachment, and the environmental groups that largely stand at odds with his \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d agenda.",
      "\u201cTax exempt status \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a privilege. It\u2019s really a privilege, and it\u2019s been abused by a lot more than Harvard,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be making some statements. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d",
      "But taken together, the executive orders and actions and memos are making one thing clear: The Trump administration is eager to test new ways to flex executive power, and dare the courts and Congress to intervene. And there\u2019s more expected to come.",
      "Environmental, immigration and civil society advocacy groups have been bracing for potential threats to their tax-exempt status, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. The person said some expect Trump might start taking action against the environmental groups on Earth Day, which is Tuesday.",
      "These are the largely nonprofit organizations and groups, many based in Washington, advocating for various communities, constituencies and causes.",
      "Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said environmental groups have heard that the Trump administration is preparing executive orders targeting the tax status of environmental groups that work on climate change, as well as that of any foundations that fund their work.",
      "\u201cTrump is marshaling all the power of government to punish his perceived enemies,\" Suckling said. \"We\u2019ve got a crack legal team and will have him in court within 24 hours. We\u2019re ready and waiting for him to come at us.\u201d",
      "CREW has been a leading ethics group in Washington, with Trump long the subject of its probes.",
      "Ahead of the 2024 election, the group was part of the legal effort to disqualify Trump from regaining the White House under the 14th Amendment, in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. More recently, CREW sued over the firing of federal workers by Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\u201cFor more than 20 years, CREW has exposed government corruption from politicians of both parties who violate the public trust and has worked to promote an ethical, transparent government,\" said Jordan Libowitz, the organization's vice president.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on civil society have created a climate that is potentially chilling for the organizations in question \u2014 but they have had mixed results.",
      "Five of the major law firms and Trump reached a deal in which they agreed to provide a combined hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono counsel to causes the administration says it supports. The firms are trying to avoid various sanctions, including terminated federal contracts, federal employment investigations over diversity hiring and others.",
      "While Columbia University agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s demands to overhaul its rules for public protests rather than risk billions of dollars in lost federal funds, Harvard rebuffed the administration and now faces a $2 billion federal funding freeze and the threat to its tax-exempt status.",
      "The tax-exempt status allows nonprofit organizations to receive donations that are crucial to their financial bottom line. Changing that could, in some situations, lead to calamity.",
      "\u201cGood governance groups are the heart of a healthy democracy,\" Libowitz said. \"We will continue to do our work to ensure Americans have an ethical and accountable government.\u201d",

      "Taking a mental health leave from work is becoming more of an option for people in the United States even thought most of them probably don't know it",
      "NEW YORK -- Her first panic attack came at a company-wide meeting, right before her scheduled presentation. Carolina Lasso had given many similar talks about her marketing team's accomplishments. When her name was called this time, she couldn\u2019t speak.",
      "\u201cI felt a knot in my throat,\u201d Lasso said. \u201cMy head, it felt like it was inside a bubble. I couldn\u2019t hear, I couldn\u2019t see, and it felt like an eternity. It was just a few seconds, but it was so profound, and in a way earth-shattering to me.\u201d",
      "Lasso was struggling after a cross-country move followed by a divorce. Her boss suggested a mental health leave, a possibility she didn\u2019t know existed. She worried whether taking time off would affect how her team viewed her or cost her a future promotion, but in the end she did.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thankful for that opportunity to take the time to heal,\" Lasso, 43, said. \u201cMany people feel guilty when they take a leave of absence when it\u2019s mental health-related. ... There is some extra weight that we carry on our shoulders, as if it had been our fault.\u201d",
      "Despite a fear of repercussions, more adults are recognizing that stepping back from work to deal with emotional burdens or psychological conditions that get in the way of their lives is a necessary choice, one that a growing number of employers recognize.",
      "ComPsych Corp., a provider of employee mental health programs and absence management services, encourages its business clients to make the well-being of workers a priority before individuals get to a breaking point while also having processes in place for those who require leaves of absence.",
      "\u201cSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, collectively we\u2019ve just been in this constant state of turmoil,\u201d Jennifer Birdsall, the senior clinical director at ComPysch, said. \u201cWe just have had this barrage of change and uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Depression, anxiety and adjustment disorder, which involves excessive reactions to stress, were the top three diagnoses of employees who took mental health leaves in the past two years among clients of Alight, a Chicago-based technology company which administers leaves and benefits for large employers.",
      "A mental health leave can last weeks or months. In some cases, workers get approval to work a reduced schedule or to take short periods of time off when needed, using an approach called \u201cintermittent leave.\u201d",
      "At most U.S. organizations with 50 or more employees, people can request leaves through the Family and Medical Leave Act. The federal law entitles workers with serious health conditions to paid or unpaid leaves of up to 12 weeks, depending on state and local laws.",
      "Some employers require people to use sick days or accumulated vacation days to continue receiving a paycheck while out. For longer leaves, workers can access short-term disability plans, if their employer offers one.",
      "Lasso's leave lasted six months, and included therapy and travel to India for additional treatment. She returned to her job but decided after a year to leave for good. She later launched a business to train people on fostering a more humane work culture.",
      "A mental health leave is \u201cnot only OK, but it can really unlock new possibilities once we have the time to do the work \u2014 therapy, medication, whatever it is \u2014 and have enough distance from work to be able to reconnect with ourselves,\u201d Lasso said.",
      "A social stigma around mental health challenges causes many people to avoid seeking treatment or requesting a leave of absence. Newton Cheng, director of health and performance at Google, hopes to change that by sharing his own struggles.",
      "His first self-disclosure happened during the pandemic, when a senior manager invited employees at a meeting to share how they were doing. When it was his turn, Cheng started crying.",
      "He explained he was struggling to live up to his expectations of himself as a father and didn't know how to turn things around.",
      "\u201cIt was just totally horrifying to me because, one, I had just cried in front of my coworkers and I was definitely taught as a professional \u2014 and as a man \u2014 you do not do that,\" Cheng recalled. \"And then two, I had never really articulated and said out loud those words. I hadn\u2019t even allowed myself to think that. But now they\u2019re out there and I had to face them.\u201d",
      "Colleagues responded by relaying their own struggles, but Cheng's difficulties continued. By February 2021, he couldn't get out of bed because he felt paralyzed by dread, he said. A therapist said he was showing symptoms of major depression and anxiety.",
      "\u201cI just realized, \u2018I\u2019m struggling a lot and this goes pretty deep. I don\u2019t think I can keep just putting duct tape on this. I probably need to take some leave,\u2019\u201d Cheng recalled.",
      "Hoping his decision would benefit others, he announced to 200 people at a conference that he planned to take mental health leave. Instead of derailing the gathering as he feared, his honesty inspired fellow conference attendees to open up.",
      "\"It was like a fireworks show,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe he did that.\u2019 Then they forgot about me. But the tone was set. It was like \u2019Oh, this is what we\u2019re doing. Let me talk about what\u2019s going on with me, too.'\u201d",
      "While balancing classes and a full-time job during her last year of college, Rosalie Mae began struggling to get out of bed and crying uncontrollably. Yet she felt like she had \u201cto keep it together\u201d to avoid burdening her colleagues at the University of Utah bookstore, where Mae worked as an accounting clerk.",
      "Then she found herself calling a suicide hotline. \u201cOnce it reached that point, I knew, especially at the urging of my husband, we need to do something more,\u201d Mae, 24, said.",
      "In her case, that meant taking a five-week work leave to put her own health and well-being first. She recommends the same for others who find themselves in a similar position.",
      "\u201cTaking a mental health leave is not necessarily a cure-all, but it is important to give yourself a break and allow yourself to regroup, make a plan of how to proceed and take the steps to work towards feeling better,\" Mae said.",
      "Before broaching the subject of a mental health leave with a manager, consider the workplace culture and the strength of your professional relationships, Cheng said. He recalls saying, \u201cFor my health and well-being, and the sake of my family and what's best for the business, the least risky thing for me to do is to go on leave soon.\u201d",
      "Individuals who suspect an unsympathetic reception can simply say, \u201cI need to go on medical leave. I need time to recover,\u201d he advised.",
      "There's also no legal or ethical requirement to tell everyone you work with the nature of your leave.",
      "\u201cYour coworkers don't need to know why,\u201d said Seth Turner, co-founder of AbsenceSoft, a leave and accommodation management solutions provider. \u201cThey just need to know, 'I\u2019m going to be here at this time, and I'm going to be gone at this time, and I'll be back.'\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition",
      "LONDON -- In a judgment with far-reaching implications, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition.",
      "The ruling was cheered by some feminists who have campaigned to safeguard rights for women on the basis of biological sex. Trans rights campaigners were disappointed, and worry about the ruling's implications for transgender women.",
      "The court was asked to determine the definition of a woman under Britain\u2019s 2010 Equality Act, which sets out protections against discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, race, religion and other traits.",
      "The case stems from a 2018 law passed by the Scottish Parliament calling for 50% female representation on the boards of Scottish public bodies. Its definition of women included trans women whose gender is legally affirmed with a Gender Recognition Certificate.",
      "A feminist group, For Women Scotland, challenged that in court, saying the Scottish government had overstepped its powers by effectively redefining the meaning of \u201cwoman.\u201d",
      "The group lost a ruling in a Scottish court in 2022 but was later granted permission to take its case to the Supreme Court, which held hearings in November.",
      "Justice Patrick Hodge said he and four other judges ruled unanimously that \u201cthe terms woman and sex in the Equality Act refer to a biological woman.\u201d",
      "In the law, \u201cthe words \u2018sex,\u2019 \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019 \u2026 mean (and were always intended to mean) biological sex, biological woman and biological man,\u201d the judges wrote.",
      "The judges argued that a broader definition that includes transgender people would make the Equality Act \u201cincoherent and unworkable.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can identify no good reason why the legislature should have intended that sex-based rights and protections under the (Equality Act) should apply to these complex, heterogenous groupings, rather than to the distinct group of (biological) women and girls (or men and boys) with their shared biology leading to shared disadvantage and discrimination faced by them as a distinct group,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The ruling makes no mention of intersex people, who also are not explicitly protected under the Equality Act.",
      "As in other countries, the issue has polarized opinion, pitting transgender rights campaigners against \u201cgender critical\u201d feminists, who argue that trans women's rights should not come at the expense of those who are born biologically female.",
      "For Women Scotland said it was \u201cabsolutely jubilant\u201d at the ruling. \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author J.K. Rowling, a prominent supporter of the group, said the court victory had \u201cprotected the rights of women and girls across the U.K.\u201d",
      "But LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall said there is \u201cdeep concern\u201d surrounding the ruling's consequences.",
      "Vic Valentine, manager of the group Scottish Trans, said the judgment \u201cseems to have totally missed what matters to trans people \u2014 that we are able to live our lives, and be recognized, in line with who we truly are.\u201d",
      "Amnesty International U.K. described the ruling as \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but said it is \u201cimportant to stress that the court has been clear that trans people are protected under the Equality Act against discrimination and harassment.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court judges stressed that their ruling should not be seen as an attack on transgender people. They said it \u201cdoes not remove or diminish the important protections \u2026 for trans people\u201d under the Equality Act, which bans discrimination against transgender people.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what the ruling will mean in practice.",
      "The judgment highlights a range of spaces and services that could be intended just for women, including \u201crape or domestic violence counselling, domestic violence refuges, rape crisis centers, female-only hospital wards and changing rooms.\u201d The law already allowed for trans women to be excluded from single-sex spaces under certain circumstances, but Wednesday\u2019s ruling appears to make such a ban easier.",
      "The ruling could also see transgender female athletes excluded from participating in women\u2019s and girls sports, and there could also be ramifications in workplaces.",
      "But much depends on how the ruling is interpreted and implemented.",
      "Hannah Ford, an employment partner at law firm Stevens & Bolton, told the BBC that because of the ruling, ensuring workplaces are welcoming places for trans people will be \u201can uphill battle.\u201d",
      "She said one positive aspect was that \u201cat least we have simplicity and clarity. So it is in one sense a triumph of sense over legal incoherency and legal fiction.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. researchers will soon test whether livers from a gene-edited pig could treat people with sudden liver failure \u2014 by temporarily filtering their blood so their own organ can rest and maybe heal.",
      "The first-of-its-kind clinical trial has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, according to pig producer eGenesis, which announced the step Tuesday with its partner OrganOx.",
      "An estimated 35,000 people in the U.S. are hospitalized each year when their liver suddenly fails. There are few treatment options and death rates as high as 50%. Many don't qualify for a liver transplant or can't get a match in time.",
      "The new study, which is expected to get underway later this spring, is a twist on the quest for animal-to-human organ transplants. Researchers won't transplant the pig liver but instead will attach it externally to study participants.",
      "The liver is the only organ that can regenerate, but the question is whether having the pig's liver filter the patient's blood for several days could give it that chance.",
      "In experiments with four deceased bodies, that \u201cbridge\u201d attempt showed the pig liver could support some functions of a human liver for two or three days, said Mike Curtis, CEO of Massachusetts-based eGenesis, which genetically modifies pigs so their organs are more humanlike.",
      "The trial will enroll up to 20 patients in intensive-care units who don't qualify a liver transplant, he said. A device made by Britain\u2019s OrganOx, currently used to preserve donated human livers, will pump participants' blood through the pig liver.",
      "It\u2019s the latest step in attempts to use gene-edited pig organs to save human lives. Pig kidneys from eGenesis and another pig producer, United Therapeutics, are being used in experimental transplants.",

      "A new study has found that fewer people crossed state lines for abortions in 2024 than the previous year",
      "Fewer people crossed state lines to obtain abortions in 2024 than a year earlier, a new survey has found.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, estimates in a report released Tuesday that the overall number of clinician-provided abortions in states where it's legal rose by less than 1% from 2023 to 2024.",
      "But the number of people crossing state lines for abortions dropped by about 9%.",
      "The report, based on a monthly survey of providers, is the latest look at how the abortion landscape in the U.S. has evolved since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022 in a ruling that eliminated a national constitutional right to abortion and opened the door to state bans and restrictions.",
      "Guttmacher estimates there were 1.04 million abortions in 2024, up about 1% from its total the previous year.",
      "Multiple studies have found that the total number of abortions in the U.S. has risen since Dobbs, despite some states implementing bans.",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Guttmacher's tally does not capture self-managed abortions such as people obtaining abortion pills from community networks, foreign pharmacies or through telehealth from medical providers in states that have laws intended to protect those who send pills into places with bans. There\u2019s a court battle over the constitutionality of such laws. But another survey found that the number of telehealth pills being sent into states with bans has been growing and accounted for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S. by the summer of 2024.",
      "Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at Guttmacher, said even though the number of abortions is up, it's likely some people who would like to end their pregnancies are not able to.",
      "\u201cWe know that some people are accessing abortion through telehealth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know it\u2019s not an option for everybody.\u201d",
      "The number of people crossing state lines for abortions dropped to about 155,000 from nearly 170,000.",
      "The year-to-year impact varies by state.",
      "For instance, about 1 in 8 abortions in Florida in the first half of 2023 were provided to people coming from out of state. By the second half of 2024 \u2014 when a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy took effect \u2014 only about 1 in 50 were for people from another state.",
      "More people traveled to states including Virginia and New York after the Florida law took hold.",
      "A drop in people traveling to Minnesota could be linked to abortions being offered again in clinics in Wisconsin.",
      "Most abortions in Kansas are provided to people from elsewhere and the number grew as clinic capacity expanded.",
      "A working paper released in March provided different insight into the impact of the bans.",
      "It found that birth rates rose from 2020 to 2023 in counties farther from abortion clinics. Rates rose faster for Black and Hispanic women, those with lower education levels, and people who are unmarried.",
      "\u201cThe takeaway is that distance still matters,\u201d said Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economic professor and one of the authors of the working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t obvious that that would be the case.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese bans are more than just policies; these are direct attacks on bodily autonomy,\" said Regina Davis Moss, president and CEO of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women\u2019s Reproductive Justice Agenda.",
      "The bans also exacerbate the huge disparities in maternal mortality for Black women in the U.S, she said. Black women died around the time of childbirth at a rate nearly 3.5 times higher than white women in 2023.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be faced with increasing numbers of births, which is going to increase the maternal mortality rate, the infant mortality rate and inequities in care,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very upsetting and sad.\u201d",

      "An Associated Press and Side Effects Public Media data analysis shows one in six visits to the emergency department in 2022 that resulted in hospital admission had a wait of four or more hours",
      "AURORA, Ill. -- At her mother\u2019s home in Illinois, Tracy Balhan flips through photos of her dad, Bill Speer. In one picture, he\u2019s smiling in front of a bucket of sweating beers and wearing a blue T-shirt that reads, \u201cPops. The man. The myth. The legend.\u201d",
      "Balhan\u2019s father died last year after struggling with dementia. During one episode late in his life, he became so agitated that he tried to exit a moving car. Balhan recalls her dad \u2014 larger than life, steady and loving \u2014 yelling at the top of his lungs.",
      "His geriatric psychiatrist recommended she take him to the emergency room at Endeavor Health\u2019s Edward Hospital in the Chicago suburb of Naperville because of its connection to an inpatient behavioral care unit. She hoped it would help get him a quick referral.",
      "But Speer spent 12 hours in the emergency room \u2014 at one point restrained by staff \u2014 waiting for a psych evaluation. Balhan didn\u2019t know it then, but her dad\u2019s experience at the hospital is so common it has a name: ER boarding.",
      "One in six visits to the emergency department in 2022 that resulted in hospital admission had a wait of four or more hours, according to an Associated Press and Side Effects Public Media data analysis. Fifty percent of the patients who were boarded for any length of time were 65 and older, the analysis showed.",
      "Some people who aren\u2019t in the middle of a life-threatening emergency might even wait weeks, health care experts said.",
      "ER boarding is a symptom of the U.S. health care system\u2019s struggles, including shrinking points of entry for patients seeking care outside of ERs and hospitals prioritizing beds for procedures insurance companies often pay more for.",
      "Experts also warn the boarding issue will worsen as the number of people 65 and older in the U.S. with dementia grows in the coming decades. Hospital bed capacity in the U.S. may not keep up. Between 2003 and 2023, the number of staffed hospital beds was static, even as emergency department visits shot up 30% to 40% over that same period.",
      "For older people with dementia, boarding can be especially dangerous, Chicago-based geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Shafi Siddiqui said. One research letter published in June 2024 in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at more than 200,000 patients and found long ER stays could be linked to a higher risk of dementia patients developing delirium \u2014 a temporary state of mental confusion and sometimes hallucinations.",
      "\u201cPeople need to be enraged about (boarding),\u201d said Dr. Vicki Norton, president-elect of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine.",
      "National emergency physician groups have lobbied for years to keep boarding under control. While they\u2019ve made some progress, nothing substantial has changed, despite concerns that it leads to worse patient outcomes.",
      "Dr. Alison Haddock, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said that\u2019s because boarding is a failing of the entire health care system that manifests in the ER, so solving it demands a systemic approach.",
      "Federal and state policy decisions made nearly 40 years ago limited the number of hospital beds, said Arjun Venkatesh, who studies emergency medicine at Yale. People are now living longer, he said, resulting in more complicated illnesses.",
      "In 2003, there were 965,000 staffed hospital beds compared to 913,000 in 2023, according to the American Hospital Association. And another JAMA research letter published in February shows there are 16% fewer staffed beds in the U.S. post-pandemic.",
      "The ones available may be prioritized for \u201cscheduled care\u201d patients who need non-urgent procedures, like cancer care or orthopedic surgeries. Insurance companies pay hospitals more for those surgeries, Haddock said, so hospitals aren\u2019t likely to move patients into those beds \u2014 even as emergency rooms fill up.",
      "Though long stays in the emergency department are common, there isn\u2019t good data that tracks the extremes, emergency medicine experts said.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently ended a requirement that hospitals track the \u201cmedian\u201d wait times in their emergency departments. An advisory group that develops quality measures for CMS recommended that the agency try to more accurately capture long emergency department stays. That measure has recently been submitted to CMS, which can choose to adopt it.",
      "Patients\u2019 families worry that long emergency room stays may make things worse for their loved ones, forcing some to search for limited alternatives to turn for support and care.",
      "Nancy Fregeau lives in Kankakee, Illinois, with her husband Michael Reeman, who has dementia.",
      "Last year, she said he visited the Riverside Medical Center emergency department several times, often staying more than four hours and in one case more than 10, before finally getting access to a behavioral care bed. Riverside declined to comment on Reeman\u2019s case.",
      "During long waits, Fregeau doesn\u2019t know what reassurance she can offer her husband.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough for anyone to be in the ER but I cannot imagine someone with dementia being in there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just kept saying \u2018When am I going? What\u2019s happening?\u2019\u201d",
      "Since November, Reeman has been going to the MCA Senior Adult Day Center in Kankakee. Fregeau said Reeman treats the day center like it\u2019s his job, offering to vacuum and clean, but comes home happier after having time around other people and away from the house.",
      "In Illinois, there are fewer adult day centers than there are counties, and other resources for people with dementia are shrinking, too. A report from the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living found that 1,000 nursing homes in the U.S. closed between 2015 and 2022. At least 15 behavioral health centers, which are facilities that specialize in treating mental health issues, closed in 2023.",
      "With fewer places for patients to go after being discharged, hospital beds are being used for longer, exacerbating the boarding problem. It\u2019s becoming more difficult to get a specialty hospital bed, especially when patients\u2019 dementia causes aggression.",
      "That was the case for Balhan\u2019s father, who became increasingly agitated during his ER stay. Hospital staff told Balhan the behavioral care unit wasn\u2019t taking dementia patients, so Speer was stuck in the ER for 24 hours until they found a behavioral health facility, separate from the health system, that would take him.",
      "While the hospital couldn\u2019t comment on Speer\u2019s specific situation, Endeavor Health spokesperson Spencer Walrath said its behavioral care unit typically admits geriatric psychiatry patients, including those with dementia, but it depends on factors like bed availability and the patient\u2019s specific medical needs.",
      "Balhan feels that the U.S. health care system failed to treat her dad as a human being.",
      "\"It didn\u2019t feel to me like he was being treated with any dignity as a person,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything could change, that would be the change that I would want to see.\"",

      "The man was spotted around 11 a.m. in a parking lot outside of the UnitedHealthcare corporate campus in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka. City spokesman Andy Wittenborg said the man contacted the FBI's field office in Minneapolis once he arrived, and an FBI negotiator made contact with him by phone.",

      "City police and the FBI coordinated their response and had steady contact with the man, successfully encouraging him to peacefully surrender to authorities after about an hour with no threat to the public, Wittenborg said. The man, who'd had previous contacts with Minnetonka police, had showed up at a security checkpoint where he was not supposed to be.",
      "Wittenborg said the incident had nothing to do with the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was shot to death in New York City on Dec. 4 as he was walking to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan. The man accused of killing him, Luigi Mangione, 26, pleaded not guilty in December to state murder and terror charges.",
      "News helicopter video of the aftermath showed over a dozen law enforcement vehicles from multiple agencies at the scene, as well as an ambulance that was standing by. There were no reports of injuries.",
      "The CEO\u2019s killing and ensuing manhunt leading to Mangione\u2019s arrest rattled the business community, with some health insurers hastily switching to remote work or online shareholder meetings. It also galvanized health insurance critics \u2014 some of whom rallied around Mangione as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills.",
      "Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind. Police say the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase commonly used to describe insurer tactics to avoid paying claims.",

      "Health departments got an influx of cash to deal with COVID-19, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make up for years of neglect. On top of that, trust in vaccines has eroded. Health officials warn the situation is primed to get worse.",
      "Recent cuts by the Trump administration have pulled billions of dollars in COVID-19 related funding \u2014 $2 billion of it slated for immunization programs for various diseases. Overseeing the cuts is Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who rose to prominence leading an anti-vaccine movement. While Kennedy has said he wants his agency to prevent future outbreaks, he's also declined to deliver a consistent and forceful message that would help do so \u2014 encouraging people to vaccinate their children against measles while reminding them it is safe.",
      "At the same time, lawmakers in Texas and about two-thirds of states have introduced legislation this year that would make it easier to opt out of vaccines or otherwise put up barriers to ensuring more people get shots, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. That further undercuts efforts to keep infectious diseases at bay, health officials said.",
      "The more than 700 measles cases reported this year in the U.S. have already surpassed last year\u2019s total. The vast majority \u2014 more than 540 \u2014 are in Texas, but cases have popped up in 23 other states. Two Texas children have died. A 6-year-old girl from Gaines County, the center of the outbreak, died in February, the first measles death in the U.S. in a decade. An 8-year-old girl from the same town, Seminole, died earlier this month.",
      "Children in the U.S. are generally required to be vaccinated to go to school, which in the past ensured vaccination rates stayed high enough to prevent infectious diseases like measles from spreading. But a growing number of parents have been skipping the shots for their kids. The share of children exempted from vaccine requirements has reached an all-time high, and just 92.7% of kindergartners got their required shots in 2023. That\u2019s well below the 95% coverage level that keeps diseases at bay.",
      "Keeping vaccination rates high requires vigilance, commitment and money.",
      "Though the outbreak in Texas started in Mennonite communities that have been resistant to vaccines and distrustful of government intervention, it quickly jumped to other places with low vaccination rates. There are similar under-vaccinated pockets across the country that could provide the tinder that sparks another outbreak.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a hurricane over warm water in the Caribbean,\u201d said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development in Houston. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s warm water, the hurricane will continue to accelerate. In this case, the warm water is the unvaccinated kids.\u201d",
      "Lubbock receives a $254,000 immunization grant from the state annually that can be used for staff, outreach, advertising, education and other elements of a vaccine program. That hasn\u2019t increased in at least 15 years as the population grew.",
      "It used to be enough for three nurses, an administrative assistant, advertising and even goodies to give out at health fairs, Wells said. \u201cNow it covers a nurse, a quarter of a nurse, a little bit of an admin assistant, and basically nothing else.\u201d",
      "Texas has among the lowest per capita state funding for public health in the nation, just $17 per person in 2023, according to the State Health Access Data Assistance Center.",
      "Vaccines are among the most successful tools in public health\u2019s arsenal, preventing debilitating illnesses and lowering the need for expensive medical care. Childhood vaccines prevent 4 million deaths worldwide each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says the measles vaccine will save some 19 million lives by 2030.",
      "U.S. immunization programs are funded by a variable mix of federal, state and local money. Federal money is sent to every state, which then decides how much to send to local health departments.",
      "The stagnant immunization grant funding in Texas has made it harder for local health departments to keep their programs going. Lubbock\u2019s health department, for example, doesn't have the money to pay for targeted Facebook ads to encourage vaccinations or do robust community outreach to build trust.",
      "In Andrews County, which borders Gaines County, the biggest cost of its immunization program is personnel. But while everything has gotten more expensive, the grant hasn't changed, Health Director Gordon Mattimoe said. That shifts the burden to county governments. Some kick in more money, some don\u2019t. His did.",
      "The problem: keeping people safe from outbreaks requires high vaccination rates across a broad region, and germs don\u2019t stop at county borders.",
      "Andrews County, population 18,000, offers a walk-in vaccine clinic Monday through Friday, but other West Texas communities don\u2019t. More than half the people who come to the clinic travel from other counties, Mattimoe said, including much larger places and Gaines County.",
      "Some had to drive an hour or more. They did so because they had trouble getting shots in their home county due to long waits, lack of providers and other issues, Mattimoe said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re unable to obtain it in the place that they live. ... People are overflowing, over to here,\u201d Mattimoe said. \u201cThere\u2019s an access issue.\u201d",
      "That makes it more likely people won\u2019t get their shots.",
      "In Gaines County just 82% of kindergartners were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella. Even in Andrews County, where, at 97%, the vaccination rate is above the 95% threshold for preventing outbreaks, it has slipped two percentage points since 2020.",
      "The health departments millions of Americans depend on for their shots largely rely on two federal programs: Vaccines for Children and Section 317 of the Public Health Services Act. Vaccines for Children mostly provides the actual vaccines. Section 317 provides grants for vaccines but also to run programs and get shots into arms.",
      "About half of kids qualify for Vaccines for Children, a safety-net program created in response to a 1989-1991 measles epidemic that sickened 55,000 people and killed 123. Section 317 money sent to state and local health departments pays for vaccines as well as nurses, outreach and advertising.",
      "Health departments generally use the programs in tandem, and since the pandemic they\u2019ve often been allowed to supplement it with COVID-19 funds.",
      "The 317 funds have been flat for years, even as costs of everything from salaries to vaccines went up. A 2023 CDC report to Congress estimated $1.6 billion was needed to fully fund a comprehensive 317 vaccine program. Last year, Congress approved less than half that: $682 million.",
      "This, along with insufficient state and local funding, forces hard choices. Dr. Kelly Moore, a preventive medicine specialist, said she faced this dilemma when directing Tennessee's immunization program from 2004 to 2018.",
      "\u201cWhat diseases can we afford to prevent and how many people can we afford to protect? Those decisions have to be made every year by every state,\u201d said Moore, who now runs the advocacy group Immunize.org.",
      "A rural clinic may have to be closed, or evening and weekend hours eliminated, she said. \u201cIt becomes difficult for them to staff the clinics they have and difficult for the people in those communities to access them, especially if they\u2019re the working poor.\u201d",
      "At the same time, health officials say more funding is needed to fight misinformation and mistrust about vaccines. In a 2023 survey by the National Association of County and City Health Officials, 80% of local health departments reported vaccine hesitancy among patients or their parents in the previous year, up from 56% in 2017.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t invest in education, it becomes even more difficult to get these diseases under control,\" Moore said.",
      "Facing these headwinds, things got much worse in March when Kennedy\u2019s health department canceled billions of dollars in state and local funding. After 23 states sued, a judge put a hold on the cuts for now in those states but not in Texas or other states that didn\u2019t join the lawsuit.",
      "But local health departments are not taking chances and are moving to cut services.",
      "HHS said the money, allocated through COVID-19 initiatives, was cut because the pandemic was over. But CDC had allowed the money to be used to shore up public health infrastructure generally, including immunization programs.",
      "Before he was confirmed as health secretary, Kennedy vowed not to take vaccines away. But in Texas, his department\u2019s cuts mean state and local health departments are losing $125 million in immunization-related federal funding as they deal with the measles outbreak. A spokesperson for the federal health department did not respond to an AP request for comment.",
      "Dallas County, 350 miles from where the outbreak began, had to cancel more than 50 immunization clinics, including at schools with low measles vaccination rates, said Dr. Philip Huang, the county\u2019s health director.",
      "Near the center of the outbreak, Lubbock\u2019s health department said seven jobs are on the line because they were paid by those grants. Included in the affected work are immunizations.",
      "Across the border in New Mexico, where the outbreak has spread, the state lost grants that funded vaccine education.",
      "It's still unclear how the recently announced $2 billion in cuts will affect immunization programs across the country, but details are starting to trickle out from some states.",
      "Washington state, for example, would lose about $20 million in vaccination-related funding. Officials were forced to pause mobile vaccine efforts on their \u201cCare-A-Van,\u201d which has administered more than 6,800 COVID-19 vaccines, 3,900 flu vaccines and 5,700 childhood vaccines since July. The state also had to cancel more than 100 vaccine clinics scheduled through June, including more than 35 at schools.",
      "Connecticut health officials estimate if the cuts stand, they will lose $26 million for immunization. Among other reductions, this means canceling 43 contracts with local health departments to increase vaccination rates and raise confidence in vaccines, losing vaccination clinics and mobile outreach in underserved neighborhoods, and stopping the distribution of vaccine-related educational materials.",
      "Several of the 23 states suing the federal government, including Minnesota, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, cite losses to vaccine programs.",
      "As the cuts further cripple already struggling health departments, alongside increasingly prominent and powerful anti-vaccine voices, doctors worry that vaccine hesitancy will keep spreading. And measles and other viruses will too.",
      "\u201cMy whole life\u2019s purpose is to keep people from suffering. And vaccines are a tremendous way to do that,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t invest in them to get them in arms, then we don\u2019t see their benefits.\u201d",

      "A key program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle chronic disease in Native American and Alaska Native communities has been gutted in the federal health layoffs",
      "CHANDLER, Ariz. -- CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spent time in tribal communities in Arizona and New Mexico this week highlighting ways they are trying to prevent chronic disease among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, something he has said is one of his top priorities.",
      "But Kennedy didn't appear to publicly address a Native health program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle disproportionate rates of conditions like diabetes and liver disease. The program, called Healthy Tribes, was gutted in this month's federal health layoffs.",
      "Some Native leaders say they are having trouble grasping the dissonance between Kennedy's words and his actions. With little information, they wonder if Healthy Tribes is part of the Trump administration's push to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. There also is confusion about what and who is left at the 11-year-old program, which was part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under Kennedy's agency, and doled out $32.5 million a year.",
      "Tribal leaders and health officials told The Associated Press that cuts to the Healthy Tribes program are another violation of the federal government\u2019s legal obligation, or trust responsibility, to tribal nations under treaties, law and other acts. That includes funding for health care through the Indian Health Service, as well as education and public safety for citizens of the 574 federally recognized tribes.",
      "But federal funding has long fallen short of meeting those needs, leaving tribal governments to rely on additional grants and programs like Healthy Tribes.",
      "\u201cSo many layers of communications of collaboration and partnerships have just been turned off,\u201d said Onawa Miller, a Quechan Indian Nation citizen and director of tribal public health for United South and Eastern Tribes, which serves 33 tribes in those regions of the U.S. She said her organization already has received its annual $2 million in Healthy Tribes funding.",
      "Several tribal facilities received an email from a CDC employee April 1 notifying them that the positions of many people who staffed the Healthy Tribes program had been eliminated \u201cas part of the reduction in force efforts at CDC.\u201d",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees union, which represents thousands of workers at the CDC in Atlanta, said more than 30 civil servant jobs were or are being eliminated. That includes 11 positions in the Healthy Tribes program and others in the larger Division of Population Health.",
      "An email sent to the account of Healthy Tribes director Dr. Julianna Reece, an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation, was met with an automated reply: \u201cDue to the recent HHS reduction in force, I have been placed on administrative leave and will be separated from the agency on June 2nd.\u201d Reece did not respond to requests for comment sent to her federal and personal email accounts.",
      "Part of the government upheaval in the past several weeks includes top officials at the National Institutes of Health being offered transfers to Indian Health Service offices far from Washington, D.C. The National Indian Health Board also has said the government eliminated key staff and programs at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health\u2019s Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health.",
      "The government is required to consult with tribes on decisions impacting them, like mass layoffs in February at the Indian Health Service that were rescinded hours later, and tribal leaders have warned the Trump administration that such consultations are not happening. In some cases tribes can take legal action against the U.S. for failing to meet its trust responsibilities.",
      "\u201cIt is a violation of trust, without a doubt,\u201d said W. Ron Allen, chairman of the Jamestown S\u2019Klallam Tribe in Washington state.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not answer questions related to the Healthy Tribes cuts but told the AP in an email that the Indian Health Service was not impacted by this month's workforce reductions and there are no plans to consolidate any of its offices.",
      "Kennedy's swing through the Southwest included a visit to a community health center in metro Phoenix that provides physical and mental health care to Native people and a hike with the Navajo Nation president. He also moderated a panel at the Tribal Self-Governance Conference, held on the Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona, but didn't take questions from the audience, tribal leaders on stage or journalists.",
      "Allen said he had a constructive conversation with Kennedy, reminding him IHS is already underfunded and understaffed and that tribes rely on additional federal grants and programs.",
      "\u201cYour issue is to reduce the central office, and so we\u2019re OK with that, but move the functions that serve the tribes out to the tribes,\u201d Allen said he told Kennedy. \u201cBecause if we don\u2019t have those resources, how are we gonna make our communities healthy? He agrees.\u201d",
      "Research shows Native Americans have shorter life expectancies than other ethnic groups, and the Indian Health Service says they face higher mortality rates from chronic conditions like diabetes and liver disease.",
      "In Seattle, Healthy Tribes money pays for a program called GATHER, which focuses on integrating traditional tribal medicine practices into health care. Providers at the Seattle Indian Health Board can use medicine made from plants grown in a community garden. A traditional Native medicine apprentice or healer is a part of a patient's care team.",
      "Seattle Indian Health Board President Esther Lucero, a descendant of the Navajo Nation, said her staff meets with people from the CDC and other Healthy Tribes grantees bimonthly to discuss project updates and ensure compliance with grants. But after last week's layoffs, they are having trouble contacting anyone.",

      "Lycia Ortega, interim CEO of Los Angeles-based United American Indian Involvement, echoed concerns about the ambiguous and somewhat confusing messages. Her organization uses Healthy Tribes money to foster connections between younger people and elders in Native American and Alaska Native communities.",
      "Native communities have had to push back against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to cut programs that might be considered DEI initiatives, she said, with the help of lawyers, policy experts and watchdogs who point out areas where the government might not be honoring the trust responsibility.",

Pete Ricketts and Coons, the ranking Republican and Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's East Asia subcommittee, spoke ahead of scheduled talks Friday with President Lai Ching-te, Defense Minister Wellington Koo and national security adviser Joseph Wu. Republican Sen. Ted Budd also is on the trip.",
      "The mission comes at a time that an economy-shaking trade war between the U.S. and China has some warning that China could strike out at Taiwan, a self-governed island with a vibrant democracy and the world's top production of the most advanced semiconductors. China claims Taiwan as its territory, to be retaken by force if necessary.",
      "Trump has repeatedly accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the United States\u2019 computer chip industry. His criticism of Taiwan, and his insistence last year that \u201cTaiwan should pay us\u201d for its defense, have heightened concern that the U.S., Taiwan\u2019s strongest military partner, might decide not to get too involved if China were ever to attack Taiwan.",
      "The 32% tariffs on Taiwan included in Trump\u2019s sweeping new tariffs on trade partners this month surprised many Taiwanese, who thought that their government had shown itself a true ally to Washington.",
      "\u201cLook past the rhetoric and look at the action,\u201d Ricketts said, repeating a watchword of the Republicans on Trump\u2019s statements.",
      "After saying he was in no rush to finish trade deals, the president said he thought he could wrap up talks \u201cover the next three or four weeks.\u201d",
      "Ricketts cited the priority that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has placed on helping the Asia-Pacific secure itself against China. That included making the region one of the first he visited in office, Ricketts said.",
      "Ricketts said Taiwan's leaders already had reached out to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for negotiations, moving quickly in the 90-day pause that Trump announced before the United States starts enforcing the new tariffs on most countries.",
      "Lai, Taiwan's president, has pledged to increase Taiwan's military spending to 3% of its gross domestic product, up from about 2.5%, bringing it up to nearly a fifth of its overall budget. Taiwan also is talking to Americans about partnerships in producing drones, part of taking a lesson from Ukraine in its defense against Russia in emphasizing fleet fighting forces working with portable Stingers, lawmakers said.",
      "Taiwan's own defense industry is also producing advanced weapons from submarines to small arms and anti-air missiles.",
      "\u201cOf course, there is the possibility that Xi Jinping would decide that this is the right time for the Chinese Communist Party to take aggressive action,\u201d Coons said of the Chinese president.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s exactly the wrong thing for them to do,\u201d Coons said. \u201cI think they would find a forceful and united response.\u201d",

      "CAIRO -- The World Food Program has halted food shipments to Houthi-held areas of Yemen and suspended food distribution there after the rebels looted one of its warehouses in the north, its deputy director said Thursday.",
      "The suspension is a further blow in the war-torn country, where hunger has been growing. In February, the WFP said 62% of households it surveyed couldn\u2019t get enough food, a figure that has been rising for the past nine months. It estimates that some 17 million people \u2013 early half Yemen\u2019s population -- are food insecure.",

      "The seizure was the latest friction between the Houthis and the United Nations. The rebels in recent months have detained dozens of U.N. staffers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen\u2019s capital.",
      "U.N. agencies, including the WFP, had already halted operations in Saada, the Houthis\u2019 stronghold, in February after seven WFP staffers and another U.N. worker were detained, and one of the WFP members died in prison. It continued low-level operations in other parts of Yemen under the Houthis\u2019 control.",
      "After the seizure of the warehouse, the WFP halted shipments of new supplies to Houthi-held areas, Skau said.",
      "\u201cThe operating environment needs to be conducive for us to continue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot accept that our colleagues are being detained, and much less so that our colleagues are dying in detention. And we cannot accept our assets are being looted.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we don\u2019t take lightly because the needs are massive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe humanitarian implications of this are deep and extensive \u2026 It\u2019s clear the food security situation is deteriorating.\u201d",
      "Yemen has been torn by civil war for more than a decade. Houthi rebels hold the capital Sanaa and much of the north and center of the country, where the majority of its population of nearly 40 million live. The internationally recognized government controls the south and west.",
      "Throughout the war, Yemen has been threatened by hunger, nearly falling into full-fledged famine. The impoverished nation imports most of its food.",
      "Skau said the WFP is seeking Houthi permission to distribute food that remains in other warehouses in the north. He said that if U.N. workers are released, it could resume programs distributing food to some 3 million people in Houthi-held areas.",
      "The WFP is also providing food assistance to some 1.6 million people in southern Yemen, areas controlled by the government and its allies.",
      "But the organization has warned its programs there could be hurt after U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has cut off funding for WFP\u2019s emergency programs in Yemen.",
      "A WFP official said the organization was reducing its staff in Yemen, and that around 200 employees \u2013 40% of its workforce \u2013 have been given a month\u2019s notice. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the personnel situation.",
      "\u201cWe have now a challenge in the south when it comes to the funding,\u201d Skau said. \u201cBut we\u2019re hoping that that can be resolved moving forward.\u201d",

      "The head of the U.K. Equality and Human Rights Commission says a Supreme Court ruling will exclude transgender women from women\u2019s toilets, hospital wards and sports teams",
      "LONDON -- Transgender women will be excluded from women\u2019s toilets, hospital wards and sports teams after a U.K. Supreme Court ruling, the head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission said Thursday, as trans groups digested a judgment that could have a broad and detrimental impact on daily life.",
      "While Britain\u2019s highest court said there was no clear winner in its ruling defining a woman for anti-discrimination purposes as someone born biologically female, noting that transgender people remain protected from discrimination, trans groups said the decision would undermine their rights.",
      "Equality Commission Chairwoman Kishwer Falkner said the \u201cenormously consequential\u201d ruling brought clarity and would prompt her organization to update public codes by summer to comply.",
      "\u201cSingle-sex services like changing rooms must be based on biological sex,\" she told the BBC. \u201cIf a male person is allowed to use a women-only service or facility, it isn\u2019t any longer single-sex, then it becomes a mixed-sex space.\"",
      "The ruling Wednesday came in a case that had nothing to do with those spaces, but stemmed from a 2018 law passed by the Scottish Parliament that required at least 50% women on boards of Scottish public bodies. Transgender women with gender recognition certificates were to be included in meeting the quota.",
      "But the court said that using a certificate to interpret someone's sex would clash with definitions of man and woman and, therefore, the anti-discrimination provisions of the 2010 Equality Act could \u201conly be interpreted as referring to biological sex.\u201d",
      "Out of some 66 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, about 116,000 identified as trans in the latest census count. About 8,500 gender recognition certificates have been issued.",
      "The feminist group that brought the court case said the outcome provided common sense, protected same-sex spaces for women and brought clarity to the thorny issue. But trans groups said it had caused fear and uncertainty.",
      "Trans activist jane fae, a director of the group TransActual, said she worried the ruling would mean \u201ctotal exclusion and segregation\u201d of trans women.",
      "\u201cNo trans women in women\u2019s changing rooms, no trans women in women\u2019s loos, no trans women in women\u2019s sports,\" fae said.",
      "\u201cThe number of people I have come across on social platforms, on forums, etc., saying \u2018How do I go on? I am in tears, I\u2019m in pieces. I am shattered. I am broken,\u2019\" fae said. \"That seems to be pretty much a unanimous reaction.\u201d",
      "Gendered Intelligence, a charity dedicated to understanding of gender diversity and improving trans lives, said it remained unclear how the ruling would be implemented, but said it could affect equal pay and access to rape crisis centers and domestic abuse services.",
      "\u201cUltimately, people who want to exclude trans women from services and institutions will likely feel empowered to do so,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe encourage everyone to look past the despair at this judgement and the divisive responses to it, and to continue to live and work together in solidarity and community.\u201d",
      "Falkner noted that there was no law requiring single-sex spaces and she encouraged trans groups to advocate for neutral spaces such as unisex toilets or changing rooms.",
      "Gender identity has not been as divisive in the U.K. as the U.S., where it has created political firestorms in some states, but the topic factors into Britain's own culture wars.",
      "Newspapers have reported on a group of female nurses who sued their employer after they had to share a changing room with a male colleague who identifies as female, and about a nurse who was suspended for calling a transgender pedophile \u201cmister.\u201d",
      "Chris Evans, editor of The Telegraph, a politically conservative London newspaper, said in its morning newsletter Thursday that the court had \u201cdeclared that transgender women are not legally women,\u201d and said it was looking into what the ruling means for \u201cpublic bodies who have sacrificed women\u2019s rights on the altar of inclusivity.\u201d",
      "British Transport Police announced it was reviewing its policies in light of the ruling and would temporarily change the way it conducts strip searches of transgender people in custody by assigning an officer of the same biological birth sex.",
      "Falkner said her group would continue to defend the rights of trans people.",
      "\u201cThey have rights, and their rights must be respected,\" she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a victory for an increase in unpleasant actions against trans people. We will not tolerate that.\"",

      "Macron also announced the creation of a joint French-Haitian historical commission to \u2018\u2019examine our shared past'' and assess relations, but did not directly address longstanding Haitian demands for reparations.",
      "France \u2033subjected the people of Haiti to a heavy financial indemnity, ... This decision placed a price on the freedom of a young nation, which was thus confronted with the unjust force of history from its very inception,'' Macron said in a statement.",
      "It comes on the 200th anniversary of the April 17, 1825 document issued by King Charles X of France, which recognized Haiti\u2019s independence after a slave revolt \u2014 but also imposed a 150 million gold francs debt as compensation for the loss of France\u2019s colony and enslaved labor force.",
      "Although the indemnity was later reduced to 90 million gold francs, the debt crippled the Caribbean nation, which continued to pay it off through French and American banks until 1947. Economists estimate it's the equivalent of billions of dollars today.",
      "Experts have said Haiti\u2019s current situation can be traced back to its past. Gangs have flourished in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with a growing number of children becoming members as families struggle to find food.",
      "Violence has surged since last year, with gangs that control 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, attacking new communities daily in a bid to control even more territory. More than 5,600 people were reported killed last year, with gang violence leaving more than one million people homeless in recent years.",
      "\u2033Acknowledging the truth of history means refusing to forget or erase it,\u2033 Macron said.",

      "Since taking office in 2017, Macron has already addressed France\u2019s role in past colonial conflicts, including in Algeria, Cameroon, and Rwanda.",

      "It was the second massive outage to hit Puerto Rico since New Year\u2019s Eve, when a blackout left 90% of clients without power.",

      "Authorities are still investigating the causes of the blackout. One possibility is that overgrown vegetation may have affected the grid and caused a transmission line to fail, officials said.",

      "It\u2019ll likely take weeks to find a precise reason for the blackout, although Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez said Thursday that she expects to have a very preliminary report within three days.",
      "For decades, Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority did not give the grid the maintenance and investment it required.",
      "It began crumbling throughout the years, and then on Sept. 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria hit the U.S. territory as a powerful Category 4 storm. It snapped power lines, toppled transmission towers and broke flimsy wooden light posts, leaving some people nearly a year without power.",
      "In the months that followed, crews focused on emergency repairs. It wasn\u2019t until a couple years after the hurricane that actual reconstruction began.",
      "In June 2021, the Electric Power Authority contracted Luma as it struggled to restructure its more than $9 billion debt, with negotiations still ongoing.",
      "In January 2023, the authority contracted Genera PR to oversee the generation of power on the island as part of another public-private partnership.",

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Foreign ministry officials from Bangladesh's interim government and Pakistan resumed talks on Thursday after a 15-year gap, as the two South Asian Muslim-majority nations attempted to ease strained relations.",
      "Under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted in August in a students-led mass uprising, Bangladesh expanded relations with neighboring India in every sector.",
      "But ties with India have become increasingly tense. Bangladesh\u2019s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, has criticized India for sheltering Hasina in the country and sought her extradition without any positive response from India.",
      "Yunus has meanwhile sought to improve relations with Pakistan, India's rival. In recent months he met Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif several times, and a high-level Bangladeshi military delegation made a rare visit to Pakistan in January and held talks with Pakistan\u2019s army chief General Asim Munir. In February, Bangladesh's navy took part in a multinational maritime exercise organized by Pakistan off the Karachi coast.",
      "After Hasina\u2019s exit, Bangladesh and Pakistan resumed direct trading for the first time in years. Direct flights between the countries are expected to resume soon and visa procedures have been eased while India stopped visas for Bangladeshis, except for medical emergencies.",
      "After Thursday's talks in Dhaka between Bangladesh\u2019s Foreign Secretary Jashim Uddin and his Pakistani counterpart, Uddin said Bangladesh raised historically \u201cunsettled issues\u201d with Pakistan, including a formal public apology for atrocities allegedly committed by Pakistani troops in 1971 during Bangladesh's war of independence.",
      "India helped Bangladesh win independence through a nine-month war against then West Pakistan, now Pakistan. Hasina\u2019s Awami League party regularly criticizes Pakistan for alleged atrocities during the war, when Bangladesh says about 3 million people were killed and about 200,000 women were raped by Pakistani soldiers. Pakistan rejects the claims and has never officially apologized.",
      "Local media reported earlier that Yunus' government was preparing to formally raise its demand for $4.52 billion in financial compensation from Pakistan.",
      "Uddin said the issue of the compensation was raised in Thursday\u2019s meeting.",
      "\u201cThese issues need to be resolved for having a solid foundation of our relations,\u201d Uddin said Thursday. The two sides also discussed expansion of trade and commerce and increasing cooperation in agriculture and other sectors, he added.",
      "Yunus\u2019 office said in a statement late Thursday that he held a separate meeting with the Pakistani foreign secretary and emphasized \u201cstrengthening ties with Pakistan to boost mutual cooperation and explore trade and business potentials.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are certain hurdles. We have to find ways to overcome those and move forward,\u201d Yunus told Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch.",
      "The last such consultation between the two countries was held in Islamabad in 2010 after Hasina came to power in a 2008 election with a landslide victory.",
      "Baloch said Bangladesh and Pakistan must find ways to \u201charness the potentials between the two countries,\" the statement said.",

      "MOSCOW -- Russia\u2019s Supreme Court on Thursday lifted a ban on Afghanistan\u2019s ruling Taliban, a group that was designated as a terrorist organization more than two decades ago.",
      "The move was a diplomatic victory for the Taliban, who were put on Russia\u2019s list of terrorist organizations in 2003, making any contact with them punishable under Russian law.",
      "At the same time, Taliban delegations have attended various forums hosted by Russia as Moscow has sought to position itself as a regional power broker.",

      "The Taliban initially promised a more moderate rule than during their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001, but started to enforce restrictions on women and girls soon after the 2021 takeover. Women are barred from most jobs and public places, including parks, baths and gyms, while girls are banned from education beyond sixth grade.",

      "The U.N. this year renewed its call for the Taliban to lift the bans.",

      "Some Taliban want greater engagement with the international community and want to scrap harsher policies to attract more outside support.

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The European Central Bank cut interest rates Thursday for the seventh time to counter worries about economic growth fueled by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff onslaught.",
      "The bank\u2019s move should support economic activity in the 20 countries that use the euro currency by making credit more affordable for consumers and businesses.",
      "ECB President Christine Lagarde said at a post-decision news conference that \u201cthe major escalation in global trade tensions and the associated uncertainty will likely lower euro area growth by dampening exports.\"",
      "\"And it may drag down investment and consumption,\" she said.",
      "The bank\u2019s rate-setting council decided at a meeting in Frankfurt to lower its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.25%. The bank has been steadily cutting rates after raising them sharply to combat an outbreak of inflation from 2022 to 2023.",
      "Now that inflation has fallen, growth worries have taken center stage. The economy in the 20 countries that use the euro grew a modest 0.2% in the last three months of 2024. Inflation was 2.2% in March, close to the bank\u2019s target of 2%.",
      "The cut was widely expected by analysts given the sudden shadow cast over the eurozone\u2019s growth outlook by Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement of unexpectedly high tariffs, or import tax, on goods from other countries starting at 10% and ranging as high as 49%. The European Union faces a 20% tariff.",
      "At the bank\u2019s last meeting on March 6, Lagarde had raised the possibility of an upcoming \u201cpause\u201d in the bank\u2019s series of rate cuts. But that option was practically eliminated by Trump\u2019s announcement.",
      "The bank\u2019s benchmark steers rates throughout the economy. Lower interest rates make it less expensive to borrow money and buy goods ranging from homes to new factory equipment. That supports spending, business investment and hiring.",
      "Trump has suspended the tariffs for 90 days, but the possibility of the 20% tariff rate he has proposed for Europe left economists and policymakers concerned that the higher costs will weigh on business activity \u2014 and lead to slower growth or even a recession if he carries through. The U.S. is Europe\u2019s largest trade partner with some 4.4 billion euros ($5 billion) in goods and services crossing the Atlantic every day in both directions.",
      "Uncertainty is another factor that could slow the economy since Trump\u2019s pause for negotiations leaves it unclear where the tariff rate will actually settle. Businesses may hold off on making decisions if they don\u2019t know what their costs will be.",
      "European Union officials have offered Trump a \u201czero for zero\u201d option that would see both sides dropping tariffs on industrial goods including cars. But Trump has said that won't be enough, and raised the possibility of Europe importing large additional quantities of US liquefied natural gas.",
      "Economists at Berenberg bank think that by midyear some of the tariffs will be negotiated away, ending at around 12%. However that is still around 10 percentage points higher than average tariffs before Trump. in addition to that comes a separate 25% tariff on autos, aluminum and steel from all countries. The auto tariff will hit Europe\u2019s prominent auto industry hard - and Trump has indicated it is is not up for negotiation.",
      "Lagarde said the \u201ccloud of uncertainty\u201d over tariffs meant that rate decisions going forward would have to be taken on a meeting by meeting basis depending on what happens during the 90-day tariff truce.",
      "\u201cThere is a negotiation which is ongoing, players around the tables have stated their position, proposals have been made, at least on one side, but all of that could change,\" she said.",

      "A 24-year-old American YouTuber who visited a restricted island in the Indian Ocean last month with a Diet Coke as offering for an isolated tribe has been further detained",
      "NEW DELHI -- A 24-year-old American YouTuber who was arrested after visiting an off-limits island in the Indian Ocean with hopes of establishing contact with a reclusive tribe was further detained in custody on Thursday.",
      "Mykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov will next appear before a local court in Port Blair -- the capital of India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands -- on April 29, police said.",
      "Polyakov, from Scottsdale, Arizona, was arrested on March 31, two days after he set foot on the restricted territory of North Sentinel Island in a bid to meet people from the reclusive Sentinelese tribe.",
      "He left a can of Diet Coke and a coconut as offering for the tribe this time after he failed to contact the Sentinelese. He shot a video of the island on his camera and collected some sand samples before returning to his boat.",
      "\u201cIt may be claimed to be an adventure trip, but the fact is that there has been a violation of Indian laws. Outsiders meeting Sentinelese could endanger the tribe\u2019s survival,\u201d said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity as he isn\u2019t authorized to speak about the case under investigation.",
      "Polyakov is suspected of violating Indian laws that carry a possible sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine.",
      "Visitors are banned from traveling within 3 miles (5 kilometers) of North Sentinel Island, whose population has been isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years. The inhabitants use spears and bows and arrows to hunt the animals that roam the small, heavily forested island. Deeply suspicious of outsiders, they attack anyone who lands onto their beaches.",
      "In 2018, an American missionary who landed illegally on the beach was killed by North Sentinelese Islanders who apparently shot him with arrows and then buried his body on the beach. In 2006, the Sentinelese had killed two fishermen who had accidentally landed on the shore.",
      "An official from the U.S. consulate visited Polyakov in jail earlier this week. The U.S embassy in Delhi didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request confirming the visit or any further updates on Polyakov.",
      "Police said Polyakov had conducted detailed research on sea conditions, tides and accessibility to the island before starting his journey. He stayed on the beach for about an hour, blowing a whistle to attract the attention but got no response from the islanders.",
      "On his return he was spotted by local fishermen, who informed the authorities and Polyakov was arrested in Port Blair, an archipelago nearly 750 miles (1,207 kilometers) east of India\u2019s mainland.",

    "story": [
      "Talks between Iran and the United States over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program are \u201cin a very crucial\u201d stage",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Talks between Iran and the United States over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program are \u201cin a very crucial\u201d stage, the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said Thursday while on a visit to the Islamic Republic.",
      "The comments by Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Tehran included an acknowledgment his agency likely would be key in verifying compliance by Iran should a deal be reached. Iran and the U.S. will meet again Saturday in Rome for a new round of talks after last weekend's first meeting in Oman.",
      "Grossi's visit also coincided with Saudi Arabia's defense minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman, visiting Tehran as the highest-ranking official from the kingdom to visit Iran since the two countries reached a Chinese-mediated d\u00e9tente in 2023. That's as Saudi Arabia tries to end its decadelong war against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen \u2014 even as a new, intense campaign of U.S. airstrikes targets them.",
      "The stakes of the negotiations Saturday and the wider geopolitical tensions in the Mideast couldn't be higher, particularly as the Israel-Hamas war rages on in the Gaza Strip. U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death \u2014 and I'd like to see that, that's my first option,\u201d Trump said when asked about a possible attack while meeting Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in the Oval Office.",
      "Grossi arrived in Iran on Wednesday night and met with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who now is in Moscow for separate talks likely over the negotiations. On Thursday, Grossi met with Mohammad Eslami, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, then later toured a hall featuring some of Iran's civilian nuclear projects.",
      "\u201cWe know that we are in a very crucial, I would say, stage of this important negotiation, so I want to concentrate on the positive,\u201d Grossi told Iranian media. \u201cThere is a possibility of a good outcome. Nothing is guaranteed. We need to make sure that we put all of the elements in place ... in order to get to this agreement.\"",
      "He added: \u201cWe know we don't have much time. So this is why I'm here. This is why I'm in contact with the United States as well.\u201d",
      "Asked about Trump's threats to attack Iran, Grossi urged people to \u201cconcentrate on our objective.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnce we get to our objective, all of these things will evaporate because there will be no reason for concern,\u201d he said.",
      "For his part, Eslami said Iran expected the IAEA to \u201cmaintain impartiality and act professionally,\u201d a report from the state-run IRNA news agency said.",
      "Since the nuclear deal\u2019s collapse in 2018 with Trump\u2019s unilateral withdrawal of the U.S. from the accord, Iran has abandoned all limits on its program, and enriches uranium to up to 60% purity \u2014 near weapons-grade levels of 90%.",
      "Surveillance cameras installed by the IAEA have been disrupted, while Iran has barred some of the Vienna-based agency\u2019s most experienced inspectors. Iranian officials also have increasingly threatened that they could pursue atomic weapons, something the West and the IAEA have been worried about for years since Tehran abandoned an organized weapons program in 2003.",
      "Despite tensions between Iran and the agency, its access has not been entirely revoked. But Grossi acknowledged in a French newspaper interview that \u201cIran has enough material to build not one but several bombs.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a jigsaw puzzle; they\u2019ve got the pieces and one day they might be able to put them together,\u201d he told Le Monde. \u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go before that happens. But they\u2019re not far off, admittedly.\u201d",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric called the upcoming Iran-U.S. talks this weekend \u201ca good sign.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe very much hope that the dialogue between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran yields a positive outcome which will see the lowering of tensions in the Gulf region, in the Middle East and between the two countries,\" he said.",
      "Prince Khalid bin Salman, the son of King Salman and the brother of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, arrived in Tehran on Thursday. Iran\u2019s joint chief of staff, Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, greeted the prince on his arrival and an honor guard played for the two men.",
      "Prince Khalid, a fighter pilot, has become the first Saudi defense minister to visit Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. He's also the highest-ranking Saudi royal to visit in decades. The last was King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, who did so as crown prince in 1997 for an Organization of Islamic Cooperation meeting held in Tehran.",
      "The state-run Saudi Press Agency, announcing the prince's arrival, said his trip would include \u201ca number of meetings to discuss bilateral relations between the two countries and issues of common interest,\u201d without elaborating.",
      "The visit is significant, particularly given the decades of enmity between the two countries. Saudi Arabia has been for years trying to get a peace deal agreed to with the Houthis. A de facto ceasefire broadly has halted hostilities in the war, though the Houthis increasingly have threatened both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates amid the U.S. airstrikes.",
      "Prince Khalid met Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as well as President Masoud Pezeshkian on his trip.",
      "\u201cIt is much better for brothers in the region to cooperate and support each other than to rely on outsiders,\u201d Khamenei said, according to state media.",

      "\u201cAfter he turned back to urge his family onward, an explosion severed one of his arms and mutilated the other,\u201d according to the World Press Photo citation.",

      "In a statement issued late Wednesday night, the army said it had detained several people, including a number of Palestinians, who were involved in firing rockets in two separate attacks toward Israel in late March that triggered intense Israeli airstrikes on parts of Lebanon. Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group denied at the time it was behind the firing of rockets.",
      "The army said that a vehicle and other equipment used in the rockets attacks were confiscated and the detainees were referred to judicial authorities. The army said it had carried out raids in different parts of Lebanon to detain the suspects without giving further details.",

The United Nations meanwhile raised alarm over the mounting impact of Israel\u2019s six-week-old blockade preventing all food and other supplies from entering the territory.",
      "Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas last month and renewed its bombardment, killing hundreds of people and seizing large parts of the territory to pressure the militants to accept changes to the agreement.",
      "A strike in the southern city of Khan Younis killed five children, four women and a man from the same family, all of whom suffered severe burns, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. Strikes in northern Gaza killed 13 people, including nine children, according to the Indonesian Hospital.",
      "The Israeli military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas because it operates in residential areas. There was no immediate comment on the latest strikes.",
      "The U.N. humanitarian office, known as OCHA, said that almost all of Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million people now rely for food on the only 1 million prepared meals produced daily by charity kitchens supported by aid groups.",
      "Other food distribution programs have shut down for lack of supplies, and the U.N. and other aid groups have been sending their remaining stocks to the charity kitchens.",
      "The only other way to get food in Gaza is from markets. But most cannot afford to buy there because of spiraling prices and widespread shortages, meaning humanitarian aid is the primary food source for 80% of the population, the World Food Program said in its monthly report for April on Gaza\u2019s markets.",
      "\u201cThe Gaza Strip is now likely facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the 18 months since the escalation of hostilities in October 2023,\u201d OCHA said.",

      "Water is also growing scarce, with Palestinians standing in long lines to fill jerry cans from trucks. Omar Shatat, an official with a local water utility, said people are down to six or seven liters per day, well below the amount the U.N. estimates is needed to meet basic needs.",

      "Israel is demanding that Hamas release more hostages at the start of any new ceasefire and ultimately agree to disarm and leave the territory. Katz said that even afterward Israel will continue to occupy large \u201csecurity zones\u201d inside Gaza.",
      "Hamas is currently holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. It says it will only return them in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a lasting truce, as called for in the now-defunct ceasefire agreement reached earlier this year.",
      "Hani Almadhoun, co-founder of Gaza Soup Kitchen, said his kitchen has food for about three more weeks.",
      "\u201cBut food is loosely defined. We have pasta and rice but nothing much beyond that. No fresh produce. There is no chicken or beef. The only thing we have is canned meat,\u201d he said. He said 15-20% of the people who come to his kitchen for food leave empty-handed.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Most of the hostages have since been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israel has rescued eight and recovered dozens of bodies.",
      "Israel's offensive has killed over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- The Vatican on Thursday opened the most solemn period of Holy Week with a recovering Pope Francis largely on the sidelines, as cardinals were designated to take his place presiding over the most important liturgical services leading up to Easter.",
      "The 88-year-old Francis, who survived a life-threatening bout of double pneumonia this winter, is expected to make some appearances, however. He made a surprise cameo at the end of Palm Sunday Mass last weekend and in recent days has made some unannounced visits \u2014 including one in which he wasn\u2019t dressed in his papal white cassock \u2014 to pray in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and St. Mary Major basilica across town.",
      "By all indications he is continuing to improve after his five-week hospital stay and is slowly resuming some of his normal activities. In recent outings, he has been seen without the nasal tubes that provide supplemental oxygen and Vatican officials say he is increasingly less reliant on the therapy.",
      "On Wednesday, Francis held his first formal group audience since returning to the Vatican on March 23, meeting with the medical staff of the Gemelli hospital who cared for him during his 38-day stay. Gathered in a Vatican audience hall, Francis thanked the 70-plus doctors, nurses and administrators and asked them for their continued prayers.",
      "\u201cThank you for everything you did,\u201d Francis said, his voice still labored but seemingly stronger as he continues respiratory and physical therapy.",
      "He gave special thanks to the rector of Gemelli\u2019s affiliated Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Elena Beccalli, whom he praised for her strong leadership. \u201cWhen women command, things go well,\u201d he said in his longest public remarks since his hospitalization.",
      "Francis has delegated the demanding Holy Week liturgical celebrations to hand-picked cardinals, but the Vatican says the pope himself composed the meditations that will be read aloud by others during the Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession on Friday night at Rome\u2019s Colosseum.",
      "The Holy Thursday Mass, for example, during which the oils used in liturgical rituals throughout the year are blessed, was being celebrated by the retired head of the Vatican\u2019s patrimony office, Cardinal Domenico Calcagno. Friday\u2019s solemn commemoration of the crucifixion of Christ was assigned to Cardinal Claudio Gugerotti, who heads the Vatican office in charge of eastern rite Catholics. Easter Sunday was assigned to the retired administrator of St. Peter\u2019s, Cardinal Angelo Comastri.",
      "It remains to be seen how Francis will handle Easter Sunday\u2019s traditional \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d speech and blessing (Latin for \u201cto the city and the world\u201d). Normally the pope delivers a sometimes lengthy discourse on the state of the world from the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s, and then imparts a special blessing to the faithful in the piazza below. In theory someone else could read the speech while Francis could impart the blessing.",
      "Francis was admitted to Gemelli on Feb. 14 with bronchitis that quickly developed into a life-threatening case of double pneumonia. Upon his release March 23, doctors proscribed two months of convalescence at the Vatican with daily respiratory and physical therapy to improve his breathing and vocal function. With time, they have predicted he will be able to resume his normal activities.",

      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has arrived in Cambodia for a two-day state visit that serves as an opportunity to further strengthen already robust relations",
      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Cambodia on Thursday for a two-day state visit that serves as an opportunity to further strengthen already robust relations.",
      "The visit, Xi\u2019s first since 2016, will conclude a three-nation Southeast Asian tour that included stops in Vietnam and Malaysia. China has been increasing its influence in the region over the past decade, largely by exercising its substantial economic leverage.",
      "Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet recently described Beijing as \u201can important and indispensable friend of Cambodia that has helped support the country\u2019s economic and social development.\u201d",
      "Xi was formally greeted at the airport in Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh by head of state King Norodom Sihamoni. During his visit, Xi is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Hun Manet and Senate President Hun Sen, who is Hun Manet\u2019s father and predecessor as prime minister.",
      "In a statement at Phnom Penh International Airport after his arrival on his presidential aircraft, an American-made Air China Boeing 747, Xi said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d to visit again.",
      "\u201cCambodia is a priority in China\u2019s neighborhood diplomacy. China will unswervingly support Cambodia in upholding strategic autonomy and in pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions,\u201d he said according to a transcript of his remarks distributed by the Chinese embassy.",
      "Trade will likely be a major topic of Xi\u2019s discussions in Cambodia, which faces among the highest tariff rates proposed by Washington. In addition to Trump's universal 10% tariff, the country faces the threat of a 49% tax on exports to the U.S. once his 90-day pause expires.",
      "In addition to discussions on strengthening bilateral ties and regional and international issues, several agreements are expected to be signed on cooperation in various sectors.",
      "In both countries, Xi emphasized strengthening ties, particularly in trade and investment, amid global economic uncertainties and the backdrop of trade tensions with the United States. He underscored the need to oppose unilateralism and protectionism and uphold the multilateral trading system.",
      "China is presenting itself as a source of stability and certainty as Southeast Asia scrambles to respond to tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which threaten the region export-oriented economies whose largest markets are generally the United States.",
      "The visit comes on the 50th anniversary of the April 17, 1975 takeover of Cambodia by the communist Khmer Rouge, which imposed a reign of terror with Maoist-inspired policies that saw an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians die of starvation, overwork or executions.",
      "Beijing was the main foreign backer of the Khmer Rouge and supported the group in carrying on a guerrilla war after it was ousted from power in 1979 by an invasion from Vietnam, though such history is rarely discussed by either country.",
      "Cambodia's rapid growth in recent decades has been fueled largely by Beijing.",
      "In Hun Manet\u2019s remarks earlier this month at the inauguration of a Chinese-funded road, he called China \u201ca first-class partner country,\u201d pointing to achievements like the inauguration of the Chinese-named Angkor Siem Reap Airport and a Phnom Penh ring road named after Xi as evidence of continued strong relations and gratitude, and noted China\u2019s continued ranking as the top investor in Cambodia in 2024.",
      "China is Cambodia\u2019s largest trading partner, surpassing $15 billion in 2024 and representing nearly 30% of Cambodia\u2019s total trade volume, though greatly in Beijing\u2019s favor.",
      "Beijing also helped fund an expansion of the Ream Naval Base on Cambodia\u2019s southern coast, raising worries it could become a strategic outpost for the Chinese navy in the Gulf of Thailand. Cambodia has repeatedly denied any agreement granting China special privileges or the establishment of a foreign military base.",
      "Cambodia has stated that warships from all friendly countries are welcome to dock at its new pier, provided they comply with certain conditions. Japan announced on Tuesday that two of its minesweepers will visit the Ream base this weekend in the first foreign navy visit since the expansion project was completed.",

      "BANGKOK -- The head of Myanmar\u2019s military government granted amnesty to around 4,900 prisoners to mark the country's traditional new year, state-run media reported Thursday, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many were political detainees locked up for opposing army rule.",
      "Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the ruling military council, pardoned 4,893 prisoners, MRTV reported. Thirteen foreigners will also be released and deported from Myanmar, it said in a separate statement.",
      "Other prisoners received reduced sentences, except for those convicted of serious charges such as murder and rape, or those jailed on charges under various other security acts.",
      "If the freed detainees violate the law again they will have to serve the remainder of their original sentences in addition to any new sentence, according to the terms of their release.",
      "Mass amnesties on the holiday are not unusual in Myanmar. The releases will occur at prisons nationwide.",
      "Dozens of relatives and friends of prisoners waited early Thursday outside the main gate of Insein Prison, on the northern outskirts of Yangon, the country\u2019s largest city. No details were available about the number of prisoners released from Insein as part of the amnesty.",
      "Myanmar has been under military rule since Feb. 1, 2021, when its army ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s elected government. The takeover was met with massive nonviolent resistance, which has since become a widespread armed struggle. The country is now in civil war.",

      "This year\u2019s celebrations of Thingyan, the New Year\u2019s holiday, were more reserved than usual due to a nationwide grieving period following a devastating earthquake last month. The country is struggling to recover from the 7.7 magnitude quake on March 28 that hit its central heartland, killing about 3,725 people and leveling structures from new condos to ancient pagodas.",
      "In a New Year\u2019s speech broadcast Thursday, Min Aung Hlaing said his government will carry out reconstruction and rehabilitation measures in the quake-affected areas as quickly as possible.",
      "He also reaffirmed plans to hold a general election by the end of the year and called on opposition groups fighting the army to resolve the conflicts in political ways.",
      "During the holiday, the violent struggle between the army and pro-democracy forces continued. There were armed clashes in the countryside but the number of casualties was unclear.",

      "Yemen's Houthi rebels say U.S. airstrikes targeting the Ras Isa oil port have killed 20 people and wounded 50 others",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- U.S. airstrikes targeting the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels killed 20 people and wounded 50 others, the group said early Friday.",
      "The strikes, confirmed by the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, represent one of the highest reported death tolls so far in the campaign launched under President Donald Trump that has involved hundreds of strikes since March 15. The Iranian-backed Houthis later Friday launched a missile toward Israel that was intercepted, the Israeli military said, causing sirens to sound in Tel Aviv and other areas.",
      "The war in Yemen meanwhile further internationalized as the U.S. alleged a Chinese satellite company was \u201cdirectly supporting\u201d Houthi attacks, something Beijing did not immediately acknowledge.",
      "The Houthis\u2019 al-Masirah satellite news channel aired graphic footage of the aftermath of the attack on Ras Isa port, showing corpses strewn across the site. It said paramedic and civilians workers at the port had been killed in the attack, which sparked a massive explosion and fires.",
      "In a statement, Central Command said that \u201cU.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully,\u201d it added. It did not acknowledge any casualties and declined to comment when asked by The Associated Press regarding civilians reportedly being killed.",
      "The Ras Isa port, a collection of three oil tanks and refining equipment, sits in Yemen's Hodeida governorate along the Red Sea. NASA satellites that track forest fires showed an intense blaze early Friday morning at the site just off Kamaran Island, targeted by intense U.S. airstrikes over the last few days.",
      "The Ras Isa port also is the terminus of an oil pipeline stretching to Yemen's energy-rich Marib governorate, which remains held by allies of Yemen's exiled government. The Houthis expelled that government from Yemen's capital, Sanaa, back in 2015. However, oil exports have been halted by the decadelong war and the Houthis have used Ras Isa to bring in oil.",
      "The Houthis denounced the U.S. attack.",
      "\u201cThis completely unjustified aggression represents a flagrant violation of Yemen\u2019s sovereignty and independence and a direct targeting of the entire Yemeni people,\u201d the Houthis said in a statement carried by the SABA news agency they control. \u201cIt targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades.\u201d",
      "On April 9, the U.S. State Department issued a warning about oil shipments to Yemen.",
      "\u201cThe United States will not tolerate any country or commercial entity providing support to foreign terrorist organizations, such as the Houthis, including offloading ships and provisioning oil at Houthi-controlled ports,\u201d it said.",
      "The attack follows Israeli airstrikes on the Houthis which previously hit port and oil infrastructure used by the rebels after their attacks on Israel.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce in a briefing with journalists accused Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. Ltd., a commercial satellite image provider, of \u201cdirectly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Bruce did not elaborate in detail, but acknowledged a story by The Financial Times that quoted anonymous American officials saying the firm linked to the People\u2019s Liberation Army has provided images allowing the rebels to target U.S. warships and commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea corridor.",
      "\u201cBeijing\u2019s support, by the way, of that company, the satellite company, even after we\u2019ve engaged in discussions with them about this ... certainly contradicts their claims of being peace supporters,\u201d Bruce said.",
      "Chinese officials and the company, known by the acronym CGSTL, could not be immediately reached for comment. Chinese state media did not acknowledge the accusation. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned CGSTL in 2023 for allegedly providing satellite images to the Russian mercenary force the Wagner Group as it fought in Ukraine as part of Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "An AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than that under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.",
      "The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.",
      "The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.",
      "The U.S. campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has also linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program. A second round of negotiations between Iran and the U.S. is due to happen Saturday in Rome.",

      "The chairman and CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH has called for a free trade zone between the European Union and the United States, saying that unresolved trade tensions could seriously hurt European industries",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH, called on Thursday for a free trade zone between the European Union and the United States and said that unresolved trade tensions could seriously hurt European industries.",
      "His remarks, in the wake of the tariffs announced by President Donald Trump, appeared to echo a similar call by Elon Musk on April 5 for a zero-tariff zone between the U.S. and EU. The EU has long pushed for a \u201czero-for-zero\u201d trade agreement \u2014 with both sides dropping tariffs \u2014 but Trump has rejected the offer.",
      "Speaking at LVMH\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, Arnault said European leaders should negotiate \u201ccleverly\u201d with the U.S. administration and that national governments should take a more prominent role instead of than leaving negotiations solely in the hands of Brussels, the center of EU\u2019s \u201cbureaucratic power.\u201d",
      "France\u2019s LVMH has for decades been the world\u2019s dominant luxury group \u2014 known for products such as Mo\u00ebt & Chandon Champagne, Hennessy Cognac, Louis Vuitton handbags and Dior perfumes \u2014 but this week lost its title as the world\u2019s largest luxury company to rival Herm\u00e8s.",
      "\u201cEurope is not run by a political power, but by a bureaucratic power that spends its time issuing regulations that are unfortunately imposed on all member states and that penalize our business sectors,\u201d the 76-year-old CEO said.",
      "The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive branch, negotiates trade deals on behalf of all 27 member states. The bloc is the largest trading entity in the world.",
      "LVMH shares fell 7.8% earlier this week, following an unexpected drop in first-quarter sales.",
      "Arnault said the company may be forced to expand U.S. operations. \"We would be forced to increase our American production to avoid tariffs if Europe failed to negotiate with intelligence,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2019, LVMH shifted part of its production to the U.S. by opening a Louis Vuitton workshop in Alvarado, Texas, during Trump\u2019s first term. Trump and Arnault toured the facility together, promoting it as a symbol of U.S. manufacturing revival.",
      "But on Thursday, Arnault admitted the Texas site has underperformed so far. According to documents presented at the meeting, the U.S. accounts for 25% of LVMH\u2019s total sales.",
      "Arnault also criticized France\u2019s proposed corporate tax increases, calling them a \u201ctax on \u2018Made in France\u2019\u201d and warned they could push companies to relocate abroad.",
      "He praised the U.S. model, citing lower taxes and state-backed industrial investment. \u201cWhen you come back to France after spending a few days in the U.S., it\u2019s a bit of a cold shower,\u201d he said.",
      "Outside the Louvre Museum conference hall, where the meeting took place, dozens of protesters demanded higher taxes on the wealthy, carrying a \u201cTax the rich\u201d sign alongside and a large puppet of Arnault depicted as a thief, a rope around his chest and hands tied behind his back.",
      "\u201cA tax of 2% on the wealth of France\u2019s ultra-rich could bring in up to \u20ac25 billion a year,\u201d said Fanny Petitbon, a spokesperson for the group 350.org. \u201cThat would be enough to invest in public services and accelerate an energy transition that benefits everyone.\u201d",

      "The IMF\u2019s Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, said Thursday that the Trump administration\u2019s sharp increases in duties have caused global uncertainty to spike. The import taxes will slow global growth, but not cause a worldwide recession, she added. The details of the IMF\u2019s outlook will be issued Tuesday.",
      "The world economy\u2019s resilience is being tested \u201cby the reboot of the global trading system\u201d that threatens to cause turbulence in financial markets, Georgieva said.",
      "That turbulence has been playing out in financial markets for weeks now, especially on Wall Street, which has experienced wild swings from day-to-day and often times even hour-to-hour.",
      "The IMF chief also echoed some Trump administration concerns. She called on countries to reduce their tariffs and lower other barriers to trade, a process that she said had stalled out in the past decade after making steady progress for many years after World War II.",
      "\u201cTrade distortions \u2014 tariff and nontariff barriers \u2014 have fed negative perceptions of a multilateral system seen to have failed to deliver a level playing field,\u201d she said. \u201cThis feeling of unfairness in some places feeds the narrative: we play by the rules while others game the system without penalty.\u201d",
      "Georgieva added that tariffs cause uncertainty, which can be costly. Due to the complexity of supply chains, the cost of a single item can be affected by tariffs in dozens of countries, she said.",
      "Increased trade barriers also tend to immediately impact growth, and while it can lead to more domestic production, that takes time to implement, she added.",
      "In its most recent projections issued in January, the IMF forecast the world economy to grow nominally faster and for inflation to come down, though it warned that outlook was clouded by President Donald Trump's policies, including tax cuts and increased tariffs on foreign imports.",
      "The Washington-based lending agency said at the time that it expected the world economy to grow 3.3% this year and next, up from 3.2% in 2024.",
      "Global inflation, which had surged after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and caused shortages and higher prices, was forecast to fall from 5.7% in 2024 to 4.2% this year and 3.5% in 2026.",
      "However, in a blog post that accompanied those projections, the fund\u2019s chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, wrote that the policies Trump has promised to introduce \u201care likely to push inflation higher in the near term.\u2019\u2019",
      "Those forecasts from January are expected to change \u2014 possibly significantly \u2014 as Trump's trade war has escalated in recent months, particularly with the U.S.'s biggest trade partner, China.",
      "Trump has paused or pulled back on many of his tariff threats \u2014 leading to more volatility in the stock market \u2014 but has been in a tit-for-tat tariff battle with China and has shown no sign of backing down. Each time Trump has raised tariffs on China, Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. imports.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China means hopeful solar buyers may have a much harder time getting systems installed in the U.S. in coming months",
      "Mike Summers was eager to install solar at his home in Ohio for years, and after he finally replaced his aging roof this year, his solar contractor swung into action. His system \u2014 including 19 panels and a battery backup \u2014 went up this week, and Summers considers himself lucky.",
      "\u201cI'm glad to have done it when I did,\u201d said Summers, a former mayor in his city of Lakewood just west of Cleveland. He'll get about $10,000 in tax credits on his $39,000 investment, but nearly as important is that all the equipment was readily available.",
      "Other hopeful solar buyers may have a much harder time in coming months. President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China threatens to crimp a massive source of solar panels and parts, with experts saying the cost of projects will certainly rise as China retaliates.",
      "China accounted for at least 80% of the components of solar panels as recently as 2022, according to an International Energy Agency report, especially polysilicon, glass and solar cells. Solar also demands increasing critical mineral supplies, of which China is a key player across the globe, and electronics.",
      "In the U.S., private industry has poured $18.2 billion into developing a domestic supply chain in recent years, according to Atlas Public Policy, that includes everything from the ingots and wafers that make up panels to electrical and structural components to assembly of the panels themselves. Most of that came from the Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden's administration, with massive funding for clean energy investment.",
      "But that won\u2019t come close to replacing what China produces.",
      "\u201cReally everybody\u2019s losing when you think about it, because the systems are costing more for the customers and it\u2019s also just making it more difficult, in some ways, for us to do business,\u201d said Brian DiPaolo, assistant sales manager at Cleveland-based solar installer YellowLite, which is doing Summers\u2019 project. DiPaolo said some customers are holding off on plans until there is more clarity. The company still stocked up on solar panels, made in North America, a month ago to stay competitive in coming months.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing both international as well as domestic manufacturers of the equipment increasing their costs to prepare for the tariffs,\" DiPaolo said. \u201cYou think that the domestic manufacturers would keep their prices down because they don\u2019t get hit by the tariffs, but they\u2019re seeing this added demand for their equipment.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s supply and demand, said Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of Heliene, which focuses on large-scale solar projects. He described the price of a necessary glass component from China going up in February due to a tariff hike. Suppliers in other countries matched the higher price, meaning higher costs no matter the source.",
      "Alexis Abramson, dean of Columbia University's Climate School, said there's no doubt that residential solar is going to be more expensive. That will cut solar adoption, and small and mid-size installers will go under, she said.",
      "It\u2019s just \u201cextremely difficult to offer current and future customers pricing certainty\u201d when trade policy is changing so much, said James Hasselbeck, chief operating officer at New England-based solar company ReVision Energy.",
      "Solar has gotten significantly more affordable in recent years as the technology scales up, improves and gets cheaper to install. Systems can still cost thousands of dollars on average, but the average cost for a residential system is down more than 70% from 2010, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. American consumers have also had a shot at credits that bring the cost down still further, although the future of those is uncertain under the Trump administration.",
      "Commercial and utility-scale project costs have also dropped dramatically.",
      "That's fed rapid growth across the U.S. over the past two decades. In 2024, the commercial segment grew 8% and utility grew 33%, according to an annual report from the association and consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The residential segment fell 32% last year, but experts attribute that to high interest rates and election uncertainty, and said they had expected continued growth before the tariffs hit.",
      "Solar is an important source of clean energy because it doesn't emit the harmful greenhouse gases that coal, natural gas and oil do. Those are massive contributors to Earth's warming.",
      "Trump imposed tariffs during his first term on imported solar cells and modules in 2018 in hopes of slashing reliance on China.",
      "But China subsidized its own domestic overproduction and some U.S. manufacturers accused it of essentially moving operations to four Southeast Asian countries that had a temporary exemption from tariffs.",
      "Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the U.S. is \u201cquickly taking back control of the supply chain from China to build the strongest solar manufacturing base in the world.\u201d The group reported that in 2024, module manufacturing capacity, largely concentrated in the South, grew 190%, and said cell manufacturing \u201cwas reshored for the first time in five years\u201d with company Suniva restarting production.",
      "But Hopper also said sudden changes in policy risk chilling investment and slowing job creation, especially for manufacturers. The group said during the first Trump administration that tariffs issued then were harmful to the industry.",
      "Ultimately, Abramson said she \u201cwould encourage anybody who has been really thinking about putting solar on their roof to really look into locking that in sooner rather than later.\u201d",

      "The bank said in a statement that \u201cthe outlook for growth has deteriorated due to rising trade tensions.\u201d",
      "It cited \u201cexceptional uncertainty\u201d about the future economic situation, saying future rate decisions would be taken on a meeting by meeting basis.",
      "The bank\u2019s move should support economic activity in the 20 countries that use the euro currency by making credit more affordable for consumers and businesses.",
      "The bank\u2019s rate-setting council decided at a meeting in Frankfurt to lower its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.25%. The bank has been steadily cutting rates after raising them sharply to combat an outbreak of inflation from 2022 to 2023.",
      "Now that inflation has fallen, growth worries have taken center stage. The economy in the 20 countries that use the euro grew a modest 0.2% in the last three months of 2024. Inflation was 2.2% in March, close to the bank\u2019s target of 2%.",
      "The cut was widely expected by analysts given the sudden shadow cast over the eurozone\u2019s growth outlook by Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement of unexpectedly high tariffs, or import tax, on goods from other countries starting at 10% and ranging as high as 49%. The European Union faces a 20% tariff.",
      "At the bank\u2019s last meeting on March 6, ECB President Christine Lagarde had raised the possibility of an upcoming \u201cpause\u201d in the bank\u2019s series of rate cuts. But that option was practically eliminated by Trump\u2019s announcement.",
      "The bank\u2019s benchmark steers rates throughout the economy. Lower interest rates make it less expensive to borrow money and buy goods ranging from homes to new factory equipment. That supports spending, business investment and hiring.",
      "Trump has suspended the tariffs for 90 days, but the possibility of the 20% tariff rate he has proposed for Europe left economists and policymakers concerned that the higher costs will weigh on business activity \u2014 and lead to slower growth or even a recession if he carries through. The U.S. is Europe\u2019s largest trade partner with some 4.4 billion euros ($5 billion) in goods and services crossing the Atlantic every day in both directions.",
      "As the European Commission puts it, \u201cthe trans-Atlantic trade relationship is the most important commercial relationship in the world.\u201d",
      "Uncertainty is another factor that could slow the economy since Trump\u2019s pause for negotiations leaves it unclear where the tariff rate will actually settle. Businesses may hold off on making decisions if they don\u2019t know what their costs will be.",
      "Economists at Berenberg bank think that by midyear some of the tariffs will be negotiated away, ending at around 12%. However that is still around 10 percentage points higher than average tariffs before Trump. On top of that comes a separate 25% tariff on autos from all countries which will hit Europe\u2019s prominent auto industry hard.",

But that option was practically eliminated on April 2, when Trump shocked global markets with proposals for unexpectedly high new tariffs, or import taxes, of 10% to 49% on global trading partners.",
      "Analysts say Thursday's meeting of the bank's rate-setting council in Frankfurt should see a quarter-point cut in the bank's benchmark rate to 2.25%. The bank has been steadily cutting rates after raising them sharply to combat an outbreak of inflation from 2022 to 2023.",
      "Now that inflation has fallen, growth worries have taken center stage. The economy in the 20 countries that use the euro grew a modest 0.2% in the last three months of 2024. Inflation was 2.2% in March, close to the bank's target of 2%.",
      "The bank's benchmark steers rates throughout the economy. Lower interest rates make it less expensive to borrow money and buy goods ranging from homes to new factory equipment. That supports spending, business investment and hiring.",
      "Trump has suspended the tariffs for 90 days, but the possibility of the 20% tariff rate he has proposed for Europe left economists and policymakers concerned that the higher costs will weigh on business activity \u2014 and lead to slower growth or even a recession if he carries through. The U.S. is Europe's largest trade partner with some 4.4 billion euros ($5 billion) in goods and services crossing the Atlantic every day in both directions.",
      "As the European Commission puts it, \u201cthe transatlantic trade relationship is the most important commercial relationship in the world.\u201d",
      "Uncertainty is another factor that could slow the economy since Trump's pause for negotiations leaves it unclear where the tariff rate will actually settle. Businesses may hold off on making decisions if they don't know what their costs will be.",
      "Economists at Berenberg bank think that by mid-year some of the tariffs will be negotiated away, ending at around 12%. However that is still around 10 percentage points higher than average tariffs before Trump. On top of that comes a separate 25% tariff on autos from all countries which will hit Europe's prominent auto industry hard.",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Crews worked early Thursday to restore power to Puerto Rico after a blackout across the entire island that affected the main international airport, several hospitals and hotels filled with Easter vacationers",
      "The outage that began past noon Wednesday left 1.4 million customers without electricity and 328,000 without water. At least 175,000 customers, or 12%, had power back at the end of the day. Officials expected 90% of customers to have power back within 48 to 72 hours after the outage.",
      "\u201cThis is a shame for the people of Puerto Rico that we have a problem of this magnitude,\u201d said Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez, who cut her weeklong vacation short and returned to Puerto Rico on Wednesday evening.",
      "The blackout snarled traffic, forced hundreds of businesses to close and left those unable to afford generators scrambling to buy ice and candles.",
      "It\u2019s the second islandwide blackout to hit Puerto Rico in less than four months, with the previous one occurring on New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "\u201cWhy on holidays?\u201d griped Jos\u00e9 Luis Richardson, who did not have a generator and kept cool by splashing water on himself every couple of hours.",
      "The roar of generators and smell of fumes filled the air as a growing number of Puerto Ricans renewed calls for the government to cancel the contracts with Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power, and Genera PR, which oversees generation.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez promised to heed those calls.",
      "\u201cThat is not under doubt or question,\u201d she said, but added that it\u2019s not a quick process. \u201cIt is unacceptable that we have failures of this kind.\u201d",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said a major outage like the one that occurred Wednesday leads to an estimated $230 million revenue loss daily.",
      "Ram\u00f3n C. Barqu\u00edn III, president of the United Retail Center, a nonprofit that represents small- and medium-sized businesses, warned that ongoing outages would spook potential investors at a time that Puerto Rico urgently needs economic development.",
      "\u201cWe cannot continue to repeat this cycle of blackouts without taking concrete measures to strengthen our energy infrastructure,\u201d he said.",
      "Many also were concerned about Puerto Rico\u2019s elderly population, with the mayor of Can\u00f3vanas deploying brigades to visit the bedridden and those who depend on electronic medical equipment.",
      "Meanwhile, the mayor of Vega Alta opened a center to provide power to those with lifesaving medical equipment.",
      "It was not immediately clear what caused the shutdown, the latest in a string of major blackouts on the island in recent years.",
      "Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez, vice president of operations at Genera PR, said Wednesday that a disturbance hit the transmission system shortly after noon, a time when the grid is vulnerable because there are few machines regulating frequency at that hour.",
      "Puerto Rico has struggled with chronic outages since September 2017 when Hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing a power grid that crews are still struggling to rebuild.",
      "The grid already had been deteriorating as a result of decades of a lack of maintenance and investment.",

      "Cocoa has long provided a lifeline in Ivory Coast but adverse weather and plant diseases have hurt harvests in recent years",
      "N'GATTAKRO, Ivory Coast -- Jean Mari Konan Yao says he's struggling as a cocoa farmer in the west African nation of Ivory Coast, which produces almost half the world\u2019s cocoa supply of the raw ingredient used in chocolate.",
      "Like many in Ivory Coast \u2014 the world's biggest cocoa producer \u2014 Konan Yao says cocoa has long provided a lifeline for him, but adverse weather and plant diseases have hurt harvests in recent years.",
      "Now, cocoa farmers worry even more over President Donald Trump\u2019s plans to impose a 21% tariff on products from Ivory Coast \u2014 the highest among West African nations.",
      "Although Trump has suspended the tariff plans for 90 days pending further review, authorities in Ivory Coast have warned that such tariffs could send the price of cocoa even higher and destabilize the local market by slowing their sales.",
      "Ivory Coast produces between 2 million and 2.5 million metric tons of cocoa annually, with around 200,000 to 300,000 metric tons exported to the United States, according to the Coffee and Cocoa Council.",
      "In 2023, Ivory Coast exported $3.68 billion worth of cocoa beans, its second biggest export after gold. The U.S. was its fourth-largest importer of cocoa beans, after the Netherlands, Malaysia and Belgium, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "For most local cocoa growers, any U.S. tariff could further shake a market already struggling with decreasing yields and shrinking funding that has limited farmers\u2019 ability to meet global demands for chocolate.",
      "\u201cIf we hear the American president is going to put a tax on the price of cocoa, it\u2019s really not good for us, it doesn\u2019t help us,\u201d said another cocoa farmer, Salif Traor\u00e9.",
      "Already, cocoa prices were rising in the country, in part because of insufficient and irregular rainfall in Ivory Coast.",
      "The U.K.-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit research firm has noted a 32% rise in the price of cocoa imported into the United Kingdom over the last three years, partially due to extreme weather conditions in parts of Africa where it\u2019s mainly grown. Together, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon produce about three-quarters of the world\u2019s cocoa.",
      "Cocoa is traded on a regulated, global market. In Ivory Coast, the government usually sets cocoa prices at the onset of each season, with prices reflecting market trends and global prices. The local prices are, however, lower than the global market rates, thereby limiting the farmers' profit from high global prices.",
      "Authorities say they are already considering cocoa price increases if the U.S. tariff comes into effect.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s customs tax is causing us problems. We are already feeling the effects,\u201d said Boss Diarra, coordinator of the local cocoa farmers\u2019 union in Bouafl\u00e9 in central Ivory Coast. He pointed to bags of cocoa that he said farmers have been unable to sell.",
      "Meanwhile, a U.S. tariff could mean more cocoa for European markets, said Bruno Marcel Iriti\u00e9, researcher at the Ivorian F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny Polytechnic Institute. Some of the top importers of Ivory Coast cocoa are in Europe, market data show.",
      "European customers \"will inevitably buy cheaper because when there is too much, the customer is king,\u201d Iriti\u00e9 said.",

      "Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni will test her mettle as an EU facilitator when she meets with Donald Trump in the White House",
      "MILAN -- Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni will test her mettle as a bridge between the EU and the United States when she meets with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House on Thursday, the first European leader to have a face-to-face with Trump since he announced, and then suspended, 20% tariffs on European exports.",
      "Meloni secured the meeting at a critical juncture in the trade war as Italy\u2019s leader, but she also has, in a sense, been \u201cknighted\u201d to represent the European Union. She has been in close contact with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ahead of the trip, and \"the outreach is \u2026 closely coordinated,\" a commission spokeswoman said this week.",
      "\u201cWe know we are in a difficult moment,\" Meloni said this week in Rome. \"Most certainly, I am well aware of what I represent, and what I am defending.\"",
      "The European Union is defending what it calls \u201cthe most important commercial relationship in the world,\u2019\u2019 with annual trade reaching 1.6 trillion euros ($1.8 trillion).",
      "Trade negotiations fall under the European Commission\u2019s authority, which is pushing for a zero-for-zero tariff deal with the U.S. However, Trump administration officials in talks with the EU have yet to publicly show signs of relenting on Trump\u2019s insistence that a baseline 10% tariff be charged on all foreign imports. He paused for 90 days a retaliatory increase to 20%.",
      "The pause has raised some hopes for negotiations, and Meloni\u2019s margins for progress are more in gaining clarity on Trump's goals rather than outright concessions, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt is a very delicate mission,\u201d said Fabian Zuleeg, chief economist at the European Policy Center think tank in Brussels. \u201cThere is the whole trade agenda, and while she\u2019s not officially negotiating, we know that Trump likes to have this kind of informal exchange, which in a sense is a negotiation. So it\u2019s a lot on her plate.\"",
      "As the leader of a far-right party, Meloni is ideologically aligned with Trump on issues including curbing migration, promoting traditional values and skepticism toward multilateral institutions. But stark differences have emerged in Meloni\u2019s unwavering support for Ukraine.",
      "After being the only European leader to attend the Jan. 20 inauguration, Meloni has responded with studied restraint as abrupt shifts in U.S. policy under Trump have frayed the trans-Atlantic alliance. She has denounced the tariffs as \"wrong\" and warned that \u201cdividing the West would be disastrous for everyone,\u201d after Trump\u2019s heated White House exchange with Ukraine\u2019s president.",
      "\u201cShe has been very cautious,\u2019\u2019 said Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst at the London-based Teneo consultancy. \u201cIt is what we need when we have a counterpart that is changing every day.\u2019\u2019",
      "Italy maintains a 40 billion euro trade surplus with the United States, its largest with any country, fueled by Americans\u2019 appetite for Italian sparkling wine, foodstuffs like Parmigiano Reggiano hard cheese and Parma ham, and Italian luxury fashion. These are all sectors critical to the Italian economy, and mostly supported by small- and medium-sized producers who are core center-right voters.",
      "\u201cAll in all, I think she will focus on the very strong economic and trade relations that Italy has with the United States, not just in terms of exports, but also services and energy,\" said Antonio Villafranca, vice president of the ISPI think tank in Milan. \u201cFor example, Italy could even consider importing more gas from the U.S.\u201d",
      "The meeting comes against the backdrop of growing concerns over global uncertainty generated by the escalating tariff wars. Italy\u2019s growth forecast for this year has already been slashed from 1% to 0.5% as a result.",
      "Meloni is also expected to address Trump's demand for NATO partners to increase military spending to 2% of gross domestic product. Italy\u2019s spending, at 1.49% of GDP, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "Experts cautioned, however, against raising expectations over any concrete progress.",
      "\u201cThe best strategy has been to be very circumspect: Get there, get the meeting, get the photo opportunity,\u201d Piccoli said. \u201cIf she is able to come back, and give a sense of how Washington wants to frame future relations on trade, defense and Ukraine policy, that would be a huge win.\"",

      "President Donald Trump joined his economic advisers for White House negotiations Wednesday over tariffs and trade with a Japanese official",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday inserted himself directly into trade talks with Japanese officials, a sign of the high stakes for the United States after its tariffs rattled the economy and caused the administration to assure the public that it would quickly reach deals.",
      "The Republican president attended the meeting alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, top economic advisers with a central role in his trade and tariff policies.",
      "\u201cHopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post ahead of the meeting.",
      "Afterward, he posted: \u201cA Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress!\u201d",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters Thursday in Tokyo that his chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, told him from Washington that the talks were \u201cvery candid and constructive.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course the talks are not easy, but President Trump stated his intention to make this negotiation a top priority,\u201d Ishiba said. \u201cI believe we had talks that lead to a next step.\u201d",
      "Ishiba said he will closely watch how ministerial talks go and plans to visit Washington to meet with Trump at an appropriate time.",
      "Trump's choice to get directly involved in negotiations points to his desire to quickly finalize a slew of trade deals as China is pursuing its own set of agreements. It's an open test of Trump's reputation as a dealmaker as countries around the world seek to limit the potential damage unleashed by his import taxes.",
      "The sweeping tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 triggered panic in the financial markets and generated recession fears, causing the U.S. president to quickly put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes and increase his already steep tariffs against China to as much as 145%.",
      "The pause temporarily spared Japan from 24% across-the-board tariffs, but there continues to be a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tax on imported cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports.",
      "With Japan charging an average tax rate of 1.9% on other countries' goods and having a longstanding alliance with the U.S., the talks on Wednesday are a crucial indicator of whether the Trump administration can achieve a meaningful deal that reassures the markets, American voters and foreign allies.",
      "U.S. economic rival China, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on the turmoil around Trump's announcements, with its leader, President Xi Jinping, touring nations of Southeast Asia and promoting his country as a more reliable trade partner.",
      "Japan is among the first countries to start open negotiations with the U.S. Trump and other administration officials have said the phones have been \u201cringing off the hook\u201d with dozens of countries calling, eager to strike deals with a president who views himself as a master negotiator to avoid tariffs when the 90-day pause ends. Israel and Vietnam have offered to zero out their tariff rates, but Trump has been noncommittal as to whether that would be sufficient.",
      "On Thursday, Trump is scheduled to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who will likely be carrying messages on behalf of the European Union about how to resolve the tariffs Trump placed on the 27-state group.",
      "Still, the U.S. president may also be feeling increased domestic pressures to settle any tariffs as many voters say they returned Trump to the White House with the specific goal of improving the economy. California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit Wednesday that argues that Trump overstepped his authority by declaring an economic emergency to levy his tariffs, with the Democrat saying in a statement that the tariffs have caused economic chaos.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that Trump's tariff policies would hurt the U.S. economy, a direct warning to a White House trying to sell the import taxes as a long-term positive for the country.",
      "\u201cThe level of tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\u201d Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago.",
      "Japan, like many other nations trying to minimize the possible economic fallout from Trump's tariffs, has been scrambling to respond. It has set up a special task force to assess the impact of the tariffs and offer loans to anxious companies.",
      "Although Ishiba has been working hard to coax exemptions out of Trump, the government has said little officially on what concessions it might offer during these talks.",
      "Nor has the administration been transparent about its asks. The Trump administration is seeking to close the $68.5 billion trade deficit with Japan and seeking greater access for U.S. goods in foreign markets, yet the president has also insisted that tariff revenues can be used to pay down the federal budget deficit.",
      "\u201cJapan is coming in today to negotiate Tariffs, the cost of military support, and \u2018TRADE FAIRNESS,\u2019\u201d Trump posted Wednesday.",
      "Japan has contended that Trump's tariff measures are likely to violate bilateral trade agreements or World Trade Organization rules. While Ishiba has said he opposes retaliatory tariffs, he also has said he is in no rush to push for a settlement because he doesn't want concessions.",
      "Xi, meanwhile, stopped in Malaysia on Wednesday and told its leader that China will be a collaborative partner and stand with its Southeast Asian neighbors after the global economic shocks.",

      "\u201cIn the face of shocks to global order and economic globalization, China and Malaysia will stand with countries in the region to combat the undercurrents of geopolitical ... confrontation, as well as the counter-currents of unilateralism and protectionism,\u201d Xi said in remarks at a dinner with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.",

      "SUVs are typically larger, heavier, harder to control and slower to brake than a standard coupe or sedan",
      "This is the time of year when many parents are thinking about buying a used vehicle for their teen drivers. The vehicle may be a graduation gift or a needed set of wheels for a summer job or trip to college. These days, SUVs are a common choice because of their sales popularity. But which one to get?",
      "Edmunds\u2019 auto experts have rounded up five used SUV recommendations for your teen driver. We considered Edmunds\u2019 evaluations of helpful qualities for teen drivers such as outward visibility, technology features and driving satisfaction. We also considered reliability data and crash test results. Here are Edmunds\u2019 top picks for $20,000 or less. The prices listed are estimates of what you might expect to pay at a nationwide dealership such as CarMax or Carvana.",
      "The last-generation Equinox is a top compact SUV value. It\u2019s affordably priced and has roomy seating, a smooth ride and useful tech features. The standard Teen Driver feature, for example, can remind young drivers to buckle up, and it limits stereo volume and lets parents monitor driving habits. Downmarket interior quality and small cargo space narrow the Equinox\u2019s appeal, but overall the Equinox is a no-nonsense choice.",
      "Look for: Picking an Equinox is pretty easy because it didn\u2019t change much from 2018 to 2024. There\u2019s a lot of Equinox inventory to pick from too. Consider a 2019-and-later model to get a newer infotainment system.",
      "2018-2022 Equinox pricing: approximately $14,000 to $20,000",
      "Lively handling and a high-quality interior make the Mazda CX-5 a fun compact SUV. And while sporty performance isn\u2019t a priority for most parents, going with a CX-5 will neatly circumvent any complaints about an SUV being boring to drive. Other high points include excellent crash test safety ratings and a high predicted RepairPal reliability score. Rear seat and cargo space come up short compared to rivals, but the CX-5 remains an excellent choice.",
      "Look for: Mazda made some improvements during this time. Young drivers will likely appreciate the standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration that became standard in 2019.",
      "2017-2020 CX-5 pricing: approximately $16,000 to $20,000",
      "Is your teen an outdoorsy type? Someone who enjoys camping, surfing, snowboarding or biking? The half-wagon, half-SUV Outback shines here. It has standard all-wheel drive for sure-footed traction in rough or wet terrain. Tall ground clearance lets it go places sportier SUVs can\u2019t, while its lower roof height makes for easy cargo loading. The Outback also gets excellent safety scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.",
      "Look for: Subaru redesigned the Outback for 2020, but we think an older Outback is just as good. Subaru made more advanced safety aids, including automatic braking and adaptive cruise control, standard starting in 2019.",
      "2015-2018 Outback pricing: approximately $15,000 to $20,000",
      "Your teen driver needs a larger three-row SUV? Consider an older Highlander. The third row isn\u2019t palatial, but it\u2019s handy enough for a teen who might need to shuttle siblings around. The third row also folds down to create ample cargo space. Crash test scores and predicted RepairPal reliability are favorable too. The biggest complaint your teen might have is that a Highlander is just too sensible and boring.",
      "Look for: the four-cylinder gets the job done, Highlanders with the more powerful V6 are better at accelerating quickly with multiple passengers aboard.",
      "2015-2016 Highlander pricing: approximately $16,000 to $20,000",
      "Like the Outback, the Wrangler isn\u2019t quite an SUV, truck or wagon. It\u2019s its own category. Yes, a four-door Wrangler lacks much of what other SUVs offer. It\u2019s bouncy, loud, gulps fuel and hardly impresses in crash test safety or RepairPal reliability. But its emotional appeal is undeniable. From its legendary off-road capability, and removable doors and roof, the Wrangler scratches a teenage itch for freedom like no other.",
      "Look for: There are two-door and four-door versions of the Wrangler; young drivers will likely enjoy the more personal vibe of the two-door. Regardless of type, the Sport or Sport S trims offer the best combination of features, fun and frugality.",
      "2015-2016 Wrangler pricing: approximately $17,000 to $20,000",
      "Whether your teen driver likes the outdoors, motorsports or simply having enough space for friends and family, there are several good choices for a used SUV to suit your teen\u2019s needs and style.",

      "However, inflation remains above the Bank of England's target of 2% and is set to rise to over 3% in April due to a confluence of factors, including higher domestic energy bills as well as the potential impact of higher taxes and labor costs for businesses, which are likely to pass some costs on to customers.",
      "Still, most economists think the bank can lower its main interest rate from 4.50%, as the peak in inflation is likely to be lower than previously thought, not least because U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies are likely to depress global growth and hence prices. One impact of Trump's tariff plans has been lower oil prices, which will have a downward effect on inflation.",

      "Inflation is way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks have dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then began to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed energy costs higher.",
      "As inflation rates have declined from multidecade highs, central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic.",

      "Making maple syrup in New England\u2019s fickle spring weather can be an unpredictable business",
      "MORGAN, Vt. -- Making maple syrup in New England's fickle spring weather can be an unpredictable business. Now President Donald Trump's ever-changing tariff policies are adding anxiety about an industry that depends on multinational trade.",
      "\u201cAny kind of disruption with our cross border enterprise, we feel it,\u201d said Jim Judd, a fourth-generation sugarer who owns Judd\u2019s Wayeeses Farms in Morgan, Vermont. \u201cIt\u2019s uncertain enough making maple syrup.\u201d",
      "Judd, who has been making Vermont\u2019s signature product since the 1970s, says multiple countries contribute to each container of the sticky sweetener. Stainless steel fixtures used connect sap lines and boil the liquid into syrup can originate in China. Packaging often comes from Italy. And the vast majority of equipment is sold by Canada, which produces about four-fifths of the planet's maple syrup \u2014 and sells nearly two-thirds of it to U.S. consumers.",
      "That's why this spring's whiplash is so concerning to Judd and many other U.S. producers in Vermont as well as New York, Maine and Wisconsin.",
      "Trump backed off the stiffest tariffs on most nations for 90 days earlier this month while increasing the taxes on Chinese imports to 145% and engaging in a lengthy back and forth with Canada and Mexico about tariffs on their countries' goods.",
      "Allison Hope, executive director of the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers' Association, said they're assuming that Trump's latest position means there is no tariff on finished maple products for now \u2014 but the situation gets murkier when considering that necessary packaging, equipment and materials may originate in China.",
      "\u201cIt's like the weather in New England. You wait five minutes and it might change,\u201d Hope said. \u201cNow it matters how Canada makes its equipment and gets its materials. ... It's hard for businesses to run on a growth mentality when there's no sense of what the industry is going to look like in a way, in a year.\u201d",
      "The uncertainty is arriving in a time of relative growth for syrup producers in the U.S. as well as Canada. Vermont has seen an increase in production of nearly 500% over the last 20 years as producers scaled up, new businesses formed and U.S. consumers sought local and natural alternatives to refined sugars, Hope said.",
      "But disrupting trade with Canada, the maple syrup powerhouse, could be devastating. Judd, for one, said he has spent \u201ccountless amounts of hours and lots and lots of money\u201d buying equipment in Canada over the decades. Import taxes could sharply increase his costs, and since syrup is, at essence, a luxury good, he thinks he can't raise prices.",
      "\u201cWe can't do this without Canadian help. We can't buy what we need at another outlet because it's all in Canada,\u201d Judd said. \u201cWe've been crossing this border all my life. The recent changes we see being imposed on the people here \u2014 we're not sure that they're all necessary.\"",

      "A recent amendment to Peru\u2019s Forestry and Wildlife Law has sparked intense backlash from environmental groups and Indigenous organizations",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- A recent amendment to Peru\u2019s Forestry and Wildlife Law is drawing fierce backlash from environmental groups and Indigenous groups that warn it could accelerate deforestation in the Amazon rainforest under the guise of economic development.",
      "The amendment eliminates the requirement that landowners or companies get state authorization before converting forested land to other uses. Critics say the change could legitimize years of illegal deforestation.",
      "\u201cTo us, this is gravely concerning,\u201d said Alvaro Masquez Salvador, a lawyer with the Indigenous Peoples program at Peru\u2019s Legal Defense Institute.",
      "Masquez added that the reform sets a troubling precedent by \u201ceffectively privatizing\u201d land that Peru's constitution defines as national patrimony. \u201cForests are not private property\u2014they belong to the nation,\u201d he said.",
      "Supporters of the amendment, enacted in March, say it will stabilize Peru\u2019s agricultural sector and provide farmers with greater legal certainty.",
      "The Associated Press sought comment from multiple representatives of Peru\u2019s agribusiness sector, as well as Congresswoman Maria Zeta Chunga, a vocal supporter of the law. Only one person in the agribusiness sector responded, saying they did not want to comment.",
      "Peru holds the second-largest share of Amazon rainforest after Brazil, with over 70 million hectares\u2014about 60% of Peru's territory, according to nonprofit Rainforest Trust. It\u2019s one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet and home to more than 50 Indigenous peoples, some living in voluntary isolation. These communities are vital guardians of ecosystems and the rainforests they protect help stabilize the global climate by absorbing large quantities of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change.",
      "Passed in 2011, the original Forestry and Wildlife Law required state approval and environmental studies before any change in forest land use. But recent reforms have steadily weakened those protections. The latest amendment allows landowners and companies to bypass that approval, even retroactively legalizing past deforestation.",
      "Peru\u2019s Constitutional Court upheld the amendment after a group of lawyers filed a constitutional challenge. Although the court struck down some parts of the amendment, it left intact the law\u2019s final provision, which validates past illegal land-use changes. Legal experts say this is the most dangerous part.",
      "In its ruling, the court acknowledged that Indigenous communities should have been consulted on reforms to the law and affirmed the Environment Ministry\u2019s role in forest zoning.",
      "Environmental lawyer C\u00e9sar Ipenza summed it up like this: \u201cThe court admits the law violated Indigenous rights and (tribes) should have been consulted but it still endorses the most harmful part.\u201d",
      "The push behind the reform mirrors dynamics seen under former President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, where political and economic forces aligned to weaken environmental protections to favor agribusiness. While Brazil\u2019s effort was led by a highly organized, industrial agribusiness lobby, Peru\u2019s version involves a looser but powerful coalition.",
      "In Peru, support comes from agribusiness interests, land grabbers and figures linked to illegal mining and drug trafficking. Small and medium farmers with concerns about securing their land have also been swept into the effort.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a convergence of both legal and illegal interests,\u201d said Vladimir Pinto, the Peru field coordinator for Amazon Watch, an environmental advocacy group.",
      "Julia Urrunaga, Peru director at nonprofit Environmental Investigation Agency, warned that the Peruvian government is now \u201cfalsely arguing\u201d that the amendments are necessary to comply with the European Union\u2019s regulations, which will soon require companies importing products like soy, beef, and palm oil to prove their goods were not sourced from illegally deforested land.",
      "If products tied to illegal deforestation are later legalized and allowed into the market, that will weaken the effectiveness of demand-side regulations like those in the EU, she said.",
      "\u201cThis sends the wrong message to global markets and undercuts efforts to curb deforestation through trade restrictions,\u201d Urrunaga said.",
      "Olivier Coupleux, head of the Economic and Trade Section of the EU in Peru, has denied that recent changes to the law are linked to the EU\u2019s deforestation-free regulation.",
      "In interviews with Peruvian media, Coupleux has said the regulation aims to prevent the purchase of products linked to deforestation and does not require legal reforms, but rather traceability and sustainability in goods like coffee, cocoa, and timber.",
      "With no further recourse in domestic courts, civil society groups are preparing to take the case to international tribunals, warning that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent for other countries seeking to circumvent environmental law under the banner of reform.",
      "For many Indigenous leaders, the law represents a direct threat to their territories, communities, and ways of life.",
      "Julio Cusurichi, board member of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest, said the measure will embolden land-grabbing and worsen environmental oversight in already vulnerable areas.",

      "Some view it as a quick turnaround with their careers just ending. There are also numerous big names in Buffaloes lore that remain in line, including from the 1990 national championship squad.",

I think most (including myself) believe he deserves the honor\u2026eventually\u2026 Bypassing the line, bypassing #2 Deon Figures doesn\u2019t make sense. Soo many all time greats that deserve the honor and have waited their turn. Why so fast? Zero waiting period? Feels like the first blunder of the Coach Prime era that has upset alumni.\u201d",

But hopefully we hit it a year from now, when somebody else think of it, besides me and Coach Fran Brown, and let them do it first.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian tennis player Lesia Tsurenko has filed an amended lawsuit that accuses the WTA Tour and its chairman, Steve Simon, of a breach of contract, negligence and the \u201cnegligent infliction of emotional distress.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- Ukrainian tennis player Lesia Tsurenko has filed an amended lawsuit that accuses the WTA Tour and its chairman, Steve Simon, of a breach of contract, negligence and the \u201cnegligent infliction of emotional distress\u201d because of the way it has handled Russian and Belarusian players amid the war in Ukraine.",
      "Tsurenko, who was once among the world's top 25, claims in the lawsuit that WTA executives \u2014 including Simon, who was its CEO at the time \u2014 failed to follow through on assurances made in a meeting with Ukrainian players that the organization would ban Russian or Belarussian players who publicly supported the war with Ukraine.",
      "The amended lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court for the Southern District of New York, cited examples such as Russian player Veronika Kudermetova wearing a patch at the French Open for sponsor Taneft, a subsidiary of a company that was sanctioned by the European Union for helping to supply the Russian army.",
      "\u201cDespite this promise,\u201d the lawsuit from Tsurenko claims, \u201cneither Defendant Steve Simon nor Defendant WTA banned Russian and Belarus players who publicly supported the war.\u201d",
      "The WTA said in a statement to The Associated Press on Wednesday that it has been \u201csteadfast and clear in its condemnation of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and the actions of the Russian government against the Ukrainian people.\u201d",
      "\u201cConsistent with our position,\" the statement said, \"the WTA has taken numerous steps to assist our Ukrainian player members, who have faced great challenges as professional athletes. The WTA has been equally clear that it was founded on principles of equality and non-discrimination and its rules provide that competitions are open to all women players who qualify based on their merit, and without discrimination. Consistent with those principles, and in common with other tennis organizations, the WTA has taken the position that individual athletes should not be penalized for the actions of their governments.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the WTA Tour, ATP Tour and International Tennis Federation issued a joint statement in which it said Russian and Belarusian athletes would be allowed to compete as long as they did not compete under their nation\u2019s flags. That policy remains in place with Russian and Belarusian athletes competing at last year\u2019s Paris Olympics as \u201cIndividual Neutral Athletes;\u201d Russian players Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider won silver in women\u2019s doubles.",
      "Tsurenko's lawsuit states that she was forced to withdraw from an event at Indian Wells because of a panic attack from having to potentially play against Russians and Belarusians, and that she had \u201cdeveloped excessive stress, loss of concentration affecting her performance at tennis games, mortification and injury to her feelings.\u201d",
      "Lindsay Brandon, the WTA director of safeguarding, informed Tsurenko in 2023 that Simon would be investigated for violating its code of conduct. But that October, the organization informed her that Simon had not violated its code nor any provision of the employee handbook. Tsurenko tried to appeal but was unsuccessful.",
      "\u201cEven in my worst nightmares, I couldn\u2019t imagine that the professional tour, which I considered my home, would become a terrifying and alien place, where the (former) CEO of the organization consciously committed an act of moral abuse against me, leading to a panic attack and my inability to do my job,\u201d Tsurenko wrote Tuesday on social media.",
      "The initial complaint filed in November requests a trial by jury.",
      "Proskaeur Rose, the law firm representing the WTA, filed a motion last month to dismiss the case on the grounds that Tsurenko\u2019s claims were \u201clegally defective.\u201d The WTA has until April 30 to decide whether it will continue with its motion to dismiss.",
      "\u201cWhile the WTA has the greatest sympathy for the significant challenges that Ms. Tsurenko and our other Ukrainian athletes have faced,\u201d its statement said Wednesday, \"we are disappointed that she has decided to engage in litigation to seek to hold the WTA responsible for her distress. At all times, the WTA and its management acted appropriately and in accordance with our rules, and we are confident that we will prevail in this litigation.\u201d",

      "Rodgers was released by the New York Jets in March. The 41-year-old four-time NFL MVP has visited the Pittsburgh Steelers and talked with the Minnesota Vikings in recent weeks, but said there are certain things going on in his personal life that are currently taking precedence over anything related to football.",
      "\u201cI have a couple people in my inner circle that are battling some difficult stuff,\u201d Rodgers said. \"I have a lot of things that are taking my attention and have, beginning in January, away from football.\u201d",
      "Rodgers added that committing to a team is a \u201cbig thing\u201d and indicated he will only do so when he's ready to be all-in. He did cut down rumors that he was holding out for a multi-year contract or a big payday, saying that $10 million for one season would be enough to get him to sign.",
      "\u201cI told every single one of the teams I talked to (that) it wasn\u2019t about the money,\u201d Rodgers said.",
      "The Steelers currently have plenty of cap space and plenty of room on the roster for Rodgers. Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson are the only two quarterbacks currently under contact. Rodgers tried to surreptitiously visit Pittsburgh's facility last month, flying into a regional airport and renting a Chevy Malibu in an effort not to draw attention to himself.",
      "Rodgers said it was important to meet with Steelers coach Mike Tomlin and general manager Omar Khan and get a feel for the city. He left without an agreement, though everyone from Tomlin to team president Art Rooney II has indicated the meeting was productive. Rodgers also has relationships with Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Arthur Smith and quarterbacks coach Tom Arth, who worked alongside Rodgers in Green Bay during the 2006 offseason.",
      "While Pittsburgh feels like the most natural fit for Rodgers \u2014 who also worked out with recently acquired Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf \u2014 he also said that retirement \u201ccould still be a possibility\u201d and he doesn't seem to be in any sort of rush even with the NFL draft looming next week.",

      "Rodgers has also been in contact with Minnesota coach Kevin O'Connell and talked to New York Giants coach Brian Daboll, whom Rodgers said has a \u201cbeautiful football mind.\u201d",
      "Rodgers indicated he has kept the lines of communication open, but is prioritizing his personal life at the moment.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it was fair to the Steelers or anyone to make a decision while I\u2019m dealing with a lot off the field,\u201d he said.",

The NBA playoffs start Saturday with four Game 1s, continue Sunday with four more Game 1s and just like that a 16-team, two-month journey will be off and running.",

And both have to believe they have a realistic chance of getting through a loaded Western Conference \u2014 James and the Lakers bolstered by the addition of Luka Doncic, Curry and the Warriors bolstered by the addition of Jimmy Butler.",
      "\u201cMeans a lot to match up against him,\u201d Minnesota star Anthony Edwards said of facing James, his Olympic teammate last summer, in Round 1. \u201cProbably goes down as the greatest player to ever play basketball.

      "The delay in approving the House vs. NCAA antitrust settlement means the rules around compensation are not yet in place, blowing up the market for the amount of money players can receive from their schools' name, image and likeness collectives or from third-party endorsement deals.",
      "More than 400 players have entered the portal since it opened Wednesday, according to tracking by 247Sports. Athletes have until April 25 to enter, and they clearly have leverage until the settlement is approved by U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in California.",
      "\u201cIt's basically a free pass to pay guys as much as you want to pay them right now,\u201d said Mit Winter, a Missouri sports law attorney who advises agents, collectives and schools. His advice to athletes: \u201cGet your deal signed now before the House settlement gets approved and make sure the payments are made from a collective before July 1.\u201d",
      "Once the House settlement is approved, any NIL deals with a collective or third party over $600 must be reported to a clearinghouse, where it will be vetted to determine if the pay is commensurate with the service provided by the athlete and that it is in line with the athlete's fair market value. July 1 is the expected date for the settlement to take effect.",
      "Jacob Piasecki and Stefan Aguilera, co-founders of the Austin, Texas-based A&P Sports Agency, have been busy since winter negotiating \u201cfrontloaded\u201d NIL contracts that will pay all or most of the money to their clients before July 1.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like an 11th hour now,\u201d Piasecki said. \u201cWe're getting to the point where collectives are going to be highly scrutinized and everything is going to be under a microscope.\u201d",
      "Michael LeRoy, a University of Illinois labor and sports law professor, said it would have been advantageous for the schools if Wilken had given final approval to the settlement in the days between the April 7 settlement hearing and the opening of the portal this week.",
      "\u201cThe lack of closure,\u201d LeRoy said, \u201cadds one more element of chaos.\u201d",
      "The scramble for pay has disrupted college sports the past few seasons, particularly with athletes now free to transfer without having to sit out the following season. This past year alone, quarterback Nico Iamaleava left Tennessee when he was set to reportedly earn $2.2 million next season and QB Matthew Sluka left UNLV, saying the school didn't come through with $100,000.",
      "In addition to NIL, athletes also will be able to get paid through revenue sharing beginning July 1. Schools are now sending players term sheets or memorandums of understanding regarding pay. Each school will be allowed to distribute $20.5 million to their athletes this year, with football and men's basketball players likely to receive the lion's share.",
      "Considering some schools had unofficial NIL payrolls at or near $20 million just for football last year and that there soon will be greater policing of collective and third-party NIL deals, some of the highest-paid players will take pay cuts this year unless their current deals are renegotiated before House approval.",
      "Piasecki and Aguilera predicted a random Power Four quarterback who earned $2 million in 2024 might make only half that in 2025 because of the rev-share and NIL caps.",
      "Winter agreed some players could make less, \u201cbut they still will be able to negotiate within whatever budget a school has. There\u2019s still going to be collectives at a lot of schools that will come in to fill gaps or go over that cap as well.\u201d",
      "How would a collective fill a pay gap if any deal over $600 must go through the clearinghouse?",
      "\u201cThe way it\u2019s envisioned now, the athletes are responsible for reporting deals with collectives and boosters to the new enforcement entity,\u201d Winter said. \u201cProbably like now, there\u2019ll be lots of deals that don\u2019t get reported.\u201d",
      "Experts say lawsuits are a certainty, noting limits have been placed on rev-share and NIL pay without collective bargaining involving the athletes and their representatives. Because college athletes are not considered employees, collective bargaining is not required. Conferences and schools have lobbied Congress to codify the House settlement and bake in some level of antitrust protection.",
      "As the settlement is written, if the clearinghouse disallows an NIL deal, the athlete is ineligible if they go forward with it. Otherwise, they can renegotiate the deal or go to arbitration and try to show why the deal is within fair market value.",
      "Winter said the formula for determining fair market value is nebulous. He said it's his understanding the athlete's performance, social media followers and the market in which their school is located will be factors.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s to say what\u2019s fair market value if someone wants to pay someone X?\u201d Winter said. \u201cHow can you say their fair market value is not X?\u201d",
      "As for enforcement, the power conferences are establishing an enforcement arm to oversee adherence to the salary cap and clearinghouse and levy penalties on violators.",
      "\u201cOne element that\u2019s in the background that\u2019s going to keep inserting itself into the foreground is these schools want to create a rules structure for everybody else except themselves,\" LeRoy said. \"That\u2019s always been the history of NCAA competition. We\u2019ll have a rules committee, we\u2019ll have enforcement. The underlying behavior is we find ways to shortcut the rules, spin the rules, even cheat on the rules.",
      "\"I look at this new regime as, \u2018We\u2019re setting up rules, everybody knows what the rules are.\u2019 And then everybody is thinking about how can you game it, how can you circumvent it?\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Rams will make their selections in the upcoming NFL draft from the Los Angeles Fire Department's Air Operations base in Van Nuys to honor the first responders who stopped the deadly wildfires that ravaged Southern California earlier this year.",
      "The Rams are converting a room in the Air Operations complex to serve as the draft headquarters for general manager Les Snead and coach Sean McVay, while an adjacent hangar will be occupied by scouts and coaches during the three-day draft next week. The LAFD base will remain fully operational during its visit from the Rams.",
      "\"Drafting from LAFD Air Operations is a powerful reminder of what it means to represent Los Angeles,\u201d Rams president Kevin Demoff said. \u201cSince the wildfires devastated our region in January, we have looked to bring LA together to help with the recovery efforts, raise the spirits of those impacted and shine a light on our first responders. We are humbled to partner with LAFD during one of the NFL\u2019s biggest moments to express gratitude for those who risk their lives daily to protect our city.\u201d",
      "The Rams are also renovating the recreation room at the Air Operations base, leaving behind recliners and other improvements for the firefighters' resting areas. About 150 first responders from around the region will meet with McVay, Demoff and other Rams executives on Day 2 of the draft.",
      "The wildfires had a significant impact on the Rams franchise. The team's training complex in the Woodland Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles was within a few miles of the Kenneth Fire in the western end of the San Fernando Valley, and some players and team personnel had to evacuate their homes as a precaution.",
      "The fires were at their worst during the week before the start of the NFL postseason. The resulting smoke pollution and strain on public resources compelled the league to move the Rams' wild-card round home game against Minnesota to Glendale, Arizona.",
      "The Rams say they have donated nearly $2 million to fire relief efforts. They've also hosted distribution events for evacuated families, staged football clinics for students affected by the fires and sold co-branded merchandise with the LAFD logo to support the fire department and the American Red Cross.",
      "\u201cHosting the NFL draft at LAFD Air Operations highlights the critical role our Air Operations division plays in protecting Los Angeles, especially during wildfire season,\u201d interim fire chief Ronnie Villanueva said. \u201cThe Rams\u2019 generosity \u2014 renovating our station and recognizing our firefighters \u2014 demonstrates a deep commitment to the city we all serve.\u201d",
      "In 2021, the Rams began a tradition of moving their draft headquarters to a symbolic location in the Los Angeles area. After setting up camp in a Malibu beach mansion four years ago, the team has since conducted its draft operations from large homes in the Hollywood Hills, Tarzana and Hermosa Beach.",

    "story": [
      "It took until the penultimate night of the regular season, but all the matchups are set for the first round of the NHL playoffs",
      "A month before NHL's playoff openers this weekend, Commissioner Gary Bettman was more than happy to defend the decision to not expand the bracket like other professional leagues around North America have done in recent years.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the races that we\u2019re having for the regular season, playoffs have started already,\u201d Bettman said then. \"We\u2019re in our play-in tournament, and I think it\u2019s terrific. What can be more compelling and exciting and entertaining than that?\u201d",
      "It took until the penultimate night of the season to lock in all 16 playoff teams and the eight first-round series.",
      "The defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers open against the cross-state rival Tampa Bay Lightning. The Toronto Maple Leafs and Ottawa Senators face off in the first Battle of Ontario in more than two decades. The Dallas Stars and Colorado Avalanche collide in a matchup of two of the top three betting favorites to win it all. And Connor McDavid\u2019s Edmonton Oilers open the postseason against the Los Angeles Kings for a fourth year in a row.",
      "A look at the matchups, first in the East and then the West with division and seeding noted:",
      "The Maple Leafs and Senators last met in a playoff series in 2004. That was before the salary cap and rule changes designed to generate more offense.",
      "Along came Auston Matthews, Toronto's captain who reached 400 career goals and teammate William Nylander, who scored 45 this season. Goaltender Anthony Stolarz has won his past eight starts, three of the past four with a shutout, and the Leafs look capable of making a run if Matthews, Nylander and Mitch Marner can keep scoring.",
      "The pesky Senators are led by hard-nosed captain Brady Tkachuk. Retired Norris Trophy-winning defenseman P.K. Subban, who now works for ESPN, said the playoffs \"are tailor-made for Brady Tkachuk and his game and his mentality.\u201d",
      "Toronto is a slight series favorite, according to BetMGM Sportsbook. Ottawa has 2023 Vezina Trophy-winning goalie Linus Ullmark, and a rivalry like this has its ways of evening the scales.",
      "The Panthers have won seven of their past eight playoff series since trading for Brady's brother, Matthew Tkachuk, and hiring Paul Maurice as coach. Their only loss came to Vegas in the 2023 final when injuries took their toll, and Florida beat Edmonton last year in seven games to capture the first title in franchise history.",
      "The Lightning beating the Panthers in the second round in \u201822 led to that series of changes, and this will be the fourth Sunshine State Showdown in the past five years. Tampa Bay went through Florida in \u201921 on the way to its second of back-to-back Cup championships.",
      "Each team loaded up at the trade deadline. Florida added top-four defenseman Seth Jones and in-your-face winger Brad Marchand, while Tampa Bay picked up Yanni Gourde and Oliver Bjorkstrand, who is week to week with an injury.",
      "The difference-makers could be in net. Russian goalies Sergei Bobrovsky for the Panthers and Andrei Vasilevskiy for the Lightning have already backstopped their team to the Cup before.",
      "A rematch of the 2010 first round, when the Canadiens shocked the then-Presidents' Trophy-winning Capitals and made a surprise run to the Eastern Conference final. Washington did finish first in the East after a season that saw captain Alex Ovechkin set the career goals record.",
      "The Capitals were on cruise control much of the second half of the season but they lost starting goaltender Logan Thompson and forward Aliaksei Protas to injuries. They have not won a playoff series since hoisting the Cup in 2018.",
      "The Canadiens clinched a playoff spot in their 82nd and final game of the season. The underdogs have been red hot and can count on full and frenzied playoff crowds at the Bell Centre in Montreal for the first time since 2017.",
      "Carolina is a heavy favorite in large part because New Jersey is missing its best player, No. 1 center Jack Hughes, who underwent season-ending shoulder surgery last month.",
      "The Devils' biggest strength is their goaltending, with Jacob Markstrom filling a void in net that hasn't quite been the same since Hall of Famer Martin Brodeur. They also are expected to have top defenseman Dougie Hamilton back from his extended injury absence.",
      "Carolina does a lot of things right and defends incredibly well. The Hurricanes after some disappointing playoff exits hope they can put together a long run, though their biggest question might be in goal between Frederik Andersen and Pyotr Kochetkov.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been, I\u2019m sure they would agree, up and down throughout the year for the goalies,\u201d captain Jordan Staal said. \u201cBut the playoffs, you just ride whoever\u2019s playing well and we\u2019re very confident with both of them. We know both can win games for us and even steal games.\u201d",
      "The Presidents' Trophy-winning Jets have been, in hockey terms, a wagon all season. They have the likely Vezina winner in goal in Connor Hellebuyck, a near-100-point producer in Kyle Connor and the kind of big, heavy game that wins this time of year.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t give up much,\u201d Blues captain Brayden Schenn said. \"They\u2019re a good defensive hockey team with a good goalie. It\u2019s going to be an exciting series, and we\u2019re looking forward to the challenge.\u201d",
      "St. Louis, like Montreal, got in by winning its final game of the season. The Blues were eight points out when play resumed in late February out of the 4 Nations Face-Off break, and they won 19 of 26 to qualify.",
      "Coach Jim Montgomery, hired in November to replace Drew Bannister fresh off being fired by Boston, turned things around even faster than he expected. The Blues with big-game goaltender Jordan Binnington, won't be an easy out.",
      "Under the old 1 to 8 conference playoff format, this easily could have been a West final. Instead, the Stars and Avalanche meet right away with one of them guaranteed to be going home early.",
      "\u201cLooking forward to the matchup,\u201d Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out of the gate, you\u2019ve got to play well right away and you\u2019re going to have to play your best hockey for two weeks in order to win.\u201d",
      "Both teams made significant trades this winter. Dallas acquired defenseman Cody Ceci and forward Mikael Granlund, then went even bigger by getting former Avalanche standout Mikko Rantanen from Carolina at the deadline.",
      "Colorado had traded Rantanen to the Hurricanes in January, flipping the pending free agent for younger forwards Martin Necas and Jack Drury. The Avs also added centers Brock Nelson and Charlie Coyle and brought back veteran defenseman Erik Johnson.",
      "Whoever wins this series likely becomes the Cup favorite.",
      "The Golden Knights were nearly as dominant as Winnipeg but somehow flew under the radar. Jack Eichel surpassed 90 points and showed off his defensive prowess as part of the best, most well-rounded season of his career.",
      "Vegas is only two years removed from winning the Cup. Adin Hill has grown into the starting role since, earning a long-term contract as the organization's goaltender of the present and future, and has valuable experience from 2023.",
      "Minnesota clinched the eighth and final spot in the West by tying its last game of the season with 20.9 seconds left. The Wild struggled in recent months but have scoring winger Kirill Kaprizov back healthy and might get a spark from newly signed prospect Zeev Buium.",
      "\u201cIt was up and down like crazy,\" defenseman Jake Middleton said. \"There was times we thought the world was ending. There was times we thought that we\u2019d already won the league.\u201d",
      "Yes, again. Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and the Oilers won this series each of the past three years, but the defending West champs are banged up and won't have defenseman Mattias Ekholm at least for the first round because of injury. Edmonton let young Dylan Holloway and Philip Broberg go to St. Louis on offer sheets last summer and has missed that kind of play.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure LA and Edmonton are sick of seeing each other,\" said retired forward Paul Bissonnette, now a TNT analyst. \u201cIt's going to be tough sledding for Edmonton, especially with all that turnover they've had, so we'll see what they've got.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles is one of the hottest teams in the NHL since the trade deadline and has five 20-plus-goal scorers: Kevin Fiala, Adrian Kempe, Warren Foegele, Quinton Byfield and Anze Kopitar. Darcy Kuemper's bounce-back season gives the Kings a legit presence in net, and they have the offense to supplement a suffocating defensive system.",

      "Corso, the longtime ESPN broadcaster and folksy former coach widely known for his endearing expressions and elaborate headgear picks, is set to retire after a career with the show that began in 1987, ESPN announced Thursday. His final broadcast will be Aug. 30 \u2014 Week 1 of the 2025 college football season \u2014 and the network said additional programming to celebrate Corso is also planned.",
      "\"My family and I will be forever indebted for the opportunity to be part of ESPN and \u2018College GameDay\u2019 for nearly 40 years,\u201d Corso said in a statement to ESPN. \u201cI have a treasure of many friends, fond memories and some unusual experiences to take with me into retirement.\u201d",
      "Corso, who turns 90 in August, began his popular headgear segment in October 1995 at a game at Ohio State.

      "Interest in gymnastics traditionally peaks with the Olympic cycle, but the sport is popular all year round on the \u201cgymternet,\u201d an online global community for devoted fans",
      "WASHINGTON -- Thomas Bateman kept busy this year managing college fantasy teams in 12 different leagues, a lineup that included SECret Weapon and One and Dunne. Five of them won it all.",
      "These were not teams stocked with NFL or NBA players. All 12 were made up of college gymnasts, and the Chicago-based marriage and family therapist is just one member of a fervent and growing fan base that channels their love of the sport into fantasy leagues.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a great way to get to know the sport a bit,\u201d Bateman said. \u201cWhen I started off, I got these lists from College Gym News and picked athletes I didn\u2019t really know, so then I got to know teams I liked and then got familiar with athletes I want to draft. It\u2019s a great way to potentially grow the audience of the sport.\u201d",
      "Interest in gymnastics traditionally peaks with the Olympic cycle, but on the \u201cgymternet\u201d \u2013 the online global community for devoted fans \u2013 it\u2019s a year-round sport. At the college level, major growth in name, image and likeness deals, viewership and streaming availability has been accompanied by a surge in fantasy leagues, too.",
      "This year, over 7,000 women\u2019s college gymnastics devotees have found their way to the Gymlytics and GymCastic fantasy platforms \u2014 all within the last few years.",
      "Gymlytics, which launched before the 2022 collegiate season, runs through the regular season and has a postseason bracket competition. GymCastic, in its second year, offers weekly fantasy matchups, including the NCAA postseason and elite meets later in the year.",
      "The two leagues take slightly different approaches. Gymlytics participants draft individual athletes for their team at the beginning of the season and set lineups for each week of competition. GymCastic runs a salary cap-style draft, in which athletes are valued at a certain number of \u201cgym rubles.\u201d Participants select athletes until their roster is filled while staying under the cap.",
      "Neither are the first platforms of their kind: Founders of both pointed to Kristen Watkins, a former college gymnast and self-taught programmer who created and ran College Fantasy Gymnastics for the decade leading into the pandemic-canceled 2020 season, as an inspiration.",
      "Watkins competed for the MIT gymnastics team until it was cut following the 2009 season, a period in which other college gymnastics programs were cut or coming under threat of reduction. The creation of the fantasy league, she said, was motivated in part because she wanted to see if there could be more interest in women\u2019s gymnastics.",
      "Subsequent leagues have hinged on the same idea.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the point of everything we do: It\u2019s very, very specific to the gymnastics fans,\u201d said Jessica O\u2019Beirne, creator of the popular GymCastic podcast and a co-founder of the fantasy league of the same name. \u201cWe use the lingo of gymnastics. It\u2019s so niche and so specific.\u2033",
      "The Gymlytics audience is similarly a lot of \u201cdiehard gymnastics fans,\u201d said Lauren Pickens, a co-creator. That includes former athletes. Pickens recalled hearing from recently graduated members of the championship-winning Michigan team who had barely missed the Gymlytics draft deadline but wanted to put teams together. (She helped them join in.)",
      "Like all fantasy team managers who care about results, Bateman and other participants have their hands full. Week to week, participants set lineups across the four apparatuses \u2013 vault, uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercise \u2013 to maximize the total number of points their team scores. An injury or struggles at a weekend meet are factors in roster changes.",
      "Bateman joined Gymlytics in 2022 with friends who had been gymnasts at the University of Michigan. He named SECret Weapon after the Southeastern Conference, whose member school LSU is a repeat favorite at this week's NCAA championships in Texas. One and Dunne bears the surname of LSU gymnast and popular influencer Olivia Dunne \u2014 and the name worked in a league where each team could include just one athlete from each college.",
      "As GymCastic and Gymlytics have taken off, their creators have seen these diehard fans bring in friends and family who are less familiar with the sport.",
      "\u2033We\u2019ve gotten a lot of emails from people saying, my significant other did fantasy basketball or fantasy football and because there\u2019s a fantasy gymnastics, they wanted to connect with me and my passion so they joined a league,\u201d said GymCastic COO Steve Cooper. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re screaming at the TV like I am.\u201d",
      "According to the Fantasy Sports & Gaming Association, the number of Americans over the age of 21 participating in fantasy sports grew by about 5% between 2017 and 2022. It's been much more robust for Gymlytics, which launched its first season with 1,000 teams and, according to co-founder Yarden Tamir, had nearly 7,000 teams across 55 countries this season; and for GymCastic, which has seen over 10% growth between its first and second seasons, per Cooper.",
      "While overall fantasy sports participation skews male by about a 2:1 ratio, according to FSGA data, the Gymlytics and GymCastic founders both estimated their participants were more gender balanced.",
      "Multiple fantasy gymnastics participants and founders pointed to the 2021 and 2022 collegiate seasons as a turning point. Those seasons followed the delayed Tokyo Games and a 2021 Supreme Court decision allowing college athletes to earn endorsement money, marking the beginning of Olympics gymnasts being able to cash in and retain their NCAA eligibility.",
      "Other than Simone Biles, every member of that medal-winning Tokyo team, including alternates, went on to compete in the NCAA.",
      "\u201cOlympics is so fun but it\u2019s hard to consistently follow elite athletes because oftentimes they\u2019re only competing three or four times per year,\u201d Bateman said. NCAA gymnastics \"is fun, too, and it\u2019s such an accessible format.\u201d",
      "Accessibility has also grown as streaming networks have jumped in. According to ESPN, the three most-watched gymnastics telecasts have been the three most recent national championships. In 2022, ESPN and affiliated platforms broadcast 40 meets across five platforms; after championships this year, it will be more than 60 meets across eight.",

      "Running a custom fantasy league isn\u2019t without its challenges. League officials pointed to challenges with data availability and inconsistent information across conferences and regions, including judging details.",

      "The NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel gave final approval to a rule designed to discourage football players from faking injuries to stop the game clock",
      "The NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel gave final approval to a rule designed to discourage football players from faking injuries to stop the game clock, the NCAA announced Thursday.",
      "Beginning this season, if medical personnel go onto the field to evaluate a player with an apparent injury after the ball is spotted for the next play, that player\u2019s team will be charged a timeout. If the team does not have timeouts remaining, a 5-yard delay-of-game penalty will be assessed.",
      "Feigning injuries, sometimes at the coach\u2019s instruction, had become a tactic defenses use to slow down tempo offenses or as a way for an offense to avoid a delay-of-game penalty or get an extra timeout.",
      "The NCAA Football Rules Committee has been concerned about feigned injuries for several years. Before the 2021 season, a framework was put in place that allows a school or conference to request a postgame video review regarding questionable actions involving injuries. If it is determined a player faked an injury to manipulate the rules, the offending team\u2019s conference was notified for possible disciplinary action.",
      "A change to overtime timeouts also was approved. Beginning with a third overtime, each team will have one timeout for the duration of the game. Previously, teams were allotted one timeout for each overtime. Beginning in the third overtime, teams alternate running 2-point plays until a winner is decided.",
      "There will be change in verbiage when the decision on a video review is announced. The referee will only say that the call on the field is \u201cupheld\u201d or \u201coverturned.\u201d The terms \u201cconfirmed\u201d and \u201cstands\u201d will not be used.",
      "There also were a couple tweaks to kick and punt formations. No offensive player will be allowed in the direct line of the snap to the potential kicker or within the frame of the snapper on punts for the formation to qualify as a scrimmage kick formation. If a team is not in scrimmage kick formation, it must have five players numbered 50 through 79 on the line of scrimmage. Additionally, if the snapper is on the end of the line by formation, the snapper will lose scrimmage kick protection and the opposition can line a player over the snapper.",
      "If any player on a kickoff-return team makes a \u201cT\u201d signal with his arms during the kick, the team gives up the right to return the kick and the play will be whistled dead.",
      "No player can call defensive signals that simulate the sound or cadence of the offensive signals. The defensive terms \u201cmove\u201d and \u201cstem\u201d would be reserved for players on that side of the ball and could not be used by the offense.",
      "After the two-minute timeout in either half, if the defense has 12 or more players on the field and all the players participate in the play, the officials will administer a 5-yard penalty. The offensive team would have the option to reset the game clock back to the time at the start of the play. If the 12th player is attempting to leave the field and has no influence on the play, the defensive team will be penalized 5 yards with no adjustment to the game clock.",
      "Also, coach-to-player communication implemented for the Football Bowl Subdivision last year will be allowed in the Football Championship Subdivision.",

      "The Tennessee Titans need a quarterback, hold the No. 1 pick overall and have spent the offseason turning over every stone, rewatching tape and looking at Miami\u2019s Cam Ward up close and personal as much as possible",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Titans need a quarterback, hold the No. 1 pick overall and have spent the offseason turning over every stone, rewatching tape and studying Miami's Cam Ward as much as possible.",
      "Yes, they've also looked closely at Shedeur Sanders, wide receiver and defensive back Travis Hunter and edge rusher Abdul Carter.",
      "Signing not one, but two journeyman sure makes Ward's name the one likely on the card the Titans give Commissioner Roger Goodell to kick off the first night of the NFL draft April 24 in Green Bay.",
      "If not, Tennessee has done its best to generate a trade market, needing more draft picks to fill roster holes after three straight losing seasons. New general manager Mike Borgonzi has said he's gotten calls about the No. 1 overall pick, but the Titans will need a \u201cbig haul\u201d to make a deal.",
      "Tennessee desperately needs a quarterback, somebody who can start and be a winner especially by the time their new stadium opens in 2027.",
      "This franchise has whiffed on a trio of first-round quarterbacks from Vince Young (No. 3 overall in 2006), Jake Locker (No. 8 in 2011) and Marcus Mariota (No. 2 in 2015). The Titans traded down from the No. 1 pick in 2016 two weeks before that draft because they already had Mariota.",
      "Young and Mariota each lasted five seasons. Locker retired after four seasons. Malik Willis, whom the Titans traded up to take in the third round in 2022, was traded last year, while Will Levis, the 33rd pick by the previous GM, was benched last season by first-year coach Brian Callahan.",
      "With veterans Brandon Allen and Tim Boyle signed in March, Levis appears to be trade bait with Tennessee needing to add to eight draft picks and leaving a big hole in the starting lineup. It's why Callahan said they're doing everything possible evaluating quarterbacks. More picks would be good for a team with only two within the first 35 picks and nothing in the third round.",
      "A potential franchise quarterback?",
      "\u201cIf you think they're that good and they're that type of player, those guys, to me, are priceless,\" Callahan said March 31 at the NFL owners' spring meetings. \u201cThere is no price that you can put on those type of players if you think that they are that caliber of quarterback.\u201d",
      "The Titans met with both Ward and Sanders of Colorado before the NFL talking period began just before the new league year opened. The team sent all the key front office personnel to Ward's pro day at Miami on March 24 and planned another visit before the draft. Team officials also checked out Sanders and Hunter at Colorado's pro day.",
      "Ward finished fourth in the voting for the Heisman Trophy after his lone season at Miami where he completed 67.2% of his passes for 4,313 yards with a FBS-best and program-record 39 touchdown passes. He also had only seven interceptions. His yards gained per pass attempt was a career-best 9.5 yards. That followed two seasons at Washington State where he threw for more yards and TDs in each season while dropping his interceptions from nine in 2022 to seven in 2023.",
      "The 6-foot-2, 219-pound Ward did his best to make his case at Miami's pro day. He completed one pass on the run, then told the Titans' top officials, \u201cI'm solidifying it today ... I made sure they heard me.\u201d",
      "Edge rusher remains a big need after Harold Landry III was released after leading the Titans with nine sacks last season to create salary cap space. So was cornerback Chidobe Awuzie. Wide receiver depth behind Calvin Ridley remains a big question. Defensive backs depth always is in demand.",
      "The Titans can wait to add offensive linemen after signing Dan Moore, expected to take over at left tackle with JC Latham sliding over after his rookie year to the right side. They also signed Kevin Zeitler to a one-year deal as a new right guard hoping to improve the offensive line after Tennessee allowed 52 sacks in the 2024 season. Only Houston, Seattle, Cleveland and Chicago gave up more.",
      "Ward. At this point, he makes the most sense for a quarterback-needy team.",

      "Here's what to know about the upcoming matches and the four semifinalists:",
      "Arsenal hosts Paris Saint-Germain on April 29 in north London, where defending champion Madrid lost by a stunning 3-0 last week in the first leg of the quarterfinals. PSG hosts the return game on May 7 at Parc des Princes, which has hosted three finals including the inaugural European Cup in 1956.",

      "The winners head to Munich on May 31 for the final of the most coveted and toughest title to win in club soccer.",
      "Coach Mikel Arteta\u2019s team has been solid all season, including facing PSG and Inter in the first half of the eight-game league program. Arsenal finished third in the new phase with six wins \u2014 including 2-0 against PSG in London \u2014 and one draw. Its only loss was at Inter 1-0.",
      "It easily overcame PSV Eindhoven in the round of 16 after a 7-1 rout in the first leg. Arsenal then stunned many with a 3-0 win at home against Real Madrid in the quarterfinals and finished the job on Wednesday with a controlled 2-1 win at Madrid.",
      "Arsenal is second in the Premier League but far behind leader Liverpool, so the Champions League is the only realistic chance it has left to win a title this season.",
      "PSG was at risk of being eliminated in the league phase but its campaign turned in the penultimate round when it bounced back from a 2-0 deficit to hand Manchester City a devastating 4-2 loss.",
      "Crucially, new signing from Napoli Khvicha Kvaratskhelia was added for the knockout rounds. Brest was demolished 10-0 in the playoffs and the Georgia winger was scintillating in the round of 16 against Liverpool. PSG and Liverpool traded 1-0 wins on the road, and a penalty shootout at Anfield was decided by goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma\u2019s two saves.",
      "PSG\u2019s third visit to England this season was this week\u2019s 3-2 loss at Aston Villa. Donnarumma\u2019s saves kept out a fourth goal that would have forced extra time. PSG advanced thanks to a 3-1 win at home last week.",
      "PSG has already clinched Ligue 1. It now hopes to achieve what it failed to accomplish when France star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 led the team: Winning the Champions League.",
      "Barcelona won four of its five European titles in a nine-year spell from 2006-15, mostly inspired by Lionel Messi, and has not been back to the final since.",
      "The team scored 28 goals in the league phase and added nine more in four knockout games. Robert Lewandowski, still prolific at age 36, has 11 goals and trails teammate Raphinha with 12. Lamine Yamal, outrageously good aged just 17, has four goals and three assists.",
      "Barcelona started with a blip in its first Champions League game under coach Hansi Flick, losing at Monaco 2-1, then romped unbeaten through the rest of the league phase: 4-1 against Bayern \u2014 which Flick led to the 2020 title \u2014 3-2 at Borussia Dortmund, and a wild 5-4 at Benfica.",
      "In the knockout rounds, Barcelona beat Benfica two more times, then met Dortmund again in the quarterfinals. A 4-0 win at home allowed the luxury of losing the return 3-1.",
      "Barcelona, like Inter, must balance preparing for the semifinals with staying top in a tight domestic title race and chasing the domestic cup.",
      "The hardest defense to breach, with just one goal conceded in the league phase by the three-time European champion.",
      "The tone was set in the opening game, a rematch of the 2023 final. A 0-0 draw at Man City was impressive in September before the English champion\u2019s aura collapsed.",
      "A series of 1-0 wins was broken up by losing by the same score at Bayer Leverkusen, on a 90th-minute goal by Nordi Mukiele. It was the only one to beat Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer until Feyenoord scored a penalty in the second leg of the round of 16.",
      "Inter impressed in winning at Bayern 2-1 last week in the first leg of the quarterfinals, then responded quickly when Harry Kane tied the scores early in the second half at San Siro. The lead was restored by Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, Inter\u2019s talisman with eight Champions League goals.",

      "Rose started the final round seven shots out of the lead, too far back to think about winning. He made a 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th for a 66. He was in a sudden-death playoff. He lost on a great shot by McIlroy, who hit gap wedge to 3 feet for birdie.",

He now has had at least a share of the lead after 12 rounds at the Masters, fourth on the list behind Jack Nicklaus (19), Arnold Palmer (18) and Gary Player (12), who have combined to win 13 green jackets.",
      "He has 23 wins worldwide, including a major at the U.S. Open and an Olympic gold medal in Rio de Janeiro. He also has the distinction of congratulating a Masters champion on the 18th green three times in the last 10 years \u2014 Jordan Spieth in 2015, Garcia in 2017, McIlroy on Sunday.",
      "The last time he lost the Masters in a playoff, Rose said it lingered for about a month. Sure, he made a few bogeys he'd like to have back from the final round Sunday. That's true for anyone at any golf tournament. There's still the sting of seeing someone else win.",
      "Rose would rather look back to what followed after that 2017 loss. He went on to win three more times that year, including his second World Golf Championships title. He won the FedEx Cup the following year and rose to No. 1 in the world for the first time.",
      "\u201cIf I look back to my best golf, 2017 August through to the end of '18 is probably the most consistently good golf that I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d Rose said. \u201cObviously, I was a little bit more in the prime of my career around that time, or you could argue more prime.\u201d",
      "Rose, who turned pro as a teenager in 1998, will be 45 at the end of July.",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t see any reason why that can\u2019t be the same this time around,\" he said. \u201cI'm working well. I'm working hard. I'm feeling good about my game. I've been saying all year that my game is good. I've just got to make sure that I\u2019m playing consistently well enough to give myself those opportunities, because majors come around ... only four times a year.\u201d",
      "Rose can't help but think how little it would take for him to be going to the PGA Championship next month at Quail Hollow with a shot at the career Grand Slam himself \u2014 briefly tied for the Sunday lead at Royal Troon, a playoff loss at the Masters.",
      "\u201cThe last two majors I\u2019ve been right there and been beaten by the top players in the world at the peak of their game,\u201d he said.",
      "What keeps him going at this stage? He will have completed his 28th year as a pro in July.",
      "It's moments like Sunday, being in the thick of it, delivering clutch moments. There was the birdie putt on the 18th at Augusta. There was that 8-foot putt on the 18th hole at the Ryder Cup in 2023 that earned a key halve. There was that walk up the 18th at Royal Troon last summer with thousands on their feet showing appreciation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m close to kind of some seriously good stuff,\u201d Rose said.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Robinson Can\u00f3 spent 17 seasons playing Major League Baseball in front of all kinds of baseball fans, but he feels there\u2019s something special about his recent stint with the Diablos Rojos of the Mexican Baseball League.",
      "He's not alone.",
      "Mexico\u2019s summer league will open it\u2019s 100th season on Thursday aiming to keep an impressive growth in attendance that began after the Mexican national team\u2019s surprise run at the 2023 World Baseball Classic and now is already surpassing some first-division soccer clubs.",
      "After finishing third in the 2023 tournament, many casual fans, some of them soccer enthusiasts disappointed after Mexico's national team was eliminated in the first round in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, turned their attention to baseball and many of them appear to have stayed for the long haul.",
      "\u201cWe are constantly striving for growth and this season is not going to be different,\u201d league president Horacio de la Vega told The Associated Press. \u201cOur growth has to do with the fact that we are not selling just baseball, but a whole experience.\u201d",
      "In Mexico City, the \u201cbaseball experience\u201d happens in the $160 million Alfredo Harp Helu Stadium, a venue that opened in March 2019 and seats 20,000.",
      "Even though the ballpark is small compared to MLB standards, the carnival-like atmosphere stands out.",
      "\u201cThis a special city, where the fans come to each game weather it is day or night,\u201d Can\u00f3 told the AP. \u201cAs a player, it is a big motivation to see the park full of fans supporting baseball.\u201d",
      "The 42-year-old Dominican, who appeared in eight All-Star Games, played in the United States for five franchises, among them the New York Yankees. He was a key player to lead Diablos Rojos to the championship last season and he recently agreed to return for a second one.",
      "Thorough his career, Can\u00f3 has played for the Dominican Republic's Estrellas Orientales and participated in several Caribbean Series, a team tournament played each year in different countries around Mexico and Central America.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere in Mexico is somewhat like the Caribbean Series, but in there you are playing for your country and it is short tournament,\u201d Cano said. \u201cHere, it's a long season and yet the fans are still there every night.\u201d",
      "Las season, the Diablos Rojos topped the average attendance in the league with 11,694, followed by Toros de Tijuana (11,354) and Sultanes de Monterrey (9,092).",
      "Soccer clubs Pachuca (10,713), Santos Torreon (9,421), Mazatlan (9,522) and Ciudad Juarez (8,980) have worse attendance despite playing in bigger stadiums. The team with the best attendance in the Mexican soccer league is Monterrey with 43,544.",
      "\u201cWe have a great group of owners even though they are rivals on the field. Off it they work as allies and share all kinds of things, from how to clean bathrooms, how to have better food courts and even to sell beer,\u201d De la Vega said.",
      "Mexico City has three soccer stadiums: Ciudad de los Deportes, Olimpico Universitario and Azteca, but none of them has great facilities. There are no elevators, escalators or even food courts. Azteca is currently closed for renovations and might have them for the 2026 World Cup.",
      "The same thing happens in most of the other Liga MX stadiums. The most fan friendly venues are Estadio BBVA in Monterrey and the Akron in Guadalajara. Both were chosen to host games in the next World Cup.",
      "\u201cWe have been growing steadily and this being a special season we are aiming at a record 5 million fans in total attendance,\u201d De la Vega said.",
      "After the World Baseball Classic in 2023, 4.734 million fans set the league attendance record for a season. Last year, the number dipped, but only by 93,000 fans.",
      "And the fans are getting younger, too. According to Othon Diaz, the Diablos Rojos president, nine years ago 53% of the team\u2019s fans were 55 years or older and now 74% of them are under 45. Also, they averaged 3,000 fans per game and now it\u2019s up to 11,000.",

      "MILWAUKEE -- As he discusses his excitement about finally being healthy for the start of a postseason run, Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo compares himself to a certain action movie star.",
      "\u201cI love playing in, how can I say, pressure, stressful situations,\u201d Antetokounmpo said this week as the Bucks prepare to open the playoffs Saturday at Indiana. \u201cI\u2019m like Tom Cruise. Have you ever seen the movies, the Tom Cruise movies that he does all the stunts? I think he gets an adrenaline rush. I love being there again.\u201d",
      "After missing all of Milwaukee\u2019s postseason run last year and part of it the year before \u2014 with his absence leading to consecutive first-round exits \u2014 Antetokounmpo is back to lead the Bucks as he pursues his second career title.",
      "If it\u2019s not quite a mission impossible, it certainly seems improbable.",
      "The Bucks are expected to open the playoffs without seven-time all-NBA guard Damian Lillard, who has been out for the last month with deep vein thrombosis in his right calf. The Bucks are seeded fifth in the Eastern Conference, their lowest playoff position since 2018. BetMGM Sportsbook gives the Bucks only a 37% chance of even getting past their first-round series with the fourth-seeded Pacers.",
      "Yet the Bucks believe they can compete with anyone as long as Antetokounmpo is available. They remember how much the two-time MVP's absence was felt last year in their 4-2 series loss to Indiana.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cTake the best player off of every team and it hurts them. Take one of the best players of our generation off your team, it\u2019s going to crush you. It\u2019s just nice having him on the floor.\u201d",
      "Antetokounmpo, 30, missed last year\u2019s Indiana series after straining his left calf in the 79th game of the regular season. A year earlier, he bruised his lower back in the first quarter of Milwaukee\u2019s opening playoff game against Miami and didn\u2019t return to action until Game 4 of a series the top-seeded Bucks eventually lost 4-1.",
      "At the end of last season, Antetokounmpo said he\u2019d have to ponder changing his offseason program or make other adaptations to assure he\u2019d stay healthy for the playoffs. He now enters the playoffs in peak form after leading Milwaukee to an eight-game winning streak to close the regular season.",
      "\u201cI made a lot of adjustments \u2014 that I\u2019ll keep private \u2014 but luck definitely plays a role, too,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cYou can be unlucky. Going down three games, or six games, I don\u2019t even remember, before the playoffs last year, that\u2019s being unlucky. But yeah, I think we made a lot of adjustments, me and my team, and I\u2019m here today, so I\u2019m happy.\u201d",
      "The last time Antetokounmpo played in an entire playoff series, he had 33.9 points, 14.7 rebounds and 7.1 assists per game in the Bucks\u2019 4-3 Eastern Conference semifinal loss to Boston in 2022. He became the first player in NBA history to collect 200 points, 100 rebounds and 50 assists in a single playoff series.",
      "A year before that, Antetokounmpo missed the final two games of the Eastern Conference finals with a hyperextended left knee but came back to earn NBA Finals MVP honors and score 50 points in a title-clinching Game 6 victory over the Phoenix Suns.",
      "Now he\u2019s back and leading a new-look Bucks roster.",
      "Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton are the only players remaining from Milwaukee\u2019s 2021 championship team. Kyle Kuzma, acquired at the trade deadline, was on the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 2020 championship team but last made the playoffs in 2021. Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins, whose roles expanded due to Lilllard's health issues, have never played in a postseason game.",
      "Lillard's absence has resulted in more ball-handling responsibilities for Antetokounmpo, who has been playing particularly well even by his lofty standards.",
      "The 6-11 forward ended the regular season ranked second in scoring (30.4), sixth in rebounding (11.9) and 13th in assists (6.5). Antetokounmpo is the only player ever to average 30 points while shooting at least 60% from the floor, and he\u2019s done that each of the last two seasons.",
      "In the six games he\u2019s played this month, Antetokounmpo has averaged 31.8 points, 12 rebounds and 11.8 assists while recording four triple-doubles.",
      "\u201cDuring this period where Dame has been out, he\u2019s been seeing consistent double teams, so he\u2019s just continued to evolve as a great player,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cHe\u2019s mixing in the assist, the laser passes, the skip passes cross-court which are very difficult to deal with when you\u2019re double-teaming him, and his shooting has gotten better and better.\u201d",
      "Now he gets a chance to try carrying that over to the postseason, a stage he missed dearly last year.",
      "\u201cWatching the game on the bench is not fun,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fun. Maybe in 20 years, I can put on a polo or a suit \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the coaches wear \u2014 and watch it from the bench. But now I\u2019m just happy that I\u2019m out there and I\u2019m in the heat of the battle and I\u2019m able to get my hands dirty and help my team win.\u201d",

So, and really, if you start taking averages of careers, career length, there\u2019s maybe a cutoff somewhere, but the careers aren\u2019t very long as it is. But we do look at (age), though.\"",
      "A majority of the older players selected in the draft last year were Day 3 picks, going in the sixth or seventh round. That indicates teams are more likely to overlook age later in the draft.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just unique to where we\u2019re at right now in kind of the football world,\u201d Raiders general manager John Spytek said. \u201cYou got guys with sixth and seventh years really, and so you\u2019ve got to talk about a value of are we going to have a problem with the 25- or 26-year-old? Some people have more problems with that. I\u2019m just looking for good football players, and I\u2019m trying to impress that upon our scouts, too. Let\u2019s just find good football players. We\u2019ll figure it out. So I will say it\u2019s been really hard on the area scouts.",
      "\u201cYou go into these schools like Georgia and Michigan, Ohio State, and they\u2019ve got a list of 30 guys that can potentially come out. ... I mean it used to just be like here\u2019s these 10 juniors, maybe half of them come out. Now it\u2019s like, you got a fourth-year, fifth-year senior, and he might take another year. So it adds a lot more names to it and uncertainty and a lot more work that has to get done in a finite amount of time. And that\u2019s why the scouts\u2019 jobs are so critical to go through all that in an efficient way and present the players the right way. We\u2019re relying on it. It\u2019s critical to every organization.\u201d",

      "Teams that stick to the old philosophy of avoiding older players limit their talent pool.",
      "\u201cI think sometimes you have to ask yourself, are you trying to get this guy for 12 years? If you\u2019re looking for that, it\u2019s a small percentage,\u201d 49ers general manager John Lynch said. \u201cOr are you looking for one contract and then hopefully more? It\u2019s an interesting topic. It\u2019s one we constantly discuss. There are pluses and minuses to both sides. Having a young guy that you think you can develop and is already a good player, and then a guy who\u2019s a little more battle-tested ... bent through a little more. It\u2019s an interesting conversation.\u201d",
      "College experience is most valuable for quarterbacks. Nix and Daniels proved it last year when they led their teams to the playoffs. Meanwhile, Anthony Richardson threw just 393 passes in college before the Colts drafted him No. 4 overall in 2023. He has struggled to adjust at the NFL level.",
      "The oldest player ever selected in the draft was quarterback Chris Weinke. He was 28 years and 264 days old when the Panthers selected him in the fourth round of the 2000 draft. Weinke started just 20 games in the NFL, going 2-18.",

      "The Bruins finished with a 5-4 overtime loss to the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday night, wrapping up a lost season in which they missed the playoffs for the first time since 2016 and posted their first losing record since 2007.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sad it\u2019s over, obviously. That\u2019s pretty much the only answer I can give you right now,\u201d forward David Pastrnak said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. Obviously want to keep playing. And I\u2019ll leave it at that, I guess.\u201d",
      "The Bruins had topped 100 points in each of the six previous non-pandemic years, including a record-setting 135-point 2022-23 campaign that was the best regular season in NHL history. But since losing in the 2019 Stanley Cup Final, they haven\u2019t made it past the second round of the playoffs; they have won only one series in the last four years.",
      "That led to the firing of first Bruce Cassidy, and then Jim Montgomery, who was let go 20 games into this season and replaced with Joe Sacco. But the interim coach could only manage a 25-30-7 record the rest of the way \u2014 last in the Atlantic Division, and no better than tied for last in the whole Eastern Conference.",
      "Sacco, who is not expected to return, was hobbled by a trade deadline surrender that purged captain Brad Marchand and a handful of other players from the roster. He said he hadn\u2019t had a chance to look back on a season that changed dramatically just six weeks in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty busy since the change,\u201d said the 56-year-old suburban Boston native, who played at Boston University before a 13-year NHL career.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s special to be able to coach obviously in your hometown. That\u2019s obviously an added bonus,\u201d Sacco said. \u201cI\u2019ll think more about it as the days go on. But I\u2019m proud of the guys. I know there\u2019s been a lot of moving parts this year and they haven\u2019t quit \u2014 right to the end.\u201d",
      "Pastrnak led the team with 43 goals and 63 assists, and his 106 points were nearly twice as many as his nearest teammate. With Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm injured, there wasn\u2019t much help on defense.",
      "And Jeremy Swayman struggled after signing an eight-year, $66 million contract and ending his holdout two days before the season opener.",
      "\u201cThe major takeaway is just finding a way to win. And no matter how we do it, we have to compete every single day,\u201d Swayman said. \u201cWe\u2019re a proud program. And we owe it to ourselves \u2014 really to our fans \u2014 to be a lot better. And I\u2019m excited for for the comeback.\u201d",

But he did order fines of 6,000 euros ($6,800) for Roma and 4,000 euros ($4,500) for Lazio because supporters of the clubs threw flares toward the field during the game. Seven flares were reported from the Roma end and four from the Lazio end.",

    "story": [
      "America\u2019s only rare earths mine has fielded calls from anxious companies since China responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs by limiting exports of seven heavy metals",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- America\u2019s only rare earths mine heard from anxious companies soon after China responded to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs this month by limiting exports of those minerals used for military applications and in many high-tech devices.",
      "\u201cBased on the number of phone calls we\u2019re receiving, the effects have been immediate,\u201d said Matt Sloustcher, a spokesperson for MP Materials, the company that runs the Mountain Pass mine in California's Mojave Desert.",
      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies could lead to a critical shortage of rare earth elements if China maintains its export controls long-term or expands them to seek an advantage in any trade negotiations. The California mine can\u2019t meet all of the U.S. demand for rare earths, which is why Trump is trying to clear the way for new mines.",
      "Rare earth elements are important ingredients in electric vehicles, powerful magnets, advanced fighter jets, submarines, smartphones, television screens and many other products. Despite their name, the 17 elements aren't actually rare, but it's hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment.",
      "MP Materials, which acquired the idle Mountain Pass site in 2017, said Thursday it would stop sending its ore to China for processing because of the export restrictions and 125% tariffs on U.S. imports China imposed. The company said it would continue processing nearly half of what it mines on site and store the rest while it works to expand its processing capability.",
      "\u201cSelling our valuable critical minerals under 125% tariffs is neither commercially rational nor aligned with America's national interests,\u201d MP Materials said in a statement.",
      "Experts say the manufacturers that rely on rare earth elements and other critical minerals will see price increases, but there is likely enough of a global supply available to keep factories operating for now.",
      "The California mine yields neodymium and praseodymium, the light rare earths that are the main components of the permanent rare earth magnets in EVs and wind turbines. But small amounts of some of the heavy rare earths that China has restricted, such as terbium and dysprosium are key to helping the magnets withstand high temperatures.",
      "Already, the price of terbium has jumped 24% since the end of March to reach $933 per kilogram.",
      "\u201cOur estimate suggests that there is enough stockpile in the market to sustain demand for now,\u201d Benchmark Mineral Intelligence rare earths analyst Neha Mukherjee said, adding that shortages may emerge later this year.",
      "China has tremendous power over the rare earths market. The country has the biggest mines, producing 270,000 metric tons (297,624 tons) of minerals last year compared to the 45,000 tons (40,823 metric tons) mined in the U.S. China supplies nearly 90% of the world\u2019s rare earths because it also is home to most of the processing capacity.",
      "The restrictions Beijing put in place on April 4 require Chinese exporters of seven heavy rare earths and some magnets to obtain special licenses. The retaliatory controls reinforced what the Trump administration and manufacturers see as a dire need to build additional U.S. mines and reduce the nation's dependence on China.",
      "Trump has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to strong-arm Greenland and Ukraine into providing more of their rare earths and other critical materials to the United States. Last month, he signed an executive order calling for the federal government to streamline permit approvals for new mines and encourage investments in the projects.",
      "Two companies are trying to develop mines in Nebraska and Montana. Officials at NioCorp and U.S. Critical Minerals said they hoped the push from the White House would help them raise money and obtain the necessary approvals to start digging. NioCorp has worked for years to raise $1.1 billion to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.",
      "\u201cAs I sit and I think about how can we deal with this enormous leverage that China has over these minerals that nobody even knows how to pronounce for the most part, we have to deal with this leverage situation,\" NioCorp CEO Mark Smith said. \"And the best way, I think, is that we need to make our own heavy rare earths here in the United States. And we can do that.\"",
      "MP Materials is working to quickly expand its processing capability, partly with the help of some $45 million the company received coming out of the first Trump administration. But after investing nearly $1 billion since 2020, the company doesn't currently have the ability to process the heavy rare earths that China is restricting. MP Materials said it was working expeditiously to change that.",
      "Big U.S. automakers declined to comment about how dependent they are on rare earths and the impact of China's export curbs. Major defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which were specifically targeted in China's restrictions along with more than a dozen other defense and aerospace companies, also remained circumspect.",
      "Military technology is a smaller but important user of rare earths. Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday calling for an investigation into the national security implications of being so reliant on China for the elements.",
      "A spokesperson for Lockheed, which makes the F-22 fighter jet, said the company continuously assesses \u201cthe global rare earth supply chain to ensure access to critical materials that support our customers\u2019 missions.\u201d",
      "Some battery makers could start to run short of key elements within weeks, according to Steve Christensen, executive director of the Responsible Battery Coalition, an association representing battery and automakers and battery sellers.",
      "Already, manufacturers have seen the price of antimony, an element used to extend the life of traditional lead-acid batteries, more than double since China restricted exports of it last year. The element isn't one of the 17 rare earths but is among the critical minerals that Trump wants to see produced domestically.",
      "Initially, automakers will likely try to absorb any increase in the cost of their batteries without raising vehicle prices, but that may not be sustainable if China's restrictions remain in place, Christensen said. A 25% tariff Trump put on all imported automobiles and auto parts cars already was expected to increase costs, although the president hinted this week that he might give the industry a temporary reprieve.",
      "The U.S. fulfilled its rare earths needs with domestic sources until the late 1990s. Production largely ended after low-cost Chinese ores flooded global markets. Robots, drones and other new technologies have rapidly increased demand for the raw materials.",
      "NioCorp recently signed a contract to do more exploratory drilling on its site this summer to help prove to the Export-Import Bank that enough rare earth minerals rest underground near Elk Creek, Nebraska, to justify an $800 million loan to help finance the project.",
      "But a new rare earths mine is years away from operating in the U.S. NioCorp estimates if all goes well with its fundraising, the site where it hopes to mine and process niobium, scandium, titanium and an assortment of rare earths possibly might be running by the end of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "U.S. Critical Minerals plans to dig up several tons of ore in Montana this summer so it can test out processing methods it has been developing. The Sheep Creek project isn't as far along as the Nebraska project, but U.S. Critical Minerals Director Harvey Kaye said the site has promising ore deposits with high concentrations of rare earths.",

      "Independent scientists described the findings as interesting, but not nearly enough to show the existence of life on another planet.",
      "\u201cIt is the strongest sign to date of any possibility of biological activity outside the solar system,\" Cambridge astrophysicist Nikku Madhusudhan said during a livestream on Thursday.",
      "By analyzing data from NASA and the European Space Agency's Webb Space Telescope, the researchers found evidence of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in the atmosphere of the planet known as K2-18b. The planet is 124 light-years away; one light-year is equivalent to nearly 6 trillion miles.",
      "On Earth, those two compounds are produced primarily by microbial life, such as marine phytoplankton.",
      "The planet is more than double Earth\u2019s size and more than 8 times more massive. It's in the so-called habitable zone of its star. The study appeared in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "Madhusudhan stressed that further research is needed to rule out any errors or the possibility of other processes, besides living organisms, that could produce the compounds.",

      "\u201cMany of the turtle populations have come back, though some haven\u2019t,\u201d said Duke ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved with the research. \u201cOverall, the sea turtle story is one of the real conservation success stories.\"",
      "The study looked at 48 populations of sea turtles around the world. Scientists measured the impacts of threats such as hunting, pollution, coastal development and climate change to the marine animals. In more than half of the areas studied, threats are declining overall, the study found.",
      "But there are some exceptions. Sea turtle populations in the Atlantic Ocean are more likely to be recovering than those in Pacific waters. And leatherback turtles are not faring as well as other species.",
      "Globally, leatherbacks are considered vulnerable to extinction, but many groups are critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "All seven of the regions where leatherbacks are found face high environmental risks, said study co-author Bryan Wallace, a wildlife ecologist at Ecolibrium in Colorado.",
      "Leatherback turtles are famous for making the longest known marine migrations of any animal \u2013 with some individuals swimming as many as 3,700 miles (5,955 kilometers) each way. That feat moves them through a wide swath of regions and may expose them to unique risks, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, green turtles are still considered endangered globally, but their populations show signs of recovery in many regions of the world, researchers found.",
      "\u201cBy ending commercial harvests and allowing them time to rebound, their populations are now doing really well\u201d in coastal waters off many regions of Mexico and the U.S., said co-author Michelle Mar\u00eda Early Capistr\u00e1n, a Stanford University researcher who has conducted fieldwork in both countries.",

Even as Cuba struggles with power outages and technological scarcity, this eatery has leaped into the 21st century with digital menus, Alexa-enabled assistance, touchless bathrooms and even a food-delivering robot.",

      "The Trump administration plans to rewrite part of the Endangered Species Act that prohibits harming the habitats of endangered and threatened species",
      "The Trump administration plans to eliminate habitat protections for endangered and threatened species in a move environmentalists say would lead to the extinction of critically endangered species due to logging, mining, development and other activities.",
      "At issue is a longstanding definition of \u201charm\u201d in the Endangered Species Act, which has included altering or destroying the places those species live. Habitat destruction is the biggest cause of extinction, said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service said in a proposed rule issued Wednesday that habitat modification should not be considered harm because it's not the same as intentionally targeting a species, called \u201ctake.\u201d Environmentalists argue that the definition of \u201ctake,\u201d though, has always included actions that harm species, and the definition of \u201charm\u201d has been upheld by the Supreme Court.",
      "The proposed rule \u201ccuts the heart out of the Endangered Species Act,\u201d said Greenwald. \u201cIf (you) say harm doesn\u2019t mean significant habitat degradation or modification, then it really leaves endangered species out in the cold.\u201d",
      "For example, he said spotted owls and Florida panthers both are protected because the current rule forbids habitat destruction. But if the new rule is adopted, someone who logs in a forest or builds a development would be unimpeded as long as they could say they didn't intend to harm an endangered species, he said.",

      "A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman referred The Associated Press to the Department of Interior, which declined to comment.",
      "Environmental groups will challenge the rule in court if it is adopted, said Drew Caputo, an attorney at Earthjustice.",
      "He said the proposal \u201cthreatens a half-century of progress in protecting and restoring endangered species,\u201d including bald eagles, gray wolves, Florida manatees and humpback whales. He said that's because the current rule \u201crecognizes the common-sense concept that destroying a forest, beach, river, or wetland that a species relies on for survival constitutes harm to that species.\u201d",
      "The question is whether the Trump administration is entitled to repeal a rule that was upheld specifically by the Supreme Court and therefore subject to precedent, said Patrick Parenteau, an emeritus professor at the Vermont Law and Graduate School who has handled endangered species cases.",
      "Because of the current definition of harm, \u201cmany, many millions of acres of land has been conserved\u201d to help keep species alive, he said.",

      "Zuckerberg said he\u2019s very focused on inventing new things, and understanding what other people are creating is a big part of the process. At any given point in his company\u2019s history, he said, similar tones of concern could be found in emails about what other companies were doing better than his.",
      "\u201cThis is my job,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I need to understand what is going on, and I need to push our teams to move quickly\u201d to learn about what is going on in a very competitive market.",
      "Hansen questioned Zuckerberg about competition, particularly from TikTok, the popular social media site owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance, and the the growth of the video-sharing platform YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet.",
      "Zuckerberg testified that people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined.",
      "While Hansen noted that the FTC doesn't consider YouTube to be a Meta competitor \u2014 because it doesn't have the same friend-sharing technology as Facebook \u2014 Zuckerberg said YouTube has built in ways to share videos.",
      "The FTC contends Meta has used a monopoly in its technology that facilitates connecting with friends and family to generate enormous profits as consumer satisfaction has dropped. The case could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, the FTC's attorney who questioned Zuckerberg, has repeatedly brought up his own words in emails to associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram to try to show Zuckerberg was more interested halting Instagram's alarming growth than improving the product.",
      "Under questioning by Hansen, Zuckerberg insisted that he had no intention of acquiring Instagram only to slow its development and end a threat. He said the focus was on \"having it run as an independent brand.\u201d",
      "Hansen noted that the FTC is making similar claims about the acquisition of the messaging app WhatsApp: that Zuckerberg was afraid of the company's potential.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something I thought about,\" Zuckerberg said, noting the app's formidable capabilities, but he added that he later learned not to be worried because the owners didn't share the same vision or direction.",
      "He said his interest in buying it was \u201cthe usage of it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought the app was important and valuable,\u201d Zuckerberg said.",
      "The trial, which is slated to last weeks, will feature other Big-Tech figures. After Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's former chief operating officer, took the stand.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump\u2019s FTC\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump\u2019s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",

    "story": [
      "The speed and scope of the federal government\u2019s efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges and universities across the country",
      "WASHINGTON -- At first, the bar association for immigration attorneys began receiving inquiries from a couple students a day. These were foreigners studying in the U.S., and they'd discovered in early April their legal status had been terminated with little notice. To their knowledge, none of the students had committed a deportable offense.",
      "In recent days, the calls have begun flooding in. Hundreds of students have been calling to say they have lost legal status, seeking advice on what to do next.",
      "\u201cWe thought it was going to be something that was unusual,\u201d said Matthew Maiona, a Boston-based immigration attorney who is getting about six calls a day from panicked international students. \u201cBut it seems now like it\u2019s coming pretty fast and furious.\u201d",
      "The speed and scope of the federal government's efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges across the country. Few corners of higher education have been untouched, as schools ranging from prestigious private universities, large public research institutions and tiny liberal arts colleges discover status terminations one after another among their students.",
      "At least 600 students at more than 90 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated in recent weeks, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials. Advocacy groups collecting reports from colleges say hundreds more students could be caught up in the crackdown.",
      "Around 1.1 million international students were in the United States last year \u2014 a source of essential revenue for tuition-driven colleges. International students are not eligible for federal financial aid, and their ability to pay tuition often factors into whether they will be admitted to American schools. Often, they pay full price.",
      "Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said.",
      "Four students from two Michigan universities are suing Trump administration officials after their F-1 student status was terminated last week. Their attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, Ramis Wadood, said the students never received a clear reason why.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the scary part,\u201d he said.",
      "The students were informed of the terminations by their universities via email, which came as a shock, Wadood said. The reason given was that there was a \u201ccriminal records check and/or that their visa was revoked,\u201d Wadood said, but none of them were charged or convicted of crimes. Some had either speeding or parking tickets, but one didn\u2019t have any, he said. Only one of the students had known their entry visa was revoked, Wadood said.",
      "Students have filed similar lawsuits in several other states, arguing they were denied due process.",
      "In New Hampshire, a federal judge last week granted a temporary restraining order to restore the status of a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, Xiaotian Liu, while he challenges the revocation of his visa.",
      "At many colleges, officials learned the legal immigration status of some international students had been terminated when staff checked a database managed by the Department of Homeland Security. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.",
      "The system to track enrollment and movements of international students came under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement after 9/11, said Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators. She said recent developments have left students fearful of how quickly they can be on the wrong side of enforcement.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need more than a small number to create fear,\u201d Aw said. \u201cThere\u2019s no clarity of what are the reasons and how far the reach of this is.\u201d",
      "Her group says as many as 1,300 students have lost visas or had their status terminated, based on reports from colleges.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security and State Department did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "Foreigners who are subject to removal proceedings are usually sent a notice to appear in immigration court on a certain date, but lawyers say affected students have not received any notices, leaving them unsure of next steps to take.",
      "Some schools have told students to leave the country to avoid the risk of being detained or deported. But some students have appealed the terminations and stayed in the United States while those are processed.",
      "Still others caught in legal limbo aren't students at all. They had remained in the U.S. post-graduation on \u201coptional practical training,\u201d a one-year period \u2014 or up to three for science and technology graduates \u2014 that allows employment in the U.S. after completing an academic degree. During that time, a graduate works in their field and waits to receive their H-1B or other employment visas if they wish to keep working in the U.S.",
      "Around 242,000 foreigners in the U.S. are employed through this \u201coptional practical training.\u201d About 500,000 are pursuing graduate degrees, and another 342,000 are undergraduate students.",
      "Among the students who have filed lawsuits is a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who is supposed to graduate on May 5, with a job offer to join the faculty. His attorney Charles Kuck said the student was likely targeted for termination because of an unpaid traffic fine from when the student lent his car to a friend. Ultimately, the violation was dismissed.",
      "\u201cWe have case after case after case exactly like that, where there is no underlying crime,\u201d said Kuck, who is representing 17 students in the federal lawsuit. He said his law firm has heard from hundreds of students.",
      "\u201cThese are kids who now, under the Trump administration, realize their position is fragile,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve preyed on a very vulnerable population. These kids aren\u2019t hiding. They\u2019re in school.\u201d",
      "Some international students have been adapting their daily routines.",
      "A Ph.D. student from China at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said she has begun carrying around her passport and immigration paperwork at the advice of the university\u2019s international student office. The student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities, said she has been distressed to see the terminations even for students like her without criminal records.",

They told the magistrate they were collecting the ants for fun and did not know that it was illegal.",

      "The Kenya Wildlife Service said the four men were involved in trafficking the ants to markets in Europe and Asia, and that the species included messor cephalotes, a distinctive, large and red-colored harvester ant native to East Africa.",
      "The illegal export of the ants \"not only undermines Kenya\u2019s sovereign rights over its biodiversity but also deprives local communities and research institutions of potential ecological and economic benefits,\u201d KWS said in a statement.",
      "Kenya has in the past fought against the trafficking of body parts of larger species of wild animals such as elephants, rhinos and pangolins among others. But the cases against the four men represent \"a shift in trafficking trends \u2014 from iconic large mammals to lesser-known yet ecologically critical species,\u201d KWS said.",
      "The two Belgians were arrested in Kenya\u2019s Nakuru county, which is home to various national parks. The 5,000 ants were found in a guest house where they were staying, and were packed in 2,244 test tubes that had been filled with cotton wool to enable the ants to survive for months.",
      "The other two men were arrested in Nairobi where they were found to have 400 ants in their apartments.",
      "Kenyan authorities valued the ants at 1 million shillings ($7,700). The prices for ants can vary greatly according to the species and the market.",
      "Philip Muruthi, a vice president for conservation at the Africa Wildlife Foundation in Nairobi, said ants play the role of enriching soils, enabling germination and providing food for species such as birds.",
      "\u201cThe thing is, when you see a healthy forest, like Ngong forest, you don\u2019t think about what is making it healthy. It is the relationships all the way from the bacteria to the ants to the bigger things,\u201d he said.",
      "Muruthi warned of the risk of trafficking species and exporting diseases to the agricultural industry of the destination countries.",
      "\u201cEven if there is trade, it should be regulated and nobody should be taking our resources just like that,\u201d he said.",

      "Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump\u2019s Federal Trade Commission\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: \u2018It is better to buy than compete.\u2019 True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \u201cneutralize perceived competitive threats,\u201d the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "\u201cUnable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company\u2019s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,\u201d the FTC says.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "\u201cThe FTC already has the difficult task, whether it\u2019s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we\u2019re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,\u201d said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cAnd I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.\u201d",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC\u2019s lawsuit \u201cdefies reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission\u2019s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC \u201cmust prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.\" This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram.",
      "Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",
      "Boasberg \u201cseems to be skeptical\u201d of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a \u201cfact question,\" which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market.",
      "While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram.",
      "\u201cInstagram is now Meta\u2019s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company\u2019s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. \u201cThe trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn\u2019t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.\u201d",
      "But Meta isn't the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google's case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August.",
      "\u201cA big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it\u2019s an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing \u2014 these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cAnd this will be a case that speaks directly to that.\u201d",

      "In the wake of the deadly shooting at Florida State University on Thursday, a portrait of the alleged gunman -- the stepson of a local sheriff's deputy -- has emerged.",
      "At least two people were killed and six others were injured when shots rang out near the Tallahassee institution's Student Union, officials said during a press conference.",
      "First responders shot the suspect on campus and he has since been hospitalized, officials said. He was taken into custody with non-life-threatening injuries, multiple law enforcement officials told ABC News.",
      "The suspect was identified during the press conference as 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner. At the press conference, authorities described Ikner as the son of Leon County Sheriff's Deputy Jessica Ikner. However, court documents indicate she is the suspect's stepmother.",
      "Sheriff Walter McNeil said Phoenix had access to one of his stepmother's personal weapons, which was one of the weapons found at the scene. He had a handgun and a shotgun with him at the time of the shooting, officials said.",
      "Jessica Ikner has been a deputy with the department for more than 18 years and \"her service to this community has been exceptional,\" McNeil said.",
      "McNeil added that the 20-year-old suspect was also a \"long-standing member\" of the Leon County Sheriff's Office's Youth Advisory Council.",
      "Pheonix had been \"steeped in the Leon County Sheriff's Office family,\" McNeil said, adding, \"It's not a surprise to us that he had access to weapons,\" he added.",
      "Ikner was previously at the center of a protracted battle between his parents that featured a custody dispute stretching from the Florida panhandle to Norway, according to court documents.",
      "At the time of the custody dispute, the suspect was a child and was known as Christian Gunnar Eriksen. (He changed his name in 2020 and is now identified as Phoenix Ikner.)",
      "Christian was taken by his biological mother to Norway in March 2015 in violation of a child custody order, according to a 2015 probable cause affidavit from the Leon County Sheriff's Office. Anne-Mari Eriksen was accused of telling Christian's father, Christopher Ikner, that she was taking him to South Florida for spring break.",
      "\"Instead of staying in South Florida, the defendant allegedly fled the country with him in violation of their custody agreement,\" the affidavit says. \"Mr. Ikner advised that Christian has developmental delays and has special needs which he feared would not be taken care of without access to his doctors here in the United States.\"",
      "The sheriff's affidavit said the child was on medication for \"several health and mental issues, to include a growth hormone disorder and ADHD.\"",
      "The document stated that Christian and his biological mother were dual citizens of the United States and Norway.",
      "Christian was eventually brought back to the United States. His mother was arrested at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in July 2015 and later pleaded no contest to illegally removing a child from Florida.",
      "In October 2015, Anne-Mari Eriksen filed a lawsuit alleging slander and libel on behalf of herself and her son against the father and Christian's stepmother, sheriff's deputy Jessica Ikner, along with two other relatives.",
      "\"The emotional and psychological harm done to the minor child will be evident for years, and will require counseling, and given the child being the age of 11, will have memory impacted by the behaviors of all the defendants for the false claims done on his mother, and for the parental alienation of the close relationship of the minor child,\" the lawsuit claimed.",
      "The lawsuit sought more than $80,000 in damages to use toward Christian's college fund.",
      "A judge dismissed the suit seven months later.",
      "An investigation into the motive of the deadly shooting is ongoing.",
      "Police said during the press conference that law enforcement's response to the shooting was \"massive\" and \"very quick.\"",
      "\"We are working multiple crime scenes, and there are potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of witnesses,\" Chief Lawrence Revell of the Tallahassee Police said.",
      "Revell also said the suspect did not comply with commands before being shot by responding officers. \"I do not believe he fired at officers,\" Revell said.",

      "The Maryland senator, who flew to the country on Wednesday, shared a photo on X on Thursday evening of him sitting down with Abrego Garcia.",
      "The Supreme Court and a Maryland federal judge ordered that the U.S. government \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. after the Department of Justice said in court filings that the 29-year-old father was wrongfully deported because of an \"administrative error.\" The Trump administration has alleged it cannot bring him back and claimed outside of court that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang.",
      "Van Hollen was joined by Chris Newman, who he said is the attorney for Abrego Garcia's wife and mother, and said they are trying to check on the deported man's condition.",
      "The video also showed Van Hollen and Newman speaking to prison guards, who were visibly shaking their heads \"no.\"",
      "\"These soldiers were ordered to prevent us from going any farther from this spot,\" Van Hollen said. \"I understand we're about three kilometers now from CECOT, and as you can see, they're letting other cars go by, but they stopped us because they're under orders not to allow us to proceed to check on the well-being of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\"",
      "Over the last couple of weeks, Republican members of Congress have gained access to the prison and posted pictures on their social media pages from inside the complex.",
      "Van Hollen later told reporters that he made his request to visit the prison to the U.S. Embassy, which then passed the request to El Salvador's government.",
      "The senator said he also asked El Salvador's vice president on Wednesday to visit the facility.",
      "\"I emphasized my goal was to check on his health and well-being,\" he said.",
      "The senator also said the prisoner has had no contact with anyone outside of CECOT, which he said is a violation of international law.",
      "\"El Salvador is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. El Salvador has signed and ratified that covenant, and that covenant says, and I quote, 'A detained or imprisoned person shall be entitled to communicate and consult with his legal counsel,'\" Van Allen told reporters.",

      "First, the nation\u2019s top law firms",
      "WASHINGTON -- First the nation\u2019s top law firms. Then its premier universities. Now, President Donald Trump is leaning on the advocacy groups that underpin U.S. civil society.",
      "Trump said Thursday that the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status not just of Harvard, but environmental groups and specifically the ethics watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. It could be a devastating financial blow to the nonprofit organizations \u2014 and his perceived political foes.",
      "The president\u2019s remarks, during an event at the White House, began to confirm what advocacy groups have been quietly warning: Trump\u2019s campaign of retribution is coming next for them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a charitable organization,\u201d Trump said about CREW, in particular. \u201cThe only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at a lot of things.\u201d",
      "Trump and his team have been working their way through the nation\u2019s institutions, threatening to chisel away at the independence and autonomy of the law firms, college campuses and now advocacy groups \u2014 or putting them at risk of losing their federal funds or professional livelihood.",
      "It's all coming quickly, not yet 100 days into the new administration, and in ways historically unheard of in this country for their speed and scope. And it's sending shock waves reverberating throughout the American system.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day in this country when organizations that provide critical services to their communities are under attack from their government,\u201d said Cole Leiter, executive director of the advocacy group Americans Against Government Censorship. \u201cNo administration, Republican or Democratic, should be able to weaponize the weight of the government against their political enemies.\"",
      "On their own, Trump's actions are an almost daily list of executive pronouncements from the White House. The Trump administration has issued orders against the law firms that had cases or attorneys perceived to be against him, and it has made demands of the universities over their rules around campus activism.",
      "Thursday brought potentially more to the stack: Trump singled out CREW, the watchdog group whose founder, Norm Eisen, played a pivotal role in Trump\u2019s first impeachment, and the environmental groups that largely stand at odds with his \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d agenda.",
      "\u201cTax exempt status \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a privilege. It\u2019s really a privilege, and it\u2019s been abused by a lot more than Harvard,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be making some statements. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d",
      "But taken together, the executive orders and actions and memos are making one thing clear: The Trump administration is eager to test new ways to flex executive power, and dare the courts and Congress to intervene. And there\u2019s more expected to come.",
      "Environmental, immigration and civil society advocacy groups have been bracing for potential threats to their tax-exempt status, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. The person said some expect Trump might start taking action against the environmental groups on Earth Day, which is Tuesday.",
      "These are the largely nonprofit organizations and groups, many based in Washington, advocating for various communities, constituencies and causes.",
      "Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said environmental groups have heard that the Trump administration is preparing executive orders targeting the tax status of environmental groups that work on climate change, as well as that of any foundations that fund their work.",
      "\u201cTrump is marshaling all the power of government to punish his perceived enemies,\" Suckling said. \"We\u2019ve got a crack legal team and will have him in court within 24 hours. We\u2019re ready and waiting for him to come at us.\u201d",
      "CREW has been a leading ethics group in Washington, with Trump long the subject of its probes.",
      "Ahead of the 2024 election, the group was part of the legal effort to disqualify Trump from regaining the White House under the 14th Amendment, in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. More recently, CREW sued over the firing of federal workers by Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\u201cFor more than 20 years, CREW has exposed government corruption from politicians of both parties who violate the public trust and has worked to promote an ethical, transparent government,\" said Jordan Libowitz, the organization's vice president.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on civil society have created a climate that is potentially chilling for the organizations in question \u2014 but they have had mixed results.",
      "Five of the major law firms and Trump reached a deal in which they agreed to provide a combined hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono counsel to causes the administration says it supports. The firms are trying to avoid various sanctions, including terminated federal contracts, federal employment investigations over diversity hiring and others.",
      "While Columbia University agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s demands to overhaul its rules for public protests rather than risk billions of dollars in lost federal funds, Harvard rebuffed the administration and now faces a $2 billion federal funding freeze and the threat to its tax-exempt status.",
      "The tax-exempt status allows nonprofit organizations to receive donations that are crucial to their financial bottom line. Changing that could, in some situations, lead to calamity.",
      "\u201cGood governance groups are the heart of a healthy democracy,\" Libowitz said. \"We will continue to do our work to ensure Americans have an ethical and accountable government.\u201d",

      "\"The goal of this mission is to let the Trump administration, to let the government of El Salvador know that we are going to keep fighting to bring Abrego Garcia home,\" Van Hollen said in a video.",
      "He posted another video after he landed and said he was on his way to meet with members of the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador.",
      "Van Hollen told reporters later in the afternoon that he wasn't able to speak with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele but did speak with the vice president. The senator asked why Abrego Garcia has been held at CECOT despite no criminal charges.",
      "\"His answer was that the Trump administration is paying El Salvador, the government of El Salvador, to keep him at CECOT,\" Van Hollen said.",
      "\"I'm asking President Bukele under his authority as president of El Salvador to do the right thing and allow Mr. Abrego Garcia to walk out of a prison, a man who is charged with no crime, convicted with no crime and was illegally abducted from the United States,\" the senator said.",
      "He added that he did not speak with Abrego Garcia or enter CECOT. Republican Congress members have taken tours of the facility in the last few weeks and have posted pictures from the inside on social media.",
      "\"I don't know about his health status -- that's why I wanted to meet with him directly,\" Von Hollen said.",
      "Later in the evening, Van Hollen posted another video update on social media, explaining that he's had \"back-to-back meetings\" in the country -- with members of humans rights groups and the U.S. Embassy.",
      "\"And the entire purpose has been to bring Abrego Garcia home,\" the senator said.",
      "Van Hollen also said that he called on the government of El Salvador to provide evidence that Abrego Garcia was involved in MS-13 -- they could not.",
      "\"They said they had no evidence,\" he said.",
      "\"So this is not about MS-13. I know President Trump wants to make this about gang violence. I have been fighting MS-13, probably longer than Donald Trump even knew about MS- 13. I care about every victim of crime. That's why we have a court system to hold people accountable when they commit crimes, to make sure they get the punishment they deserve,\" Van Hollen continued.",
      "In the end, the senator claimed that his trip was simply about letting Abrego Garcia \"have his day in court.\"",
      "\"We use the courts to make sure that we don't convict people who are not guilty, and that we convict those who are,\" Van Hollen said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt held a news conference later in the day and slammed the senator for \"potentially using taxpayer dollars\" to fly to El Salvador in an attempt to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and repeated her allegations that the migrant was an MS-13 terrorist.",
      "\"It's appalling and sad that Sen. Van Hollen and the Democrats are plotting his trip to El Salvador today, are incapable of having any shred of common sense or empathy for their own constituents and our citizens,\" she told reporters.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi alleged Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member and was able to be deported because of Trump's executive orders on immigration. She added Wednesday morning during a press briefing that Abrego Garcia will not be returning to the U.S.",
      "\"He should not be in our country,\" Bondi said. \"He was deported. They needed one additional step in paperwork, but now MS-13 is characterized as they should be as an FTO, as a foreign terrorist organization. So he is not coming back to our country.\"",
      "\"President Bukele said he was not sending him back,\" she added. \"That's the end of the story.\"",
      "The Department of Justice has not made that accusation in court papers and admitted the deportation was an error, and Bondi declined to answer a reporter's question about why the DOJ hasn't presented direct evidence of this. Abrego Garcia's family and attorneys have been fighting the deportation for weeks in court.",
      "Van Hollen reiterated that none of these allegations were made in court and no charges related to the allegations have been issued.",
      "Leavitt claimed Abrego Garcia was wearing clothing that had MS-13 symbols, but such allegations were not made in court and there has been no evidence backing up this claim. An arrest photo released by the federal government earlier in the day showed Abrego Garcia wearing what appeared to be a bright yellow construction shirt.",
      "The press secretary invited Patty Morin, the mother of Rachel Morin, a Maryland mother of five who was killed by an immigrant lacking legal status in 2023, to speak at the news conference. Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez, 24, who was originally from El Salvador and accused of killing a woman in his home country, was convicted of first-degree murder, first-degree rape, third-degree sex offense and kidnapping on Monday.",
      "\"To have a senator from Maryland who didn't even acknowledge or barely acknowledged my daughter and the brutal death that she endured, leaving her five children without a mother and now a grandbaby without a grandmother so that he can use my taxpayer money to fly to El Salvador to bring back someone that's not even an American citizen, why does that person have more right than I do for my daughter, for my grandchildren?\" she said.",
      "The senator put out a statement after Martinez-Hernadez's conviction saying, \"This verdict brings a measure of justice that they so deserve. I'm grateful to the law enforcement officers who brought her killer into custody and for our legal process for delivering this justice.\"",
      "The Supreme Court unanimously ruled last week that the Abrego Garcia, 29, who had no criminal record in the U.S., was illegally deported. However, Bondi has claimed El Salvador's government is not giving him up.",

      "\"I asked the folks at the embassy whether they've been ordered by the administration to do anything to facilitate his return. The answer was no,\" he said. \"So they're clearly not in compliance.\"",
      "\"It is pretty clear that the Trump administration has not lifted a finger to implement that court order. And so I think it's important that the courts know that -- and they will know that,\" he told Maddow.",

Then, in September 2024, an immigration judge ordered him removed from the U.S. to Venezuela.",

      "Tim Myers, a Grammy-nominated former bassist for international hitmakers OneRepublic, announced Thursday he will challenge Rep. Ken Calvert in the battleground 41st District in Riverside County that stretches from the L.A. suburbs to the resort haven of Palm Springs.",

      "Myers grew up in Corona, most of which is in the district, but now lives in neighboring Los Angeles County.",
      "At a time when competitive House contests are becoming scarcer nationwide, Democrats consider Calvert's closely divided California district one of the party\u2019s best opportunities to gain ground in the chamber, where Republicans hold a fragile 220-213 majority.",

      "Myers, a prolific producer, songwriter and solo artist, is positioning himself as a change agent in a race against one of the most senior members of the House. The 40-year-old Myers said he was in second grade when Calvert, the longest-serving Republican in the state\u2019s congressional delegation, was first elected in 1992.",
      "In the video that appears to have been filmed in a recording studio, Myers recalls growing up a pastor's son in Corona, on the western edge of the Southern California district. He recounts the ups-and-downs of the notoriously cutthroat music business that eventually led him to found his own record label. He now lives in the tony enclave of Hidden Hills in neighboring Los Angeles County, a popular redoubt for musicians and actors.",

      "Republicans hold a slim registration advantage in the district \u2014 less than 2 points over Democrats \u2014 and Calvert has beat back tough challenges in the last two elections. Calvert prevailed by about a 3-point edge in 2024, the same year Trump carried the district by 6 points over Democrat Kamala Harris, the former California U.S. senator and attorney general.",
      "The campaign arm of House Democrats has named Calvert a top target for 2026, as he was in 2024. Calvert's campaign raised over $1.3 million the first quarter of 2025.",

Democrats hold every statewide office, dominate the Legislature and congressional delegation and outnumber registered Republicans by a staggering 2-1 ratio. Still, Republicans retain pockets of political clout in the Southern California suburbs and vast rural stretches, including the Central Valley farm belt.",

      "Thousands of Catholics are making the trek to a historic adobe church in the hills of northern New Mexico as part of a Holy Week tradition spanning generations",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- A unique Holy Week tradition is drawing thousands of Catholic pilgrims to a small adobe church in the hills of northern New Mexico, in a journey on foot through desert badlands to reach a spiritual wellspring.",
      "For generations, people of the Upper Rio Grande Valley and beyond have walked to reach El Santuario de Chimay\u00f3 to commemorate Good Friday.",
      "Pilgrims, some walking for days, were on track to arrive Friday amid a forecast of cool temperatures and sprinkles of rain.",
      "Some travelers are lured by an indoor well of dirt believed to have curative powers. Throughout the year, they leave behind crutches, braces and canes in acts of prayer for infirm children and others, and as evidence that miracles happen.",
      "Easter week visitors file through an adobe archway and narrow indoor passages to find a crucified Nuestro Se\u00f1or de Esquipulas at the main altar. According to local lore, the crucifix was found on the site in the early 1800s, a continent away from its analog at a basilica in the Guatemalan town of Esquipulas.",
      "Chimay\u00f3, known for its artisan weavings and chile crops, rests high above the Rio Grande Valley and opposite the national defense laboratory at Los Alamos that sprang up in the race to develop the first atomic weapon.",
      "The iconic adobe church at Chimay\u00f3 was cast from local mud at the sunset of Spanish rule in the Americas in the early 1800s, on a site already held sacred by Native Americans.",
      "Set amid narrow streets, curio shops and brooks that flow quickly in spring, El Santuario de Chimay\u00f3 has been designated as a National Historic Landmark that includes examples of 19th century Hispanic folk art, religious frescoes and saints carved from wood known as bultos.",
      "One votive room is filled with notes of thanks from those who say they had ailments cured.",
      "A separate chapel is dedicated to the Santo Ni\u00f1o de Atocha, a patron saint of children, travelers and those seeking liberation and a fitting figure of devotion for Chimay\u00f3 pilgrims on the go.",
      "Hundreds of children's shoes have been left in a prayer room there by the faithful in tribute to the holy child who wears out footwear on miraculous errands. There are even tiny boots tacked to the ceiling.",
      "Pueblo people who inhabited the Chimay\u00f3 area long before Spanish settlers believed healing spirits could be found in the form of hot springs. Those springs ultimately dried up, leaving behind earth attributed with healing powers.",
      "Photographer Miguel Gandert grew up in the Espa\u00f1ola valley below Chimay\u00f3 and made the pilgrimage as a boy with his parents.",
      "\u201cEverybody went to Chimay\u00f3. You didn't have to be Catholic,\" said Gandert, who was among those who photographed the 1996 pilgrimage through a federal grant. \u201cPeople just went there because it was a powerful, spiritual place.\u201d",
      "Scenes from that pilgrimage \u2014 on display at the New Mexico History Museum in Santa Fe \u2014 include children eating snow cones to keep cool, men shouldering large wooden crosses, infants swaddled in blankets, bikers in leather and weary pedestrians resting on highway guardrails to smoke.",
      "A generation later, Good Friday pilgrims still haul crosses on the road to Chimay\u00f3, as families leave behind cars, push strollers and allow time for older hikers. Throngs of visitors often wait hours for a turn to file into the Santuario de Chimay\u00f3 to commemorate the crucifixion.",
      "It's just one of hundreds of adobe churches anchoring a uniquely New Mexican way of life for their communities. Many are at risk of crumbling into the ground in disrepair as congregations and traditions fade.",
      "Pilgrims from nearby towns set out for Chimay\u00f3 in the predawn hours. Some have walked 20 miles (32 kilometers) from Santa Fe, while others traveled for days from Albuquerque and elsewhere.",
      "Vendors sell religious trinkets, coffee and treats. State transportation workers, law enforcement agencies and other volunteers are stationed along the roadway to ensure safety from oncoming traffic, the outdoor elements and exhaustion.",
      "Pilgrims traverse an arid landscape speckled with juniper and pi\u00f1on trees and cholla cactus that finally give way to lush cottonwood trees and green pastures on the final descent into Chimay\u00f3.",
      "The magnitude of the religious pilgrimage has few if any rivals in the U.S. Many participants say their thoughts dwell not only on Jesus Christ but on the suffering of family, friends and neighbors with prayers for relief.",

      "U.S. officials say a new intelligence assessment found no coordination between the Tren de Aragua gang and the Venezuelan government",
      "WASHINGTON -- A new U.S. intelligence assessment found no coordination between Tren de Aragua and the Venezuelan government, contradicting statements that Trump administration officials have made to justify their invocation of the Alien Enemies Act and deporting Venezuelan migrants, according to U.S. officials.",
      "The classified assessment from the National Intelligence Council, released this month, is more comprehensive and authoritative than an earlier intelligence product released Feb. 26 and reported last month by The New York Times, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the assessment. They were not authorized to address the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The new assessment draws input from the 18 agencies that comprise the intelligence community. It repeatedly stated that Tren de Aragua, a gang that originated in a prison in Venezuela, is not coordinated with or supported by the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, or senior officials in the Venezuelan government. While the assessment found minimal contact between some members of the gang and low-level members of the Venezuelan government, there was a consensus that there was no coordination or directive role between gang and government.",
      "The assessment provided support and extensive sourcing for those assertions, according to the officials. Of the 18 organizations that make up the U.S. government\u2019s intelligence community, only one \u2014 the FBI \u2014 did not agree with the findings.",
      "It is not uncommon for intelligence agencies to differ in their assessments on matters of great public interest. But the latest assessment was significant for its near unanimity.",
      "Several years ago, under former Director Christopher Wray, the FBI assessed that the COVID-19 pandemic most likely originated from a lab leak, though that was hardly the uniform consensus. The position got recent support from a CIA assessment declassified in January.",
      "The White House and the office of Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday night.",
      "The intelligence assessment's findings come as the Supreme Court last week ruled that the Trump administration can use the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law, to deport Venezuelan migrants \u2014 but that the migrants must get court hearings before they\u2019re taken from the United States.",
      "Tren de Aragua has been linked to a series of kidnappings, extortion and other crimes throughout the Western Hemisphere. Those activities are tied to a mass exodus of millions of Venezuelans as their country's economy unraveled over the past decade.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act was created to give the president wide powers to imprison and deport noncitizens in time of war. Until now, it has been used just three times, most recently eight decades ago during World War II to justify the detention of Japanese-American civilians.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed legal challenges to the Trump administration's use of the law, contends that Trump does not have the authority to use the Alien Enemies Act against a criminal gang rather than a recognized state.",
      "President Donald Trump invoked the act in March, declaring in a proclamation that Tren de Aragua \u201cis closely aligned with, and indeed has infiltrated, the Maduro regime, including its military and law enforcement apparatus.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi repeated that assertion Monday night in an interview on Fox News Channel. Bondi defended the invocation of the wartime law and called Tren de Aragua \u201ca foreign arm of the Venezuelan government.\"",
      "\u201cThey are organized. They have a command structure. And they have invaded our country,\u201d she said.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration used the Alien Enemies Act to fly more than 130 men accused of being members of the gang to El Salvador, where the U.S. has paid for the men to be held in a notorious prison. The Venezuelans deported under the act received no opportunity to challenge the orders, and attorneys for many of the men have said there is no evidence they are gang members.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the gang has become an invading force and designated it, along with seven other crime groups, as \u201cforeign terrorist organizations.\u201d",
      "The latest intelligence assessment was first reported Thursday by The Washington Post.",

      "An Alaska Native man who maintained his innocence in the 1997 killing of a white teenager has agreed to an $11.5 million settlement with the city of Fairbanks",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- An Alaska Native man who maintained his innocence in the 1997 killing of a white teenager has agreed to an $11.5 million settlement with the city of Fairbanks after alleging police acted with a racial bias in a case in which he and three other Indigenous men spent nearly two decades in prison.",
      "Marvin Roberts is the last of the so-called Fairbanks Four to reach a settlement with the city after their murder convictions were vacated in 2015. While the agreement in his long-running civil lawsuit against the city and police officers was announced in late March, the parties on Wednesday formally asked a judge to dismiss Roberts' case, citing the settlement.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any amount of money will be enough to justify what I endured as an innocent man in prison,\" Roberts said in a recent statement. \"This settlement, however, gives me freedom with my life, and most importantly, more time with my daughter and my parents, who supported me throughout this nightmare.\u201d",
      "Fairbanks city attorney Tom Chard confirmed the city and its insurance carriers had agreed to an $11.5 million settlement. Terms of the agreement set out a schedule for release of funds, with the final payment due by Oct. 1, 2026. The agreement stipulates that the settlement \u201cshall not be construed as an admission of liability or responsibility\u201d by the defendants.",
      "Nick Brustin, a member of Roberts\u2019 legal team with Neufeld Scheck Brustin Hoffmann & Freudenberger, LLP, a New York-based civil rights firm, in a statement called the agreement a \u201cvindication of Marvin Roberts\u2019 innocence, which he has maintained with extraordinary dignity for almost three decades.\u201d",
      "The agreement comes nearly 1 1/2 years after the other three men, George Frese, Eugene Vent and Kevin Pease, agreed to a settlement in which they each were to receive $1.59 million from the city\u2019s insurer. The city in that case said the settlement was \"not an admission of liability or fault of any kind.\u201d",
      "Alaska Native leaders long advocated for the men's release, saying the convictions were racially motivated. Pease is Native American; Frese, Vent and Roberts are Athabascan Alaska Natives. Roberts was the only one of the four who was on parole at the time the convictions were thrown out.",
      "A 2015 settlement in a civil case brought by the men that led to the convictions being thrown out followed a weeks-long hearing reexamining the case in detail and raised the possibility that others had killed 15-year-old John Hartman. While the four men each maintained their innocence, the Alaska Department of Law said the settlement was not an exoneration.",
      "The men would argue the settlement that led to their release \u2014 in which they agreed not to sue \u2014 was not legally binding because they were coerced. An appeals court panel ruled in their favor.",
      "Teal Soden, a spokesperson for the Fairbanks police department, said the agency lists Hartman's killing as an \u201copen/active\u201d case.",

It also describes the letter as an effort to limit academic freedom and to dictate what students can be taught.",
      "But during a hearing Thursday, Deputy Associate Attorney General Abishek Kambli argued the teachers\u2019 union lacks standing to sue because the guidance is aimed at schools, not teachers. And educators who are \u201cself-censoring\u201d due to misunderstanding the letter aren\u2019t being harmed, he said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t manufacture harm simply by inflicting harm on yourself,\u201d he said.",
      "Kambli also suggested a temporary halt to enforcement was unnecessary because there is a lengthy, multi-step process to determine whether a school should lose funding, with ample opportunity to challenge findings. But Judge Landya McCafferty read passages from the Education Department press release announcing the recent cancellation of grants and contracts to Columbia University.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t describe any sort of process, it says immediate,\u201d she said.",
      "The directive does not carry the force of law but threatens to use civil rights enforcement to rid schools of DEI practices. Schools that continue such practices \u201cin violation of federal law\u201d can face Justice Department litigation and a termination of federal grants and contracts, the department has warned.",
      "Sarah Hinger, an attorney for the ACLU, pushed back against Kambli\u2019s claim that the letter was not a final action that can be challenged in court but rather an explanation of the department\u2019s enforcement priorities.",
      "\u201cIt requires. It orders. It dictates,\u201d she said. \u201cThe chill from that is happening now, and plaintiffs are not required to wait until they\u2019re hauled into court to challenge an unconstitutional law.\u201d",
      "Education officials in some Democratic-led states have indicated they will not comply with the order to submit certification of their schools\u2019 compliance. Hinger told reporters after the hearing that in addition to fear, educators have also expressed bravery.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing folks across the education community stand up and assert their rights and really being brave in indicating how contrary this \u2018Dear Colleague\u2019 letter is to sound educational practices from K-12 through higher education,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "For years, President Donald Trump has complained that colleges and universities are \u201cindoctrinating\u201d their students with \u201cradical left\u201d ideas and has said they should lose their tax-exempt status",
      "For more than a century, the majority of colleges and universities have not paid most taxes. The Revenue Act of 1909 excused nonprofits operating \u201cexclusively for religious, charitable, or educational purposes\u201d in order to continue acting in the public interest.",
      "President Donald Trump is looking to challenge that designation, complaining that colleges and universities are \u201cindoctrinating\u201d their students with \u201cradical left\u201d ideas, rather than educating them. And he has decided to start with the 388-year-old Harvard University, one of the world's most prestigious institutions of learning and the first college founded in the American colonies.",
      "On Tuesday, he targeted Harvard University in a post on his social media site, questioning whether it should remain tax-exempt \u201cif it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting \u201cSickness?\u201d Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!\u201d",
      "Tax-exempt status, which is decided by the Internal Revenue Service, means that these institutions do not pay certain kinds of taxes and that their donors receive a tax deduction when they make gifts. The rules they have to follow to maintain that status are set out in the tax code. We spoke with attorneys who specialize in nonprofit law and freedom of speech to try to answer questions about this challenge.",
      "In general, no. Colleges and universities have broad leeway to design the education they provide.",
      "Genevieve Lakier, a First Amendment scholar at the University of Chicago Law School, said the U.S. Supreme Court has laid out four essential freedoms for colleges and universities \u2014 what to teach, how to teach it, who their students are and who their professors are.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the irreducible core of academic freedom and it is constitutionally protected in this country,\u201d she said, adding the government cannot threaten funding cuts or revoking a school's tax status as punishment for its views or what the school teaches.",
      "The First Amendment also protects the rights of other nonprofits to pursue their charitable missions under freedom of assembly, Lakier said, even if those missions are odious or the government does not like them.",
      "No, he is not supposed to, according to two nonprofit tax attorneys who wrote about a previous call from Trump to revoke the nonprofit status of colleges and universities.",
      "In 1998, Congress passed a law that forbade federal officials from telling the IRS to investigate any taxpayer in an effort to increase trust in tax enforcement.",
      "The attorneys, Ellen Aprill and Samuel Brunson, also pointed to legislation that forbade the IRS \u201cfrom targeting individuals and organizations for ideological reasons,\u201d after a controversy over how it treated Tea Party groups in 2013.",
      "The IRS recognizes multiple reasons for a nonprofit to to be exempt from paying many kinds of taxes, including pursuing charitable, religious or educational missions among many other examples. The statute specifically names sports competitions, preventing cruelty to children or animals and defending human or civil rights as exempt purposes.",
      "Nonprofits can lose their tax-exempt status for things like improperly paying its directors, endorsing a political candidate or operating a business unrelated to its charitable mission.",
      "In short, tax attorneys say nonprofits must operate \u201cexclusively for charitable purposes,\u201d which is a different standard than what the president referred to as, \u201cacting in the public interest.\u201d",
      "Phil Hackney, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh, said, \u201cLong history and precedent suggest that Harvard and institutions of higher education are operating for educational purposes, which are considered charitable,\" under the tax code.",
      "He said it would be exceedingly difficult to make a case that a college or university was not operating for charitable purposes under current law. However, Edward McCaffery, who teaches tax policy at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, warned there is precedent for the IRS revoking the tax-exempt status of colleges that the government could lean on.",
      "\u201cI think to dismiss it out of hand as over-the-top bluster and that the administration has no power to unilaterally pursue it, I think that\u2019s naive,\" McCaffery said. \"This could happen.\u201d",
      "Yes. In 1983, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision that the IRS could deny tax-exempt status to Bob Jones University, a private Christian university that banned interracial dating and marriage on campus, and Goldsboro Christian Schools, which employed racially discriminatory admissions policies.",
      "The court found the IRS had some discretion to determine whether an organization seeking tax-exempt status met standards of \u201ccharity,\u201d meaning that it \u201cmust serve a public purpose and not be contrary to established public policy.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, McCaffery said, \u201cThe ability of the IRS just to come in and deny tax exemption, it better be a very clear, long-standing, deeply held public policy, and not political preferences for certain kinds of positions, attitudes and voting patterns.\u201d",
      "Usually, the IRS would open an audit, where it gathers evidence that a nonprofit is not operating exclusively for charitable purposes.",
      "\u201cThe IRS would have to send to Harvard a proposed revocation of its status,\u201d Hackney said. \u201cAt that point, Harvard would have many different means to talk with the IRS about why they believed they were within the law,\u201d including suing.",
      "However, Hackney said the U.S. Department of Treasury could implement new regulations, for example, stating that operating a diversity, equity and inclusion program is not consistent with charitable purposes. Such a change would usually take years to make and would run counter to decades of precedent, Hackney said.",
      "\u201cI am skeptical this effort will be successful,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it were, this would be the most dramatic change of charitable law in my lifetime and I would say in the history of our charitable law.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration\u2019s claim that it can't do anything to free Kilmar Abrego Garcia from an El Salvador prison and return him to the U.S. \u201cshould be shocking,\u201d a federal appeals court said Thursday in a scathing order.",
      "A three-judge panel from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously refused to suspend a judge's decision to order sworn testimony by Trump administration officials to determine if they complied with her instruction to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, wrote that he and his two colleagues \u201ccling to the hope that it is not na\u00efve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time,\u201d Wilkinson wrote.",
      "The seven-page order amounts to an extraordinary condemnation of the administration\u2019s position in Abrego Garcia\u2019s case and also an ominous warning of the dangers of an escalating conflict between the judiciary and executive branches the court said threatens to \u201cdiminish both.\u201d It says the judiciary will be hurt by the \u201cconstant intimations of its illegitimacy\u201d while the executive branch \u201cwill lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately comment on the decision. In a brief accompanying their appeal, government lawyers argued that courts do not have the authority to \u201cpress-gang the President or his agents into taking any particular act of diplomacy.\u201d",
      "\u201cYet here, a single district court has inserted itself into the foreign policy of the United States and has tried to dictate it from the bench,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The panel said Republican President Donald Trump's government is \u201casserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order.\u201d",
      "\u201cFurther, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear,\u201d Wilkinson wrote.",
      "Earlier this month, the Supreme Court said the Trump administration must work to bring back Abrego Garcia. An earlier order by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis \u201cproperly requires the Government to \u2018facilitate\u2019 Abrego Garcia\u2019s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador,\u201d the high court said in an unsigned order with no noted dissents.",
      "The Justice Department appealed after Xinis on Tuesday ordered sworn testimony by at least four officials who work for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department.",
      "The 4th Circuit panel denied the government's request for a stay of Xinis' order while they appeal.",
      "\u201cThe relief the government is requesting is both extraordinary and premature,\" the opinion says. \"While we fully respect the Executive\u2019s robust assertion of its Article II powers, we shall not micromanage the efforts of a fine district judge attempting to implement the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision.\u201d",
      "Wilkinson, the opinion's author, was regarded as a contender for the Supreme Court seat that was ultimately filled by Chief Justice John Roberts in 2005. Wilkinson\u2019s conservative pedigree may complicate White House efforts to credibly assail him as a left-leaning jurist bent on thwarting the Trump administration\u2019s agenda for political purposes, a fallback line of attack when judicial decisions run counter to the president\u2019s wishes.",
      "Joining Wilkinson in the ruling were judges Stephanie Thacker, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama, and Robert Bruce King, who was nominated by Democratic President Bill Clinton.",
      "White House officials claim they lack the authority to bring back the Salvadoran national from his native country. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele also said Monday that he would not return Abrego Garcia, likening it to smuggling \u201ca terrorist into the United States.\u201d",
      "While initially acknowledging Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported, the administration has dug in its heels in recent days, describing him as a \u201cterrorist\u201d even though he was never criminally charged in the U.S.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said Wednesday that \u201che is not coming back to our country.\u201d",
      "Administration officials have conceded that Abrego Garcia shouldn't have been sent to El Salvador, but they have insisted that he was a member of the MS-13 gang. Abrego Garcia's lawyers say there is no evidence linking him to MS-13 or any other gang.",
      "The appeals court panel concluded that Abrego Garcia deserves due process, even if the government can connect him to a gang.",
      "\u201cIf the government is confident of its position, it should be assured that position will prevail in proceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order,\u201d the opinion says.",
      "Xinis also was skeptical of assertions by White House officials and Bukele that they were unable to bring back Abrego Garcia. She described their statements as \u201ctwo very misguided ships passing in the night.\u201d",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's Supreme Court decided last week that ballots from two categories should have been left out of the tally of an unresolved November election for a seat on the court because state laws otherwise makes the voters ineligible.",
      "But there's still legal friction about the number of ballots that state courts say must be scrutinized by election officials tasked with removing them from the count and giving voters the chance to provide additional information so their votes can remain.",
      "The universe of potential ballots is critical since Democratic Associate Justice Allison Riggs leads Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin by just 734 votes from more than 5.5 million ballots cast in what is the nation\u2019s last undecided race from the 2024 general election.",
      "Griffin hopes enough ballots that he challenged are removed to flip the result. Meanwhile, Riggs and her allies have asked federal judges to stop the State Board of Elections from starting its ballot review while they argue U.S. law prevents any of these ballots from being removed.",
      "The State Board of Elections, in a court filing this week, said that up to 1,675 ballots that were formally challenged by Griffin will be subject to the \"cure\u201d process ordered by state appeals courts. But Griffin's attorneys wrote the next day that his formal protests required thousands of additional ballots to be identified by the board and potentially removed. And they accused the board of carrying out an order of the state Court of Appeals too narrowly.",
      "\u201cThe State Board has announced its intent to defy this Court\u2019s mandate,\u201d Griffin lawyer Craig Schauer wrote Wednesday in asking the Court of Appeals to intervene.",
      "A majority on the state Supreme Court let stand parts of an April 4 Court of Appeals decision that ballots shouldn't be counted if they were cast by overseas voters who have never lived in the U.S. but whose parents were declared North Carolina residents. Election officials were told to \u201cidentify the votes from \u2018Never Residents\u2019 and remove them from the final count.\u201d",
      "The other disallowed category covers military or overseas voters who did not provide copies of photo identification or an ID exception form with their absentee ballots. Judges decided state law required that they provide IDs like other voters. Election officials were told to identify these voters and notify them that they could turn in an ID copy or exception form within 30 days for their vote to count.",
      "An attorney for the State Board of Elections wrote Tuesday that only up to 1,409 voters in just one county would be subject to the ID curing process because only Griffin's protest in Guilford County was complete by the election protest deadline.",
      "But Griffin's lawyers said he filed ID protests in five more counties before the deadline while still awaiting lists of such voters. Three more counties later provided information that raised the number of potential challenges to over 5,500. Schauer wrote that the Court of Appeals made it plain that ballots from all six counties should be subject to the review. Unofficial results show Riggs ahead in all six counties.",
      "The state board also said Griffin's residency protests would only affect up to 266 people in 53 counties. Griffin's brief said the order should apply to voters from all 100 counties. The board also plans to give any voters inaccurately identified as living overseas the chance to keep their ballot in the count.",
      "Riggs, the state Democratic Party and other groups and voters contend that Riggs is the winner, and that federal laws and the U.S. Constitution prevent state courts from changing voting rules after an election so that ballots cast properly can be removed.",
      "Earlier this week, U.S. District Judge Richard Myers refused their injunction requests to halt the board's vote-curing process while they argue those points, but he barred the state board from certifying results or declaring a winner in the meantime. Riggs and others appealed Myers' ruling to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "\u201cThis Court must intervene to prevent a retroactive application of a state court ruling that infringes North Carolina voters\u2019 fundamental rights,\u201d Riggs attorney Sam Hartzell wrote the 4th Circuit late Wednesday.",

      "After leaving the military, Meyer remained in the spotlight. In 2016 he married former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's daughter, Bristol, and they had two children.",

      "The suspect was taken into custody several hours after the shooting. He was remained in jail on Thursday on a charge of aggravated assault mass shooting.",
      "Martinez said that they believe there was \u201ca dispute taking place,\u201d but they do not yet know what led to the shooting.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have that information as to the why, the motivation,\u201d Martinez said.",
      "Martinez said they are looking into \u201chow deep\u201d the culpability is of the student who opened the door.",
      "Four male students were shot and were taken to hospitals, according to officials. Martinez said all of those injured are all expected to make a full recovery.",
      "The shooting drew a large number of police and other law enforcement agents to the roughly 1,000-student campus.",
      "Martinez said that the suspect parked his vehicle at the school just before 1 p.m.",
      "An arrest warrant said that after the suspect was let into the building, he walked down a hallway until he spotted a group of students. The arrest warrant says he then displayed a firearm and began firing \u201cindiscriminately\u201d before approaching a student who was not able to run and walking toward that student and appearing to take a point-blank shot.",
      "The suspect\u2019s bond was set at $600,000. Jail records did not list an attorney for him.",
      "At the same school last April, one student shot another in the leg.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- A Wisconsin Elections Commission discussion of uncounted ballots in Madison devolved into a shouting match Thursday, with the Democratic chair threatening to kick a Republican commissioner out of the meeting.",
      "The commission is investigating former Madison City Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl after she failed to count 200 absentee ballots in the November election and didn't tell the commission about the oversight until after election results were certified. Witzel-Behl resigned this week.",
      "Commission Chair Ann Jacobs said at a Thursday meeting that she and Commissioner Don Millis had deposed Witzel-Behl as well as other city workers and planned to continue questioning additional workers.",
      "Republican Commissioner Bob Spindell said that he was fine with the Madison investigation, but the commission needs to pay more attention to what he said were even more serious problems with election administration in Milwaukee.",
      "As he attempted to detail his concerns, Jacobs began screaming at him that how elections are run in Milwaukee wasn't on the agenda. She ordered him to stop talking or she would kick him out.",
      "\u201cI am not going to let you keep going, Bob,\u201d she said, jabbing her finger at him. \u201cI'm going to talk over you until you stop. You must stop. You are out of order, and I will eject you from this meeting if you disobey again.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou're going to eject me from the meeting? You're going to try and muzzle me?\u201d Spindell responded.",
      "\u201cDo you understand the words I am saying?\u201d Jacobs said.",
      "\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Spindell said.",
      "\u201cThey are simple. You are out of order. The city of Milwaukee is not on this agenda. You don't get to hijack the agenda,\" Jacobs said.",
      "They continued to shout over each other until Spindell gave up. \u201cI said what I needed to say. Thank you,\" he said. Jacobs ultimately allowed Spindell to remain in the meeting.",
      "The commission is evenly divided with three Republican commissioners and three Democrats. Spindell was one of 10 Republicans who signed certificates in 2020 falsely stating that Donald Trump had won Wisconsin. Democrat Joe Biden actually won the state that year.",
      "He and Jacobs have been at odds for years, with Spindell often lodging complaints and making motions that Jacobs rules out of order. Much like Thursday's exchange, their interactions have often been marked by Jacobs demanding that he stop talking.",
      "The commission opened an investigation into Witzel-Behl in early January after learning that she had failed to count 193 absentee ballots and didn't inform the commission until Dec. 18, more than two weeks after election results were certified.",
      "The uncounted ballots didn't affect the outcome of any races, but commissioners appeared stunned at the oversight. Four Madison voters whose ballots went uncounted have filed claims for $175,000 each from the city and Dane County, the first step toward a lawsuit. It was another blunder for Witzel-Behl after she announced in September that her office erroneously sent out up to 2,000 duplicate absentee ballots.",
      "Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway suspended Witzel-Behl in March and launched an internal investigation. Witzel-Behl resigned on Monday. The city has yet to release the findings from its internal probe.",
      "It wasn't clear what Milwaukee voting problems Spindell was referring to on Thursday since Jacobs drowned him out. But he could be heard referencing a report about how some polling stations in Milwaukee ran out of ballots because of higher than anticipated turnout in the state's hotly contested Supreme Court election.",

      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s mansion was the target of an arson attack last weekend, but the attacker's motives are unclear",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A year ago, Carole Zawatsky was invited by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to a Passover Seder, held in the same room at the governor\u2019s official residence that was devastated by an arsonist just hours after Shapiro hosted this year\u2019s Jewish holiday feast.",
      "Now, as she looks at photos of the destruction, Zawatsky can envision where she had been seated and how deadly the attack could have been.",
      "Like many others, Zawatsky is cautiously awaiting word from investigators about the motivations of the attacker, which are clouded by hints of erratic behavior as well as statements from his past.",
      "Still, the attack hit the Jewish community hard in a state where such pain is achingly familiar. It targeted Pennsylvania\u2019s religiously observant Jewish governor in the very place where just hours before he had hosted one of the central rituals of the Jewish calendar.",
      "Zawatsky heads a Pittsburgh organization formed to counter antisemitism and memorialize the victims of another Pennsylvania assault \u2013 the murders of 11 worshippers from three congregations at the Tree of Life synagogue more than six years ago, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.",
      "\u201cSeeing those images is deeply traumatic,\u201d said Zawatsky, CEO of The Tree of Life, the group established in the wake of the Oct. 27, 2018 killings. \u201cIt\u2019s not too much to ask that we all live in a country where we celebrate our faith without fear.\u201d",
      "The synagogue shooting trial revealed that the gunman, who was convicted and sentenced to death, had long been steeped in antisemitism and methodically carried out the attack.",
      "In the Harrisburg case, things are less clear. Investigators have released only fragments of what Balmer told them. His relatives say he has struggled with mental illness, and his lawyers suggested Wednesday that will be central to their defense.",
      "\u201cWe have no definitive information about this person\u2019s motive,\" Zawatsky said. \"We do know that there was certainly hate involved.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania State Police said 38-year-old Cody Balmer confessed to the attack, harbored hatred for the governor and said he planned to beat Shapiro with a hammer.",
      "\u201cBALMER identified himself by name and related that Governor Josh SHAPIRO needs to know that he \u2018...will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people,\u2019\u201d police wrote as part of applications for search warrants. Exactly who and what that meant were unclear in the documents.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York on Thursday called on the Justice Department to determine whether the attack qualifies as a federal hate crime.",
      "Audrey Glickman, a survivor of the 2018 attack and a member of Tree of Life Congregation, said she admired Shapiro\u2019s composure, just hours after the attack, and his emphatic denunciaton of hatred regardless of motivation.",
      "\u201cIt takes a while to realize you\u2019ve been attacked and what to make of it,\u201d Glickman said. She admired \u201chow he stood up right away and spoke strongly about it.\u201d",
      "Shapiro responded to the scene of the 2018 Pittsburgh attack as Pennsylvania\u2019s then-attorney general. As governor, he took part in the 2024 groundbreaking for a new building to replace the synagogue, including a memorial, programming and other exhibits aimed to counter antisemitism.",
      "About 200 people participated in a somber march Wednesday night in Harrisburg. They walked from the parking lot of a synagogue to the governor's residence, where they held a multifaith prayer vigil across the street.",
      "Several marchers connected the attack to the overheated political climate.",
      "\u201cTo deny it is like putting your head in the sand,\u201d said retired Presbyterian minister Don Potter, 75, of Dillsburg, who said the images of the building\u2019s interior with fire damage \u201cmade me sick.\u201d",
      "Enid Wassner, a retired child care worker from Hershey, said the fact that the firebombing occurring during Passover and targeted Shapiro and his family was \u201cextremely worrying.\u201d She noted that Jewish institutions and buildings in Harrisburg have had to increase security.",
      "\u201cGradually things have been getting more worrisome, for me personally and the entire Jewish community.\"",
      "Police said in court affidavits that in an interview with detectives Balmer \u201cadmitted to harboring hatred towards\u201d Shapiro and referred to the Palestinian people in a 911 call attributed to him that was placed shortly after the break-in.",
      "Balmer\u2019s mother and brother have said he suffered from bipolar disorder and would not consistently take medication. His brother, Dan Balmer, said Cody Balmer twice in recent years spent time in a psychiatric hospital in Harrisburg. During a court hearing on Monday, Balmer denied any history of mental illness.",
      "Dan Balmer told the AP on Tuesday that Cody Balmer \u201chad these theories that were going on in his head\u201d and became angry when family members would tell him his views didn't reflect reality.",
      "\u201cThe allegations, if true, demonstrate the devastating consequences of severe mental illness,\u201d Mary Klatt, the chief public defender in Dauphin County, whose office is representing Balmer, said Wednesday. She said his preliminary hearing would be delayed to determine whether Balmer is mentally competent to stand trial.",
      "Shapiro declined to talk about the attacker's motive on Wednesday, saying prosecutors will ultimately determine what drove him.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to answer that,\u201d he said.",
      "The governor has publicly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government and the nature of Israel\u2019s military action in Gaza, but also has backed Israel\u2019s right to defend itself from Hamas.",
      "Hank Butler, executive director of the Pennsylvania Jewish Coalition, said Shapiro\u2019s focus has been Pennsylvania and not the Palestinian people.",
      "\u201cTo say that our governor wishes the worst on the Palestinian people is not welcomed here,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt is not justified, absolutely not justified -- no attack is justified.\u201d",
      "Shapiro has won statewide races three times in a crucial battleground state. He was a finalist to be Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in last year's presidential campaign and is considered a potential 2028 Democratic candidate for president.",
      "The attack once again puts his identity front and center. When Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Shapiro, Republicans tried to cast the pick as a snub to Jewish voters.",
      "Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, an umbrella group for more than 800 Reform congregations in North America, connected the attack to Shapiro's identity.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s also someone who is a strong supporter of Israel,\u201d Jacobs said of Shapiro. \"Are those things that put your life at risk in the 21st century?\u201d",
      "Zawatsky, the Tree of Life CEO, noted that in the Passover ritual, Jews are instructed not just to recite the story of their ancient forebears\u2019 liberation from slavery but to envision themselves as having experienced it \u2013 something that feels especially poignant now. Whether law enforcement officials ultimately settle on a definitive conclusion about what motivated last weekend's attack, she and others already know what living in fear feels like.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad to think we pass along the inherited trauma of the fear of antisemitism, but never did I think we would be a generation that would have the lived experience of this kind of violent antisemitism,\u201d she said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Scores more people were undergoing screening Thursday as potential jurors for Harvey Weinstein's New York rape retrial.",
      "The panel started taking shape Wednesday, when five women and four men were picked for the redo of the landmark #MeToo-era trial. They were chosen after several stages of screening and questioning, a multistep process that's common for long felony trials in Manhattan. Weinstein's retrial is expected to run at least through the end of May.",
      "A new group of over 80 prospective jurors was brought into court Thursday for the first stage of selection: a show-of-hands response to whether they had schedule conflicts or felt they couldn't be fair and impartial because of the nature of the case.",

      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty. He says all his sexual experiences have been consensual.",

      "What has been banned?",
      "Pork, beef, lamb, mutton, goat, venison and any other products made from these meats - such as sausages - from the EU have been banned. It also applies to pet food.",
      "In addition, milk and dairy products - like butter, cheese and yoghurt - from the EU have also been prohibited.",

      "Any products of animal origin, like meat and dairy, could be contaminated with foot and mouth disease.",

      "Foot and mouth disease is harmless to humans and there are no cases in the UK -  but it is highly contagious for animals.",
      "It affects cattle, sheep, pigs and, according to the government, \"other cloven-hoofed animals such as wild boar, deer, llamas and alpacas\".",
      "Animals that catch it typically come down with a high temperature before developing blisters, usually around the mouth or feet. It can make animals lame and, for the very young, result in fatalities.",
      "How long will the ban last?",
      "The Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs introduced the measure on Saturday, 12 April and did not give an end date.",
      "The BBC understands the ban will stay in place until the government believes there is no significant risk from travellers bringing banned meat and dairy into Great Britain.",

      "Anyone travelling should follow the rules.",
      "The government says items could be seized and destroyed at the border and, in serious cases, offenders could be fined up to \u00a35,000 in England.",

      "No, travellers are not normally allowed to bring meat and milk products into the EU from the UK for personal use.",

      "A race to lower prices could help households who are still struggling with the cost of living at a time when bills, such as energy and water, are increasing.",
      "\"We're in the strongest position we've ever been [on price competition] and we intend to stay there,\" said Sainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts.",

      "Sainsbury's predicts underlying retail profit will tick down by around \u00a336m over the year.",
      "This, said Bernstein analyst William Woods, gives the supermarket \"wiggle room\" to fight with Tesco and Asda if needed.",
      "While supermarkets are always competing with each other over price, the threat of a more intensive clash arose in March when Mr Leighton said Asda would take a hit to its profits in order to reduce prices, rebuild market share and win back customers.",
      "At the time, the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury's saw their share prices plunge on speculation they would be forced to fund millions of pounds worth in price cuts to compete with Asda.",
      "Mr Leighton was Asda's chief executive between 1996 and 2001 and returned last year as executive chairman to turn the business around after a period of falling sales and under-investment.",

      "Mr Roberts declined to comment on what effect US President Donald Trump's tariffs could have on the business, which also owns Argos and the Habitat brand.",
      "There has been speculation that China, faced with high tariffs on selling goods to the US, might re-route products to other countries and sell them cheaply to offload them.",
      "Mr Roberts said that Sainsbury's was \"watching developments carefully\".",
      "While revenue at Sainsbury's grew strongly over the 12 months to 1 March, sales continued to fall at Argos although it said that the situation improved as it boosted traffic to the brand's website.",
      "The supermarket also reported an 8.9% drop in fuel sales to \u00a34.7bn. It blamed \"reduced demand\" as well as the lower cost of petrol and diesel due to \"falling commodity prices in a highly competitive market\".",
      "Official data released on Wednesday showed that the falling cost of motor fuel helped drive down the overall rate of inflation.",
      "Inflation eased by more than expected to 2.6% in the year to March, from 2.8% in February."

    "story": [
      "When wedding dress designer Catherine Deane saw her company's Instagram account get hacked, she says it was \"devastating\".",
      "\"It felt like the rug had been pulled from under us. Instagram is our primary social platform, and we've invested the most amount of time and business resources into it.",
      "\"To keep the account current we post content every day. Suddenly all this work\u2026 it was just pulled.\"",
      "Ms Deane's UK-based business, which is named after her, sells wedding dresses online, with her biggest market being the US.",
      "On Instagram it now has 59,000 followers, but a few years ago the firm lost control of the account after a member of its social media team received a message suggesting that the business had been selected to get blue-badge verification from Instagram, which is owned by Facebook's Meta.",
      "This was the stamp of authenticity that Ms Deane had long sought. \"We were obviously very excited about that,\" she says.",
      "So her employee opened a link to what turned out to be a fake Instagram verification form that requested log-in credentials. She filled it in, divulging the username and password, and shortly afterwards the account was taken over by hackers.",
      "What added to Ms Deane's anguish was that she says she had to fight with Meta to get her account back, which took four months.",
      "Initially she filled out the admin dispute form and sent it off, but heard nothing. Multiple emails followed but no action was taken.",
      "\"It's so incredibly frustrating when you're dealing with your account being hacked and there is no-one to talk to,\" she says. \"It's almost traumatising because there is no-one who understands and can help escalate it.\"",
      "Eventually an email came from Meta, telling her that the case was closed, even though she was still unable to access her page.",
      "In the end the matter was finally resolved for Ms Deane because someone in the firm had a contact at Facebook, and the team emailed that person daily for the four months.",
      "\"Finally, I think they just needed to get us off their backs and they reinstated the account,\" says Ms Deane.",
      "According to Jonas Borchgrevink, boss of US-based cyber security firm Hacked.com, Ms Deane is far from a unique case among people with business accounts on Instagram and Facebook.",
      "\"I would say that it is a massive problem,\" says Mr Borchgrevink. \"There are probably thousands every day that are losing their business pages.\"",
      "His company helps firms recover their Instagram and Facebook accounts, and he gets \"10 to 15 clients per week\". \"But those are just the ones that know about us and are able to pay the price, because these cases can take up to six months to sort.\"",
      "The BBC asked Meta to provide some numbers that would reveal the extent of the problem, and how it was tackling it, but it declined.",
      "However, it said in a statement, that \"we take the safety and security of our community seriously and encourage everyone to create a strong password, enable two factor authentication and to be suspicious of emails or messages asking for personal details.",
      "\"We also have a feature called Security Check-up to help people keep their Instagram and Facebook accounts secure.\"",
      "Hackers want to take over business social media accounts for a number of reasons. These including using the pages to sell fake products or place scam adverts, harvesting personal information, spreading malware, tricking people into sending money, or blackmailing the company in question to unblock the account.",
      "The final thing in that list happened last year to David Davila, who is part of the marketing team at Quantum Windows & Doors, a small, family-run business based in Washington state in the US.",
      "He got locked out of the firm's social Facebook account when he responded to what turned out to be a fake message purporting to be from Meta.",
      "Because his phone number was linked to the account, that also fell into the hands of the scammers and, soon after the lock-out, he got a WhatsApp message demanding $1,200 (\u00a3900) to unlock the account.",
      "Unable to find a helpline, he searched on Google, but the number he rang put him through to more scammers. That link has since been removed by Google.",
      "Thankfully, Mr Davila was able to get the Facebook account unlocked a few days later.",
      "Mr Borchgrevink believes that Meta is overwhelmed by the scale of the problem.",
      "\"It has implemented different security measures over the years and yet we still receive the same amount of clients, so I don't think there's been a lot of change there,\" he says.",
      "In fact, with scammers now utilising AI to make their messages seem even more believable, Mr Borchgrevink  thinks the situation could get a lot worse.",
      "He tells the BBC that scammers are behind many of these lock-outs and one of their preferred methods of fooling people is to masquerade as customer support agents.",
      "\"They pretend to be Meta Support and send the business an email saying that they have infringed some kind of copyright or broken terms and conditions in some way, and that they need to verify themselves.",
      "\"The messages have the Facebook logo and are very believable. But when you start to verify your business page, they ask for the password and redirect you to a fake Meta site to steal log-ins.\"",
      "He said that the fraudsters often target a personal Facebook page first, because all business accounts need to be linked to one.",
      "\"Your personal account will also have admin rights to your business account. The scammers go into your business account and transfer the admin rights to their own or to fake profiles.",
      "\"Then they go back to your personal account and disable it by posting inappropriate content like terror-related or pornography-related. That disables your account and makes it really hard to recover either that or your business account.\"",
      "The BBC has also learned of businesses losing access to their Facebook and Instagram accounts despite them not being hacked.",
      "One small business which is part of franchise, told the BBC that they lost access to their account when another franchisee gained a blue-tick verification. As a result of that their account was flagged as a clone.",
      "Meanwhile, others, such as digital marketer Chetha Senadeera, say that Meta has wrongly closed business accounts.",
      "Last autumn he realised that a Facebook page he managed for a mobile bank had gone missing. \"It had just disappeared,\" he says.",
      "\"There was no notification to me or any of the team members. It was just gone. It was like it had been kidnapped, almost.\"",
      "The page was a crucial gateway to customers across Europe for Lithuania bank MyTU.",
      "Mr Senadeera says that the customer support agents he spoke to at Meta, Facebook's owner, were baffled. He says they told him that they could see the page, but that it had been restricted, and that they couldn't unblock it.",
      "Six months later, and the page remains locked.",
      "Meta tells the BBC that the page had been removed for violating its scams policies, via a link on the page that was flagged by its systems as potentially harmful.",
      "Mr Senadeera disputes that the firm has ever posted any harmful or misleading content. He says that Meta needs to do more, and move more quickly, to help firms get their Facebook and Instagram pages back, whether they have been a victim of fraud or not.",

      "Shares in Nvidia plunged on Wednesday after the computer chip giant said it would be hit by $5.5bn (\u00a34.2bn) in costs due to the US government tightening its export rules to China.",
      "The firm, which has been at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, will require licences to export its H20 AI chip to China, which has been one of its most popular.",

      "But the fall may only be temporary as analysts say it's expected to spike from April as rising bills and higher business costs take hold.",
      "\"The only significant offset came from the price of clothes which rose strongly this month,\" said Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "The average price of petrol fell by 1.6p per litre between February and March to 137.5p per litre.",
      "The inflation decrease was also driven by a drop in recreation and culture prices, with toys, games, and hobbies falling particularly sharply.",
      "The fall in inflation means that, although prices continue to rise, the pace is slowing. Price rises have slowed from highs seen in recent years.",
      "Wages continue to outpace inflation with salary raises for public sector workers growing more than those in the private sector.",

      "How quickly are prices rising?",
      "In May, the inflation figure for April will likely be pushed to around 3% due to increases in gas prices, electricity prices, and water charges, said Michael Saunders, senior advisor at Oxford Economics.",
      "The former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting Monetary Policy Committee told Radio 4's Today Programme the effect of Trump's trade wars will also be felt in exports and investment in the UK.",
      "\"We may get a diversion of cheap exports which might have otherwise gone to the US, will start to come to Europe and the UK,\" he said.",
      "\"Perhaps not as high as the Bank of England had feared a few months ago, but the economy will be weaker, with exports and investment and consumer spending all hit and unemployment starting to rise\".",
      "He added that another side-effect of Trump's trade war is hitting global growth, which causes oil prices to fall, which will feed through to lower petrol prices here in the UK.",
      "'It's getting higher and higher'",
      "Sonja Skelton says the biggest cost for her business is staffing - and that's about to get higher with minimum wage increases.",
      "The recent increase in National Insurance has cost her over \u00a360,000.",

      "Interest rate cut",
      "As inflation comes down, it could put pressure on the Bank of England to cut its key interest rate, currently 4.5%.",
      "Vacancies at their lowest point in four years and economic pressure predicted from Donald Trump's tariffs may also encourage the Bank to cut when it meets next month.",

      "Petrol and toy prices have fallen, a relief for drivers and parents, while food prices are unchanged.",
      "However, this data is for last month, and analysts suggest it is the \"calm before a storm\".",
      "Exact predictions are difficult, but here are three key areas where inflation is expected to rise.",
      "1. April's bills and costs",
      "A host of household bills went up at the start of April, on top of continued rent rises.",
      "They included utilities such as domestic energy and water. Council tax also rose significantly for millions of people, and there were hikes for many on phone and broadband contracts, as well as the TV licence.",
      "For businesses, the rise in employer National Insurance contributions in April may have led them to immediately put up their prices.",
      "Some of these increased costs will feed into the next set of inflation data published in May. As a result, analysts think this will see the inflation rate quickly climb over 3% (remember the government and Bank of England's target is 2%).",
      "After that, there's significant uncertainty. Commentators suggest inflation may not stay as high, for as long, as previously thought, for reasons we'll come to next.",
      "2. The Donald Trump tariffs effect",
      "The rollercoaster ride of US tariff policy has dominated the headlines and airwaves in the last few weeks.",
      "The US president announced taxes on goods imported into the US from around the world, then rowed back or delayed many, but doubled down on Chinese imports.",
      "Some countries have hit back with tariffs of their own; others - such as the UK - are trying to negotiate.",
      "We are in relatively unknown territory in modern economics and the picture seems to change almost every day, so predictions have to be taken with a large dose of salt.",
      "In theory, when tariffs are announced, and retaliation comes, then higher taxes all round will make goods more expensive for consumers.",
      "But, particularly for the UK, things are far more nuanced. The 10% tariff on UK goods imported by the US is lower than feared, and retaliation looks unlikely.",
      "Indeed, there are heightened expectations of a UK-US trade deal, rather than a trade war.",
      "So, any price rises would be limited.",
      "China is facing massive 145% tariffs on all its goods bound for the US. If that puts up barriers to the US market, it may find other places to sell its - often cheaply manufactured - products, such as the UK.",
      "A so-called dumping of cheap Chinese products in the UK will increase price competition and could slow the rate of inflation.",
      "3. Performance of the UK economy",
      "Growth in the UK economy has been sluggish for some time, although the latest data was more positive than many had expected.",
      "But, again connected to the issue of tariffs, there are warnings that the improvement in UK economic growth could be short-lived with some even predicting a recession.",
      "That's not good news for the government, which has made economic growth its priority.",
      "Nor is it good news for workers, whose job security becomes less stable if businesses draw back on investment and start to cut costs.",
      "No job means less money to spend. That would bring down the inflation rate, but would be small mercy to anyone who is suddenly unemployed.",
      "Alternatively, the government's drive for growth could successfully propel the economy against these headwinds.",
      "And there is even greater pressure on policymakers at the Bank of England to help boost growth by cutting interest rates, lowering the cost of borrowing for loans and mortgages.",
      "Cutting interest rates usually adds to consumer demand, and risks raising prices and the rate of inflation further from its 2% target.",
      "So the Bank's rate-setters face a delicate balancing act for the rest of the year, starting at their next meeting in May, particularly because nobody is sure how much the tightrope is going to wobble.",

      "When that happens, Li, 58, will play a key role. He previously served as a deputy permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva and has held several key jobs in the commerce ministry.",
      "Speaking to Reuters, one expert said the change in jobs was \"very abrupt and potentially disruptive\" given the current trade tensions - adding that Wang also had experience negotiating with US since the first Trump administration.",
      "\"It might be that in the view of China's top leadership, given how tensions have continued escalating, they need someone else to break the impasse... and finally start negotiating,\" said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, a senior adviser to the Conference Board's China Centre.",
      "However, another analyst who spoke to Reuters suggested the move could just be a \"routine promotion\" that just happened to come at a particularly tense period in time.",
      "The US should 'stop whining'",
      "Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Sheng Laiyun, deputy commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) warned that US levies would put pressure on China's foreign trade and economy, but added that China's economy is resilient and should improve in the long term.",
      "\"We firmly oppose the US practice of tariff barriers and trade bullying,\" said Sheng.",
      "\"It violates the economic laws and the principles of the World Trade Organization, has a serious impact on the world economic order, and drags down the recovery of the world economy.\"",
      "In an editorial by state news outlet China Daily earlier this week, the outlet described the US's behaviour as \"capricious and destructive\", adding that it should \"stop whining about itself being a victim in global trade\".",
      "\"The US is not getting ripped off by anybody...rather... [it] has been taking a free ride on the globalisation train,\" the editorial went on to say.",
      "Promising growth - but will it last?",
      "Beijing's GDP figures for the first quarter have beaten analysts' expectations - which hovered around 5.1%.",
      "Growth in the world's second-largest economy was underscored by strong retail sales and promising factory output.",
      "But US tariffs on China soared only in recent weeks. Trump raised them to 145% early last week, and Beijing retaliated by raising levies on US goods to 125%.",
      "So some of the expansion could be down to factories rushing out shipments to beat Trump's tariffs - a concept called \"front loading\".",
      "Analysts say a surge in China's exports in March will be sharply reversed in the months ahead as tariffs take full effect.",
      "China's property downturn is also still dragging on growth. Property investment fell by almost 10% in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period last year.",
      "New home prices also were unchanged compared to the previous month - a sign that there are still too many empty homes, and not enough people buying them.",
      "Officials have said there is ample room for stimulus measures, and plenty of tools that they can use to bolster the economy and roll out more support measures.",
      "But it will be especially important for China to boost domestic demand and spending this year as Washington's tariffs hits Beijing's crucial export sector."

      "UK business and trade minister Sarah Jones welcomed Vance's comments and said talks to secure a deal with the US were ongoing, but declined to provide a timeline on their progress.",
      "\"Nobody wants tariffs. No one wants a tariff war. We want to secure a deal with the US,\" she added.",
      "The real question about positive comments by Vice-President JD Vance and Jones about a UK-US trade deal, is what they actually mean by the term \"deal\".",
      "Just after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to the White House in February, it was rather telling that the UK delegation referred to what was being negotiated as an \"economic deal\".",

      "But there is no general problem with this trading relationship. In fact, the UK buys more from the US than the other way around.",
      "The mood music from Washington is that this 10% tariff is not for negotiation with anyone. That is the baseline tariff that has been levied on nearly all of America's trading partners.",
      "Making an exception for one country would simply invite significant trade diversion.",
      "'Good chance' of US-UK trade deal, says Vance",
      "But the UK is in a different position than other nations.",
      "Most countries had faced higher tariffs - as illustrated on Donald Trump's big board - such as on electronics manufacturers in East Asia and they want to keep the levy at the 10% rate.",
      "The net result is that the UK may not have much to negotiate here, and yet is being treated very harshly, given there is no US trade deficit.",
      "Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about.",
      "Another issue is that all this is being done at the same time as the post-Brexit reset negotiations are being outlined ahead of the UK-EU summit next month.",
      "The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape.",
      "The US has taken an interest in this in the past. Could the US make it part of their negotiation?",
      "In addition, many US officials have mentioned a desire for allies to join it in containing China.",
      "The US might also try to force a choice on the UK here, or at least encourage action to keep out diverted Chinese goods.",
      "All this would fly in the face of the UK government's entire sell to the world that Britain could be the \"most connected economy in the world\" with strong links into European goods markets, US technology and the east Asia market, including China.",
      "There is a final factor here, which is very intriguing.",
      "Given last week's chaos in financial markets including for US government debt, it is now the case that the US needs these deals, especially the easy pickings with its closest allies.",
      "The UK has more leverage than it did a month ago. The PM may not want to use it but the US cannot afford to make the UK stall or walk away."

    "summary": "America is trying to create a chip industry through isolation and protectionism, when what allowed it to emerge in Asia is the opposite: collaboration.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "The US has \"dropped the ball\" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021.",
      "Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.",
      "He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality products in their American factories.",
      "So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale?",
      "Microchips: The secret sauce",
      "Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale.",
      "Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.",
      "It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades.",
      "Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",
      "With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US.",
      "The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.",
      "That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden \u2013 an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.",
      "Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas.",
      "TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island.",
      "But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions.",
      "\"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\"",
      "And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.",
      "Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?",
      "Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\".",
      "\"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\"",
      "The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.",
      "TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies.",
      "Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing.",
      "\"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\"",
      "One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India.",
      "\"Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US.",
      "\"That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.\"",
      "The global knock-on effect",
      "Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector.",
      "\"It's a wrench in the machine \u2013 a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\"",
      "The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US.",
      "Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small.",
      "\"China ultimately will want to win \u2013 it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot.",
      "\"If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.\"",
      "In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US \u2013 it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good.",
      "India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water \u2013 chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it.",
      "Bargaining chips",
      "Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector.",
      "Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying.",
      "Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm a very flexible person,\" adding that \"there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.\"",
      "Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips.",
      "\"I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,\" says Mr Einstein.",
      "\"I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here \u2013 TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie.\"",
      "But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale \u2013 it will take time.",
      "Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1drqeev36qo",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:15:59 GMT",
    "summary": "As the trade war continues to escalate, China has hit back at Trump by suspending exports of rare earth minerals.",
    "story": [
      "As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another.",
      "But slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate.",
      "China has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US.",
      "The move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals.",
      "This week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry.  But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war?",
      "What are rare earths and what are they used for?",
      "\"Rare earths\" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.",
      "Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.",
      "Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like Neodymium, Yttrium and Europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.",
      "For instance, Neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.",
      "Yttrium and Europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.",
      "\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.",
      "Rare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.",
      "What does China control?",
      "China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.",
      "The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.",
      "That means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.",
      "Both the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting.",
      "All rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.",
      "\"Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,\" says Mr Kruemmer.",
      "But China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.",
      "In a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: \"The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths\".",
      "\"Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,\" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.\"",
      "How has China restricted exports of these minerals?",
      "In response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as \"heavy\" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector.",
      "These are less common and are harder to process than \"light\" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.",
      "From 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.",
      "That is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of \"dual use products\".",
      "According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.",
      "How could this impact the US?",
      "A US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.",
      "This means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard.",
      "Heavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.",
      "A CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.",
      "It adds that this comes as China \"expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States\".",
      "\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,\" said Mr Kroemmer.",
      "And it's not only in the field of defence.",
      "US manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted.",
      "\"Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,\" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies.",
      "If such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require \"substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China\".",
      "And it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such  critical minerals.",
      "\"President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,\" said the order.",
      "\"Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience.\"",
      "China's precious metals the US can't do without",
      "What are 'rare earths' used for?",
      "Can't the US produce its own rare earths?",
      "The US has one operational rare earths mine, but it does not have the capacity to separate heavy rare earths and has to send its ore to China for processing.",
      "There used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths.",
      "But these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost.",
      "This is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China.",
      "Another place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland - which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements.",
      "Trump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it.",
      "These might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.",
      "\"The challenge the U.S. faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Whether they will still prioritise collaboration with America remains to be seen in the turbulent policy environment of this new administration.\""

      "Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in Guyana.",
      "Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company.",
      "For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana's key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana's fishing and sugar industries.",
      "The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of \"consequences\" if it were to use force against Guyana.",
      "But the planned high tariff showed Washington's ire, says Mr Bailey. \"I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana.",
      "\"The US is saying, 'if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country'. Trump is a very transactional president \u2013 and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression.\"",
      "The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments. The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015.",
      "Last year it exported $3.13bn (\u00a32.4bn) of crude oil to the US, according to United Nations figures.",
      "Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US. However, it is the price impact of Trump's global tariffs on what they import from the US that is of most concern.",
      "This is because the Caribbean's love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour.",
      "And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean.",
      "Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US.",
      "So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US.",
      "With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump's tariffs could be profound and keenly felt.",
      "In Antigua and Barbuda, interior designer Carissa Warner tells the BBC that 70% of her materials are imported from the US, and 20% from China.",
      "\"Some of my projects are on hold while we wait to see what happens,\" she explains. \"I am extremely worried from a business aspect but also just as a local consumer.",
      "\"I'm so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don't think people realise the impact it will have on us.\"",
      "Ms Warner believes one way Caribbean governments could ease the squeeze on their people is by lowering their own import duties, which are partially calculated using a percentage of an item's cost.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's Prime Minister Gaston Browne has dubbed global tariffs \"extremely worrisome\" and is urging citizens to \"buy smarter and buy local\".",
      "Trump's tariffs come as the Caribbean is already grappling with a confluence of harsh economic conditions from the cost of cleaning up after frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, to the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, says that the US has long enjoyed a trade surplus with most Caribbean countries.",
      "\"For decades, we have helped sustain American prosperity by collectively importing far more from the United States than we export,\" he says.",
      "\"The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets.\"",
      "As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: \"Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market.\"",
      "The Caribbean islands' small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica.",
      "\"These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,\" Sir Ronald continues.",
      "Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to $1.5m per docking. This idea was mooted by the White House in February.",
      "Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China.",
      "Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US \"can only come from diversifying the market, but that's not an overnight achievement\".",
      "He adds: \"It's not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It's not governments who control trade; it's the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US.\"",
      "Many Caribbean leaders feel the best strategy to thwart the fallout from tariffs is to negotiate as a bloc.",
      "Mia Mottley, chair of the intergovernmental group Caricom, said the region was facing the most challenging of times since its 15 member states gained independence several decades ago.",
      "\"We are working and will continue to work to become more self-sufficient, but\u2026 this trade war will mean higher prices for all of us,\" she said in a recent statement.",
      "Ms Mottley added that it was vital to redouble efforts to \"invest in Caribbean agricultural production and light manufacturing\".",
      "\"We must build our ties with Africa, Central and Latin America, and renew those ties with some of our older partners around the world, in the United Kingdom and Europe, and in Canada. We must not rely solely on one or two markets.\"",
      "Ms Mottley, who is also the prime minister of Barbados, is calling for Washington to \"work with\" the Caribbean to keep prices down.",

      "Sainsbury's predicts underlying retail profit will tick down by around \u00a336m over the year.",
      "This, said Bernstein analyst William Woods, gives the supermarket \"wiggle room\" to fight with Tesco and Asda if needed.",
      "While supermarkets are always competing with each other over price, the threat of a more intensive clash arose in March when Mr Leighton said Asda would take a hit to its profits in order to reduce prices, rebuild market share and win back customers.",
      "At the time, the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury's saw their share prices plunge on speculation they would be forced to fund millions of pounds worth in price cuts to compete with Asda.",

    "story": [
      "The rate of rising prices - inflation - has eased for the second month in a row, official figures show.",
      "In March, prices rose at an annual rate of 2.6%, far slower than the 11% inflation peak seen in 2022.",
      "Petrol and toy prices have fallen, a relief for drivers and parents, while food prices are unchanged.",
      "However, this data is for last month, and analysts suggest it is the \"calm before a storm\".",
      "Exact predictions are difficult, but here are three key areas where inflation is expected to rise.",
      "1. April's bills and costs",
      "A host of household bills went up at the start of April, on top of continued rent rises.",
      "They included utilities such as domestic energy and water. Council tax also rose significantly for millions of people, and there were hikes for many on phone and broadband contracts, as well as the TV licence.",
      "For businesses, the rise in employer National Insurance contributions in April may have led them to immediately put up their prices.",
      "Some of these increased costs will feed into the next set of inflation data published in May. As a result, analysts think this will see the inflation rate quickly climb over 3% (remember the government and Bank of England's target is 2%).",
      "After that, there's significant uncertainty. Commentators suggest inflation may not stay as high, for as long, as previously thought, for reasons we'll come to next.",
      "2. The Donald Trump tariffs effect",
      "The rollercoaster ride of US tariff policy has dominated the headlines and airwaves in the last few weeks.",
      "The US president announced taxes on goods imported into the US from around the world, then rowed back or delayed many, but doubled down on Chinese imports.",
      "Some countries have hit back with tariffs of their own; others - such as the UK - are trying to negotiate.",
      "We are in relatively unknown territory in modern economics and the picture seems to change almost every day, so predictions have to be taken with a large dose of salt.",
      "In theory, when tariffs are announced, and retaliation comes, then higher taxes all round will make goods more expensive for consumers.",
      "But, particularly for the UK, things are far more nuanced. The 10% tariff on UK goods imported by the US is lower than feared, and retaliation looks unlikely.",
      "Indeed, there are heightened expectations of a UK-US trade deal, rather than a trade war.",
      "So, any price rises would be limited.",
      "China is facing massive 145% tariffs on all its goods bound for the US. If that puts up barriers to the US market, it may find other places to sell its - often cheaply manufactured - products, such as the UK.",
      "A so-called dumping of cheap Chinese products in the UK will increase price competition and could slow the rate of inflation.",
      "3. Performance of the UK economy",
      "Growth in the UK economy has been sluggish for some time, although the latest data was more positive than many had expected.",
      "But, again connected to the issue of tariffs, there are warnings that the improvement in UK economic growth could be short-lived with some even predicting a recession.",
      "That's not good news for the government, which has made economic growth its priority.",
      "Nor is it good news for workers, whose job security becomes less stable if businesses draw back on investment and start to cut costs.",
      "No job means less money to spend. That would bring down the inflation rate, but would be small mercy to anyone who is suddenly unemployed.",
      "Alternatively, the government's drive for growth could successfully propel the economy against these headwinds.",
      "And there is even greater pressure on policymakers at the Bank of England to help boost growth by cutting interest rates, lowering the cost of borrowing for loans and mortgages.",
      "Cutting interest rates usually adds to consumer demand, and risks raising prices and the rate of inflation further from its 2% target.",
      "So the Bank's rate-setters face a delicate balancing act for the rest of the year, starting at their next meeting in May, particularly because nobody is sure how much the tightrope is going to wobble.",

      "From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by a Czech billionaire who co-owns a football club and is a major investor in a British supermarket - so, why would he want this ailing institution?",
      "\"A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please.\" The slightly baffled staff at Claridge's scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky's breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands.",
      "The upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot.",
      "He was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfalteringly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it.",
      "Known as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth \u00a36bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets.",
      "Our meeting was at Claridge's in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail.",
      "His profile as a buyer was one that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe.",
      "But six months on, his bid to buy Royal Mail's parent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed \"legally binding\" undertakings.",
      "The government was awarded a so-called \"golden share\", requiring it to be notified of any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions.",
      "Earlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way.",
      "But step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic?",
      "How Royal Mail's crown slipped",
      "Royal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their 'postie', who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door.",
      "But in recent years Royal Mail's crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes.",
      "Royal Mail's letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year.",
      "In December 2024, it was fined \u00a310.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.",
      "While the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail's share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share.",
      "Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of \u00a33.3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap.",
      "At its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than \u00a36bn but had slumped to just over \u00a32bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April.",
      "He sealed the deal at \u00a33.6bn - 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago.",
      "\"Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,\" says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. \"It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal.",
      "\"This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff.\"",
      "Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International.",
      "Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do.",
      "\"Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,\" says Ms King.",
      "The 'Czech Sphinx's' plan",
      "Mr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed him to buy a 27.5% stake in Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company \u2013 EP Group \u2013 intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics.",
      "He sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon.",
      "The USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail \u00a3300m a year \u2013 putting it back on a break-even footing.",
      "Mr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO \"as long as I am alive\", but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that \"rational minds prevail\" when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form.",
      "So far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\".",
      "Given letter numbers are falling, \"we have to think about what is economical\", she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail \"to make sure it is sustainable\".",
      "While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements.",
      "Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets \u2013 99.5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five \u2013 is \"over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service\".",
      "It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies \"goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation\".",
      "European parcel know-how",
      "But there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business.",
      "Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 \u2013 long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised.",
      "Last year GLS made a profit of \u00a3320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost \u00a3348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business.",
      "\"GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "Mr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be \"nonsensical\".",
      "In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail's operations.",
      "What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL.",
      "Catching up with competitors",
      "Given all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there's an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn't, while up against powerful competitors?",
      "Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly.",
      "Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense.",
      "Mr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe.",
      "Earlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury's would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst.",
      "Royal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box.",
      "Emma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an \"historic change\" to give postboxes \"a new lease of life\".",
      "All of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don't have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it's more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time.",
      "\"If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "\"There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries.\"",
      "But Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK.",
      "Winning over doubters",
      "That Mr Kretinsky has pulled off the takeover is no easy feat. Royal Mail is, after all, considered vital national infrastructure and as such the deal required review under national security laws.",
      "Then there is the fact that his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe \u2013 paid for and approved by EU member states. The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders.",
      "Speaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago.",
      "Getting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. \"The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,\" Dave Ward, the CWU's general secretary, told the BBC in June. \"We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor.\"",
      "But during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail's pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU.",
      "Mr Kretinsky also agreed to restrictions on moving dividends out of Royal Mail Group and to respect agreements with and recognition of the CWU. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.",
      "Union bosses told me that a life under Mr Kretinsky \"couldn't be any worse than what we have had for the last 10 years\".",
      "So, as Mr Kretinsky looks certain to pull off the sale, what will customers notice?",
      "The frequency of second-class deliveries may be reduced after the Ofcom review. We will see new Royal Mail lockers appearing in our neighbourhoods. And the price of first-class mail may go up: second-class stamps are regulated by Ofcom, while first-class ones are not.",
      "The monarch's head will still be on those stamps, but there is a new king of our mail system. And his name is Daniel Kretinsky.",

      "\"It also means we can get involved as well,\" adds dad Steve, explaining that parents can help to test their children on them.",
      "3. Stay connected to what you love",
      "When we're stressed, it can be tempting to push aside time for fun and relaxation - but it's actually really important in helping us to perform well in exams, Stevie says.",
      "\"We really need to look after our brains. It's really important to get the balance.\"",

      "Members of the National Education Union (NEU), England's largest teaching union, will vote on taking strike action if the government sticks with its 2.8% pay offer for the 2025-26 academic year.",
      "They agreed to launch a formal ballot if the pay offer \"remains unacceptable or if the government does not announce real terms funding increases\".",
      "Are more strikes planned?",
      "The NEU announcement does not mean teachers in England are about to walk out.",
      "The union will need to reject a final decision from the government on teacher pay - including both the size of the pay rise, and whether or not there will be any additional funding for it.",
      "If it does launch a formal ballot, enough members would need to vote and support strike action. That ballot could open for several months, meaning any strike action would likely take place in the autumn term at the earliest.",
      "Last week, results from an informal ballot showed 93.7% of members rejected the offer and 83.4% said they would be willing to strike. The turnout was 47.2%.",
      "NEU members went on strike over pay in the first half of 2023, forcing many schools to close on eight days of action. The NEU called off action after the government revised its 2023 offer to 6.5%.",
      "Teachers were then given a 5.5% rise in 2024.",
      "In December, the government recommended a 2.8% pay rise for 2025.",
      "What do teachers want?",
      "England",
      "In a letter to Education Bridget Phillipson after the government's recommendation of a 2.8% pay rise, teaching unions said they had been clear that the 5.5% increase in 2024 \"must be only the first in a series of fully funded, above inflation pay increases needed to correct teacher and school leader pay\".",
      "They said that the value of teacher pay had fallen since 2010, which, coupled with \"excessive workload\", had contributed to a \"crisis\" in recruitment and retention.",
      "They also want the government to fund the pay rise so that schools do not have to pay for it through existing budgets. At present, the government expects, external that most schools will have to make \"efficiencies\" in order to afford the additional cost.",
      "Each year, the independent School Teachers Review Body (STRB) hears submissions from each side and makes recommendations on teacher pay to the government, who ultimately decide on how much to award.",
      "Wales",
      "The Welsh Government made a pay offer for 2024/25 in line with England's 5.5% teacher pay rise, which was higher than the 4.3% recommended by the Independent Welsh Pay Review Body (IWPRB).",
      "Long-running action ended in November 2023 after NAHT members accepted a new workload agreement along with an improved pay offer and additional funding.",

      "In February, teachers rejected an offer of 5.5% and started action short of strike in schools.",
      "But unions have now accepted a revised deal. The pay rise will remain at 5.5%, but the agreement also contained commitments to address concerns about workloads.",
      "Will my child's school close if strikes happen?",
      "Although none are currently planned, schools in England should open where possible in the event of a teachers' strike, the government says., external",
      "Teachers do not have to declare in advance if they intend to strike, and there are no rules about when parents must be told about school closures.",
      "Head teachers take a decision on whether to shut schools. Some parents may only be told about a closure on the morning of industrial action, once staff numbers are known.",
      "The new Labour government repealed the previous government's minimum service level law, which unions had called \"undemocratic\".",
      "Can parents take time off, and what else do you need to know?",
      "In England, you can ask for leave to care for \"family and dependants\", including emergency childcare.",
      "Your employer must not refuse a reasonable request, but you may not be paid. Alternatively you may be able to take holiday or unpaid parental leave.",
      "Schools are asked to prioritise vulnerable pupils and key workers' children during strikes. They are also asked to try to prevent, or reduce, any disruption to exams and other formal assessments.",
      "The NEU issued guidance to support arrangements for head teachers to \"provide the minimum level of teaching staff needed\" on strike days so students who had exams coming up could attend school.",
      "Schools must also support children eligible for benefits-related free school meals, external if they close.",
      "How much are teachers paid?",
      "Classroom teachers were paid an average of \u00a343,100 in the 2023/24 school year in England and \u00a347,340 in Wales. In Scotland teacher pay is higher, where fully qualified teachers who have passed their probation start on \u00a340,305.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 00:03:01 GMT",
    "summary": "The festival returns for a second weekend in the Californian desert. Here's how to watch at home.",
    "story": [
      "The best thing about Coachella is that it happens twice - so if you missed the first weekend, don't worry!",
      "Lady Gaga, Travis Scott, Charli XCX and everyone else will return to the Colorado Desert on Friday for a second dose of musical mayhem, and punishing gusts of wind.",
      "Better yet, the opening weekend let us know who was worth watching (Lady Gaga), who we can safely avoid (Travis Scott) and who might be this year's breakout star (Benson Boone).",
      "With that in mind, here's a guide to this weekend's sets - and when you can watch them on Coachella's comprehensive YouTube livestream.",
      "1) Lady Gaga confronts her inner demons",
      "Lady Gaga's elaborate stage performances have been known to collapse under the weight of their own ambition. Not this time.",
      "Her second visit to Coachella, after stepping in as a last-minute replacement for Beyonc\u00e9 in 2017, was one of the greatest pop performances ever. Two hours full of energy and presence and pounding synth hooks.",
      "Staged in a crumbling gothic opera house, the two-hour show depicted the star's  inner angels and demons wrestling for her soul.",
      "During Poker Face, the two sides faced off in a deadly game of chess; while Perfect Celebrity - a song about her tabloid commodification in the 2000s - saw her buried in a shallow grave, singing to a skeleton.",
      "It was bold and audacious and over the top, in all the best ways, with celebratory, nine-minute performance of Bad Romance to cap it all off.",
      "If you only watch one performance, make it this one.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 11:10pm on Friday (local time), or 7:10am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "2) Missy Elliot makes up for lost time",
      "Despite a career that's lasted three decades, Missy Elliot only staged her first ever tour last year.",
      "Luckily, tracks like Get Ur Freak On, Lose Control and Pass That Dutch still sound as fresh and futuristic now as they did first time around - and Missy's relative lack of stage experience was never apparent.",
      "She arrived onstage inside a giant car exo-skeleton, like a hip-hop Transformer, and sped through her set with pin-sharp choreography and boundless good humour.",
      "The only downside was that her set had to end after just 55 minutes.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 9:00pm on Friday (local time), or 5:00am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "3) Lola Young fights the flu",
      "\"I'm either going to faint or throw up,\" declared Lola Young near the start of her set last weekend. \"One of the two is about to happen\".",
      "The British singer, whose song Messy has been embraced by fans worldwide, was battling sickness and heatstroke throughout her set. But she powered through, leading a mass singalong to Messy, and debuting a new single called Spiders.",
      "With her health back on track, her second weekend performance should erase any bad memories from her debut.",
      "Watch on the Mojave Stage at 4:50pm on Friday (local time), or 12:50am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "4) Green Day are 'not part of the MAGA agenda'",
      "Although Travis Scott closed the main stage on Saturday, Green Day were technically the headliners - and the California band delivered a thrilling, cathartic set worthy of their billing.",
      "They plunged head-first into a furious rendition of American Idiot, keeping up their recent tradition of changing the lyrics, so that frontman Billie Joe Armstrong sang: \"I'm not part of the MAGA agenda\".",
      "That aside, politics were kept to a minimum, as the group delivered a high-voltage blast of their greatest hits, from the bratty pop-punk of Basket Case to the more reflective Boulevard of Broken Dreams.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 9:05pm on Saturday (local time), or 5:05am on Sunday (UK time).",
      "5) Post Malone's good-time hoedown",
      "\"Post-ee, Post-ee, Post-ee.\"",
      "It might have been the end of the weekend, but fans still had energy to spare for Post Malone's headline slot on Sunday night.",
      "He rewarded them with a laid-back set, that repurposed some of his earlier pop/rap hits with the \"yee-haw\" twang of his recent album F-1 Trillion.",
      "It all worked surprisingly well, although the eight-piece band occasionally overpowered his voice, and some fans were disappointed by the lack of hip-hop beats - saying the show would have been better suited to Coachella's sister festival Stagecoach (which is where Post launched his country phase last year).",
      "Surprisingly, the set was devoid of special guests, leading to speculation that the 29-year-old was holding fire for weekend two.",
      "As someone who's recently collaborated with Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Dolly Parton, that could definitely be worth staying up for.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 10:25pm on Sunday (local time), or 6:25am on Monday (UK time).",
      "6) Back to Black(pink)",
      "In 2019, Blackpink made history by becoming the first Korean group to headline Coachella. This year, two of its members - Lisa and Jennie - were back with dazzling solo sets, before the band reconvenes for a stadium tour in the summer.",
      "Lisa was up first, on Friday night, with a slick, highly-choreographed set that combined hard-edged rap cuts like Money and Lifestyle, with the softer sounds of Moonlit Floor and Dream.",
      "After her appearance in the third series of The White Lotus, she clarified that music is, in fact, her main job. Backstage, she held a post-mortem on the performance with her bandmate Ros\u00e9 (Conclusion: The desert wind makes it hard to sing).",
      "Jennie packed the Outdoor Theater on Sunday evening, for a set of clubby disco anthems that don't sound a million miles away from her friend and collaborator Dua Lipa.",
      "Highlights included the bombastic Like Jennie - produced by Diplo, and boasting it's own viral dance break -  and the swoonsome pop of Love Hangover, which showcased her vocal abilities.",
      "The 29-year-old has never been the most precise performer, but it somehow works to her advantage - making her more \"real\" than the imperious perfection of her peers.",
      "Watch Lisa on the Sahara Stage at 7:45pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45am on Saturday (UK time). Jennie plays the Outdoor Theatre at 7:45pm on Sunday (local time), or 3:45am on Monday (UK time).",
      "7) Brat Summer 2: Electric Boogaloo",
      "Charli XCX drew one of the weekend's biggest crowds, for a sleazy, hedonistic run-through of her sleazy, hedonistic breakout album, Brat.",
      "Performing entirely on her own, the star was in constant motion - a mesmerising blur of hip-rolls, hair tosses, stomach crunches and knee-drops, as she turned Coachella's main stage into sweat-drenched, laser-lit club night.",
      "Compared to the maximalism of other sets, it was a lesson in how one person can hold a stage on their own... Well, almost.",
      "At several points, she brought out her collaborators from Brat's companion album - Troye Sivan, Billie Eilish and Lorde. It was, one excitable fan commented, \"like The Avengers for gay people\".",
      "Whether the guest-list will be the same on Coachella's second weekend remains to be seen. But Charli is worth your time either way.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 7:15pm on Saturday (local time), or 3:15am on Sunday (UK time).",
      "8) Benson Boone vs d4vd",
      "Anyone who's had the pleasure of watching Benson Boone over the last year will know he's fond of performing a front flip off his piano, the big show off.",
      "He didn't let us down at Coachella - bouncing around the stage like a Duracell Bunny attached to a car battery. To cap it all off, he brought out Brian May for a surprisingly successful version of Bohemian Rhapsody.",
      "Less fortunate, however, was Texan singer d4vd, whose attempt at a backflip went disastrously wrong.",
      "Thankfully, he recovered in time to pull off an energetic set that highlighted the life-affirming vibes of his bedroom pop hits Feel It and What Are You Waiting For.",
      "After the set, he swore to practice harder for this weekend's performance. \"Imagine if I fall again,\" he cringed.",
      "Watch Benson Boone on the Coachella Stage at 7:05pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45 am on Saturday (UK Time). D4vd plays the Gobi Stage at 5:55pm on Friday (local time), or 1:55am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "9) Gustavo Dudamel's genre-defying live mixtape",
      "Last Saturday, the entire LA Philharmonic Orchestra boarded a bus and set off for the desert to make their Coachella debut.",
      "Under the baton of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, they performed what was billed as \"Gustavo's mixtape\" - moving seamlessly between classical standards like Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, and modern pop hits.",
      "For the latter, they were joined on stage by a host of A-list stars, including indie titan Beck, Icelandic songstress Laufey, country singer Maren Morris and rap icon LL Cool J.",
      "\"I told to the orchestra, 'I'm so happy conducting, but I wish I could be in the middle of the crowd and enjoy the moment,'\" Dudamel told Variety magazine ahead of the show.",
      "Weekend two will feature an all-new array of guest stars, he promised, but details are being kept under wraps for now.",
      "The LA Philharmonic plays the Outdoor Theatre at 6:25pm on Saturday (local time), or 2:25am on Sunday (UK time).",
      "10) T-Pain is the ultimate party starter",
      "\"It took me 20 years to get on this stage,\" said T-Pain towards the end of his set on Saturday, and he certainly made the most of his hour-long set.",
      "He covered Journey's Don't Stop Believin' and Chris Stapleton's country hit Tennessee Whiskey, while racing through early 2000s hits like Buy U A Drank and I'm In Luv, and revisiting his verses on Flo Rida's Low, and Kanye West's Good Life.",
      "For that, he received a hero's welcome, with the crowd treating his set as an excuse for some turn of the millennium escapism.",
      "By the time it ended, a campaign had started for T-Pain to play next year's Super Bowl half-time show.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 5:25pm on Saturday (local time), or 1:25am on Sunday (UK time).",
      "Other sets worth watching",
      "Luckily, you're not forced to stay up all night to watch the stars strut their stuff in California.",
      "Coachella's generous livestreams repeat throughout the day, and you can rewind several hours to find the performances you want.",
      "Other highlights from the first weekend included Megan Thee Stallion, whose star-studded set included appearances from Queen Latifah, Victoria Mon\u00e9t, and Ciara; and Kraftwerk, reminding everyone that they essentially invented electronic music.",
      "Belinda Carlisle reunited with her old band The Go-Gos for a dose of sun-kissed 1980s nostalgia, and the UK's Sam Fender tore through a blistering set that showcased the songwriting chops of his new album, People Watching.",
      "Among the newcomers with main stage aspirations were South Africa's hip-swivelling R&B star Tyla, and New York dance act Fcukers, whose breakout hit Bon Bon was one of the weekend's most inescapable tracks.",
      "You can see the full line-up for Coachella's second weekend on the festival's website."

      "He had a choice between Anisa Khan, who sells Indian food-flavoured pizzas, and Dean Franklin, who runs an air conditioning company, in a battle he billed as \"chilli versus the chiller\".",
      "The final signalled the end of a bruising 12-week process that started with 18 budding entrepreneurs vying to become Lord Sugar's latest prot\u00e9g\u00e9.",

      "He was also asked about his company's website, which says his engineers would \"always treat your home as if it were their own\". Soutar then produced a picture from Dean's social media showing a sex toy that he had stuck to a customer's air conditioning unit.",
      "In the final, the show's previously fired contestants returned to help Dean and Anisa create advertising campaigns for their companies.",

    "story": [
      "After British actress Aimee Lou Wood called a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that impersonated her using exaggerated prosthetic teeth \"mean and unfunny,\" impressionists have told BBC News how they tread the line between being funny and offensive.",
      "It all began with five minutes on NBC last Saturday night.",
      "Titled The White Potus - a spin on hit HBO dark comedy The White Lotus - a SNL sketch depicted US president Donald Trump, his family and top team spending time at a fictional tropical hotel.",
      "After jokes showing Eric Trump blending a gold Rolex watch and Ivanka Trump rejecting a spiritual call to give up material wealth, Wood's White Lotus character Chelsea is portrayed by cast member Sarah Sherman using a pronounced accent and large teeth.",
      "In response to a comment made by a character playing US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, she asks: \"Fluoride? What's that?\"",
      "The mineral is added to some water supplies and brands of toothpaste to help prevent tooth decay.",
      "'Bit of a cheap shot'",
      "For BBC Radio 4's Dead Ringers star Jan Ravens, the first misstep of the writers behind the SNL sketch was \"not reading the room\".",
      "It was a bad idea to joke about someone's appearance in a sketch about The White Lotus, Ravens says, given Wood's casting has been praised for a character lacking \"those all-American, fake-looking teeth\".",
      "\"In the wake of all that, she's been talking about how she was bullied at school and the butt of jokes. So then you think, 'why would you do that joke'?\"",
      "It meant that in making fun of Wood's appearance, the sketch \"punched down,\" says Ravens.",
      "\"You might make a joke about Donald Trump's appearance because you're definitely not punching down on the most powerful man in the western world.\"",
      "Ronni Ancona, co-writer and star of the early 2000s TV series The Big Impression, said she \"could see\" that the writers were also trying to make a point about US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's pledge to remove fluoride from US drinking water.",
      "But in doing so, \"they would have made this tenuous link between fluoride and Aimee Lou's teeth. It's a bit of a cheap shot,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "After the show aired, Wood, 31, said she was \"not thin skinned\" and understood that SNL was about \"caricature\".",
      "\"But the whole joke was about fluoride,\" she wrote on Sunday. \"I have big gap teeth not bad teeth.\"",
      "Later on, in a post on social media, she said: \"I've had apologies from SNL.\"",
      "However, Francine Lewis, a comedian whose impersonations have earned her a large following on social media, says the whole purpose of the US show is to \"take the mick\".",
      "While she can sympathise with someone being \"embarrassed\" by being the target of a sketch, Lewis adds that she thinks Wood's response was \"too sensitive\".",
      "In her own impressions of celebrities, which include TV stars Gemma Collins and Stacey Solomon, Lewis has stuffed a pillow up her top to appear to be physically larger and put cotton wool on her teeth \"to make them really white and jut out a bit\".",
      "In recent times, both fans and some of her targets have taken offence.",
      "\"I don't know if it's just the new generation of young people that just take offence to every little thing,\" she says.",
      "\"People that say you're a troll, you're a bully... I find myself hiding at celebrity events because I think 'oh I do their impression, they might not like me'.\"",
      "But she believes that being impersonated is actually a marker of someone's popularity and fame, saying that \"it means you've arrived\".",
      "Rather than adapting her impressions, Lewis is steadfast in her belief that \"to make comedy funny, unfortunately you have to overstep the mark.\"",
      "'Got to have the mickey taken'",
      "It's a view shared by Steve Nallon, known for impersonating former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on satirical TV programme Spitting Image.",
      "\"What caricaturists do by nature... is exaggerate the physicality. If a caricaturist is stopped from doing that, there's no point in him being a caricaturist,\" he says.",
      "During the 1980s, one of his targets - former Labour minister Roy Hattersley - was mocked for a slight speech impediment, with water spurting out of his mouth as he spoke.",
      "\"The joke was Roy Hattersley spits,\" says Nallon, who adds that Hattesley allegedly got on board with the joke after initially taking offence.",
      "For Nallon, those in the public eye will always be fair game. \"Maybe it's not a bad lesson to learn that you've got to have the mickey taken out of you occasionally,\" he says.",
      "But times have changed. Ravens says that \"people are much more sensitive\" about targeting certain aspects of people's appearances and mannerisms \"than they used to be earlier on in my career, for example, and I think rightly so\".",
      "This is not the first time SNL has received criticism of their portrayals.",
      "It doesn't mean the comedy is lost, says Ravens. In political satire - which was the main thrust of the SNL sketch - a really good impression satirises what the person is saying, rather than just fixating on how they look or how they deliver it, she adds.",
      "During our phone interview, she seamlessly breaks into an impression of former UK Prime Minister Theresa May, but notes that just speaking in a tense, clipped way, \"is only good for one line really\".",
      "\"You're pricking pomposity and you're exposing hypocrisy. That's the point of satire.\"",

      "\"But it's also exciting to look forward to a day when [having non-white leads] isn't something huge.\"",

      "Funding cuts and rising costs took much of the blame, with National Theatre executive director Kate Varah recently saying many in the industry are at \"breaking point\".",
      "But some venues said the shows they do stage are on a bigger scale than a decade ago, with the aim of running for longer on tour or in the West End.",
      "Last week, actress Lesley Manville warned that new talent had \"less opportunity\" to develop than when she was starting out in the 1970s.",
      "\"It's going to be a diminishing discipline, because there's not always the amount of stage work available for them to go and do,\" she told BBC Radio 4 after winning an Olivier Award.",
      "'Serious problem'",
      "Leeds Playhouse chief executive and artistic director James Brining said the venue had cut its number of homegrown shows from 12 to eight a year.",
      "\"That decision to contract has been forced upon theatres because it's so expensive, and increasingly so, to make work,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We love making work. So it's heartbreaking that the amount of work you can make is reducing, and it is reducing the pipeline opportunities for artists at the beginning of their careers.\"",
      "British theatre has \"a serious problem\" with the reduction in opportunities, added Brining, who is about to move from Leeds to run the Edinburgh Lyceum.",

      "Many performers and crew start their careers in theatres before going on to work in TV and film, arts education consultant and theatre blogger Carl Woodward said.",
      "\"A lot of Netflix stars and a lot of those people we see on dramas like Mr Bates vs the Post office and Adolescence cut their teeth in regional theatres.",
      "\"And if those opportunities are no longer there, then those pathways don't exist. And that is a national scandal, I think.\"",
      "The theatre industry's financial pressures have had an impact on the workforce, with \"chronic low pay, job insecurity, poor work/life balance,\" he added.",
      "Many venues said they now co-produce more shows with other theatres or commercial operators to spread the costs and risks. That also means those productions can be on a bigger scale.",
      "\"Some individual productions that are made with the commercial sector are much bigger than anything we ever used to make,\" Birmingham Rep chief executive Rachael Thomas said.",
      "\"So for us, yes there are fewer productions coming out, but we are spending more because the productions that we are making are so much bigger than they ever used to be.\"",
      "However, the Rep has lost all of its annual local council funding - once worth more than \u00a31m a year - and smaller shows have often been squeezed out, Thomas said.",
      "\"I suppose the subsidy enables you to take the risk on the productions that are never going to recoup what they've cost, and often that will be the smaller-scale productions.\"",
      "In 1995, the Rep's studio theatre staged the premiere of East Is East, four years before it became a hit British film. It couldn't afford to do a play of that scale in its studio today.",
      "\"I cannot see a world in which we could now launch a play which has got a cast size of nine or 10 in our 133-seater studio space now as a new play,\" Thomas said.",
      "\"For our model, and I would say for the vast majority of regional producing theatres, that is nigh on impossible.\"",
      "'Less serious drama'",
      "Salisbury Playhouse artistic director Gareth Machin said audience tastes had also changed, meaning it's harder to put on \"serious drama\", especially outside London.",
      "\"When money is tight, people want a good night out and they don't want to take a risk,\" he said.",
      "\"They're probably not coming out as much as they were, so when they do come out they don't want to take a chance on something they're not sure is going to be entertaining and a fun experience.",
      "\"So there's less misery and risk.\"",
      "Nottingham Playhouse chief executive and UK Theatre joint president Stephanie Sirr said she didn't recognise the picture of a drop in productions, pointing out that \"it does fluctuate from year to year\".",
      "\"I do think it's more difficult to produce these days,\" she continued.",
      "\"The costs have gone up exponentially. Things like the energy costs really impact you if you're building scenery all day, or if you're running theatre lanterns all night.\"",
      "However, making more co-productions is a positive thing in most ways, and has meant \"we've been able to really increase the scale of the work we produce\", she said, with Nottingham's production of Dear Evan Hansen now on a major UK tour.",
      "'More with less'",
      "A handful of venues staged more original shows in 2024 than 2014. They include Leicester Curve, which has put a focus on making musicals in collaboration with commercial producers, which can then go on the road.",
      "Curve has doubled its box office receipts over the past decade.",
      "\"By sharing resources and risk, we're able to, by default, do more work and create and present more work,\" chief executive Chris Stafford said.",
      "\"We are doing more with less in terms of public investment,\" he continued, but said the biggest challenge for many theatres would be affording essential building repairs and upgrades in the coming years.",
      "Annual funding from Arts Councils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Scottish equivalent has largely been stagnant for the past 10 years - while inflation has risen sharply - and many venues have had their local council subsidies cut. Many are also still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic.",
      "Last year, a survey by the group Freelancers Make Theatre Work depicted \"a workforce that is at breaking point\".",
      "Performer and group spokesman Paul Carey Jones said the BBC research \"would come as no surprise to most theatre freelancers in the UK, who have been struggling with low rates of pay, career precarity and vulnerability, a lack of job certainty and a skills retention crisis for many years now.",
      "\"It shows the need for action from government in terms of funding for the arts, but also from the theatre industry to support its freelance workforce, on which it entirely depends.\"",
      "The research for this story counted original and co-productions that opened in 2014 and 2024, including revivals, transfers and tours. They had to be professional in-person theatre productions, at least an hour long, and to have run for at least a week. If a co-production was jointly made by more than one theatre, it was counted as a single production.",
      "The research covered the 40 venues, festivals and touring companies that produce original theatre, were operating in 2014 and 2024, and had the highest annual grants in 2024/25 from the Arts Councils of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Creative Scotland and the Scottish government.",

    "summary": "Portraying some of the most famous people on the planet has its challenges, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Playing any well-known figure from recent history is a challenge, but the challenge of finding four actors to put in convincing portrayals of four of the most famous people in popular culture is one not many directors have attempted.",
      "Earlier this month, director Sam Mendes announced the cast for his four-part Beatles biopic, with each member of the band set to be the subject of their own feature-length films set for release in 2028.",
      "Actors Harris Dickinson, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan will play John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr respectively.",
      "Their performances \u2013 and particularly their efforts at the Beatles' distinctive accents \u2013 will be closely watched by fans the world over. And if previous actors' attempts are anything to go by, they should brace themselves for some serious scrutiny.",
      "'Suspend disbelief'",
      "Perhaps one of the most famous and successful Beatles biopics is 1994's Backbeat, set in the band's 1960-1962 Hamburg era.",
      "On the one hand, it had Liverpool actor Ian Hart turning in a convincing Lennon (even if he was not exactly Lennon's double).",
      "But on the other, Hollywood actor Stephen Dorff, playing the film's lead character of original Beatles bass player and artist Stuart Sutcliffe, who died of a brain haemorrhage aged just 21, provided an uncanny likeness. But his attempt at the Liverpool accent has received, over the years since, reviews from \"decent\" to \"variable\" to \"awful\".",
      "So should any actor taking on a Beatle role be wary?",
      "Beatles historian Paul Du Noyer, who wrote The Beatles: The Complete Illustrated Story and Conversations With Paul McCartney, said: \"The Beatles are so well known to us all, not just their faces but every nuance of the way they talk, every mannerism.",
      "\"Many of us know the Beatles as well as we know our own families. It can be difficult for us to suspend the disbelief.",
      "\"Even when I've seen performances that were very good, for example Ian Hart in Backbeat, that got around the problem of the familiarity by dwelling on a lesser-known period of their story.\"",
      "Du Noyer added that some Beatles might seem easier to take off than others.",
      "\"In some ways, you stick a wig and a beard on someone, little round granny glasses and a white suit and everyone goes, 'It's John Lennon'\"",
      "But he said McCartney was a tougher portrayal to nail \u2013 especially when the man himself is a tough critic.",
      "\"Paul has been very critical of films like [Sam Taylor-Wood's early years biopic of John Lennon] Nowhere Boy, and Backbeat, because they tend to fall into a pastiche of McCartney that he doesn't recognise \u2013 he doesn't like the stereotype of him being the cute one, the manipulative one.\"",
      "So does Sam Mendes have a job on his hands?",
      "Du Noyer added: \"He's got bankable stars, who won't let themselves down. I know there's been some disappointment among Liverpudlians because non-Liverpudlians have been cast in the roles, but even as a loyal Liverpudlian I can't condemn Sam Mendes on the casting, because he is making films for the whole world to watch.",
      "\"I think the accuracy of the Liverpool accent will be pretty low down the list of things he needs to cover.\"",
      "'Don't hear it any more'",
      "Edda Sharpe, a Merseyside-based voice and dialect coach who has worked with actors at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, said there were some specific challenges to taking on the voice of a Beatle.",
      "Among them is the fact that the accent with which John, Paul, George and Ringo spoke is much less pronounced than the one many might associate with Liverpool today.",
      "Beatles aficionados will know that on the Let It Be album version of the old Liverpool folk tune Maggie May, Lennon deliberately exaggerated the Liverpool accent, elongating his vowels and adding a much more nasal quality to it.",
      "The performance has more in common with today's Scouse accent than it did with the one the Beatles spoke with.",
      "\"And the challenge is, the way the Beatles spoke, you just don't hear that any more. It's a completely different tone to the Liverpool accent we are currently exposed to,\" Sharpe said.",
      "\"And you are not just trying to create the sound of someone from Liverpool in the 1960s, you are trying to create the sound of people that everyone is familiar with.\"",
      "She said there might be advantages for Irish actors Mescal and Keoghan, as there are certain common traits to both Liverpool and Irish accents.",
      "But she said similarities in accent could also prove problematic for actors.",
      "\"The northern Irish accent, particularly, has this sort of down-and-then-up quality, and when you listen to early recordings of the Beatles you hear what sounds like a familiar Irish pattern.",
      "\"But sometimes accents that are closer to your own are harder to do than ones that are completely different.\"",
      "'More Scouse'",
      "Dr Paul Cooper, a senior lecturer in English Language at the University of Liverpool, said there was academic research to back up the idea that \"Scouse was getting more Scouse\" than it used to be in the time of the Beatles.",
      "He said research by linguistics expert Marten Juskan into the changing sound of the Scouse accent supported the claim.",
      "\"Also,\" said Cooper, \"I think younger people are now looking at the accent more favourably than maybe it was looked at 30 or 40 years ago.",
      "\"There's always been a strong sense of pride in the accent, but I think in the 1980s and 1990s you got the Harry Enfield Scousers stuff and it maybe became viewed a bit more negatively.",
      "\"I think now it's viewed a bit more favourably again. Plus, Liverpool is much more of a tourist destination now, and the accent is thought of as very welcoming and very friendly.\"",
      "But what does an actor who has taken on not one but two Beatle roles think the challenge will be for the actors taking on the Fab Four in Mendes' films?",
      "Michael Hawkins played John Lennon in the successful stage show Cilla: The Musical based on the life and career of Liverpool entertainer Cilla Black, and, in his first TV role, George Harrison in the 2014 ITV serial biopic Cilla, with Sheridan Smith taking the title role.",
      "Hawkins said: \"You've got to do your research, watch as much stuff as you can.",
      "\"Obviously in the films like Hard Days Night they're sort of playing a version of themselves, but with the Get Back film, you see more of them as how they were.",
      "\"So many people feel like they know them so well that if you get something a little off, it'll make people wince.",
      "\"It's about getting the authenticity, and not doing a caricature.\"",
      "The 35-year-old, a member of \"parody band\" Ugly Baby, said even as a born-and-bred Scouser he was not immune from scrutiny for his portrayal of Harrison in Cilla.",
      "He added: \"I didn't really change my accent much for playing George. And then one of my mates sent me a review, from the Mirror, I think it was, where they were saying George's accent was just a general northern one, with no hint of the 'Pool.",
      "\"And I was the only Scouser out of the four of us.\"",

      "The 55-year-old is seen as one of the most talented and bankable actresses in film, but she has indicated several times in recent years that she's keen to break away from the big screen.",
      "\"My family roll their eyes every time I say it, but I mean it. I am serious about giving up acting,\" she told the Radio Times in a new interview. \"[There are] a lot of things I want to do with my life.\"",
      "Speaking about her experience of being a celebrity she added: \"When you go on a talk show, or even here now, and then you see soundbites of things you've said, pulled out and italicised, they sound really loud. I'm not that person.",
      "\"I make more sense in motion - it's been a long time to remotely get comfortable with the idea of being photographed.\"",
      "Her remarks echoed comments she made to BBC Radio 4's This Natural Life last year, when she said she \"absolutely loved\" acting, but also said it would be \"brilliant\" to give it up and spoke about her passion for nature and conservation.",
      "Blanchett is best known for appearing in films such as T\u00e1r, Notes on a Scandal and Elizabeth: The Golden Age, and won Oscars for her performances in Blue Jasmine and The Aviator.",
      "She wouldn't be the first successful actor to switch careers slightly later in life. Here are 10 other actors who retired from acting (including a few who came back):",
      "1. Cameron Diaz",
      "The US actress was one of Hollywood's biggest stars in the 90s and 00s, having made her debut at the age of 21 opposite Jim Carey in The Mask more than 30 years ago.",
      "Initially finding fame for her goofy performances in romcoms such as My Best Friend's wedding, and comedies including There's Something About Mary, Diaz went on to prove her dramatic acting chops in movies like Being John Malkovich and Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York.",
      "But she took a hiatus from Hollywood following her turn as Ms Hannigan in 2014's remake of the musical Annie, confirming her \"retirement\" in 2018. \"I was free to be [like] 'I'm a mum, I'm a wife, I'm living my life' - it was so lovely.\"",
      "She said the decade she spent in retirement from acting was \"the best 10 years\" of her life. But she was eventually persuaded to return to screens earlier this year for spy thriller Back in Action with actor Jamie Foxx.",
      "2. Daniel Day-Lewis",
      "The Oscar-winning star, considered one of his generation's finest actors, apparently retired in 2017, but it wasn't the first time he had stepped away from the spotlight.",
      "Day-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, has won an incredible three best actor Academy Awards for roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln.",
      "Known for leaving long stretches between roles, in the 1990s Day-Lewis went into what he called \"semi-retirement\" and became a shoemaker's apprentice in Florence, Italy.",
      "He was coaxed back to acting by Martin Scorsese and his offer of the role in Gangs of New York.",
      "A statement issued through the star's agent in 2017, when he was aged 60, said he \"will no longer be working as an actor\".",
      "Again, however, that proved not to be permanent. Day-Lewis is soon to star in Anemone, the debut feature film from his son Ronan Day-Lewis. Daniel and Ronan co-wrote the script which \"explores the intricate relationships between fathers, sons and brothers, and the dynamics of familial bonds\".",
      "Whether it's a one-off due to the family connection or the start of a big return to film remains to be seen.",
      "3. Jack Nicholson",
      "Nicholson is one of only three actors (including Day-Lewis, above) to have won three Academy Awards for acting. Two of Nicholson's were for best actor (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets) and another for best supporting actor (Terms of Endearment).",
      "The legendary star's other famous roles include Easy Rider, The Shining, The Departed, A Few Good Men and Batman.",
      "Although he's never formally announced he is quitting or retiring, he previously said his retreat from the spotlight was brought on by a desire to not \"be out there anymore\".",
      "His last film role was in 2010 romcom How Do You Know.",
      "But just last week, that film's director James L Brooks told Hollywood Reporter: \"I wouldn't be surprised to see Jack work again. I mean, it's been a hunk of time but I don't know. Maybe it could be the right thing. He's reading scripts all the time, I think.\"",
      "4. Greta Garbo",
      "Legendary Swedish screen siren Greta Garbo declared in 1941 at the ripe old age of 36 that she would be taking a \"temporary\" retirement.",
      "It proved to be permanent. The Camille and Queen Christina star never appeared on film again.",
      "Always the reluctant celebrity, the reclusive actress never played the Hollywood game, refusing interviews and avoiding film premieres and other public appearances.",
      "The enigmatic star, whose famous line \"I want to be alone\" from Grand Hotel somewhat mirrored her desire in real life as well as on screen, only succeeded in increasing her mystique by stepping away from the spotlight.",
      "However, she later clarified in an interview: \"I never said: 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be let alone! There is all the difference'.\"",
      "One of the few silent movie stars to transition successfully to the \"talkies\", Garbo moved away from Hollywood to New York, where she lived until her death in 1990 at the age of 84.",
      "5. Sean Connery",
      "Synonymous with James Bond, the late Scottish star first found fame through modelling and body-building before landing a few small theatre and TV roles.",
      "He made his film debut in No Road Back in 1957, but playing Secret Intelligence Service agent 007 in Dr No a few years later gave him his big breakthrough. He went on to star in five further Bond movies including From Russia with Love and Goldfinger.",
      "Connery appeared in numerous other films over his long career, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, The Man Who Would Be King opposite Sir Michael Caine, The Untouchables (for which he won an Oscar) and The Hunt for Red October. But he would forever be wedded to 007.",
      "In 2005, however, he said he was \"fed up with the idiots\" adding there was an \"ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who greenlight the movies.\"",
      "That declaration came a couple of years after he starred in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which many concluded was one of the main reasons for his retirement.",
      "The poorly received comic book caper was to be his final screen appearance.",
      "6. Rick Moranis",
      "Kids of the 80s and 90s: You know. This guy was a huge star back in the day, the comedy backbone of popular films such as Ghostbusters, Honey I Shrunk The Kids and the musical Little Shop of Horrors (Suddenly, Seymour anyone?).",

      "He began to cut back on work after his wife died of cancer in 1991 to concentrate on raising his children, with his final big screen outing being the 1997 sequel Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.",
      "\"I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the travelling involved in making movies,\" he told USA Today in 2005.",
      "\"So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it.\"",
      "He did continue to do voiceover work, however, and Moranis was set to make a comeback in a Honey I Shrunk the Kids reboot, which sadly fell through.",
      "7. Gene Hackman",
      "We sadly lost this acting legend earlier this year, along with his second wife Betsy Arakawa, but the star hadn't been seen on screen for years after retiring from the profession on the advice of his heart doctor - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico.",
      "Hackman shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s and was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.",
      "He chose to bow out from acting in the political satire Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.",
      "Explaining his decision, he told Reuters that he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.",
      "\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"",
      "8. Bridget Fonda",
      "Fonda, from the famous family dynasty, is another star who quit at the height of her fame.",
      "Starring in 80s and 90s hits such as Scandal (about the Profumo Affair), Cameron Crowe's Singles, The Godfather Part III and Single White Female (everyone wanted to copy that elfin crop, not just Jennifer Jason Leigh). And then... nothing.",
      "Fonda never formally retired, she just seemed to retreat. Her last big screen appearance was in The Whole Shebang in 2001.",
      "When asked in 2023 by a reporter if she would return to acting at some point, she replied: \"I don't think so, it's too nice being a civilian.\" Fair enough!",
      "Fonda's aunt Jane also quit acting in 1990 for several years, explaining later in Vogue that \"she wasn't having fun anymore\".",
      "But she later came out of retirement for the romcom movie Monster-in-Law.",
      "\"It was just a gut feeling of, Why the hell not? It'd been 15 years, and I wanted to act again.\"",
      "9. Shelley Duvall",
      "Another star we sadly lost in the last year, Shelley Duval was best known for her roles in film like The Shining, Annie Hall and Nashville.",
      "Her step back from the spotlight wasn't just her choice. Movie roles began to drop off in the 90s and then she decided to move back to Texas after her brother was diagnosed with cancer.",
      "A year before her death, she told People magazine: \"It's the longest sabbatical I ever took but it was for really important reasons - to get in touch with my family again.\"",
      "Duvall did return to acting in horror movie, 2023's The Forest Hills.",
      "\"Acting again - it's so much fun. It enriches your life,\" she told People.",
      "\"[Jessica Tandy] won an Oscar when she was 80. I can still win,\" she joked. Sadly, she didn't get the chance.",
      "10. Ke Huy Quan",
      "Who could forget 2024 award season's most charming star, Oscar winner and Everything, Everywhere All At Once actor Ke Huy Quan?",
      "He first found fame as a child actor in the 80s when he landed the role of Short Round in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, before taking another starring role in childhood adventure hit The Goonies.",
      "A couple of TV roles followed but then the work largely dried up, and he settled for working behind the scenes as a stunt co-ordinator and assistant director.",
      "\"It's always difficult to make the transition from a child actor to an adult actor,\" he told the Telegraph. \"But when you're Asian, then it's 100 times more difficult.\"",

      "Its very distinctive character was affectionately lampooned by PG Wodehouse. In his Jeeves stories, Bertie Wooster is briefly employed by a magazine called Milady's Boudoir, which was housed \"in one of those rummy streets in the Covent Garden neighbourhood\".",
      "The real Lady Magazine just happened to be in Bedford Street in Covent Garden.",
      "The Lady's fame owed much to its advice to women on the mysteries of the British class system. In 1936, for instance, its readers were given an update on the acceptability of novels.",
      "\"The reading of fiction, not long ago thought deplorable by nearly all social workers, is now becoming almost a virtue,\" it noted.",
      "Its first edition began with an explanation that its objective was to cover \"the whole field of womanly action\".",
      "Almost all of it was written by a man - Bowles - using various aliases. It was not a huge success. Fortunes changed in 1894 when he appointed his children's governess, Rita Shell, to be editor.",
      "'How to sack a servant'",
      "Under Shell's control, it became a successful weekly guide to women who found themselves in charge of both a household and a budget to outsource the daily drudgery to the lower classes.",
      "In December 1927, it cautioned young women \"to become a good cook before you marry, darling. Then you will be competent to rebuke a staff of domestics or to dispense with one\".",
      "Eighty years later, those concerns remained central. Editor Rachel Johnson was a firm believer in not being too familiar with staff, writing: \"Never sit in the kitchen chatting to your nanny, it'll end in tears before bedtime.\"",
      "And even today there are still pages of classified adverts for livery workers and other assorted varieties of domestic help but the demand now is more for live-in carers for the elderly than butlers or nannies.",
      "Rebranding The Lady",
      "That age profile has long been a concern. In 2009, Johnson was taken on to give the magazine a more youthful rebrand. She was asked to halve the average of the reader, which was, when she started, 78.",
      "A Channel 4 documentary revealed it was not universally welcomed, and Johnson's diaries later catalogued all the difficulties of aiming articles at  younger readers amongst adverts for walk-in baths and absorbent underwear along with products to remove their associated odours. It was an eventful three years that made more than a few headlines.",
      "Nevertheless, while the readership did briefly increase, like most print magazines, sales have been in sharp decline in recent years. Once a weekly, it went from fortnightly to monthly. The last published figures in 2023 revealed it sold just under 18,000 copies an issue.",
      "Custard creams in the safe",
      "And while the website will continue, it is the end of the line for a very distinctive bit of British culture.",
      "The current owner of The Lady is the great grandson of the founder, Thomas Bowles. Ben Budworth has spent 17 years trying to keep it afloat.",
      "He took over the running of the magazine in 2008 and oversaw the controversial rebrand. His decision to sell off the Covent Garden offices and move production to a business park in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire was met with protest.",
      "The premises on Bedford Street were seen by many of the staff as more than just another office, they helped define The Lady's character.",
      "No-one had a direct phone line. Instead, calls all went through a telephonist. One former editor said work would stop at 2pm to listen to the Archers, and again at 3:30pm for tea.",
      "Johnson said the wall safe was where the tins of custard creams were stored. One particular perk was her own peach-coloured WC. Each day she would be handed two freshly laundered towels.",
      "The building was a reminder of its long history and the magazine's many contributors, among them Lewis Carroll, Nancy Mitford and Stella Gibbons, who while giving the impression of being hard at work wrote Cold Comfort Farm in the magazine's offices.",
      "The L word",
      "However, heritage does not pay bills. Problems with a tax demand made headlines in 2024 and suggested the move to Hertfordshire had not solved the financial woes.   The problem of the shrinking and ageing readership was never going away.",
      "Even the word lady has shifted over the years from being an aspiration to a term widely regarded as demeaning and disparaging.",
      "And while there are older magazines, such as The People's Friend (which did not begin as a magazine aimed specifically at women) and the American Harper's Bazaar, which absorbed the even older British stalwart Queen, the Lady has a good claim on being the UK's oldest surviving women's magazine.",
      "However, 140 years on, a magazine that once billed itself as an indispensable guide to society has found that society has moved on."

    "summary": "The actress stayed behind the camera to make a documentary about Young's 2023 solo tour.",
    "story": [
      "Fifty-seven years into his career, Neil Young has harvested millions of fans \u2013 but none of those followers is more devoted than his pet dogs.",
      "\"They love the music,\" says the musician's wife, actress Daryl Hannah.",
      "\"They go to every sound check and lay under the piano on the stage. Whenever Neil is playing, the dogs just migrate right to him and lay at his feet.\"",
      "It's not just the dogs. During the 2020 lockdown, Young performed a livestream concert from the barn at his Colorado farm, surrounded by alpacas, ducks, chickens and even a horse.",
      "\"And every single one of the animals came over and laid down and watched him,\" Hannah says. \"It was so cool. I think they're really drawn to the music.\"",
      "Hannah, known for appearing in films such as Blade Runner, Splash and Kill Bill, directed that livestream \u2013 and she's stayed behind the camera to make a documentary about Young's 2023 solo tour.",
      "Filmed largely on her phone (\"and it's not even the most recent model\"), it captures the star's return to the stage, aged 75, after a four-year break, with his dogs in tow.",
      "\"He was very nervous about it,\" she recalls.",
      "\"There's always a point where he's like, 'I don't know if I can do this\u2026 We'll see'.\"",
      "\"It's funny, because he didn't do any rehearsals before the tour. He likes things to be real and spontaneous. But as soon as he walked out on stage, he was fine.\"",
      "Playing without a band, the shows were loose and unpredictable. The setlist changed every night, and even recurring songs like Heart of Gold and Like A Hurricane would be played in different settings, on different instruments, without warning.",
      "It's a set-up that caused his director a few headaches.",
      "\"It was really hit or miss because every day he would go out to do sound check, and he would choose one of his three pianos and play something like Expecting To Fly,\" says Hannah.",
      "\"So we'd set a camera on that piano but, when it came to show time, he wouldn't go near it. There were quite a few shows where we literally got no footage.",
      "\"I was frustrated in the editing room, trust me.\"",
      "Despite those challenges, Hannah captured spellbinding, stripped back versions of rarely-played tracks like Vampire Blues, If You Got Love and Prime Of Life.",
      "More revealing, however, was the footage she shot off the stage.",
      "Large stretches of the film take place on a silver eagle tour bus, where Young rides shotgun beside his longtime driver, Jerry Don Burden.",
      "Together, they shoot the breeze like Vladimir and Estragon - but rather than waiting for Godot, they're waiting for the next arena car park.",
      "The conversations are wonderfully mundane. There is ample discussion of scenery, snacks and setlists (\"people think they want to hear the hits, because that's all they've ever heard\", Young observes.)",
      "It's punctuated by stretches of companionable silence, where Young drums on his knees, or interacts with his son Ben, who was born with severe cerebral palsy.",
      "Later, the musician emerges from the bathroom, stares into the camera and deadpans: \"Now there's no risk of having to pee in the middle of the show\".",
      "Capturing that day-to-day normality was Hannah's motivation from the start.",
      "\"So many performers put on a persona, and Neil just does not have that quality at all. Whatever he's talking about with his bus driver, he continues talking about with the audience.",
      "\"People think of him as this intimidating, inscrutable person who'll make an album the record company refuses to put out,\" she continues, referring to the time Geffen Records sued Young for submitting two albums it considered \"musically uncharacteristic\".",
      "Hannah says people who judge him on that basis have got it wrong.",
      "\"He just has an absolute, uncanny commitment to his creative muse,\" she argues.",
      "\"He's not driven by financial interests, he's not driven by self-aggrandisement, he's not driven by anything other than that creative force, and it's pretty incredible to witness.",
      "\"Having spent so much time with him, my perception is that he's completely guileless. He has a lot of warmth and innocence, so I wanted to show that.\"",
      "Barred from America?",
      "Young recently made headlines for pulling out of the Glastonbury Festival, saying the BBC had asked him \"to do a lot of things\" he was \"not interested in\".",
      "He later backtracked, saying he'd received bad information, and will top the bill on the Pyramid Stage this June (Hannah jokes he'll serenade Glastonbury's livestock, in the style of his lockdown sessions).",
      "But his European tour isn't without peril. Writing on his website, Young has shared concerns that he could be barred from the US upon his return, following a rise in the number of people being detained and deported upon entering the country.",
      "\"If I talk about Donald J Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminium blanket,\" he wrote.",
      "Young, who holds dual Canadian-American citizenship, has long been an outspoken critic of President Trump, calling him \"a disgrace to my country\" and suing him for using the song Rockin' In the Free World on the campaign trail.",
      "Hannah reveals her husband was harassed during the first Trump administration, as he went through the process of becoming a US citizen.",
      "\"They tried to every trick in the book to mess him up, and made him keep coming back to be re-interviewed and re-interviewed. It's ridiculous [because] he's been living in America and paying taxes here since he was in his 20s.\"",
      "Despite that, she doesn't think Young will be prevented from entering the country.",
      "\"They've been detaining people who have green cards or visas \u2013 which is hideous and horrifying -  but they have not, so far, been refusing to let American citizens back in the country, so I don't think that's going to happen.\"",
      "Hannah will accompany Young to Glastonbury, and says she'll film his performance from the side of the stage (perhaps the BBC can use that footage, if all else fails).",
      "The trip happens to fall on the 25th anniversary of her West End debut, in The Seven Year Itch. So, has she any desire to tread the boards again?",
      "\"Oh God, no,\" she exclaims. \"I really loving directing, because I don't have to be the focus of things, and that's a much more comfortable position for me.",

      "\"I saw this woman coming out of a motorhome near the place where the stars are on the pavement,\" says Collins. \"She was dressed as Marilyn Monroe, in a white halterneck dress, and she popped some money in the parking meter.",
      "\"It was the strangest image. I never saw her again but I never forgot her.\"",

      "\"I found a producer, we decided to take it to Edinburgh, we had a venue, we made posters and a short trailer for the show,\" she says.",
      "\"And then Covid happened.\"",
      "The festival was cancelled in 2020 and greatly curtailed the following year. Everything went on hold.",
      "Sadly, Permutt died last year. But he left his literary estate, including the first draft of Motorhome Marilyn, to Collins.",

      "He says that includes the Edinburgh Fringe.",
      "\"A lot of the time, public bodies take the big events that happen on their doorsteps for granted. They assume they're always going to be there and post covid we can assume nothing.\"",

      "The August festivals have come in for a lot of scrutiny in recent years due to their effect on the letting sector in the capital.",

      "Mr Combs eventually dropped out of university to work there full-time, guiding the early careers of artists including Mary J Blige and Jodeci.",
      "However, tragedy struck in 1991, when Mr Combs co-promoted a celebrity basketball game and concert at City College of New York. Nearly 5,000 people showed up to the gymnasium, which could only fit 2,730 people. In the ensuing crush, nine people died and 29 people were injured.",
      "An inquiry by the New York Mayor's Office cited Mr Combs for hiring inexperienced security guards. However, the star and his lawyers maintained he was not responsible for security at the event.",
      "\"City College is something I deal with every day of my life,\" the musician said in 1998. \"But the things that I deal with can in no way measure up to the pain that the families deal with. I just pray for the families and pray for the children who lost their lives every day.\"",

      "Mr Combs quickly expanded the Bad Boy roster, releasing hit albums by Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112 and Total.",
      "The label's sound was slick and polished. Its biggest singles lifted chunky samples from well-known hits. The practice was frowned upon by hip-hop purists, but it was catnip to radio programmers.",

      "Her lawsuit included multiple graphic descriptions of violent abuse, alleging that Mr Combs \"regularly beat and kicked Ms Ventura, leaving black eyes, bruises, and blood\".",
      "Ventura also alleged sexual abuse and rape, and claimed that many of these incidents were witnessed by Mr Combs' \"tremendously loyal network\" who \"were not willing to do anything meaningful\" to stop the violence.",

      "Mr Combs denied all the allegations against him, while his spokesperson called the lawsuits a \"money grab\".",
      "\"The claims involving alleged misconduct against Mr Combs from over 30 years ago and filed at the last minute are all completely denied and rejected by him,\" they said in a statement.",

      "And when the actor, now 21 years old, speaks to BBC Newsbeat, it's the night after walking the red carpet at the London premiere of The Last of Us season two.",
      "The smash-hit adaptation of the PlayStation video game was a critical and ratings success, launching the young star to full-on leading role status.",
      "\"I think it's quite a unique experience,\" Bella, who's originally from Nottingham, England, modestly admits.",
      "The rest of this article contains spoilers for The Last of Us season one.",
      "Bella, who uses gender-neutral pronouns, plays Ellie in the HBO drama, set in a post-apocalyptic future where humanity has been almost wiped out by cordyceps.",
      "The deadly parasitic fungus turns humans into zombie-like creatures, but Ellie is immune from infection and is humanity's last hope for a cure.",
      "In the first season viewers saw a father-daughter relationship slowly blossom between Ellie and mercenary Joel, played by Pedro Pascal.",

      "Rather than sacrifice her, Joel kills the medics and flees with the unconscious teenager.",
      "When she awakes, he lies to her about what happened, and season one's cliffhanger ending leaves viewers with the strong impression that Ellie is well aware of the deception.",
      "So when the new season begins, five years later, \"obviously there's tension in that relationship,\" says Bella.",
      "\"It was quite horrible to play.\"",
      "Young Bella's vow to not be a \"typical teenager\" was actually less about their career and more about their relationship with their parents, they say.",

      "Ellie is 19 in season two, not too much younger than Bella, who began shooting the first series back in 2021.",
      "Number two was delayed by the 2023 Hollywood strikes, so a lot has happened for Bella in the meantime.",
      "There's symmetry there.",
      "\"It's so fun getting to step back into a character but with kind of new revelations about her and about me in my own life,\" says Bella.",
      "\"There's always like a merging of me and whatever character I'm playing and that happens times 10 with Ellie because I'm spending so much time in her skin.\"",

      "\"It was something that I didn't really think about too much before,\" Bella starts.",
      "\"Actually, no, that's a lie. I did, because I said that I was neurodiverse before, and then I was like, 'Why don't I just say what it actually is, which is, yeah, I'm autistic.\"",
      "Bella says opening up has allowed them \"to be a bit more free\" and hopes it will inspire others.",
      "\"You can be in industries like this and openly say that you're autistic, why there shouldn't be sort of such a stigma around that and such a fear around that,\" says Bella.",

      "\"Autism comes in all different shapes and sizes, and and I'm not someone that people would maybe typically see and go like 'oh, you're autistic'.\"",
      "Bella also identifies as non-binary, and the new series of The Last of Us more deeply explores Ellie's same-sex relationship with Dina, played by Isabella Merced.",
      "\"I feel like we're still figuring out how to portray queer storylines in the media in a way that feels very authentic but that also feels very genuine in terms of the story,\" says Bella.",
      "\"That's what The Last of Us does so well, I think, with Ellie and Dina.",
      "\"It doesn't feel like it's like representation added on top to check a box - it really feels like it's just a part of the story.",
      "\"So that was what was exciting about getting to portray this sort of relationship in this medium.\"",

    "summary": "The number of people vaping in the UK has stalled, while disposable vape usage has fallen, a study suggests.",
    "story": [
      "The popularity of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes has fallen ahead of a UK-wide ban on their sale on 1 June, a study suggests.",
      "The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped by nearly half in the last year from 63% to 35%, University College London (UCL) researchers say.",
      "But researchers believe vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban \u2013 instead of giving up.",
      "As a result they warn the ban may only have a \"limited impact\" on vaping rates as it found vaping in general stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16 after several years of significant growth.",
      "The UK government ban on disposable and single-use vapes is aimed at stopping littering as, in most cases, the vapes cannot be recycled and often end up in landfill or pollute natural environments.",
      "The ban is also aimed at tackling rising rates of youth vaping and protecting children from harm.",
      "GP Dr Helen Wall told BBC Breakfast that NHS advice is \"very clear\" that vaping should be used as a means to stop smoking.",
      "\"But for people who have never smoked, and for young people particularly, to turn to vaping can be quite detrimental,\" she said.",
      "\"Our young people are becoming quite addicted. It's affecting their concentration, they're becoming agitated, their capacity to learn is affected, their developing brain can be affected.\"",
      "The UCL study looked at survey data on vaping habits in England, Wales and Scotland both before and after the ban was announced.",
      "The study used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, which collected data on 88,611 people aged 16 and over.",
      "Before the ban, between January 2022 and January 2024, vaping among those aged 16 and over went up from 8.9% to 13.5%.",
      "In young adults aged 16-24, usage increased more sharply, from 17% to 26.5%.",
      "After the ban was announced, researchers found a decline in the number of vapers mainly using disposable e-cigarettes - in all age groups and particularly among 16-24 year olds.",
      "The study only asked vape users about their main choice of device.",
      "Dr Sarah Jackson, who works for the UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group and is the lead author of the survey, tells the BBC she thinks \"more people are turning to refillable, reusable devices\" rather than stopping vaping altogether.",
      "\"We often see people change their behaviour in response to impending policy changes before they come into action,\" she adds.",
      "Disposable vapes are single-use devices, which come pre-filled with vape liquid, whereas refillable and rechargeable (reusable) devices have a longer shelf-life and are often a cheaper way to vape in the long-term.",
      "A reusable vape has vape liquid that can be refilled and a battery that can be recharged.",
      "How are the vaping rules changing?",
      "Dr Jackson adds that vape manufacturers have also been quick to react to the upcoming ban, with \"the most popular\" disposable brands producing rechargeable versions of their most popular models.",
      "\"They're very similar in design, colours, flavours and even price,\" she says.",
      "While Dr Jackson thinks it's too early to tell whether the government's new strategy will deter young people from vaping, she maintains that health legislators face \"an issue of balance\".",
      "\"We know it makes sense to do something to try and reduce the vast numbers of young people taking up vaping, but the key public health priority here does remain smoking,\" she says.",
      "\"This is vastly more harmful and is killing a lot of people every year, so we need to make sure that any policy measures that are brought in to tackle youth vaping don't put people off using vapes, which are very effective at quitting smoking,\" she adds.",

      "On average, every person who has been diagnosed with Huntington's disease will have at least another 2.2 relatives who have the gene, meaning there are hundreds of people in northern Scotland who could be considered for effective treatments in the future, researchers said.",
      "Previous studies have mainly looked at the number of people who tested positive for the gene then estimated the number of relatives at risk using statistical modelling.",

      "A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted \"in good faith\" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement.",
      "A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring \"clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs\".",
      "\"Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,\" the spokesman added.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch described the ruling as a \"victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious\".",
      "She added: \"It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so.\"",
      "'Deep concern'",
      "Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: \"It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK.\"",
      "But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: \"This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society.",
      "\"It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next.\"",
      "For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups.",
      "Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender.",
      "Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was \"shocked\" by the court ruling, arguing that it \"reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates\".",
      "They added: \"This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services.",
      "\"It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody.\"",
      "The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy over transgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prison and an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse who objected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room.",
      "NHS Fife said it would \"carefully consider\" the court's judgement.",
      "'Biological' or 'certified'?",
      "The judges ruled that interpreting sex as \"certificated\" rather than \"biological\" would \"cut across the definitions of man and \"woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way\".",
      "They said a \"certified\" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian.",
      "The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to \"function coherently\".",
      "It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions.",
      "The judges noted \"similar confusion and impracticability\" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces.",
      "The judges added: \"The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct.\"",
      "Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender.",
      "However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs \"if it is proportionate to do so\".",
      "Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman.",
      "He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex.",
      "But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be \"settled\" by this court case.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them.\"",
      "Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a \"reassessment\" of rules.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards.",
      "For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law.",
      "The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts.",
      "Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was \"not limited to biological or birth sex\".",

      "\"The only significant offset came from the price of clothes which rose strongly this month,\" said Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "The average price of petrol fell by 1.6p per litre between February and March to 137.5p per litre.",
      "The inflation decrease was also driven by a drop in recreation and culture prices, with toys, games, and hobbies falling particularly sharply.",
      "The fall in inflation means that, although prices continue to rise, the pace is slowing. Price rises have slowed from highs seen in recent years.",
      "Wages continue to outpace inflation with salary raises for public sector workers growing more than those in the private sector.",

      "How quickly are prices rising?",
      "In May, the inflation figure for April will likely be pushed to around 3% due to increases in gas prices, electricity prices, and water charges, said Michael Saunders, senior advisor at Oxford Economics.",
      "The former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting Monetary Policy Committee told Radio 4's Today Programme the effect of Trump's trade wars will also be felt in exports and investment in the UK.",
      "\"We may get a diversion of cheap exports which might have otherwise gone to the US, will start to come to Europe and the UK,\" he said.",
      "\"Perhaps not as high as the Bank of England had feared a few months ago, but the economy will be weaker, with exports and investment and consumer spending all hit and unemployment starting to rise\".",

      "As inflation comes down, it could put pressure on the Bank of England to cut its key interest rate, currently 4.5%.",
      "Vacancies at their lowest point in four years and economic pressure predicted from Donald Trump's tariffs may also encourage the Bank to cut when it meets next month.",
      "But the Bank faces a dilemma, as wage growth remains strong and this would normally discourage a cut in rates.",

    "story": [
      "The government has admitted it would \"look at a Chinese firm in a different way\" when considering investment in the steel industry after being forced to seize control British Steel.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said steel is a \"sensitive sector\" after key raw materials needed to keep the company's blast furnaces running were being transported to its Scunthorpe plant on Tuesday.",
      "The government passed an emergency law to take control of British Steel amid accusations that its Chinese-owner Jingye was planning to switch the furnaces off.",
      "Beijing has accused the government of \"politicising trade co-operation\" and said this situation had raised doubts about Chinese investment in the UK.",
      "The government has so far stopped short of taking British Steel back into full public ownership but has not ruled out nationalisation, while also looking for potential private investors to fund operations.",
      "But Reynolds said when it came to looking for potential investors: \"I think you would look at a Chinese firm in a different way\".",
      "\"[Steel] is a sensitive sector around the world and a lot of the issues in the global economy with steel come from over-production and dumping of steel products, and that does come from China,\" he added.",
      "After its intervention at the weekend, the government then had to scramble to secure the supplies needed to keep Scunthorpe going.",
      "Coking coal and iron ore from the US arrived at Immingham docks on Tuesday to be transported to British Steel's Scunthorpe site.",
      "Reynolds said he was \"keen to stress the action we've taken here was to step in, because it was one specific company that I thought wasn't acting in the UK's national interest\".",
      "Alasdair McDiarmid, assistant general secretary of the union Community, said the arrival was a \"huge relief\".",
      "A separate shipment of materials is back on its way to the UK from Australia after a legal dispute over who owned the cargo was resolved between the government and Jingye.",
      "If the furnaces were starved of fuel and went out, the UK would no longer have the capability to produce so-called virgin steel, due to the process of restarting them being extremely difficult and costly.",
      "Virgin steel-making involves iron being extracted from its original source to be purified and treated to make all types of steel used in major construction projects, such as new buildings and railways.",
      "The materials have been paid for by the government, which industry minister Sarah Jones said are covered by existing budgets.",
      "\"We have a \u00a32.5bn fund for steel within the department for business so we won't be drawing down on any extra resources and people can be reassured of that,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "The plant, which employs 2,700 people, is said to be in a \"far better position\" as a result of the government's intervention, according to union officials.",
      "Asked if the government could guarantee there would be no job cuts at the North Lincolnshire steelworks, Reynolds there may be a \"different employment footprint\".",
      "\"That might be new technology, new facilities, that might have a different employment footprint. The staff here absolutely know that, they know they need a long-term future.\"",
      "British Steel has been granted planning permission to build new \"greener\" electric arc furnaces which unions have claimed would lead to job losses.",
      "Why did the government take control of British Steel?",
      "Ex-Tata workers 'frustrated' by Scunthorpe takeover",
      "'Bad faith'",
      "In March, Jingye said the Scunthorpe site was losing \u00a3700,000 a day, which it said was \"no longer financially sustainable\", and the company began a consultation on job cuts.",
      "Talks between officials and Jingye last week failed to produce a breakthrough.",
      "The government said the company had rejected an offer of \u00a3500m in public money to help keep the furnaces operating, and had demanded more than twice as much with few guarantees it would keep the plant open.",
      "\"We were working in good faith on what we thought was a good deal on the table,\" said Jones.",
      "\"That relationship broke down when, in the middle of a consultation about the future of the site, they refused to buy the raw materials to keep that site going. That was an act of bad faith and that's why we had to intervene in the way that we did.\"",
      "Reynolds previously said it \"became clear\" that Jingye was intent on closing down the blast furnaces no matter the financial support offered, prompting the government to secure control of the site.",

      "The NEU's general secretary, Daniel Kebede, claimed there were \"an awful lot of racists who are getting involved in Reform\".",
      "Farage reacted angrily to Mr Kebede's claims, accusing him of encouraging \"indoctrination of teenagers in our schools\" and vowing that his party would \"go to war\" with the teaching unions if it won the next general election.",

      "Teachers in England move a step closer to striking",
      "Reform stands by candidate over racist post in 2013",
      "A motion passed at the NEU's conference in Harrogate described Reform UK as a \"racist and far-right party because of its policies around immigration and its campaigns against migrants\".",
      "It accused the party of \"scapegoating refugees, asylum seekers, Muslims, Jews and others who do not fit their beliefs\".",
      "Members agreed that the union should \"use the union's political fund to support campaigning against election candidates from Reform UK (whose anti-immigration policies and campaigns are racist in nature) or other racist organisations\".",

      "Asked whether he therefore disagreed with the motion, he said: \"I think there [are] an awful lot of racists who are getting involved in Reform.\"",
      "Pressed on whether that included Farage, he said: \"I think Nigel Farage is a right-wing populist.\"",
      "Responding to the comments at a press conference in County Durham, Farage said Mr Kebede was a \"self-declared Marxist\" who was encouraging \"indoctrination of teenagers in our schools\".",
      "He said the union leader was \"somebody who is absolutely determined that our children should be poisoned at school, their minds should be poisoned about everything to do with this country, its history, what it stood for\".",
      "He added: \"I'll make one thing very, very clear: if we win the 2029 general election, we will go to war with the National Education Union and all left-wing teachers' unions.",
      "\"People should be taught objectively, fairly and should be taught critical thinking where kids can make their own minds up what they believe and not be indoctrinated.\"",
      "Reform MP Lee Anderson said the NEU had \"shown its true colours\", adding: \"Rather than focusing on educating Britain's youth, it seems more interested in political indoctrination, silencing free speech, and spreading divisive rhetoric.\""

      "Charities have criticised the government for cutting the amount of funding families in England can access to pay for therapy for adopted children by 40%.",
      "Adoption UK said the news was \"distressing\" for families, who had already faced \"an agonising wait\" to find out whether the adoption and special guardian support fund would continue.",
      "Last year each eligible child could access \u00a32,500 for specialist assessment and \u00a35,000 for therapy. But the therapy limit has now been cut to \u00a33,000 per year, while separate funding for specialist assessment has been axed.",
      "The government said the move would \"ensure the fund is financially sustainable to allow more vulnerable children to access targeted support\".",
      "In an email to stakeholders, seen by the BBC, the Department for Education said the \"difficult decision\" came as demand for the fund \"continues to grow significantly\".",
      "Nearly 20,000 children received support through the scheme last year, up from around 13,000 in 2019/20.",
      "Adoption fund to continue after families 'left in limbo'",
      "The future of the fund had been in doubt, until the government confirmed at the last minute that it would continue in 2025/26.",
      "In response to an urgent question in the House of Commons on 1 April - the day after the fund expired - Children and Families Minister Janet Daby said \u00a350m had been allocated for this year.",
      "The overall funding for the scheme remains the same as last year.",
      "However, Adoption UK said the cut in the amount available per child would have \"a direct impact on children and young people who have had a very tough start in life\".",

      "Louisa - not her real name - has used the fund to provide therapy for her two adopted sons and said it \"changed our lives\".",
      "\"Without it, we fear for their future, their ability to function in the world, attend school, be safe to others and themselves, and for our family stability,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Louisa said her own family and others affected were \"anxious, fearful, sad and in disbelief at what [the cut] means for their children\".",
      "For the last two years, her eldest has used the maximum allocation of funding for therapy.",
      "He had already been forced to stop his therapy sessions at the end of January because future funding had not been confirmed, leaving the family in \"limbo\" and \"watching the decline in front of our eyes\".",
      "Louisa said this meant he had not been able to attend school full-time and she feared he would continue to go backwards if he could no longer get the same level of support.",
      "She is also concerned that after her youngest has a specialist assessment, there will be little funding left for therapy.",
      "Liberal Democrat spokesperson for education, children and families Munira Wilson has written to Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson calling on her to reverse the cuts.",
      "Wilson said she was \"extremely disappointed\" the government had \"slipped out\" the announcement over the Easter break.",
      "In her letter, she said the cuts were causing \"immense worry and stress\" for families and \"cannot be justified\".",
      "The charity Kinship, which represents friends and families who step in to raise a child when parents are not able to, said the news was a \"further blow\", after therapy had been disrupted by the delay in renewing the scheme.",
      "Chief executive Dr Lucy Peake said the government's \"confused and ill-considered approach\" of boosting awareness of the scheme but not supporting this with extra funding \"risks pushing more families to breaking point\".",
      "Charities said the announcement would mean further delays for families trying to access therapy, while adoption agencies made adjustments to funding applications.",
      "The fund is available for adopted children and young people, as well as those in kinship care who have a Special Guardianship Order, up to the age of 21, or those aged up to 25 if they have an education, health and care plan.",

      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "PM: I'll only sign US tariffs deal if it suits UK",
      "UK government sources have suggested that recent talks with the US on a trade deal have been making good progress. It is understood that any deal would focus on more than just lowering tariffs, and cover elements of trade in both goods and services.",
      "In Vance's wide-ranging interview with UnHerd, he suggested a US-UK trade deal would be easier to land than with other European countries due to \"a much more reciprocal relationship\".",
      "He mentioned Germany as an example of a country that exported heavily to the US but by comparison was \"pretty tough on a lot of American\" exports.",

      "She told BBC Breakfast that talks to secure a deal with the US were ongoing, but declined to provide a timeline on their progress.",

      "The president has since made some exemptions, and stock markets on Monday showed signs of recovery, although they are still down on the month.",
      "Vance said any implementation of a new system is going to make financial markets \"jittery\" and that Trump is committed to the tariff strategy as \"a long-term play\".",
      "\"What we want is to see lower trade deficits, really across the board,\" Vance said.",
      "The vice-president also expressed an affinity for Europe, after disparaging remarks between him and other top US officials were leaked from a private chat.",
      "\"I love European people. I've said repeatedly that I think that you can't separate American culture from European culture,\" Vance said.",
      "He also emphasised points that he and the White House have made repeatedly, saying that Europe needs to better fortify its own self defence.",
      "\"It's not in Europe's interest, and it's not in America's interest, for Europe to be a permanent security vassal of the United States,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance went on to address the war in Ukraine and criticism that the US might be getting too cosy with Russia President Vladimir Putin.",
      "He reiterated the administration's messaging that to end the war \"you have to try to understand\" both sides.",
      "\"That doesn't mean you morally support the Russian cause, or that you support the full-scale invasion,\" Vance said.",
      "\"But you do have to try to understand what are their strategic red lines, in the same way that you have to try to understand what the Ukrainians are trying to get out of the conflict,\" he continued.",
      "On Sunday, Russia launched its deadliest attacks on Ukraine this year, killing at least 35 people and prompting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to invite Trump to visit his country before any deal is struck with Russia."

    "story": [
      "The UK Supreme Court has unanimously and unambiguously backed the argument that the definition of a woman in the Equality Act should be based on biological sex.",
      "Reading out the ruling, Lord Hodge cautioned that it should not be taken as a triumph for one group in society over another.",
      "But there were scenes of jubilation for women's campaigners outside the Supreme Court.",
      "Tearful hugs were exchanged and a bottle of champagne was cracked open.",
      "The fact someone had thought to bring one along underlines that it was potentially on the cards, but For Women Scotland (FWS) still seemed shocked by the scale of their victory.",
      "The Scottish government's argument - that sex can be changed via the gender recognition process, and that someone with a gender recognition certificate should have the protections of that sex - were dismissed.",
      "So what does it all mean?",
      "Supreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman",
      "UK Supreme Court rules legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex",
      "The application of the law on the ground, in \"real life\", was clearly foremost in the minds of the judges.",
      "Take the example of single sex spaces and services - part of the motivation for FWS bringing this case.",
      "The previous reading of the law was that everything from hospital wards and prison wings to support groups for victims of abuse can exclude everyone but women thanks to exceptions in the Equality Act.",
      "The concern from campaigners was that if people could change their sex with a certificate, and then claim protection against discrimination as a woman, that could be more complicated.",
      "That's particularly the case on a practical level, given those providing these services aren't actually meant to ask to see a gender recognition certificate.",
      "Now, the court is clear that this exemption can continue - the rules underpinning women-only spaces can exclude people with gender recognition certificates, along with everyone else.",
      "Does the Equality Act still protect trans people?",
      "There are still conditions which need to be satisfied - services will have to show that excluding trans people is a limited and proportionate means to achieving a legitimate aim.",
      "Blanket bans are generally discouraged. There is still a bar to clear to exclude anyone, and the test of proportionality has to be met in each case.",
      "The Equality and Human Rights Commission - which oversees the application of the Equality Act - is to issue new guidance to help service providers",
      "But FWS are clearly delighted with the underlying principle, and hope it will lead to clearer guidance for those providing services.",
      "It's important to note that trans people are still protected by the Equality Act.",
      "The protected characteristic of gender reassignment is not affected by this ruling, and Lord Hodge stressed that there are other defences against direct and indirect discrimination and harassment.",
      "He was clear that trans people are a \"vulnerable and often harassed minority\", who \"struggle against discrimination and prejudice as they seek to live their lives with dignity\".",
      "But the court has held that it would be problematic to effectively divide trans people between two different protected characteristics, depending on whether they have a certificate.",
      "Again, judges stressed that this is particularly the case when service providers can't ask to see the certificate.",
      "They say the law needs to be \"clear and consistent\" - and that including those with a GRC in with women would ultimately be \"incoherent\".",
      "The court carefully weighs the letter of the law, but it's worth remembering that ultimately that law is drafted by politicians - and it can be changed at the stroke of a pen.",
      "Will gender reform be relaunched at Holyrood?",
      "The issue may now move out of the legal arena and back into the political one.",
      "There had been some pressure on the UK government to clarify the definitions of the Equality Act, which is Westminster legislation.",
      "The court has handily done that for them, and UK ministers have welcomed the ruling.",
      "There may be more political pressure on the Scottish government, given it has lost this case.",
      "For a long time, ministers have batted away questions about this case - such as, do they really believe in the legal points their lawyers are making? - by saying they can't comment on live litigation.",
      "They will have to go into a little more detail now, but I imagine this is issue still just about the last thing they want to talk about.",
      "There had been some speculation that a ruling like this could raise the prospect of ministers re-launching their attempts at gender reform at Holyrood.",
      "But frankly there is not the political will in the John Swinney administration to ride into battle on this issue, as there was under his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "With a Holyrood election looming, there is no prospect of the first minister deciding to wade back into such a contentious debate.",
      "But with For Women Scotland now hoping to use this ruling to hold his feet to fire when it comes to broader government policies and guidance, it is one he will need to address."

      "Just after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to the White House in February, it was rather telling that the UK delegation referred to what was being negotiated as an \"economic deal\".",

      "The mood music from Washington is that this 10% tariff is not for negotiation with anyone. That is the baseline tariff that has been levied on nearly all of America's trading partners.",
      "Making an exception for one country would simply invite significant trade diversion.",
      "'Good chance' of US-UK trade deal, says Vance",
      "But the UK is in a different position than other nations.",
      "Most countries had faced higher tariffs - as illustrated on Donald Trump's big board - such as on electronics manufacturers in East Asia and they want to keep the levy at the 10% rate.",
      "The net result is that the UK may not have much to negotiate here, and yet is being treated very harshly, given there is no US trade deficit.",
      "Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about.",
      "Another issue is that all this is being done at the same time as the post-Brexit reset negotiations are being outlined ahead of the UK-EU summit next month.",
      "The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape.",
      "The US has taken an interest in this in the past. Could the US make it part of their negotiation?",
      "In addition, many US officials have mentioned a desire for allies to join it in containing China.",
      "The US might also try to force a choice on the UK here, or at least encourage action to keep out diverted Chinese goods.",
      "All this would fly in the face of the UK government's entire sell to the world that Britain could be the \"most connected economy in the world\" with strong links into European goods markets, US technology and the east Asia market, including China.",
      "There is a final factor here, which is very intriguing.",
      "Given last week's chaos in financial markets including for US government debt, it is now the case that the US needs these deals, especially the easy pickings with its closest allies.",
      "The UK has more leverage than it did a month ago. The PM may not want to use it but the US cannot afford to make the UK stall or walk away."

      "Can British Steel's blast furnaces keep running?",

      "When the furnace is turned back on this metal heats up again and expands which can crack the furnace.",

      "Any employees sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated and the plant can be entered by force, if necessary, to secure assets.",
      "But Jingye will retain ownership of it for now.",
      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "However, the business secretary acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\" as there are currently no companies willing to buy the plant.",
      "If British Steel is nationalised, taxpayers' money will be used to run it. Reynolds says it is currently making an annual net loss of \u00a3233m, but had the furnaces been allowed to shut the cost to the taxpayer would be higher.",

      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government UK government briefing, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 00:20:52 GMT",
    "summary": "A pilot project will test whether it is a useful way of fighting climate change.",
    "story": [
      "A ground-breaking project to suck carbon out of the sea has started operating on England's south coast.",
      "The small pilot scheme, known as SeaCURE, is funded by the UK government as part of its search for technologies that fight climate change.",
      "There's broad consensus amongst climate scientists that the overwhelming priority is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the chief cause of global warming.",
      "But many scientists also believe that part of the solution will have to involve capturing some of the gases that have already been released.",
      "These projects, known as carbon capture, usually focus either on capturing emissions at source or pulling them from the air.",
      "What makes SeaCure interesting is that it is testing whether it might be more efficient to pull planet-warming carbon from the sea, since it is present in greater concentrations in water than in the air.",
      "To reach the project's entrance you have to go round the back of the Weymouth Sealife Centre and walk past a sign that says \"Caution: Moray Eels may Bite\".",
      "There's a reason this ground-breaking project has been placed here.",
      "It's a pipe that snakes under the stony beach and out into the Atlantic, sucking up seawater and bringing it onshore.",
      "The project is trying to find whether removing carbon from the water might be a cost effective way of reducing the amount of the climate warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere.",
      "SeaCURE processes the seawater to remove the carbon before pumping it back out to sea where it absorbs more CO2.",
      "We're the first broadcast journalists to visit and Professor Tom Bell from Plymouth Marine Laboratory is tasked with showing us around.",
      "He explains that the process begins by treating some of the seawater to make it more acidic. This encourages the carbon that's dissolved in the seawater to turn into a gas and be released into the atmosphere as CO2.",
      "\"This is the seawater stripper\" Prof Bell says with a smile as we turn a corner.",
      "The \"stripper\" is a large stainless steel tank which maximises the amount of contact between the acidic seawater and the air.",
      "\"When you open a fizzy drink it froths, that's the CO2 coming out.\" Prof Bell says. \"What we're doing by spreading the seawater on a large surface area. It's a bit like pouring a drink on the floor and allowing the CO2 to come out of the seawater really quickly.\"",
      "The CO2 that emerges into the air is sucked away and then concentrated using charred coconut husks ready to be stored.",
      "The low-carbon seawater then has alkali added to it \u2013 to neutralise the acid that was added \u2013 and is then pumped back out into a stream that flows into the sea.",
      "Once back in the sea it immediately starts to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere contributing in a very small way to reducing greenhouse gases.",
      "There are already much more developed carbon capture technologies which take carbon directly out of the air \u2013 but Dr Paul Halloran who leads the SeaCURE project tells me that using water instead has its advantages.",
      "\"Seawater has got loads of carbon in it compared to the air, about 150 times more,\" says Dr Halloran.",
      "\"But it has got different challenges, the energy requirements to generate the products that we require to do this from seawater are huge.\"",
      "At present the amount of CO2 this pilot project is removing is tiny \u2013 at most 100 metric tonnes per year \u2013 that's about the carbon footprint of about 100 transatlantic flights. But given the size of the world's oceans those behind SeaCURE think it has potential.",
      "In its submission to the UK government SeaCURE said the technology had the potential to be massively scaled up to remove 14 billion tonnes of CO2 a year if 1% of the world's seawater on the ocean's surface was processed.",
      "For that to be plausible the entire process for stripping the carbon \u2013 would have to be powered by renewable energy. Possibly by solar panels in a floating installation at sea.",
      "\"Carbon removal is necessary. If you want to reach net zero emissions and net zero emissions is needed to halt further warming,\" says Dr Oliver Geden who's part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and an expert in carbon capture.",
      "\"Capturing directly from seawater is one of the options. Directly capturing it from the air is another one. There are basically 15 to 20 options, and in the end the question of what to use, of course, will depend on the cost.\"",
      "The Seacure project has \u00a33m of funding from the government and is one of 15 pilot projects being backed in the UK as part of efforts to develop technologies that capture and store greenhouse gases.",
      "\"Removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere is essential in helping us achieve net zero,\" says energy minister Kerry McCarthy. \"Innovative projects like SeaCURE at the University of Exeter play an important role in creating the green technologies needed to make this happen, while supporting skilled jobs and boosting growth.\"",

      "Scientists have found new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life.",
      "A Cambridge team studying the atmosphere of a planet called K2-18b has detected signs of molecules which on Earth are only produced by simple organisms.",
      "This is the second, and more promising, time chemicals associated with life have been detected in the planet's atmosphere by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).",
      "But the team and independent astronomers stress that more data is needed to confirm these results.",
      "The lead researcher, Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, told me at his lab at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there. I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "K2-18b is two-and-a-half times the size of Earth and is 700 trillion miles, or 124 light years, away from us - a distance far beyond what any human could travel in a lifetime.",
      "JWST is so powerful that it can analyse the chemical composition of the planet's atmosphere from the light that passes through from the small red Sun it orbits.",
      "The Cambridge group has found that the atmosphere seems to contain the chemical signature of at least one of two molecules that are associated with life: dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). On Earth, these gases are produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan said he was surprised by how much gas was apparently detected during a single observation window.",
      "\"The amount we estimate of this gas in the atmosphere is thousands of times higher than what we have on Earth,\" he said.",
      "\"So, if the association with life is real, then this planet will be teeming with life,\" he added.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan went further: \"If we confirm that there is life on K2-18b, it should basically confirm that life is very common in the galaxy.\"",
      "He told BBC Radio 5Live on Thursday: \"This is a very important moment in science, but also very important to us as a species.",
      "\"If there is one example, and the universe being infinite, there is a chance for life on many more planets.\"",
      "Dr Subir Sarkar, a lecturer in astrophysics at Cardiff University and part of the research team, said the research suggests K2-18b could have an ocean which could be potentially full of life - though he cautioned scientists \"don't know for sure\".",
      "He added that the research team's work will continue to focus on looking for life on other planets: \"Keep watching this space.\"",
      "The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans",
      "There are lots of \"ifs\" and \"buts\" at this stage, as Prof Madhusudhan's team freely admits.",
      "Firstly, this latest detection is not at the standard required to claim a discovery.",
      "For that, the researchers need to be about 99.99999% sure that their results are correct and not a fluke reading. In scientific jargon, that is a five sigma result.",
      "These latest results are only three sigma, or 99.7%. Which sounds like a lot, but it is not enough to convince the scientific community. However, it is much more than the one sigma result of 68% the team obtained 18 months ago, which was greeted with much scepticism at the time.",
      "But even if the Cambridge team obtains a five sigma result, that won't be conclusive proof that life exists on the planet, according to Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotland's Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team.",
      "\"Even with that certainty, there is still the question of what is the origin of this gas,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"On Earth it is produced by microorganisms in the ocean, but even with perfect data we can't say for sure that this is of a biological origin on an alien world because loads of strange things happen in the Universe and we don't know what other geological activity could be happening on this planet that might produce the molecules.\"",
      "That view is one the Cambridge team agree with. They are working with other groups to see if DMS and DMDS can be produced by non-living means in the lab.",
      "\"There is still a 0.3% chance that it might be a statistical fluke,\" Prof Madhusudhan said.",
      "Suggesting life may exist on another planet was \"a big claim if true\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding: \"So we want to be really, really thorough, and make more observations, and get the evidence to the level that there is less than a one-in-a-million chance of it being a fluke.\"",
      "He said this should be possible in \"maybe one or two years\".",
      "Other research groups have put forward alternative, lifeless, explanations for the data obtained from K2-18b. There is a strong scientific debate not only about whether DMS and DMDS are present but also the planet's composition.",
      "The reason many researchers infer that the planet has a vast liquid ocean is the absence of the gas ammonia in K2-18b's atmosphere. Their theory is that the ammonia is absorbed by a vast body of water below.",
      "But it could equally be explained by an ocean of molten rock, which would preclude life, according to Prof Oliver Shorttle of Cambridge University.",
      "\"Everything we know about planets orbiting other stars comes from the tiny amounts of light that glance off their atmospheres. So it is an incredibly tenuous signal that we are having to read, not only for signs of life, but everything else,\" he said.",
      "\"With K2-18b part of the scientific debate is still about the structure of the planet.\"",
      "Dr Nicolas Wogan at Nasa's Ames Research Center has yet another interpretation of the data. He published research suggesting that K2-18b is a mini gas giant with no surface.",
      "Both these alternative interpretations have also been challenged by other groups on the grounds that they are inconsistent with the data from JWST, compounding the strong scientific debate surrounding K2-18b.",
      "Prof Chris Lintott, presenter of the BBC's The Sky at Night, said he had \"great admiration\" for Prof Madhusudhan's team, but was treating the research with caution.",
      "\"I think we've got to be very careful about claiming that this is 'a moment' on the search to life. We've [had] such moments before,\" he told Today.",
      "He said the research should be seen instead as \"part of a huge effort to try and understand what's out there in the cosmos\".",
      "Prof Madhusudhan acknowledges that there is still a scientific mountain to climb if he is to answer one of the biggest questions in science. But he believes he and his team are on the right track.",
      "\"Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,\" he said.",
      "\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering.\"",

    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

      "\"That then cascades through the food web because without the invertebrates you don't get the birds who are reliant on them for food,\" Mr McCarthy said.",
      "He said government funding to help farmers and land managers restore peat bogs in the uplands, to prevent fires while also soaking in planet-warming carbon and providing habitat, was essential.",
      "Conservation charities including The Wildlife Trusts and the Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru (INCC) also voiced fears for the future of the water vole, which is already under serious threat from habitat loss and predation by American minks.",
      "Small animals like water voles and shrews, which live in burrows, can survive fast-moving fires but their habitats and the food they rely on are destroyed.",
      "Water voles are \"the fastest-declining mammal ever\" according to Rob Parry of the INCC.",
      "\"Their last foothold [in Wales] is in the uplands so when those sites are burned it is awful for that particular population, but from a UK point of view we are one step closer to the extinction of an entire species,\" he said.",
      "The INCC is also monitoring five breeding pairs of barn owls in the Amman Valley in south Wales, where wildfires have destroyed huge areas of habitat.",
      "\"A few weeks ago they had all of this area to find food for their chicks and suddenly they don't have that any more,\" said Mr Parry.",
      "\"I don't know how they are going to cope. A wildfire just makes that habitat disappear overnight.\"",
      "Other rare birds are also affected, including hen harriers, which have been subject to  recent conservation efforts to increase their numbers in the Welsh uplands, and skylarks, which have declined in huge numbers since the 1970s.",
      "\"We're worried enough as it is about wildlife,\" said Mr Parry.",
      "\"We're one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world and wildfires every spring at the worst possible time is a burden that wildlife and the environment just can't cope with.\"",
      "The INCC has called for closer oversight of controlled burns by farmers and better monitoring of the impact of wildfires on the environment.",
      "Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said wildfires were a \"massive issue\", particularly in south Wales, where Welsh government figures showed more than half of wildfires in Wales took place last year.",
      "Becky Davies, a senior officer at NRW, said: \"In the last three days we've had over 75 fires in the south Wales valleys alone.",
      "\"We have a lot of hillsides that are linear, the valley side has a lot of bracken, a lot of heathland, grassland and coal spoil and that is the sort of hillside that goes up in flames.\"",
      "The environmental impact of wildfires can also be felt more widely.",
      "When it rains after a fire, the newly bare soil and the phosphates that were trapped inside it can wash off into streams and rivers, affecting water quality.",
      "'Deliberate fire setting is a crime'",
      "Numbers of wildfires vary year-on-year depending on when spells of dry weather happen.",
      "But figures obtained by the BBC show that in south Wales, grassfires have increased by 1,200% from the same time period last year.",
      "From 1 January to 10 April 2024, there were 34 wildfires in the region, whereas there were 445 over the same dates in 2025.",
      "In north Wales, crews have attended 170 fires this year, and Mid Wales Fire and Rescue said it had tackled 772 blazes.",
      "Wildfires are also up in England and Northern Ireland compared to last year, while the fire service in Scotland has issued an extreme wildfire alert covering the whole country.",
      "Statistics show the majority of wildfires are started deliberately, but they can also be ignited from disposable BBQs or controlled burns that get out of hand.",
      "In south Wales, firefighters are going to primary schools to teach children from a young age about the devastating impact.",
      "At Pontnewydd Primary School in Cwmbran, staff from South Wales Fire and Rescue  Service and Gwent Police brought along animals like snakes, hedgehogs and foxes for children to meet.",

      "The singer was joined by Bezos's fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, who said a highlight of the flight was hearing Perry sing Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\".",
      "After landing back on Earth, Perry said she felt \"super connected to life\" and \"so connected to love\".",
      "The flight lasted around 11 minutes and took the six women more than 100km (62 miles) above Earth, crossing the internationally recognised boundary of space and giving them a few moments of weightlessness.",
      "Also on board were former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.",
      "The New Shepard rocket lifted off from its West Texas launch site just after 08:30 local time (14:30 BST).",
      "The capsule returned to Earth with a parachute-assisted soft landing, while the rocket booster also landed back in Texas.",
      "Cheering could be heard from inside the capsule as the recovery crew went to collect them.",
      "Jeff Bezos opened the capsule door to welcome back Lauren S\u00e1nchez, the first to disembark.",
      "\"I'm so proud of this crew,\" she said tearfully. \"I can't put it into words.\"",
      "She paused, before adding: \"I looked out of the window and we got to see the moon.\"",
      "\"Earth looked so quiet,\" she said, adding that it was not what she expected. \"It was quiet, but really alive.\"",
      "Next out was Katy Perry, who kissed the ground and lifted a daisy to the sky - her daughter is called Daisy.",
      "Gayle King also got on her knees and kissed the ground.",
      "\"I just want to have a moment with the ground, just appreciate the ground for just a second,\" she said.",
      "The last to get out, Kerianne Flynn, pointed at the sky and shouted: \"I went to space.\"",
      "A celebrity cast had watched the launch from the ground.",
      "Speaking from the viewing platform, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian said: \"I didn't realise how emotional it would be, it's hard to explain. I have all this adrenaline and I'm just standing here.\"",
      "\"Whatever you dream of is in our reach, especially in today's day and age. Dream big, wish for the stars\u2014and one day, you could maybe be amongst them,\"\u200b she added.",
      "Oprah Winfrey spoke about her friend Gayle King, and revealed she was a nervous flier.",
      "\"I mean, for her\u2014whew\u2014anytime we're on a flight, she's in somebody's lap at the slightest bit of turbulence. She has real, real-world anxiety when it comes to flying. And this... this is her overcoming a wall of fear,\" she said.",
      "The spacecraft was fully autonomous, requiring no pilots, and the crew did not manually operate the vehicle.",
      "The last all-female spaceflight was over 60 years ago when Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space on a solo mission aboard the spacecraft Vostok 6.",
      "Since then, there have been no other all-female spaceflights but women have made numerous significant contributions.",
      "The space tourism  industry is still in its infancy, so every successful launch is significant and demonstrates that these short, commercial flights can be carried out safely.",
      "But some critics stress it is tourism, not space science, and professional astronauts undertake missions, including scientific research, for the benefit of humankind.",
      "\"A celebrity isn't an envoy of humankind - they go into space for their own reasons,\" Dr Kai-Uwe Schrogl, special advisor for political affairs at the European Space Agency, told BBC News.",
      "\"These flights are significant and exciting, but I think maybe they can also be a source of frustration for space scientists,\" he added. \"We see space flight as being for science, knowledge and the interests of humanity.",
      "\"Celebrities do it for amusement but get a lot more attention than the regular astronauts.\"",
      "The space flight also generated a range of response on social media, from enthusiasm to hostility.",
      "Dr Tanya Harrison, from the Outer Space Institute experts network said: \"A lot of the comments that I saw on social media were things about, 'Oh, it's like the Real Housewives go to Mars' or 'It's the oligarchy in space, read the room, the timing is terrible.'\"",
      "But: \"There were a lot of positive takes as well. People were like, 'Oh, this is so cool. Katy Perry is going to space.'\"",
      "Dr Harrison, who had previously worked on Nasa missions to Mars said: \"The cynical part of me wants to call it a marketing stunt. This is a company promoting the fact they can launch tourists into space.\"",
      "However she noted the all-women team might \"change the demographics a little bit of who might want to do something like this.\"",
      "\"Socially, they might have had some impact\", she said.",
      "In a news conference after the flight, two of the women took issue with some of the criticism the mission had received, related for example to its cost.",
      "\"I feel that anybody who is criticising doesn't really understand what's happening here,\" said Gayle King.",
      "She said that the astronauts had had a huge, positive response from young women and young girls.",
      "Lauren S\u00e1nchez said she had got \"fired up\" about the criticism and would love to have the naysayers come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees who \"put their heart and soul into\" the missions.",
      "Blue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon.",
      "Although Blue Origin has not released full ticket prices, a $150,000 (\u00a3114,575.85) deposit is required to reserve a seat\u2014underlining the exclusivity of these early flights.",
      "Alongside its suborbital tourism business, the company is also developing long-term space infrastructure, including reusable rockets and lunar landing systems.",
      "The New Shepard rocket is designed to be fully reusable and its booster returns to the launch pad for vertical landings after each flight, reducing overall costs.",
      "According to US law, astronauts must complete comprehensive training for their specific roles.",
      "Blue Origin says its New Shepard passengers are trained over two days with a focus on physical fitness, emergency protocols, details about the safety measures and procedures for zero gravity.",
      "Additionally, there are two support members referred to as Crew Member Seven: one provides continuous guidance to astronauts, while the other maintains communication from the control room during the mission.",
      "The rise of space tourism has prompted criticism that it is too exclusive and environmentally damaging.",
      "Supporters argue that private companies are accelerating innovation and making space more accessible.",
      "Professor Brian Cox told the BBC in 2024: \"Our civilisation needs to expand beyond our planet for so many reasons,\" and believes that collaboration between NASA and commercial firms is a positive step.",
      "Rocket engine exhaust contains gases and particles that can affect Earth's climate and ozone layer.",
      "On its web page under the title \"Protecting our Planet\" Blue Origin claims: \"During flight, the only byproduct of New Shepard's engine combustion is water vapor with no carbon emissions.\"",

      "Heathrow airport closed for a day in late March after a fire at a nearby substation cut power and resulted in 1,300 cancelled flights, with thousands of passengers affected.",
      "It feels hard to imagine now what it was like having eight days of airspace closure across the UK and Europe in 2010 with 300 airports closed, 100,000 flights cancelled, 10 million passengers unable to travel and a reported \u00a31.1 billion loss for the airline industry.",
      "Flights were grounded for eight days in mid-April 2010 with a major impact on passengers in the UK and around the world",
      "'Black Swan Event'",
      "The day after the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption which spewed ash high into the atmosphere - around 20 to 50,000ft (4-10 miles) where commercial airlines operate - that ash started to drift southward into UK airspace.",
      "International aviation rules at the time were that aircraft could not fly into any levels of volcanic ash and the airspace was quickly closed down.",
      "This had never caused a problem before because most volcanic eruptions up to that point were localised and airlines were able to fly around ash cloud without issue.",
      "According to Jonathan Nicholson from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA): \"It was what a lot of people called a 'Black Swan Event' - unforeseen, typically with extreme consequences - but it was a Black Swan that was ultimately predictable because Icelandic volcanoes happened and will continue to happen.\"",

      "\"An eye opener globally\"",
      "The Met Office operates one of nine global Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres (VAAC) and is responsible for issuing advisories for volcanic eruptions originating from the north eastern corner of the North Atlantic, including Iceland.",
      "Once Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull erupted the centre ran computer models with forecast data and for Dr Matthew Hort, Head of Atmospheric Dispersion at the Met Office, it was the most intense period of his working life before and since.",
      "He said: \"It was an eye opener globally. The unique thing about the Icelandic eruption was that it happened in an area where we had winds from the north that brought the ash down across UK airspace and trans-Atlantic routes.\"",
      "Four days after the main eruption the Met Office dispersion forecasts showed ash across the UK, the Atlantic, most of Europe and western Russia.",
      "As the days of disruption went on with no sign of ash contamination clearing, everyone was under pressure to find a way to re-open airspace in a safe and controlled way.",
      "Airlines and engine manufacturers had to conduct research to ascertain if there was a safe level of ash concentration which wouldn't damage jet engines.",
      "Rolls-Royce was at the forefront of pioneering testing and for the first time was able to establish a level of volcanic ash that didn't seriously affect the jet engine over a given timeframe.",
      "Mr Nicholson explained: \"In conjunction with Met Office forecasts it enabled us to open airspace where there were low levels of ash.\"",
      "On 20 April after an international teleconference headed by the CAA, it was agreed that 2 milligrams of ash per cubic metre of air was an acceptable safe ash concentration.",
      "Airspace re-opened that night with flights operating as normal.",
      "Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull continued to erupt well into June with occasional spikes of higher ash concentration coming into the UK but under the new rules authorities were able to keep most of the airspace open with only localised airport closures.",
      "Airlines had a 'zero volcanic ash' policy for jet engines in 2010",
      "Have things changed?",
      "In the months and years after research and working groups continued to assess procedures and rules.",
      "\"The work that happened very quickly at the time around the event got us to 90% of where we are now\u2026but that has been consolidated and put into specific safety measures,\" Mr Nicholson said.",
      "Today there are three levels of volcanic ash contamination - low, medium and high, with guidance on how long a pilot can fly in those concentrations before causing significant damage.",
      "\"If something similar happened today, it will be up to the airlines to use their own permissions from the engine manufacturers and their own safety cases to decide where and when, based on forecasts, will allow them to go,\" Mr Nicholson added.",
      "\"And that will be different for each airline as some may accept higher or lower levels of ash as acceptable.\"",
      "There has also been a massive development programme in the monitoring and forecasting of volcanic ash.",
      "As a direct result of the ash cloud the Met Office deployed permanent LIDAR instruments that point a laser into the sky capable of measuring ash concentrations.",
      "New satellites have also been launched globally which enable scientists to monitor ash concentrations every 15 minutes.",
      "In addition there have been advances in computer modelling to improve the physics and processes involved in how different shapes and sizes of volcanic ash behave in the atmosphere.",
      "Volcano has been erupting intermittendly near Grindavik, Icleand with large lava flows but no ash cloud",
      "Could it happen again?",
      "What is clear today is that as a direct result of 2010, with all the improvements made, the UK and Europe is in a much better place to control and manage volcanic ash.",
      "In recent months there have been small eruptions in Iceland leading to the evacuation of Grindavik and the closure of the famous Blue Lagoon spa.",

      "Experts believe that if the 2010 volcanic ash event happened today there would be \"nowhere near the same level, if any, disruption\" according to both Dr Hort and Mr Nicholson, largely because we now know that the level of ash seen in UK airspace in 2010 was relatively low and safe to fly in.",

    "summary": "Could discoveries of alien life ever change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9ljwgg9y0o",
    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 23:39:32 GMT",
    "summary": "America is trying to create a chip industry through isolation and protectionism, when what allowed it to emerge in Asia is the opposite: collaboration.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "The US has \"dropped the ball\" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021.",
      "Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.",
      "He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality products in their American factories.",
      "So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale?",
      "Microchips: The secret sauce",
      "Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale.",
      "Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.",
      "It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades.",
      "Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",
      "With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US.",
      "The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.",
      "That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden \u2013 an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.",
      "Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas.",
      "TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island.",
      "But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions.",
      "\"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\"",
      "And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.",
      "Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?",
      "Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\".",
      "\"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\"",
      "The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.",
      "TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies.",
      "Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing.",
      "\"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\"",
      "One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India.",
      "\"Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US.",
      "\"That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.\"",
      "The global knock-on effect",
      "Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector.",
      "\"It's a wrench in the machine \u2013 a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\"",
      "The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US.",
      "Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small.",
      "\"China ultimately will want to win \u2013 it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot.",
      "\"If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.\"",
      "In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US \u2013 it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good.",
      "India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water \u2013 chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it.",
      "Bargaining chips",
      "Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector.",
      "Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying.",
      "Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm a very flexible person,\" adding that \"there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.\"",
      "Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips.",
      "\"I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,\" says Mr Einstein.",
      "\"I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here \u2013 TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie.\"",
      "But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale \u2013 it will take time.",
      "Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.",

      "His testimony is part of a case first brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2020 during the final days of the first Trump administration.",
      "The US competition watchdog alleges Meta unfairly dominated the market through its acquisitions of photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and the messaging service WhatsApp in 2014.",
      "The FTC is seeking to break up Meta by forcing a spinoff of Instagram or WhatsApp. Meta says there's plenty of competition in social media, including from apps such as TikTok, X, and YouTube.",
      "Wearing a dark suit and light blue tie, Mr Zuckerberg was the first witness in the case on Monday at a federal court in Washington DC. The trial is expected to last for two months.",
      "The FTC pointed to a 2011 email Mr Zuckerberg sent saying: \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly.\"",
      "The following year, he sent another email saying the company was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are... I worry that it will take us too long to catch up\".",
      "On the stand, Mr Zuckerberg defended his statements, calling the emails \"relatively early\" conversations about buying the app. He added that Meta had improved Instagram over the years.",
      "Mr Zuckerberg also said he wanted to buy Instagram because of its camera technology, not because of its social network. He is expected to continue his testimony on Tuesday.",
      "The FTC says the company overpaid when it acquired Instagram for $1bn and WhatsApp for $19bn as a defensive move.",
      "\"They decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,\" said FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson in his opening statement at Monday's trial.",

      "Meta has been making regular overtures to Trump since his election.",
      "The company contributed $1m to Trump's inaugural fund, and has added former Trump adviser Dina Powell McCormick and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) boss Dana White, a Trump ally, to Meta's board of directors this year.",
      "The company also announced in January that it was rolling back content moderation policies that Republicans said had amounted to censorship.",
      "It also agreed to pay Trump $25m to settle a lawsuit over the suspension of his accounts after the US Capitol riot in 2021.",

      "The FTC's case against Meta will be tougher to prove, says Laura Phillips-Sawyer, an associate professor of business law at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"I think they have a real uphill battle,\" Ms Phillips-Sawyer said of the FTC.",
      "\"They have a long road before any consideration of divestiture of Instagram or WhatsApp is considered.\"",
      "That's because compared to online search, there's more competition in the personal network services space that Meta operates in, Ms Phillips-Sawyer said.",

      "He said this new price adjustment had brought \"the digital edition more into alignment with the standard version\".",
      "Cost of tariffs?",
      "While President Donald Trump has revealed a tariff exemption for some electronics, video game consoles are not thought to be among them.",
      "Christopher Dring, who writes about the gaming industry in The Game Business newsletter, said while Sony did not directly mention tariffs in its decision, their \"knock-on effect\" could have an impact on pricing worldwide.",

      "\"Ultimately, the era when game consoles went down in price over time is certainly over.\"",
      "The price increase comes as Nintendo's launch of its rival Switch 2 console was marred by the impact of US tariffs on markets worldwide.",
      "It said it would suspend US pre-orders for the device so it could \"assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions\".",
      "And Mr Harding-Rolls said he felt Sony may have been given \"the green light to increase pricing\" due to the Switch 2's \u00a3395 price tag.",
      "\"At its current pricing, the digital version would be cheaper than the Switch 2, leaving Sony with some breathing space to increase its pricing, while remaining competitive across the console hardware market,\" he said.",
      "This is the second time Sony has increased the RRP for its latest console.",
      "Its initial \u00a3360 price tag for the disc drive-free digital edition was seen as a low price at the time, as Sony sought to match its price to that of the Xbox Series X.",
      "But it rose the price by \u00a330 in 2022 - meaning with the latest price increase, the digital edition of the PS5 has increased by roughly \u00a370 since it first went on sale.",

      "One likely reason for the dip, says Mr Pentikainen, is a decision to raise VAT from 24% to 25.5% last September, the highest rate in western Europe. The government said this was a \"difficult but necessary\" move designed to stabilise public finances.",
      "But Mr Pentikainen suggests it could make Finland's start-up ecosystem less competitive for international founders.",

      "A big question heading into the two-hour forum was whether Liberal leader Mark Carney, who has been leading in the polls, would stumble.",
      "Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, managed to survive Wednesday's French debate despite being less proficient in the country's second language.",

      "The leaders were asked about how they would negotiate with Trump and respond to his tariffs on Canada.",
      "The US president has implemented blanket 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, with an exemption on products covered by the USMCA - a North American free trade deal. Canada is also hit with global US tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars.",
      "The president has also publicly spoken about Canada becoming the 51st US state.",
      "Canada's government has previously said its position is to implement \"dollar-for-dollar\" tariffs with the aim of inflicting maximum pain on the US economy.",

      "The Liberal leader said the focus would shift to targeted tariffs designed to maximise pain on the US and hurt Canada as little as possible.",

      "It was clear that Canadians have starkly different choices before them.",
      "Poilievre frequently championed his vision of a small government that would keep taxes low to drive up economic growth and affordability for Canadians, and that would be tough on crime.",

      "Smaller parties fight for air time \u2013 and survival",
      "Canada's political system, similar to that of the UK, has a few political parties: the centrist Liberals, the right-leaning Conservatives, the left-leaning New Democrats, and the Bloc, which only runs candidates in Quebec. There is also the Green Party, which was disqualified at the last minute from the debate for not running enough candidates.",
      "But polls show this election the bulk of Canadians are opting to support either the Conservatives or the Liberals.",
      "This has left the third-place parties fighting for survival. National polls have Singh's New Democrats polling at 8.5% - which could roughly translate to just five seats out of 343, a major loss from their current 24 seats.",
      "Singh pushed to make his voice heard, repeatedly interrupting both Poilievre and Carney in a bid to set his party apart as the choice for left-wing voters.",
      "\"You can't entrust all the power to Mr Carney,\" Singh remarked.",
      "Meanwhile, Bloc leader Blanchet inserted issues relevant to the French-speaking province at every opportunity.",
      "His party, too, stands to lose at least a dozen seats in Quebec, according to current polling.",
      "Canadian civility on display",
      "Despite the frequent crosstalk, the tone overall was rather cordial.",
      "The general sense of decorum was apparent when the leaders were discussing the housing crisis. In a rebuttal to Poilievre, Carney appeared to stop himself before laying into his opponent.",
      "\"A misunderstanding. . . ,\" Carney said as he paused mid-sentence, adding: \"I'll be polite.\"",
      "Even after some heated exchanges, Carney and Poilievre were filmed shaking hands and laughing afterwards.",
      "Not only was it strikingly different to some recent presidential debate cycles in the US, it was even friendlier than some past Canadian federal debates."

      "The US has dismantled large parts of a camp built to house migrants at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show.",
      "President Donald Trump ordered the existing facility in Cuba be expanded to hold 30,000 migrants shortly after taking office in January.  However, only a small number were ever actually held at the base.",
      "The Pentagon spent around $38m (\u00a328.7m) on deportation and detention operations at Guantanamo Bay in the first month of operations this year alone, a Department of Defense official said.",
      "But new images now show that around two-thirds of the roughly 260 tents installed as part of the operation had been removed as of 16 April.",
      "When asked about the removal of the tents, a US defence official said: \"This force adjustment represents a deliberate and efficient use of resources - not a reduction in readiness.\"",
      "The camp began construction just a day after President Trump announced the plan, with tents going up between 30 January and 12 February. Visible construction continued until 8 March, with scattered temporary structures appearing on satellite imagery.",
      "The construction marked a significant expansion to the Guantanamo Migrant Operations Center - a facility long used to hold some migrants and distinct from the high-security military prison used to house detainees suspected by the US of terrorism offences.",
      "The photos below show a mix of around 260 green and white military tents in an area to the south-west of the overall Guantanamo Bay base on 1 April. But by 10 April many had been removed.",
      "Subsequent lower resolution images show that as of 16 April a total of around 175 tents appeared to have been taken down.",
      "It's unclear how many migrants remain at the facility. Stephen Miller - the White House deputy chief of staff - insisted in an interview with Fox News last week that the base remained open and that \"a large number of foreign terrorist aliens\" were still there.",
      "The White House failed to reply to a request for comment on whether removal of the tents represented a reversal of Trump's plans to expand the detention facility.",
      "Despite Trump's pledge to send 30,000 migrants to the base, a US defence official indicated that the deployment to the island was to support a population of 2,500 detainees.",
      "BBC Verify's analysis of likely tent capacity estimated it at less than 3,000 people, based on US military sleeping guidelines.",
      "Trump said in January that the expansion would largely be used to hold undocumented migrants deemed to be dangerous criminals or national security risks.",
      "\"Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them, because we don't want them coming back,\" he said of migrants. \"So we're going to send them to Guantanamo... it's a tough place to get out.\"",

      "On 28 March, a group of five Democrat senators visited the base. In a statement, they said they were \"outraged by the scale and wastefulness of the Trump Administration's misuse of our military\", and described the camp as \"seemingly designed to undermine due process and evade legal scrutiny\".",

    "story": [
      "On the morning of 8 December 2024, I waited anxiously at the Lebanese border, hoping to get into Syria as soon as the crossing opened, not knowing what to expect.",
      "Bashar al-Assad, the president of 24 years, was gone. Opposition fighters had advanced towards Damascus, taking major cities including Aleppo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing: Syria was free.",
      "Like many Syrians, I'd only ever known the country under the rule of Assad and his father Hafez, who had been in power from 1971 until 2000. Life under the Assads had meant more than 50 years of disappearances, incarceration - and the civil war that began in 2011 had claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Syrians.",
      "I'd been detained at the start of the uprising that year, and several times afterwards; I witnessed men lined up to be beaten and heard screams of torture. Even after I left the country in 2013, I learnt that security forces had broken into my apartment in Damascus and vandalised it.",
      "I assumed I'd lost my home country for good, then suddenly last year the dictatorship was toppled in just over a week. As I crossed the border into the country without fear of arrest, and watched rebel fighters shoot celebratory gunfire, while people rejoiced on the streets, I felt like laughing and crying at once.",
      "For weeks, Damascus's main Umayyad Square became a hub of celebrations. Young and old talked freely about politics and everywhere Syria's future was debated openly; among street vendors and taxi drivers, boys cleaning shoes. All of this was unthinkable under Assad, as Syrians could never protest freely for fear of reprisals.",
      "Only now, four months on, the situation is more complex. Though great strides have been made in gaining some social freedoms, there are growing concerns around what democracy will look like but also around the role of Islam in the new regime.",
      "So, how long might these social freedoms remain \u2013 or could, as some fear, the newly won liberties be short-lived?",
      "A return from exile for many",
      "At Rawda Caf\u00e9 in central Damascus, just across the road from Parliament, intellectuals gather around long tables to smoke shisha and discuss culture. Under Assad, political activists were picked up and arrested there. Rumour had it that some waiters were regime informants.",
      "Today, it's a very different picture. The caf\u00e9 hosts talks and music plays. Prominent figures who once fled the country have returned too \u2013 many are greeted by a band playing traditional songs with a giant drum.",
      "Syrian journalist Mohammad Ghannam is one of them. He tells me that he spent months in prisons during Assad's regime and later moved to France; his euphoria at returning is palpable.",
      "\"I think everyone who can come back, should come back to rebuild the country,\" he declares. \"There is a window to do whatever you want now compared with before 8 December 2024.\"",
      "Reflecting on the past, he adds: \"Even preachers in the mosques needed to get approval and know what they were going to preach. [Now] it's completely free. [At] Friday prayers the Imam was talking about how your personal freedom shouldn't step on other people's freedom.\"",
      "Odai al-Zobi has also recently returned to Syria after 14 years  \u2013 he left to study but says he was unable to come back before now because he was outspoken about the regime.",
      "\"My books were banned here,\" he tells me. \"Now there is no censorship, you can read whatever you want. I was very surprised that a lot of people want to read and want to know more.\"",
      "\"This is a big change,\" agrees Ali al-Atassi, a Syrian documentary-maker and son of former Syrian President Noureddine al-Atassi. (His father was deposed in a coup by Hafez al-Assad.)",
      "\"It changed the rules of the game, and opened a lot of perspectives for the country.\"",
      "Protecting the arts scene",
      "Syria's vibrant arts and culture scene has long been a source of the country's pride: the Assads supported it, wanting to present a rich culture to the world yet some artists and writers were killed for their views on the regime.",
      "Even carrying certain books was once cause for arrest. Today, however, all kinds of books are on display in shops around the capital - even political titles. Cinema clubs screen films that were previously banned too.",
      "For weeks after Assad's fall, the caretaker government didn't appoint a Minister of Culture, but musicians and artists grouped together to protect the culture scene.",
      "Now, however, there are fresh concerns: while Syria under Assad saw political debates repressed, some worry that repression by clerics could end up forbidding some forms of art seen as anti-religious.",
      "There is no clear evidence of this. Dr Maher Al Sharaa, the brother of the interim president, has been seen at the city's Opera House with his family; Vivaldi was played by Syrian musicians. The family looked like any modern one who would go on a weekend for theatre.",
      "And after the fall of Assad, a cultural event with talks about cinema, music, theatre and performances was held at Beit Farhi, a historic house in the heart of Damascus's Jewish quarter. An all-female orchestra played songs that praised revolutions and martyrs. Some in the audience were left in tears.",
      "\"It is great to have this opportunity to talk among us about how to protect and support the art scene in Syria,\" says Noura Murad, a choreographer.",
      "Mr al-Atassi also chooses to be optimistic. \"I believe the Syrians won't allow this regime to enter in their private lives, to create rules on how to behave in the public space.\"",
      "A concentration of power",
      "When Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad, was appointed by a military council on 29 January, he delivered a speech in which he stressed that the priority was to \"fill the power vacuum in a legitimate and legal way\".",
      "But months on, there is concern among some around the likelihood of building a lasting democracy. And there is no system in place to hold officials, including the president, accountable until a permanent constitution is adopted and elections are held.",
      "\"The past few months, the regime has not been ready to share power and allow other political and social forces to find their place in society,\" argues Mr Al-Atassi. \"Without opening up the political arena to other forces, I don't think Sharaa can bring Syria back to the international community.\"",
      "In February, hundreds gathered at the People's Palace in Damascus for a two-day national dialogue about Syria's future. Some critics argued that the meeting was organised in haste and was too short to cover all the key topics.",
      "According to Abdulhay Sayed, a Syrian legal expert and managing partner at Sayed and Sayed law firm, it was neither representative nor truly reflective of consensus.",
      "\"Large segments of Syrian society felt excluded or unrepresented,\" he argues. \"[It] was conceived as a mechanism to simulate wider assent.\"",
      "However, he concedes: \"It does reflect a certain willingness on the part of the new authorities to expand the scope of consultation.\"",
      "Sharaa, who was leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al-Qaeda affiliate and Islamist group that dominated the rebel alliance, has clearly stated his commitment to establishing a country with \"free and impartial elections\".",
      "He has also appointed a committee to work on a constitutional declaration, which laid out Syria's future over a five-year transitional period. However, the subsequent declaration didn't enshrine the separation of powers.",
      "\"He needs to show that he's more serious about political participation from all groups,\" says Mr Al-Atassi.",
      "There are some examples of this: a Christian female minister was appointed minister for social affairs, while head of the White Helmet civil defence group, became minister of emergencies and disasters. But some have raised questions about the appointment of Sharaa's brother as head of presidential affairs.",
      "\"High-ranking former HTS members now occupy key sovereign positions,\" adds Mr Sayed.",
      "Mr Al-Atassi also claims that \"highly qualified people in international law were not asked to participate in the Cabinet. They were overlooked.\"",
      "The Minister of Justice holds a degree in Sharia law (Islam's legal system, derived from the Quran), and is not an expert on Syria's Civil Code, which draws heavily on French and Ottoman law. One question being asked is whether codes based on Sharia law could be applied rather than civil ones.",
      "\"The new authorities have so far made no attempt to replace the existing legal codes with Sharia-inspired legislation,\" says Mr Sayed. However, he adds, \"this remains an area we continue to monitor closely.",
      "\"The most pressing concern is whether judicial independence will be restored and effectively safeguarded. This represents a major challenge.",
      "\"There is little indication that the new authorities are genuinely committed to re-establishing an independent judiciary.\"",
      "Freedom of women and religion",
      "Under Assad's regime, women had relatively equal rights and had been represented in parliament since the 1950s, as well as being present in society at all levels. There are no new written rules that might point to how that could change \u2013 but there are some worrying signs.",
      "Only one woman was appointed in the interim government. According to research by University College London and McGill University, women's rights advocates have raised concerns over HTS enforcing an interpretation of Islamic law, which could for example severely restrict women's mobility, dress and public participation.",
      "\"One important area to watch is whether women judges \u2013 who make up approximately 35 to 40 per cent of the judiciary \u2013 will face marginalisation or dismissal,\" says Mr Sayed. \"So far, we have seen no signs of such a trend, but continued vigilance is essential.\"",
      "As for religious freedoms, there have been no new laws or rulings restricting social life, but some Syrians report that they have seen what appear to be attempts to enforce Islamic rule.",
      "The Ministry of Justice has begun separating entry for men and women, plus there have been reports of men distributing flyers on buses and in Umayyad Mosque in Damascus asking women to wear full-faced veils.",
      "In Christian neighbourhoods in the capital, cars have been filmed driving through the streets with preachers advocating for Islam over loudspeakers. An order to shut down bars and restaurants in the old city's Christian quarter was only revoked after a public outcry.",
      "Some observers of Islam tell me they are worried. Damascus is known for its tolerance but there are fears in some quarters that the new authorities have a Salafi background (a strict, orthodox Sunni Muslim sect).",
      "\"There is an increasing call for a return to religious values,\" says Mr Sayed. \"This presents a profound challenge for those who still believe in democracy, the rule of law, and equal citizenship.\"",
      "However Husam Jazmati, a Syrian academic who researches Islamic movements at the civil society research organisation Impact, claims that Sharaa \"opposes both Islamist and non-Islamist political movements [and] neither wants to establish an Islamic state nor believes it's possible.",
      "\"They don't want to, and they can't\".",
      "Even if the government wanted to instil hardline practices, the question is whether they could? Alaa El Din Al Sayyek, an imam based in Damascus, thinks not. He argues that Syrians would reject any attempt to do so.",
      "\"It is impossible, our society will not accept it,\" he tells me. \"We have lived in harmony with different sects for years even during difficult times. The Quran says it clearly: no compulsion in religion.\"",
      "Competing visions for the future",
      "Today there are growing tensions: violence in coastal cities has left more than 1,400 people dead, many of them Alawites (part of Assad's minority sect). They were said to be revenge for attacks on Syrian security forces.",
      "Elsewhere, in the north east of the country, even though the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in 2019, camps still hold about 56,000 people, many of them the family members of Islamic State group (IS) suspects, more than five years after the jihadists' territorial defeat in Syria.",
      "The main question now facing the country, however, is how Syrians see their future. There are some tensions around this, which have seeped into a push-pull between the leadership and HTS, according to Mr Jazmati.",
      "He claims that while Sharaa's top circle wants to build \"a conservative, economically liberal\" state, \"they can't stop many of their members \u2013 those they've appointed in various positions and rely on because they're trusted \u2013 from trying to Islamise public life in Syria.\"",
      "The think tank International Crisis Group has similar concerns. It has said that it believes Syria is living \"on borrowed time\".",
      "\"The interim government is running out of funds, security forces are overstretched, poverty is deepening and insurgency is brewing at the periphery. Outsiders are meddling. Western sanctions deprive leaders of what they need to rebuild, while preventing fragmentation or a return to civil war.\"",
      "For Mr Al-Atassi, the solution is straightforward: He believes Sharaa needs to open up the political arena. \"There are no elections today in Syria, there are only nominations,\" he says. \"This is very dangerous.\"",
      "With a pause, he adds: \"It could be that a new dictatorship is in the making - but I don't believe that the Syrian people are ready, after five decades, to accept a new dictatorship.\"",
      "And as for the prospect of lasting democracy? \"We need to wait to see,\" he says. \"But I'm not at all optimistic.\"",
      "However there is a wider issue too. That is, could there be a wider loss of faith in the very idea of democracy given the country's recent history?",
      "Mr Sayed thinks so. \"Though the Assad-era constitutions formally proclaimed political freedoms\u2026 our experience of political modernity came in the form of shells falling on our heads, while our bodies were laid bare in detention camps,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Large segments of the Syrian population have lost faith in the promises of political modernity.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 21:24:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Sources say half a million US weapons obtained by the Taliban have been lost, sold or smuggled to militant groups.",
    "story": [
      "Half a million weapons obtained by the Taliban in Afghanistan have been lost, sold or smuggled to militant groups, sources have told the BBC - with the UN believing that some have fallen into the hands of al-Qaeda affiliates.",
      "The Taliban took control of around one million weapons and pieces of military equipment - which had mostly been funded by the US - when it regained control of Afghanistan in 2021, according to a former Afghan official who spoke to the BBC anonymously.",
      "As the Taliban advanced through Afghanistan in 2021, many Afghan soldiers surrendered or fled, abandoning their weapons and vehicles. Some equipment was simply left behind by US forces.",
      "The cache included American-made firearms, such as M4 and M16 rifles, as well as other older weapons in Afghan possession that had been left behind from decades of conflict.",
      "Sources have told the BBC that, at the closed-door UN Security Council's Sanctions Committee in Doha late last year, the Taliban admitted that at least half of this equipment is now \"unaccounted\" for.",
      "A person from the committee said they had verified with other sources that the whereabouts of half a million items was unknown.",
      "In a report in February, the UN stated that al-Qaeda affiliates, including Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, and Yemen's Ansarullah movement, were accessing Taliban-captured weapons or buying them on the black market.",
      "The BBC put this to Hamdullah Fitrat, deputy spokesperson for the Taliban government, who told the BBC it took the protection and storage of weapons very seriously.",
      "\"All light and heavy weapons are securely stored. We strongly reject claims of smuggling or loss,\" he said.",
      "A 2023 UN report said the Taliban allowed local commanders to retain 20% of seized US weapons, and that the black market was thriving as a result. These commanders are affiliated to the Taliban but often have a degree of autonomy in their regions.",
      "The UN noted that the \"gifting of weapons is widely practiced between local commanders and fighters to consolidate power. The black market remains a rich source of weaponry for the Taliban\".",
      "A former journalist in the city of Kandahar told the BBC that an open arms market existed there for a year after the Taliban takeover, but has since gone underground via the messaging service WhatsApp. On it, wealthy individuals and local commanders trade new and used US weapons and equipment - mostly the weapons left by US-backed forces.",
      "The number of weapons recorded by the US body tasked with overseeing Afghan reconstruction projects, known as Sigar, is lower than those cited by our sources, but in a 2022 report it acknowledged it was unable to get accurate information.",
      "The reason given for this was that equipment has been funded and supplied by various US departments and organisations over the years.",
      "Sigar added that there had been \"shortfalls and issues with DoD's [Department of Defense] processes for tracking equipment in Afghanistan\" for more than a decade.",
      "It also criticised the State Department, adding: \"State provided us limited, inaccurate, and untimely information about the equipment and funds it left behind.\" The department denied this was the case.",
      "This is very much a political issue, and US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that he will reclaim weapons from Afghanistan. He said that $85bn (\u00a366bn) of advanced weaponry was left there.",
      "\"Afghanistan is one of the biggest sellers of military equipment in the world, you know why? They're selling the equipment that we left,\" Trump said during his first cabinet meeting of the new administration.",
      "\"I want to look into this. If we need to pay them, that's fine, but we want our military equipment back.\"",
      "The president's figure has been disputed, as money spent in Afghanistan also funded training and salaries. Also, Afghanistan did not feature in the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's top 25 largest exporters of major arms last year.",
      "In response to Trump's comments, Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban's chief spokesperson, told Afghan state TV: \"We seized these weapons from the previous administration and will use them to defend the country and counter any threats.\"",
      "The Taliban regularly parades US weapons, including at Bagram Airfield, which served as the main US-Nato base, and frame them as symbols of victory and legitimacy.",
      "After withdrawing in 2021, the Pentagon claimed US equipment left in Afghanistan was disabled, but the Taliban have since built a capable military using US weapons and gained superiority over rival groups, such as the National Resistance Front and Islamic State Khorasan Province - the regional affiliate of the Islamic State group.",
      "A source from the former Afghan government told the BBC that \"hundreds\" of unused Humvees, mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles (MRAPs), and Black Hawk helicopters remain in Kandahar warehouses.",
      "The Taliban has showcased some of this captured equipment in propaganda videos, but their ability to operate and maintain advanced machinery, such as Black Hawk helicopters, is limited due to a lack of trained personnel and technical expertise. Much of this sophisticated equipment remains non-operational.",
      "However, the Taliban have been able to utilise more straightforward equipment, like Humvees and small arms, in their operations.",
      "While Donald Trump appears determined to reclaim US weapons from Afghanistan, the former head of Sigar, John Sopko, says such an attempt would be pointless.",
      "At a recent event hosted by the Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies, he said that \"the cost would exceed its actual value\".",
      "Whether Trump will take any action remains to be seen, but, in the meantime, concerns about the spread of weapons in the region and access by militant groups remain unresolved.",

    "summary": "The charges will start in 180 days and rise in the coming years.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has unveiled its plan to impose port fees on Chinese ships as it tries to revive shipbuilding in the US and challenge China's dominance of the industry.",
      "The US Trade Representative's (USTR) announcement is less severe than a plan floated in February to hit Chinese vessels with charges of up to $1.5m (\u00a31.1m) for each American port they visit.",
      "It said the fees would start to be charged in 180 days time and would rise in the coming years.",
      "There have been concerns that the measures would further disrupt global trade amid US President Donald Trump's tariff policies.",
      "\"China has largely achieved its dominance goals, severely disadvantaging US companies, workers, and the US economy,\" the USTR said in statement.",
      "Fees on Chinese vessel owners and operators of ships built in China will be based on the weight of their cargo, how many containers they carry or the number of vehicles onboard.",
      "For affected bulk vessels, the fee will be based on the weight of their cargo, while the charge for container ships will depend on how many containers a vessel is carrying.",
      "Under the measures, Chinese ship owners and operators will initially be charged $50 per ton of cargo, rising by $30 a ton each year for the next three years.",
      "Fees on Chinese-built ships will start at $18 a ton or $120 per container and also rise over the next three years.",
      "Non-US built ships carrying cars will be charged $150 per vehicle.",
      "The fee will be applied once per voyage on affected ships and not more than five times a year.",
      "The USTR also decided not to impose fees based on how many Chinese-built ships are in a fleet or based on prospective orders of Chinese ships, as it had originally proposed.",
      "Empty vessels that arrive at US ports to carry bulk exports like coal or grain are exempted.",
      "Vessels that move goods between American ports as well as from those ports to Caribbean islands and US territories are also exempted from rules, as are US and Canadian ships that call at ports in the Great Lakes.",
      "The USTR said a second phase of actions will begin in three years to favour US-built ships carrying liquified natural gas (LNG). These restrictions will rise incrementally over the following 22 years.",
      "The announcement came as global trade is already being disrupted by Trump's trade tariffs, experts have said.",
      "Cargoes originally destined for ports in the US from China are instead being redirected to European ports, a trade group said.",
      "Businesses have warned this will raise prices for US consumers.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.",
      "His administration said this week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.",
      "These tariffs have caused \"significant build ups\" of ships, especially in the European Union, but also \"significant congestion\" at UK ports, according to Marco Forgione, director general of the Chartered Institute of Export & International Trade.",
      "More containers are coming to the UK, he said.",
      "\"We've seen a lot of diversion of ships from China, that were due to head to the US, diverting and coming to the UK and into the EU.\"",
      "In the first three months of 2025, Chinese imports into the UK have increased by about 15% and into the EU by about 12%.",
      "\"That's a direct impact of what President Trump is doing,\" he said, adding that uncertainty and increased disruption pushes up prices for consumers.",
      "US tariffs will make global trade shrink, says WTO",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "Sanne Manders, president of logistics firm Flexport, said both tariffs and strikes at ports in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium in the first three months of the year had been \"clogging\" ports.",
      "Congestion in the UK \"is particularly severe in Felixstowe\", while in continental Europe Rotterdam and Barcelona are \"also pretty severe\".",
      "\"I do believe that if more cargo is going to be routed towards Europe, finding new buyers that will drive up the volumes even further, that could lead to more congestion,\" he said - although terminals would be open for more hours per day in the summer due to better weather.",
      "He said shippers were looking for new markets, but that also there may be a surge of goods to the US to try to take advantage of that 90-day window for goods from some countries.",
      "He said in the US, consumers would pay for the tariffs, but European consumers would not see \"much impact\".",
      "Companies would also probably start redesigning their supply chains, he said."

      "The US president separately said on Thursday that he is confident of making \"a very good deal\" with China, adding that representatives from Beijing have reached out \"a number of times\".",
      "Trump and Meloni enjoy a good relationship and the Italian leader hopes to position herself as a bridge between the EU and the US amid fractured relations and mounting concerns about the global impact of Trump's tariffs.",
      "Despite his confidence in an eventual deal, Trump said he was in \"no rush\".",
      "\"Everybody wants to make a deal. And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them,\" he said, adding that he expects to cut deals with every country \"over the next three to four weeks\".",
      "Trump also suggested thathe was reluctant to further raise tariffs on China - which currently stand at 145%.",
      "\"I may not want to go higher. I may want to go to less because you know, you want people to buy and, at a certain point, people aren't gonna buy,\" he told reporters at the White House.",
      "At a press conference on Thursday following Trump's and Meloni's conversation, the leaders said they had discussed defence spending, immigration and tariffs.",
      "The atmosphere in the Oval Office appeared relaxed and good-natured - similar to the reception UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer received during his visit to the White House in February.",
      "However Meloni's aides had described the visit as a \"commercial peace mission\" following Trump's decision to impose a 10% baseline tariff on almost all foreign imports to the US.",
      "He has strongly criticised the European Union on trade, claiming it was \"formed to screw the United States\". A 20% \"retaliatory\" tariff on the EU has been temporarily suspended until July.",
      "Meloni previously called the tariffs \"absolutely wrong\" and said they would end up damaging the EU \"as much as the US\".",
      "While she didn't score any tangible wins on tariffs during the meeting, she did convince Trump to accept an invitation to visit Rome, which she said would be an occasion for him to meet other European leaders.",
      "Given the fraught relations between the EU and the US, Meloni will likely chalk that up as a significant win, particularly if Trump agrees to meet the president of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, during the visit.",
      "Meloni will return to Europe with stronger credentials as the so-called \"Trump whisperer\", something that will be reinforced when she meets US Vice President JD Vance in Rome tomorrow.",
      "The Italian leader was careful to praise Trump and align herself with the US president's viewpoints.",
      "In her statement following the meeting, she criticised \"woke ideology\" and championed the \"war against illegal migration\".",
      "\"The goal for me is to make the West great again, and I think we can do it together,\" she added.",
      "She also seized the opportunity to tout the work of her own government. \"I'm proud of sitting here as prime minister of an Italy that today has a very good situation - a stable country, a reliable country,\" Meloni said.",

    "story": [
      "A highly anticipated resentencing hearing for convicted killers Erik and Lyle Menendez kicked off on Thursday before unravelling and being postponed by a judge.",
      "The hearing was set to decide whether the brothers, serving life without the possibility of parole, should receive a new sentence that could allow their freedom after serving three decades in prison.",
      "They were convicted in the 1989 killing of their parents in a Beverly Hills mansion - a case that continues to divide the nation.",
      "The hearing devolved from the start as attorneys for the brothers fought with prosecutors, who oppose their release. The judge ultimately delayed the hearing until 9 May to weigh requests made by both sides.",
      "The contentious hearing, which led to swarms of media, yielded few developments.",
      "The brothers' attorney Mark Geragos declared he would seek the recusal of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office from the case and prosecutors asked the court to review a new report about whether the brothers could be a danger to the public if released.",

      "The brothers themselves appeared in court via a video feed from a San Diego prison, wearing identical cobalt blue prison uniforms.",

      "Newsom had ordered the state's parole board to examine the case, and that panel completed a risk assessment report this week. The report examines whether the brothers would be a risk to society if released.",
      "Prosecutors said in court filings that they want to review the report before moving ahead with the resentencing effort.",
      "Mr Geragos argued that he, too, had not been able to view the report yet.",
      "Late in the afternoon, Judge Michael Jesic agreed to pause the proceedings until 9 May to give the court and attorneys time to review the risk assessment.",
      "That hearing will consider what parts of the report, if any, will be admissible during the resentencing hearing.",

    "story": [
      "Officially, all lines of enquiry are still open into a wave of arson and gun attacks at French prisons.",
      "That means police haven't ruled out the extremist left, or a foreign power such as Russia or Algeria.",
      "But the conviction is growing that the attacks - 12 since Sunday night - can only have been the work of drugs gangs, hitting back at the government's latest crackdown.",
      "That is certainly the belief of the government itself.",
      "Speaking on Thursday morning, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said he was \"certain that what we're dealing with is the drugs-yobs [in French, narco-racaille]\".",
      "\"It's not they who have declared war on us. It's we who declared war on them with our new law on drugs trafficking. They know we're going to be hitting their wallets.\"",
      "In what was obviously a co-ordinated plan over three nights, gangs set fire to cars outside prisons and a prison officer training centre. In two locations, guns were used.",
      "In many attacks, the perpetrators sprayed graffiti bearing the initials DDPF, which stands for Droits des Prisonniers Fran\u00e7ais - Rights for French Prison Inmates.",
      "The group was previously unheard of, but on Tuesday it posted a video on the messaging platform Telegram showing the burning of a prison officer's car.",
      "In French that is full of mistakes, the video's text accuses Justice Minister G\u00e9rard Darmanin of declaring \"war\" on prisoners.",
      "\"All we want is that human rights be respected,\" the text reads. \"If in 2025 we can watch TV, smoke and eat our meals without being bothered in our cells, it's only because our elders fought for these fundamental rights.\"",
      "Presenting themselves as defenders of human rights may not be the usual methodology of drugs gangs.",
      "But nor does the DDPF come across as a classic far-left or anarchist organisation, which might more naturally be fighting for the cause.",
      "For one thing, such groups tend to have intellectual underpinning which means they write grammatical and properly spelled French. Nor have far-left groups till now made prisoners' rights a particular issue.",
      "Investigators have said that perpetrators of the attacks caught on video were dressed more like drugs-gang foot soldiers rather than far-left militants, who tend to come from a different social background.",
      "And in one location they wrote the wrong set of initials \u2013 DDFM \u2013 suggesting that their attachment to the supposed organisation was not exactly deep.",
      "The theory of foreign manipulation is taken seriously \u2013 especially after proven cases of Russian interference such as the spraying of Stars of David in Paris after the October 7 attacks.",
      "Relations with Algeria are also at an all-time low at the moment.",
      "But if the drugs gang theory is the favoured one, it is because means and motivation are both so easy to grasp.",
      "The French government currently includes an unusual tandem: an interior and a justice minister who are not rivals; who are both on the political right; and who have pledged to fight head-on the scourge that they say is the drugs trade.",
      "To this end Darmanin and Retailleau are currently steering a bill through parliament that they say will seriously hamper the drugs lords' ability to operate.",
      "A dedicated branch of the prosecutors' office will be created. There will be extra powers for investigators, and a special, protected status for informers.",
      "Even more of a threat to the drugs barons \u2013 so the government says \u2013 will be two newly converted prisons, where the 100 most powerful of them will be interned from later this year.",
      "In these top-security jails, there will be much stricter rules governing visits and communication with the outside world. New measures will be in place to stop the infiltration of mobile telephones (of which tens of thousands are known to circulate in French jails).",
      "The purpose is to prevent gang leaders from continuing their operations from behind bars \u2013 a security breach which has become widespread.",
      "The case of Mohamed Amra, the drugs-lord whose escape last year led to the murder of two prison-officers near Rouen, is typical.",
      "Prison staff who went on strike in protest told the BBC how laxity inside jails was undermining morale and presenting a growing security risk.",

    "summary": "BBC Verify looks at the evidence behind allegations that the Salvadoran mistakenly deported to a mega-prison was a dangerous gang member.",
    "story": [
      "The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia - a 29-year-old from El Salvador who was deported from the US in March - has prompted a legal showdown over the administration's immigration policy.",
      "Judges all the way up to the US Supreme Court have ruled that Mr Abrego Garcia was deported in error and that the US government should help \"facilitate\" his return to his home in Maryland.",
      "But the White House has accused Mr Abrego Garcia of being a member of the transnational Salvadorian gang MS-13, a designated foreign terrorist organisation, saying that he will \"will never live\" in the US again.",
      "Mr Abrego Garcia denies he is a member of the gang and he has not been convicted of any crime.",
      "BBC Verify has examined court documents and public records to determine what's known \u2013 and what is still unknown \u2013 about Mr Abrego Garcia and his alleged ties to MS-13.",
      "What do we know about alleged MS-13 links?",
      "Mr Abrego Garcia has acknowledged entering the US illegally in 2012, according to court documents.",
      "In March 2019 he was detained along with three other people in Hyattsville, Maryland, in the car park of a Home Depot.",
      "Officers at the Prince George's County Police Department said the men were \"loitering\" and subsequently identified Mr Abrego Garcia and two of the others as members of MS-13.",
      "In a document titled the \"Gang Field Interview Sheet\", the local police detailed their observations.",
      "They said Mr Abrego Garcia was wearing a \"Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie with rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents on the separate denominations\".",
      "Officers claimed the clothing was \"indicative of the Hispanic gang culture\" and that \"wearing the Chicago Bulls hat represents thay (sic) they are a member in good standing with the MS-13\".",
      "Steven Dudley, a journalist and author who has spent years studying the MS-13 gang, said that it is true that \"at some point, the Chicago Bulls logo with the horns became a stand-in of sorts for the MS-13's devil horns symbol\".",
      "But wearing the logo of the hugely popular basketball team, he added, is of course not exclusive to the gang.",
      "\"Any assertions about gang affiliation would need to be corroborated with testimony, criminal history, and other corroborating evidence,\" Mr Dudley said.",
      "According to the field interview sheet and other court documents, officers said they were also advised by a \"proven and reliable source\" that Mr Abrego Garcia was an active member of MS-13's \"westerns clique\", with the rank of \"chequeo\".",
      "However, Mr Dudley says that a \"chequeo\" is not a rank but is instead used to refer to recruits who are yet to be initiated.",
      "Lawyers for Mr Abrego Garcia's argued in court filings that the \"westerns clique\" is based in New York, where they say their client has never lived. And according to government documents, he has dismissed the information given to police against him as \"hearsay\".",
      "According to his lawyers, Mr Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of any criminal offence, including gang membership, in the US or in El Salvador. He lived in the US for 14 years, had three children and worked in construction, according to court records.",
      "But the judge who presided over his 2019 case said that based on the confidential information, there was sufficient evidence to support Mr Abrego Garcia's gang membership. That finding was later upheld by another judge.",
      "As a result Mr Abrego Garcia was refused bail and remained in custody. During this time he applied for asylum to prevent his deportation to El Salvador.",
      "In October 2019 he was granted a \"withholding of removal\" order, court documents show - a status different from asylum, but one which prevented the US government from sending him back to El Salvador because he could face harm.",
      "Mr Abrego Garcia's lawyers say that he was granted the status based on his \"well-founded\" fear of persecution by Barrio-18, the main rival gang of MS-13.",
      "He said that prior to him entering the US, his family and their business had been threatened and extorted by Barrio-18.",
      "Since 2019, when he was released with the protective order, Mr Abrego Garcia's lawyers say he has had yearly check-ins with immigration officials, which he has attended \"without fail and without incident\".",
      "What are the separate allegations against him?",
      "Mr Abrego Garcia has faced at least two other allegations of criminal activity, neither of which resulted in a conviction.",
      "In 2021, his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, filed a protective order petition against him, alleging that he had physically attacked her on multiple occasions, according to documents shared by the US Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Ms Vasquez Sura said in a statement on 16 April that she had decided not to follow through with the court process at the time and that she and her husband \"were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling\".",
      "She described her husband as \"a loving partner and father\" and has repeatedly denied he is an MS-13 gang member.",
      "On 15 April, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also accused Mr Abrego Garcia of involvement in human trafficking.",
      "She appeared to be referencing a report in the The Tennessee Star, a conservative news website, which said Mr Abrego Garcia was detained by a Tennessee highway patrol officer on suspicion of human trafficking in December 2022 while driving a vehicle carrying seven passengers.",
      "The report, which cited unnamed sources, said officers contacted the FBI and later released him and the passengers.",
      "The BBC has not independently verified the report and has contacted both Tennessee authorities and the FBI for comment, as well as Mr Abrego Garcia's lawyers.",

    "title": "Could JD Vance meet the most famous Catholic of them all?",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxn21l37d7o",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 23:52:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The US vice-president will meet Italy's prime minister but an audience at the Vatican could also happen, the BBC learns.",
    "story": [
      "When US Vice-President JD Vance comes to Rome on Friday, he is set to meet Italy's prime minister and the Vatican secretary of state.",
      "But one of his main objectives is not on the official schedule - to be seen alongside Pope Francis.",
      "According to four sources familiar with the matter, the vice-president, a devout Roman Catholic, is hoping for at least a brief encounter with the 88-year-old pontiff, which would become the focal point of his visit.",
      "Such a moment would carry powerful symbolic weight, politically and personally, particularly over Easter, the most important celebration in the Catholic calendar, said a source familiar with his thinking.",
      "It could also signal a thaw in relations between the Vatican and Washington after months of tension over issues such as moral leadership and migration, with the Pope having previously said that mass deportations of people fleeing poverty or persecution damaged \"the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families\".",
      "\"Pope Francis and JD Vance are today's most prominent Catholics, one at the head of the Church and the Catholic hierarchy, the other a layman who is now vice-president of the United States,\" said Father Roberto Regoli, professor of history of the Church at the Pontifical Gregorian University.",
      "\"A meeting between the leaders of two global powers of this calibre would have immense symbolic significance.\"",
      "The White House and the vice-president's office did not respond to questions from the BBC about Vance's trip, and the Vatican has not confirmed any formal or informal meeting with Vance.",
      "Pope Francis has been in poor health following a five-week hospital stay for double pneumonia.",
      "Since returning to the Vatican a month ago, he has cancelled most of his official appointments.",
      "How JD Vance sees the world - and why that matters",
      "How JD Vance sees the world - and why that matters",
      "However, as his condition improves, Pope Francis has begun making surprise appearances - last week, he briefly met King Charles III and Queen Camilla during their official visit to Italy.",
      "\"A photo with Pope Francis would be a major win for JD Vance, and it would also reflect Pope Francis's inclusive approach - his willingness to welcome and meet anyone, even those with differing visions or values,\" said David Gibson, director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Fordham University, the Jesuit university of New York.",
      "But if there is no encounter, he adds, there will inevitably be speculation about a snub or the Pope's health.",
      "While a potential meeting with the Pope is uncertain, another encounter has been firmly locked in for weeks - a formal handshake with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.",
      "A Catholic herself and standard-bearer of Europe's populist right, she is politically aligned with the US administration and shares their belief in taking a tough stance on migration.",
      "She is expected to receive the vice-president for a bilateral meeting during his visit, upon her return from Washington DC where she met Donald Trump on Thursday.",
      "The meeting could offer a further glimpse of the ideological alliances that Vance hopes to nurture in Europe, as Meloni has emerged as the natural mediator between the US and the EU, especially on thorny issues such as tariffs and trade.",
      "Vance and Meloni will later be joined by Italy's two deputy prime ministers, the League's Matteo Salvini and Forza Italia's Antonio Tajani, according to Italian officials.",
      "Vance's visit is the first to Europe since he delivered an ideological broadside against European leaders at the Munich Security Conference in February.",
      "He accused them of abandoning free speech, caving in to political correctness and losing touch with their citizens on issues like migration and national identity.",
      "That friction with the leaders on the continent also extends to the Vatican, where relations with the Trump administration have been strained by hardline immigration policies which have faced pushback from Catholic leaders and Pope Francis.",
      "Cuts to refugee programmes, the prospect of large-scale deportation plans, arrests in places of worship and efforts to curb birthright citizenship have been condemned by the US bishops' conference as being contrary to the common good.",
      "Pope Francis himself urged a more compassionate response to migration, drawing on Gospel teachings and the parable of the Good Samaritan.",
      "JD Vance - the 'hillbilly' Maga loyalist",
      "JD Vance - the 'hillbilly' Maga loyalist",
      "In a letter to US bishops in February, he expressed concern over the administration's policies and implicitly challenged Vance's attempts to use Catholic doctrine to justify the administration's immigration crackdown, saying that \"Christians know very well that it is only by affirming the infinite dignity of all that our own identity as persons and as communities reaches its maturity\".",
      "\"A meeting between Pope Francis and JD Vance would certainly underscore the stark contrast between their visions of Catholicism,\" said Gibson.",
      "\"Yet a meeting would serve both men - for Vance, a photo with the Pope could soften perceptions that he's an opponent of the Church; for Francis, it would demonstrate his welcoming approach, and, importantly, posing for a photo with JD Vance could mark [another] significant step in his return to public-facing duties.\"",
      "Others also see a benefit for Vance in associating with the moral authority of the papacy, if he does get a meeting or photograph with the man who leads the planet's 1.2 billion Catholics.",
      "How many Roman Catholics are there?",
      "How many Roman Catholics are there?",
      "He will have time with a highly ranked Vatican official, its secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. And he is expected to participate in ceremonies around Easter Sunday.",
      "The vice-president came to the faith relatively late in life. Raised in a largely non-practising, evangelical household, Vance spent part of his adolescence drawn to a Pentecostal church, only to later abandon organised religion altogether.",
      "It was not until August 2019, at the age of 35, that he formally converted to Catholicism at a Dominican priory in Cincinnati. Ohio.",
      "The decision, he has since explained, stemmed from a search for a moral and philosophical framework capable of making sense of the societal breakdowns he chronicled in his bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy.",
      "In a 2020 essay for the Catholic magazine The Lamp, Vance wrote candidly about his spiritual turn, describing his need for a worldview that could account for both personal responsibility and structural injustice."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4nqe3724vo",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 23:04:48 GMT",
    "summary": "There are concerns around what democracy could look like and the role of Islam in the new regime.",
    "story": [
      "On the morning of 8 December 2024, I waited anxiously at the Lebanese border, hoping to get into Syria as soon as the crossing opened, not knowing what to expect.",
      "Bashar al-Assad, the president of 24 years, was gone. Opposition fighters had advanced towards Damascus, taking major cities including Aleppo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing: Syria was free.",
      "Like many Syrians, I'd only ever known the country under the rule of Assad and his father Hafez, who had been in power from 1971 until 2000. Life under the Assads had meant more than 50 years of disappearances, incarceration - and the civil war that began in 2011 had claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Syrians.",
      "I'd been detained at the start of the uprising that year, and several times afterwards; I witnessed men lined up to be beaten and heard screams of torture. Even after I left the country in 2013, I learnt that security forces had broken into my apartment in Damascus and vandalised it.",
      "I assumed I'd lost my home country for good, then suddenly last year the dictatorship was toppled in just over a week. As I crossed the border into the country without fear of arrest, and watched rebel fighters shoot celebratory gunfire, while people rejoiced on the streets, I felt like laughing and crying at once.",
      "For weeks, Damascus's main Umayyad Square became a hub of celebrations. Young and old talked freely about politics and everywhere Syria's future was debated openly; among street vendors and taxi drivers, boys cleaning shoes. All of this was unthinkable under Assad, as Syrians could never protest freely for fear of reprisals.",
      "Only now, four months on, the situation is more complex. Though great strides have been made in gaining some social freedoms, there are growing concerns around what democracy will look like but also around the role of Islam in the new regime.",
      "So, how long might these social freedoms remain \u2013 or could, as some fear, the newly won liberties be short-lived?",
      "A return from exile for many",
      "At Rawda Caf\u00e9 in central Damascus, just across the road from Parliament, intellectuals gather around long tables to smoke shisha and discuss culture. Under Assad, political activists were picked up and arrested there. Rumour had it that some waiters were regime informants.",
      "Today, it's a very different picture. The caf\u00e9 hosts talks and music plays. Prominent figures who once fled the country have returned too \u2013 many are greeted by a band playing traditional songs with a giant drum.",
      "Syrian journalist Mohammad Ghannam is one of them. He tells me that he spent months in prisons during Assad's regime and later moved to France; his euphoria at returning is palpable.",
      "\"I think everyone who can come back, should come back to rebuild the country,\" he declares. \"There is a window to do whatever you want now compared with before 8 December 2024.\"",
      "Reflecting on the past, he adds: \"Even preachers in the mosques needed to get approval and know what they were going to preach. [Now] it's completely free. [At] Friday prayers the Imam was talking about how your personal freedom shouldn't step on other people's freedom.\"",
      "Odai al-Zobi has also recently returned to Syria after 14 years  \u2013 he left to study but says he was unable to come back before now because he was outspoken about the regime.",
      "\"My books were banned here,\" he tells me. \"Now there is no censorship, you can read whatever you want. I was very surprised that a lot of people want to read and want to know more.\"",
      "\"This is a big change,\" agrees Ali al-Atassi, a Syrian documentary-maker and son of former Syrian President Noureddine al-Atassi. (His father was deposed in a coup by Hafez al-Assad.)",
      "\"It changed the rules of the game, and opened a lot of perspectives for the country.\"",
      "Protecting the arts scene",
      "Syria's vibrant arts and culture scene has long been a source of the country's pride: the Assads supported it, wanting to present a rich culture to the world yet some artists and writers were killed for their views on the regime.",
      "Even carrying certain books was once cause for arrest. Today, however, all kinds of books are on display in shops around the capital - even political titles. Cinema clubs screen films that were previously banned too.",
      "For weeks after Assad's fall, the caretaker government didn't appoint a Minister of Culture, but musicians and artists grouped together to protect the culture scene.",
      "Now, however, there are fresh concerns: while Syria under Assad saw political debates repressed, some worry that repression by clerics could end up forbidding some forms of art seen as anti-religious.",
      "There is no clear evidence of this. Dr Maher Al Sharaa, the brother of the interim president, has been seen at the city's Opera House with his family; Vivaldi was played by Syrian musicians. The family looked like any modern one who would go on a weekend for theatre.",
      "And after the fall of Assad, a cultural event with talks about cinema, music, theatre and performances was held at Beit Farhi, a historic house in the heart of Damascus's Jewish quarter. An all-female orchestra played songs that praised revolutions and martyrs. Some in the audience were left in tears.",
      "\"It is great to have this opportunity to talk among us about how to protect and support the art scene in Syria,\" says Noura Murad, a choreographer.",
      "Mr al-Atassi also chooses to be optimistic. \"I believe the Syrians won't allow this regime to enter in their private lives, to create rules on how to behave in the public space.\"",
      "A concentration of power",
      "When Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad, was appointed by a military council on 29 January, he delivered a speech in which he stressed that the priority was to \"fill the power vacuum in a legitimate and legal way\".",
      "But months on, there is concern among some around the likelihood of building a lasting democracy. And there is no system in place to hold officials, including the president, accountable until a permanent constitution is adopted and elections are held.",
      "\"The past few months, the regime has not been ready to share power and allow other political and social forces to find their place in society,\" argues Mr Al-Atassi. \"Without opening up the political arena to other forces, I don't think Sharaa can bring Syria back to the international community.\"",
      "In February, hundreds gathered at the People's Palace in Damascus for a two-day national dialogue about Syria's future. Some critics argued that the meeting was organised in haste and was too short to cover all the key topics.",
      "According to Abdulhay Sayed, a Syrian legal expert and managing partner at Sayed and Sayed law firm, it was neither representative nor truly reflective of consensus.",
      "\"Large segments of Syrian society felt excluded or unrepresented,\" he argues. \"[It] was conceived as a mechanism to simulate wider assent.\"",
      "However, he concedes: \"It does reflect a certain willingness on the part of the new authorities to expand the scope of consultation.\"",
      "Sharaa, who was leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al-Qaeda affiliate and Islamist group that dominated the rebel alliance, has clearly stated his commitment to establishing a country with \"free and impartial elections\".",
      "He has also appointed a committee to work on a constitutional declaration, which laid out Syria's future over a five-year transitional period. However, the subsequent declaration didn't enshrine the separation of powers.",
      "\"He needs to show that he's more serious about political participation from all groups,\" says Mr Al-Atassi.",
      "There are some examples of this: a Christian female minister was appointed minister for social affairs, while head of the White Helmet civil defence group, became minister of emergencies and disasters. But some have raised questions about the appointment of Sharaa's brother as head of presidential affairs.",
      "\"High-ranking former HTS members now occupy key sovereign positions,\" adds Mr Sayed.",
      "Mr Al-Atassi also claims that \"highly qualified people in international law were not asked to participate in the Cabinet. They were overlooked.\"",
      "The Minister of Justice holds a degree in Sharia law (Islam's legal system, derived from the Quran), and is not an expert on Syria's Civil Code, which draws heavily on French and Ottoman law. One question being asked is whether codes based on Sharia law could be applied rather than civil ones.",
      "\"The new authorities have so far made no attempt to replace the existing legal codes with Sharia-inspired legislation,\" says Mr Sayed. However, he adds, \"this remains an area we continue to monitor closely.",
      "\"The most pressing concern is whether judicial independence will be restored and effectively safeguarded. This represents a major challenge.",
      "\"There is little indication that the new authorities are genuinely committed to re-establishing an independent judiciary.\"",
      "Freedom of women and religion",
      "Under Assad's regime, women had relatively equal rights and had been represented in parliament since the 1950s, as well as being present in society at all levels. There are no new written rules that might point to how that could change \u2013 but there are some worrying signs.",
      "Only one woman was appointed in the interim government. According to research by University College London and McGill University, women's rights advocates have raised concerns over HTS enforcing an interpretation of Islamic law, which could for example severely restrict women's mobility, dress and public participation.",
      "\"One important area to watch is whether women judges \u2013 who make up approximately 35 to 40 per cent of the judiciary \u2013 will face marginalisation or dismissal,\" says Mr Sayed. \"So far, we have seen no signs of such a trend, but continued vigilance is essential.\"",
      "As for religious freedoms, there have been no new laws or rulings restricting social life, but some Syrians report that they have seen what appear to be attempts to enforce Islamic rule.",
      "The Ministry of Justice has begun separating entry for men and women, plus there have been reports of men distributing flyers on buses and in Umayyad Mosque in Damascus asking women to wear full-faced veils.",
      "In Christian neighbourhoods in the capital, cars have been filmed driving through the streets with preachers advocating for Islam over loudspeakers. An order to shut down bars and restaurants in the old city's Christian quarter was only revoked after a public outcry.",
      "Some observers of Islam tell me they are worried. Damascus is known for its tolerance but there are fears in some quarters that the new authorities have a Salafi background (a strict, orthodox Sunni Muslim sect).",
      "\"There is an increasing call for a return to religious values,\" says Mr Sayed. \"This presents a profound challenge for those who still believe in democracy, the rule of law, and equal citizenship.\"",
      "However Husam Jazmati, a Syrian academic who researches Islamic movements at the civil society research organisation Impact, claims that Sharaa \"opposes both Islamist and non-Islamist political movements [and] neither wants to establish an Islamic state nor believes it's possible.",
      "\"They don't want to, and they can't\".",
      "Even if the government wanted to instil hardline practices, the question is whether they could? Alaa El Din Al Sayyek, an imam based in Damascus, thinks not. He argues that Syrians would reject any attempt to do so.",
      "\"It is impossible, our society will not accept it,\" he tells me. \"We have lived in harmony with different sects for years even during difficult times. The Quran says it clearly: no compulsion in religion.\"",
      "Competing visions for the future",
      "Today there are growing tensions: violence in coastal cities has left more than 1,400 people dead, many of them Alawites (part of Assad's minority sect). They were said to be revenge for attacks on Syrian security forces.",
      "Elsewhere, in the north east of the country, even though the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in 2019, camps still hold about 56,000 people, many of them the family members of Islamic State group (IS) suspects, more than five years after the jihadists' territorial defeat in Syria.",
      "The main question now facing the country, however, is how Syrians see their future. There are some tensions around this, which have seeped into a push-pull between the leadership and HTS, according to Mr Jazmati.",
      "He claims that while Sharaa's top circle wants to build \"a conservative, economically liberal\" state, \"they can't stop many of their members \u2013 those they've appointed in various positions and rely on because they're trusted \u2013 from trying to Islamise public life in Syria.\"",
      "The think tank International Crisis Group has similar concerns. It has said that it believes Syria is living \"on borrowed time\".",
      "\"The interim government is running out of funds, security forces are overstretched, poverty is deepening and insurgency is brewing at the periphery. Outsiders are meddling. Western sanctions deprive leaders of what they need to rebuild, while preventing fragmentation or a return to civil war.\"",
      "For Mr Al-Atassi, the solution is straightforward: He believes Sharaa needs to open up the political arena. \"There are no elections today in Syria, there are only nominations,\" he says. \"This is very dangerous.\"",
      "With a pause, he adds: \"It could be that a new dictatorship is in the making - but I don't believe that the Syrian people are ready, after five decades, to accept a new dictatorship.\"",
      "And as for the prospect of lasting democracy? \"We need to wait to see,\" he says. \"But I'm not at all optimistic.\"",
      "However there is a wider issue too. That is, could there be a wider loss of faith in the very idea of democracy given the country's recent history?",
      "Mr Sayed thinks so. \"Though the Assad-era constitutions formally proclaimed political freedoms\u2026 our experience of political modernity came in the form of shells falling on our heads, while our bodies were laid bare in detention camps,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Large segments of the Syrian population have lost faith in the promises of political modernity.\"",
      "Of the many challenges facing the new leadership, perhaps it is this that they would be wise to address first as they continue to carve out a new path for the future of Syria.",

    "summary": "Housing has taken a backseat in Canada's election to Donald Trump's tariffs, but advocates argue the affordability crisis is just as disruptive.",
    "story": [
      "Before Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened its sovereignty, the Canadian psyche was consumed with another major issue: housing affordability. With an election on the horizon, voters are wondering if any party has a plan to fix what has become a generational problem.",
      "Willow Yamauchi says she was just a \"regular\" person when she and her husband bought their family home in Vancouver 25 years ago for a modest sum of C$275,000 - around C$435,000 ($312,000; \u00a3236,400) in today's dollars.",
      "That same property is now worth several million.",
      "In the city in Canada's pacific northwest, Ms Yamauchi's story is as common as the rainy weather. The average price of a detached home in Vancouver in 2000 was around C$350,000. Now, it is more than C$2m.",
      "\"My husband and I were very privileged to be able to purchase a house when we did,\" the 52-year-old writer tells the BBC. As a member of Generation X, timing was on her side.",
      "The same, she says, cannot be said for younger people, who - without \"the bank of mom and dad\" - are effectively priced out of the city they grew up in.",
      "Vancouver, a cultural and economic hub with a population of less than one million, is often seen as the epicentre of Canada's housing crisis. A report by Chapman University in California last year listed it among the top \"impossibly unaffordable\" cities in the world.",
      "But it is not the only Canadian city where the cost of homes is out of reach for many. Canada as a whole has one of the highest house-price-to-income ratios among developed nations.",
      "In 2021, the average household income after taxes in Canada was around C$88,000, according to national data. That same year, the average home price hit C$713,500 - more than eight times higher. The gap is even larger in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver.",
      "For many Canadians, housing is one of the top issues in the federal election, eclipsed only recently by US President Donald Trump and his tariffs on Canada. Before Trump, concerns on housing affordability had boosted the Conservative Party, which has consistently been seen as the best equipped to fix the crisis. Its success on pocketbook issues in general had threatened to collapse of the governing Liberal party, which only recently catapulted to the top of the polls in the wake of a trade war with the US.",
      "Even with the Trump factor, the topic featured prominently in the two federal leaders debate this week. During the French debate, moderator and journalist Patrice Roy displayed figures showing how much home prices had increased in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver in the last decade.",
      "\"I'm sure this won't come as a surprise,\" Mr Roy told the federal leaders, before asking for their plans on how they would fix the crisis.",
      "Polls show young people are especially worried about the housing crisis and what it means for their future.",
      "Speaking to students at the University of British Columbia's (UBC) Vancouver campus, it quickly became clear that the issue was top of mind for many.",
      "Many said they have either opted to live at home during their studies to save on costs, or are paying anywhere from C$1,100 to C$1,500 for a single room near campus, often in a home shared with five or six others.",
      "Emily Chu, a 24-year-old who is in her final semester at UBC, says that she at one point had to delay her studies by two years in order to work, as she struggled to afford paying both tuition and rent.",
      "She now shares an apartment with her older brother, who works full-time and pays the majority of the rent. Ms Chu considers herself one of the lucky ones.",
      "As for home ownership in the future, she says \"that's not even possible\" for most people her age. \"Everybody kind of assumes that we can't ever own housing.\"",
      "Young professionals with well-paying jobs, like Margareta Dovgal, are also priced out. The 28-year-old director at Vancouver-based non-profit Resource Works told the BBC that she has considered moving to the neighbouring province of Alberta due to its lower cost of living, despite being a lifelong and \"committed Vancouverite\".",
      "Still, Calgary, Alberta's largest city, saw house prices increase by 15% in 2024 from the previous year as the city experienced its highest population growth rate since 2001.",
      "The root causes of Canada's housing affordability crisis are complex. One of the main issues is a supply that has not kept up with a growing population, which has driven up costs for both buyers and renters.",
      "The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the national housing agency, estimates that more than 3.8 million homes need to be built in the next six years to address the shortage.",
      "Construction of new housing, however, has been well below that target, raising questions on whether Canada will meet this goal. Experts say barriers to ramping building include the high cost and scarcity of land in urban areas, where most Canadians tend to live and work.",
      "There are also regional barriers, like city zoning laws that prevent the construction of more affordable, higher density housing - including apartment buildings or multiplexes - in some neighbourhoods.",
      "Daniel Oleksiuk, co-founder of the advocacy group Abundant Housing Vancouver, says his city is one example, where more than half of the land has historically been zoned for single-family homes.",
      "\"We've kept almost all of the land reserved,\" Mr Oleksiuk told the BBC. \"There are whole neighbourhoods where all you have is three to five million dollar homes.\"",
      "On the campaign trail, each major federal party has put forward a plan to fix the crisis, all with the goal of building as many homes as quickly as possible.",
      "The Liberals, led by Mark Carney, said their aim is to build 500,000 new homes a year with the help of a new government agency called Build Canada Homes that would oversee and finance the construction of affordable housing in Canada - a plan similar to one implemented after the Second World War to house veterans.",
      "Critics have questioned whether Carney's target is viable, as it would require Canada to more than double its current construction rate.",
      "Meanwhile, the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, vowed to tie federal funding to housing starts by rewarding cities that build more homes and penalising those that block construction - a carrot-and-stick approach.",
      "Poilievre also promised to remove federal taxes on newly constructed homes in an effort to cut costs to would-be homebuyers. Critics, however, say this policy may have minimal effect, as most homes purchased in Canada are resold, rather than brand new.",
      "Voters who spoke to the BBC say they welcome any plan to ramp up housing construction in Canada.",
      "While much of housing is governed by provinces and cities, Ms Dovgal notes that the federal government has an ability \"to lead persuasively\" and implement measures that make it cheaper and easier to build across the country.",
      "But others watching the issue closely caution that the steps proposed may not be enough.",
      "Paul Kershaw, a public policy professor at UBC and founder of think tank Generation Squeeze, argues that politicians have failed to address the elephant in the room: the wealth older homeowners have generated off the housing crisis.",
      "\"The political bargain has asked younger Canadians to suffer higher rents and mortgages in order to protect those higher home values,\" Kershaw notes.",
      "\"None of the parties are really naming that generational tension,\" he says, adding that politicians may privately feel there is a political risk in trying to stall the cost of housing, and thus, older Canadians' assets.",
      "Prof Kershaw calls this a \"cultural problem\", and says that parties should also focus on reducing costs for younger people as a way to alleviate this generational burden.",
      "Fixing the housing crisis, he argues, is just as integral as asserting sovereignty and prosperity in the face of threats posed by Trump's tariffs.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 04:27:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Ambitious economies like Vietnam and Indonesia are stuck between China and the US as the trade war escalates.",
    "story": [
      "When US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in his first term, Vietnamese entrepreneur Hao Le saw an opportunity.",
      "His company is one of hundreds of businesses that have emerged to compete with Chinese exports that have increasingly been facing restrictions from the West.",
      "Le's SHDC Electronics, which sits in the budding industrial hub of Hai Duong, sells $2m (\u00a31.5m) worth of phone and computer accessories every month to the United States.",
      "But that revenue could dry up if Trump imposes 46% tariffs on Vietnamese goods, a plan that is currently on hold until early July.  That would be \"catastrophic for our business,\" Le says.",
      "And selling to Vietnamese consumers is not an option, he adds: \"We cannot compete with Chinese products. This is not just our challenge. Many Vietnamese companies are struggling in their own home market.\"",
      "Trump tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers. But they also opened new doors for other businesses, often into global supply chains that wanted to cut their dependence on China.",
      "But Trump 2.0 threaten to shut those doors, which it it sees as an unacceptable loophole. And that's a blow for fast-growing economies like Vietnam and Indonesia that are gunning to be key players in industries from chips to electric vehicles.",
      "How were Donald Trump's tariffs calculated?",
      "They also find themselves stuck between the world's two biggest economies - China, a powerful neighbour and their biggest trading partner, and the US, a key export market, which could be looking to strike a deal at Beijing's expense.",
      "And so Xi Jinping's long-planned trip to Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week took on fresh urgency.",
      "All three countries rolled out the the red carpet for him, but Trump saw it as more evidence of the them conspiring to \"screw\" the US.",
      "The White House will use its upcoming negotiations with smaller nations to pressure them into limiting their dealings with Beijing, according to reports.",
      "But that could be a fanciful ambition given the amount of money flowing between   China and South East Asia.",
      "In 2024, China earned a record $3.5tn from exports - 16% of those went to South East Asia, its biggest market. Beijing, in turn, has paid for railways in Vietnam, dams in Cambodia and ports in Malaysia as part of its \"Belt and Road\" infratructure programme that seeks to boost ties abroad.",
      "\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC on Tuesday, ahead of Xi's visit.",
      "\"If the issue is about something that we feel is against our interest, then we will protect [ourselves].\"",
      "A wake-up call",
      "In the days after Trump unveiled his sweeping tariffs, South East Asian governments scrambled into deal-making mode.",
      "In what Trump described as a \"very productive call\" with Vietnamese leader To Lam, the latter offered to completely scrap tariffs on US goods.",
      "The US market is crucial to Vietnam, an emerging electronics powerhouse where manufacturing giants like Samsung, Intel and Foxconn, the Taiwanese firm contracted to make iPhones, have set up shop.",
      "Meanwhile, Thai officials are headed to Washington with a plan that includes higher US imports and investments. The US is their largest export market, so they are hoping to avoid the 36% levy on Thailand that Trump may reinstate.",
      "\"We will tell the US government that Thailand is not only an exporter but also an ally and economic partner that the US can rely on in the long term,\" Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said.",
      "The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) has ruled out retaliation against Trump's tariffs, instead choosing to emphasise their economic and political importance to the US.",
      "\"We understand the concerns of the US,\" Mr Zafrul told the BBC. \"That's why we need to show that actually we, Asean, especially Malaysia, can be that bridge.\"",
      "It's a role that South East Asia's export-driven economies have played well - they have benefitted from both Chinese and US trade and investment. But Trump's paused levies could derail that.",
      "Take Malaysia, for instance. In recent years, chip manufacturers from the US and elsewhere have invested there, as Washington blocks the sale of advanced tech to China. Last year China imported $18bn worth of chips from Malaysia. These chips are used in Chinese-made electronics, such as iPhones, typically bound for the US.",
      "Trump's proposed tariffs on Malaysia - 24% - could cut off the multi-billion dollar US market. But that's not all.",
      "\"If this continues, then companies will have to rethink their investment commitments,\" Mr Zafrul says. \"This will have an impact not just on Malaysia's economy, but on the global economy.\"",
      "Then there is Indonesia, which could face 32% tariffs, and is home to vast nickel reserves and has its sights set on the global electric vehicle supply chain.",
      "Cambodia, a Chinese ally, faces the steepest levies: 49%. One of the poorest countries in the region, it has thrived as a trans-shipment hub for Chinese businesses seeking to skirt US tariffs. Chinese businesses currently own or operate 90% of the clothes factories, which mainly export to the US.",
      "Trump may have hit pause on these tariffs but \"the damage is done,\" says Doris Liew, an economist at Malaysia's Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs.",
      "\"This serves as a wake-up call for the region, not only to reduce reliance on the US, but also to re-balance overdependence on any single trade and export partner.\"",
      "China's loss and South East Asia's gain",
      "In these uncertain times , Xi Jinping is trying to send a steadfast message: Let's join hands and resist \"bullying\" from the US.",
      "That is no easy task because South East Asia also has trade tensions with Beijing.",
      "In Indonesia, business owner Isma Savitri is worried that Trump's 145% tariffs on China means more competition from Chinese rivals who can no longer export to the US.",
      "\"Small businesses like us feel squeezed,\" says the owner of sleepwear brand Helopopy. \"We are struggling to survive against an onslaught of ultra-cheap Chinese products.\"",
      "One of Helopopy's popular pyjamas sells for $7.10 (119,000 Indonesian rupiah). Isma says she has seen similar designs from China going for around half that price.",
      "\"South East Asia, being close by, with open trade regimes and fast-growing markets, naturally became the dumping ground,\" says Nguyen Khac Giang, visiting fellow at the ISEAS Yusof-Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"Politically, many countries are reluctant to confront Beijing, which adds another layer of vulnerability.\"",
      "While consumers have welcomed competitively-priced Chinese products - from clothes to shoes to phones - thousands of local businesses have not been able to match such low prices.",
      "More than 100 factories in Thailand have closed every month for the last two years, according to an estimate from a Thai think tank. During the same period in Indonesia, around 250,000 textile workers were laid off after some 60 garment manufacturers shut, local trade associations say  - including Sritex, once the region's largest textile maker.",
      "\"When we see the news, there are lots of imported products flooding the domestic market, which messes up our own market,\" Mujiati, a worker who was laid off from Sritex in February after 30 years, tells the BBC.",
      "\"Maybe it just wasn't our luck,\" says the 50-year-old, who is still hunting for work. \"Who can we complain to? There's no-one.\"",
      "South East Asian governments responded with a wave of protectionism, as local businesses demanded to be shielded from the impact of Chinese imports.",
      "Last year Indonesia considered 200% tariffs on a range of Chinese goods and blocked e-commerce site Temu, popular among Chinese merchants. Thailand tightened inspections of imports and imposed additional tax on goods worth less than 1,500 Thai baht ($45; \u00a334).",
      "This year Vietnam has twice imposed temporary anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel products. And after Trump's latest tariffs announcement, Vietnam is reportedly set to crack down on Chinese goods being trans-shipped via its territory to the US.",
      "Allaying these fears would have been on Xi's agenda this week.",
      "China is concerned that channelling its US-bound exports to the rest of the world would \"end up really alienating and aggravating\" its trading partners, David Rennie, the former Beijing bureau chief for the Economist newspaper, told BBC's Newshour.",
      "\"If a tidal wave of Chinese exports ends up swamping those markets and damaging employment and jobs \u2026 that's a massive diplomatic and geopolitical headache for the Chinese leadership.\"",
      "China has not always had an easy relationship with this region. Barring Laos, Cambodia and a war-torn Myanmar, the others are wary of Beijing's ambitions. Territorial disputes in the South China have soured ties with the Philippines. This is also an issue with others such as Vietnam and Malaysia, but trade has been a balancing factor.",
      "But that might change now, experts say.",
      "\"South East Asia had to think about whether they really wanted to offend China. Now this complicates things,\" says Chong Ja-Ian, associate professor at the National University of Singapore.",
      "China's loss could be South East Asia's gain.",
      "Hao Le, in Vietnam, says he has seen a surge in enquiries from American customers scouting for new electronics suppliers, outside of China: \"In the past, US buyers would take months to switch suppliers. Today, such decisions are made within days.\"",
      "Malaysia, with sprawling rubber plantations and the world's largest medical rubber glove maker, has nearly half the world's market for rubber gloves. But it is poised to grab a bigger share from its main competitor, China.",
      "The region still faces a 10% baseline tariff, like most of the world. And that is bad news, says Oon Kim Hung, president of the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association.",
      "But even if the paused tariffs kick in, he says, customers will find paying an additional 24% on Malaysian gloves vastly preferable to the 145% levy they will have to cough up for Chinese-made gloves.",
      "\"We're not exactly jumping with joy, but this may well benefit our manufacturers, as well as those in Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 21:49:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Ola, once a rising star, is facing falling sales amid rising competition and regulatory scrutiny.",
    "story": [
      "It was once the Indian start-up world's shining star, but Ola is now battling a multitude of crises.",
      "Founded in 2010, it quickly became a household name, expanding from ride-hailing to electric vehicles and battery cells, challenging Uber along the way.",
      "The company jumped on the AI bandwagon in 2023 with Krutrim, India's first AI company valued at over $1bn.",
      "Marquee global investors such as Japan's SoftBank, US-based Tiger Global and Singapore's Temasek bankrolled this expansion. Last year, Ola's electric vehicles (EV) arm raised close to $734m (\u00a3567m) in a blockbuster initial public offering (IPO), India's biggest in 2024.",
      "But this ambitious rise has been accompanied by a series of controversies lately, particularly at its EV arm.",
      "Ola Electric has lost close to 70% of its value in the seven months since the IPO was launched. It is facing competition from more established two-wheeler giants, along with mounting regulatory scrutiny.",
      "Sales of Ola's scooters are down to less than half from April last year and the company's losses have widened. Customers have posted videos on social media of Ola scooters going up in flames or breaking down mid-ride.",
      "There's a government inquiry under way at hundreds of newly-opened Ola showrooms regarding licences and registrations. One of its vendors also filed an insolvency plea against the company, which Ola said in a statement to stock exchanges that it had settled.",
      "The BBC has learnt from former employees and industry sources that delayed payments have led to many major suppliers and logistics partners ending ties with them.",
      "Ola has been cutting jobs, restructuring operations and automating functions in a bid to reduce costs and trim losses. Media reports say it has undertaken a second round of layoffs since November, with over 1,000 roles axed.",
      "The BBC sent detailed questions to Ola about these issues. The company shared links to some of its earlier press statements, not responding specifically to all the queries.",
      "So, what's gone wrong?",
      "Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal positioned the company as Tesla's two-wheeler equivalent, solving the emissions problem for the price-sensitive Indian market.",
      "He poured in millions of marketing dollars, opening Ola showrooms across India, even delivering scooters at the doorstep of people who'd made online bookings.",
      "But Ola has struggled to read the market well, says Rohit Paradkar, an analyst with the auto magazine Overdrive.",
      "Its scooter is modelled on the AppScooter from Etergo, a Dutch start-up that Ola Electric acquired in 2020.",
      "Several former employees told the BBC that Ola's first EV scooter was launched without many changes to Etergo's version. A former employee who worked in the compliance department told the BBC that clearances were rushed through to meet unrealistic launch deadlines.",
      "In response to queries, Ola referred to an October 2023 blog post where it addressed the \"myth\" that the vehicle had \"not been engineered and tested for India\". It said it had \"fully re-engineered\" Etergo's scooter and tested it for \"Indian conditions\".",
      "\"The whole vehicle has been tested at three levels [for India] - digital simulations, component tests and vehicular lab tests, and vehicular field tests,\" it said in the post.",
      "But several safety-related incidents reported by customers have raised questions.",
      "Some scooters began catching fire which, auto experts say, was likely due to short-circuits or faulty battery management system.",
      "Ola recalled more than 1,400 first-generation scooters in 2022 to investigate the fires, but the report was not publicly released. It had then said the battery systems were compliant for Indian and European standards but didn't explain what caused the fires.",
      "Some riders also reported the front suspension - which holds the wheel in place - breaking mid-ride, causing injuries.",
      "In early 2023, after such an accident, Ola called it a rare case, noting there were only a few such issues among 150,000 scooters.",
      "The front fork arm, they said, had a significant safety margin for accidents and was designed to handle 80% more load than what it would typically experience during daily use.",
      "Meanwhile, Ola's rivals - mostly established automakers - have rolled out electric scooters smoothly, adding to the pressure on the company.",
      "Their entry shook the market. Ola's share had plunged from 52% to 19% by December, then recovered to 25% in January.",
      "Ola aims to sell 50,000 units monthly to turn profitable, but analysts doubt the target, despite the company saying recent restructuring has helped it achieve $10m monthly savings and faster deliveries.",
      "Government data shows that less than 10,000 scooters were sold in February, but Ola claims 25,000, blaming registration delays due to vendor contract changes. The federal transport ministry has issued notices over the discrepancy. Ola said it had registered over 23,000 scooters sold in March and held a 30% market share for the fiscal year.",
      "But competing scooters with fewer features are now outselling Ola simply because they come from trusted, well-established brands, said Jay Kale, executive vice-president and auto analyst at Elara Capital.",
      "To push sales, Ola has offered deep discounts, launching newer models at cheaper price points. But losses have widened to $65m in the October-December quarter from $43.6m a year ago.",
      "Besides product issues, the reliability of its customer service has been another major issue, says Kale.",
      "When angry customers flooded social media and consumer helplines with complaints about the fires and front suspension, their service requests were reportedly unanswered for days.",
      "At one point, thousands of complaints were piling up monthly, a former employee at Ola told the BBC. India's consumer rights agency, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), also sent a notice to Ola after it got 10,000 complaints over the period of a year.",
      "But since Ola had eschewed the established dealer route in a bid to sell directly to buyers and had just a few service centres, aggrieved consumers had few places to turn to.",
      "Late last year, Ola wrote to the CCPA that it had a \"robust mechanism to address complaints\", and that most raised with the regulator had been satisfactorily resolved.",
      "Aggarwal was initially dismissive of the problems on social media but later announced that Ola would be opening nearly 4,000 stores with service facilities, following a heated public exchange on X with a stand-up comedian who took up the customers' cause.",
      "A majority of these new centres, however, came under the government's scanner for lacking relevant licences to store and sell vehicles.",
      "On 21 March, Ola confirmed investigations in four states and said it was responding to authorities.",
      "The sharp turn in Ola's fortunes is making investors - especially those who bought in at high IPO valuations - nervous.",
      "Ola has been a key player in India's push to cut carbon emissions and expand manufacturing.",
      "It benefits from two separate state subsidies, one to make scooters and the second to set up its own 20 gigawatt EV battery plant. But Reuters has reported that the costly gigafactory project is delayed and has missed a key milestone, potentially leading to penalties.",
      "Critics say Ola's troubles emanate from typical culture issues that plague many start-ups - including CEO-driven decision-making, constant pivots and unrealistic, high-pressure deadlines.",
      "\"Software mindsets don't work with hardware products, which need time to build,\" said Deepesh Rathore, who used to head product strategy at Ola Electric and now runs consultancy firm Insight EV.",
      "Some top executives across the wider company have quit recently, including a former Ola Cab CEO who quit within months. Key leaders in tech, marketing, sales and business also left last year.",
      "Experts say the exits have also affected Ola's efforts to fix product and service issues.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has scrapped a plan to offer help curbing measles in Texas schools after some staff working on the agency's response to this year's record outbreak of the virus were warned they could face layoffs, an agency employee said.",
      "CDC officials had initially weighed expanding a service they had been offering to hospitals in Texas \u2014 onsite assessments to root out how errors in ventilation and air filtration could be enabling spread of the virus \u2013 to other kinds of facilities like schools as well.",
      "\"Being on the ground allows us to actually look at the filters that are in place, look at the HVAC systems, how they're set up, how they're being used, how they're being monitored. And after seeing what we did, I'm glad we did,\" Dylan Neu, who had led the CDC's ventilation assessments in Texas, told CBS News.",
      "Neu is a biomedical engineer for the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, which was largely eliminated by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s first wave of layoffs earlier this month.",
      "Two experts from NIOSH \u2014 Neu and an industrial hygienist \u2014 were first sent to Texas on March 20 at the state's request. They found a number of issues at hospitals in Texas that had been actively treating measles patients during the outbreak, Neu said.",
      "The agency's teams do careful inspections of the hospital's facilities, assessing how air is moving, he said, which can be difficult to accurately do over the phone with people unfamiliar with the technical details of how HVAC systems work.",
      "In one example, an isolation room at a hospital was found to have been pressurized wrongly, with air flowing out of the room with the measles patient, Neu said. Another hospital had skipped a key step in setting up an air filter in their waiting room: unwrapping the filter before turning it on.",
      "\"They might say in an interview, 'Yeah, we purchased HEPA filters. They've been running in the waiting room.' But if they're not actually out of the plastic bag, they're not doing what they think they're doing,\" Neu said.",
      "While Neu remains on the job for now, he received a notice on April 1 warning him to expect to be laid off by HHS in the coming weeks.",
      "\"This action is necessary to align our workforce with the agency's current and future needs and to ensure the efficient and effective operation of our programs,\" Neu's notice from the department said.",
      "Neu said he received the notice while in his hotel room in Texas, as he prepared to return from his deployment. Most of his colleagues and the leadership above him within NIOSH have either been laid off, offered reassignments to other agencies or warned to expect cuts.",
      "\"My current understanding is that I'll be working in the office until the end of this month, and then I'll be on 60 days administrative leave until June 30th, and then we'll be separated at that point,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Some states want to block SNAP recipients from using benefits to buy sugary foods as part of the \"make America healthy again\" movement.",
    "story": [
      "The federal food stamp program is facing scrutiny in some states that want to block enrollees from using their government benefits to buy soda and candy.",
      "Three Republican-led states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho and Indiana \u2014 on Tuesday moved to ban purchases of soda and candy with benefits provided by the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Those states have a combined total of roughly 1 million residents on SNAP out of the program's total 41.7 million U.S. participants.",
      "Other states are also likely to restrict SNAP recipients' food purchases, experts say. Lawmakers in states including Arizona, Kansas and Tennessee\u00a0have introduced similar measures to curtail food stamp purchases of sugary foods and drinks.",
      "The rationale for such legislation is the view that blocking low-income Americans from using food stamps on soda and candy will help improve their health. But anti-hunger advocates say that these restrictions will add to negative perceptions of receiving food aid, while also being unlikely to improve recipients' eating habits.",
      "\"It's stigmatizing to say, 'You who are low income, we don't trust you to make the right choices,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger research group.",
      "Instead, she said, these states would be better off focusing on the biggest obstacle to healthy eating: the high cost of groceries, particularly the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Because SNAP provides an average individual monthly benefit of $187, or a little over $6 per day, many recipients fill up by purchasing the cheapest, most calorie-dense foods they can afford, she added.",
      "Grocery costs soared during the pandemic, surging almost 24% from 2020 to 2024 and outpacing overall inflation by almost three percentage points, according to an analysis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Food prices aren't expected to drop anytime soon, with the USDA forecasting that groceries could rise 2.7% in 2025, adding to the challenges SNAP recipients face in affording healthy food.",
      "Make America healthy again?",
      "In announcing plans to block food stamp purchases of soda and candy, Idaho Governor Brad Little on Tuesday\u00a0proclaimed that the state \"welcomes the MAHA movement,\" referring to the \"make America healthy again\" movement started by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders credited the Trump administration with placing \"a laser focus on solving America's chronic disease epidemic,\" saying that banning candy and soda from food stamp purchases is \"a great place to start.\"",
      "About 80 cents of every $1 in SNAP benefits is used to purchase staples like meat, bread, milk, cereal and rice, with the remainder going to salty snacks, candy and sweetened beverages. Households that rely on food stamps have very similar patterns of spending to households not on food stamps, according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "The Arkansas plan, which would take effect in July 2026, would exclude soda, including no- and low-calorie soda; fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice; \"unhealthy drinks;\" candy, including confections made with flour, like Kit Kat bars; and artificially sweetened candy.",
      "It also would allow participants to use benefits to buy hot rotisserie chicken, which is excluded from the program now under the SNAP program's longstanding ban on hot foods. Food stamp recipients also would be barred from using their benefits to buy nonfood items, such as soap or toothpaste, as well as alcohol or tobacco.",
      "Some industries are pushing back against the SNAP restrictions. Representatives for American Beverage accused state and federal officials of \"choosing to be the food police rather than take truly meaningful steps to lift people off SNAP with good-paying jobs.\"",
      "The National Confectioners Association called the approach \"misguided.\"",
      "\"SNAP participants and non-SNAP participants alike understand that chocolate and candy are treats \u2014 not meal replacements,\" spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health\"",
      "Over the past two decades, lawmakers from both political parties have proposed halting SNAP payments for everything from soda to\u00a0 steak. To date, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the SNAP program, hasn't granted the required waivers for states to curb food stamp purchases.",
      "But the Trump administration is signaling that it will grant the waivers requested this week, with USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins saying in a Tuesday statement\u00a0that she plans to quickly approve Arkansas' request.",
      "\"I have said since my confirmation that USDA has a role to play in improving nutrition programs to better serve individuals in need of support, all while recognizing the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Rollins said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our shared goal should be to lift millions of Americans out of dependency and into hopeful futures and insert new energy and ideas into long-ignored programs like diet-related, chronic disease.\"",
      "Blocking SNAP purchases of candy and soda wouldn't keep recipients from using their own money to buy such items, as food stamp benefits typically pay for roughly\u00a0two-thirds of a household's grocery costs.",
      "But advocates of banning unhealthy foods from SNAP say that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for supporting bad eating habits.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health,\" Sanders said Tuesday at a news conference with Rollins in Little Rock, Arkansas. \"We're paying for it on the front end and the back end.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:08:18 -0400",
    "summary": "CDC experts were not made available to discuss the findings showing a rise in autism prevalence.",
    "story": [
      "One out of 31 children \u2014 more than 3% of kids \u2014 have been identified with autism, according to the latest results published Tuesday from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that tracks trends of autism's prevalence across some communities in the U.S.",
      "\"They've again gone up dramatically, just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, 1 out of 31 kids. And when I was, in my generation today, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday in Indiana, announcing the new findings. \"And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease.\"",
      "Kennedy often cites the CDC's figures from this study as evidence for his claim that the U.S. is now seeing a growing \"epidemic\"\u00a0of autism, which experts and advocacy groups have criticized as stigmatizing and misleading.",
      "\"As the report indicates, more children have access to evaluations for autism and more children are being identified as autistic. This is encouraging because when children are identified early, appropriate supports and services can be tailored to help them, and their families thrive,\" said Dr. Kristin Sohl, of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism, in a statement shared before Kennedy's remarks and the report's release.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told \"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0that the definition of what autism is has also expanded.",
      "\"It's a spectrum. It's not just one thing. ... So that's part of it,\" she said. \"We also are being much more aggressive about looking for it \u2014 pediatricians, educators.\"",
      "The definitions used in this study are also quite broad, Gounder added.",
      "\"They were looking at both health records, educational records, did a student access special ed supports, that sort of thing,\" she said. \"So part of it is the way in which we're looking for it. But there also does seem to be an underlying increase that has been occurring over time.\"",
      "For years, CDC scientists have said that the data indicating a rise in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, could be reflecting improved screening and access to autism services in some communities. However, the agency's experts were not made available for a press briefing about the latest findings, marking a change from previous years.",
      "\"Research has not demonstrated that living in certain communities puts children at greater risk for developing ASD,\" the CDC's authors said in their report.",
      "The study's authors said estimated autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black and Hispanic children compared to White children. Factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning could be contributing to this gap, the report says.",
      "Data from sites in 16 communities were collected for the new CDC report. The last report found a rate of 1 in 36 children through 2020, based on data from 11 communities.",
      "While the network's data is not nationally representative, figures from other federally-funded surveys and studies have also tracked a rise in autism's prevalence over the past two decades, accelerating in the early 2000s.",
      "\"Autistic children add value to our communities. Advocating for resources and funding to support autistic people across the lifespan is essential for a productive and healthy America,\" Sohl said in the statement.",
      "It comes as federal spending into autism research has also surged, largely going into efforts to study the biology suspected to underlie the condition. While scientists have linked up to 90% of autism to genetic traits, other factors are also suspected to play a role in changing its risk.",
      "Kennedy has said he believes \"an environmental toxin\" is causing autism, pointing to a range of potential culprits from food contaminants to vaccines.",
      "Many studies have debunked the claim that vaccines cause autism. But there is less research for some other factors that studies suggest might be linked to autism, ranging from pesticides to time between pregnancies.",
      "\"While the number of studies investigating the epidemiology of autism is increasing, most potential environmental factors have not been investigated sufficiently to draw firm conclusions,\" the federal government's autism research coordination office said in 2023.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Kennedy claimed that autism was preventable and said that it was \"unforgivable that we have not yet identified the underlying causes.\"",
      "\"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September,\" he said. Leading autism organizations have expressed skepticism over that promise and concern that he will revive debunked theories.",
      "Finding an answer to the cause or causes of autism by September is \"not realistic,\" Gounder said.",
      "\"Some of the theories include diabetes during pregnancy that might be affecting the development of the child, air pollution, exposure to micro plastics, antibiotic use and the way that changes the microbiome and the gut,\" she said. \"There's a whole bunch of different theories. And again, because it's so many different diseases actually labeled Autism Spectrum Disorder, it's going to take a while to really tease that out.\"",
      "The CDC also released a statement noting that prevalence varied widely between different sites in the study. That variation \"could reflect differences in availability of services for early detection, evaluation, and diagnostic practices,\" Dr. Karyl Rattay, head of the CDC's Division of Human Development and Disability, said.",
      "CDC delayed report, barred agency experts from media",
      "The CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities was initially planning to release the report in March this year, multiple officials told CBS News. Its publication was pushed back by CDC officials amid a department-wide pause on communications ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Plans to make the agency's experts available to explain and interpret the results were also scrapped, said multiple CDC officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ahead of the agency's last release of autism figures in 2023, CDC scientists appeared at press briefings and interviews with media outlets about the report.",
      "That year, news outlets were also provided with embargoed copies of the report ahead of time to give journalists time to prepare their reports and interview experts. This longstanding practice has also now been abandoned agency-wide under the Trump administration, officials said, both for the autism report and many other studies published by the agency.",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to requests for the embargoed report, or to make any experts available for an interview.",
      "Most of the communications staff working with the center have also been laid off, officials said, as part of Kennedy's sweeping restructuring of the department this month.",
      "The branch responsible for producing the autism figures is one of the few teams remaining on the job in the CDC's birth defects and disabilities center.",

      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president, who has previously criticized his performance. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair.",
      "In a meeting Thursday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Mr. Trump said of Powell, \"Oh, he'll leave. If I ask him to, he'll be out of there.\"",
      "Mr.\u00a0Trump nominated Powell\u00a0to lead the Fed in 2017, and Powell was re-nominated by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Over the years, Powell has steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. In December, he said that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials.",
      "Whether the White House chooses to respect the Fed's independence remains to be seen. Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, ranging from refusing to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election to, since his return to power in January, empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the billionaire's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Research Group, notes that Mr. Trump this week fired two Democrats on the board of another financial regulator, the National Credit Union Administration. In March, the White House also dismissed two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, which historically has operated as an independent, bipartisan commission.",
      "\"The President appears to be moving closer to justifying removal of Democrats on the Federal Reserve Board. By firing the two Democrats from the credit union regulator, the president is establishing the precedent that he has total discretion over financial regulators, which could include the Federal Reserve,\" Seiberg said in a report.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 18:20:33 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has suggested stripping Harvard of its tax-exempt status, a step that experts say would be unusual and face  legal challenges.",
    "story": [
      "The battle between President Trump and Harvard University has moved to a new front, with the IRS now considering whether to revoke the Ivy League school's tax-exempt status.",
      "A final decision has not yet been made by the IRS, CBS News' Aaron Navarro reports. But the effort comes after Mr. Trump on Tuesday\u00a0suggested that Harvard could lose its tax exemption. The tax agency's move to consider whether to strip Harvard of its designation as a 501(c)(3) organization was earlier reported by CNN.",
      "The IRS has awarded tax-exempt status to almost 2 million organizations, ranging from universities like Harvard to charities such as churches and foundations. The designation exempts these groups from paying federal income taxes, while donations to these groups are considered tax-deductible by the IRS.",
      "Mr. Trump's scrutiny of Harvard's tax status comes after the university on Monday rejected his administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration this week moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard.",
      "The Trump administration has also threatened to cut off federal funding at other\u00a0top universities\u00a0as it exerts pressure on the institutions' policies governing student expression on campus and academic programs.",
      "But stripping an organization of its tax-exempt status is an unusual step, especially for an institution the size and reputation of Harvard, experts said.",
      "\"It would be historically unprecedented,\" Brian Galle, professor of tax policy at Georgetown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Certainly no major research university has ever lost its tax exemption.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the issue.",
      "Why is Harvard tax exempt?",
      "Organizations that have a purpose deemed to be \"charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals\" can qualify for tax-exempt status, according to the IRS.",
      "Most private and public universities and colleges have been granted tax-exempt status by the IRS because of their educational mission, which the federal government has recognized for their importance in fostering the productivity and civic contributions of American citizens, the Association of American Universities says.",
      "Can Mr. Trump order the IRS to remove Harvard's tax-exempt status?",
      "Not legally, according to Sam Brunson, a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and an expert on federal income tax and nonprofit organizations.",
      "That's because Congress in 1998 passed a law that forbids the president from directing the IRS to audit or investigate taxpayers, he explained. If Mr. Trump instructed the IRS to remove Harvard's tax exemption, \"that runs exactly contrary to law,\" Brunson said.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said, \"Any forthcoming actions by the IRS will be conducted independently of the President, and investigations into any institution's violations of its tax status were initiated prior\" to Mr. Trump's social media post this week questioning Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Could the IRS remove Harvard's tax exemption?",
      "The IRS has legal authority to strip organizations of their tax-exempt status, and it occasionally exercises that power. But that is usually due to groups failing to meet tax requirements, like neglecting to file an annual information return for more than three consecutive years.",
      "One famous case involved a university losing its tax-exempt status, Galle and Brunson noted. In the 1970s, Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, a Christian institution, lost its tax-exempt status due to a policy that banned interracial relationships.",
      "That case ended up at the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1983 that the IRS was correct in depriving Bob Jones of the status because its rules had violated a \"fundamental national public policy\" about racial discrimination in education.",
      "The IRS could argue that Harvard is in violation of public policy either by failing to crack down on protestors rallying against Israel's actions in Gaza or by refusing to comply with the Trump administration's push against diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Brunson said. But both he and Galle expressed skepticism that such rationales would hold up in court, partly because universities have a constitutional right to freedom of speech, while also representing issues that are far different from the practices that Bob Jones engaged in.",
      "\"There isn't a society-wide agreement that allowing protests on your campus is inconsistent with fundamental public policy,\" Galle said.",
      "He added, \"Let's be clear: There is absolutely no basis for Harvard to lose its exemption. Zero.\"",
      "What happens if the IRS strips Harvard of its tax-exempt status?",
      "The IRS would first do an investigation and then inform Harvard of its reason for removing its tax-exempt status, Brunson said. Harvard could then file an appeal to the IRS. If that appeal failed, the university could then take the issue to the courts.",
      "As the case proceeded, it's likely that a court would issue an injunction or order to halt the IRS' decision, which means that Harvard would likely continue to operate as a tax-exempt institution until the case was resolved, experts said.",
      "\"Harvard isn't going to lose this \u2014 they have the money and the resources and the alumni to get the best people representing them,\" Brunson said. He predicted that Harvard would win a court case and \"set a precedent.\"",
      "How could losing tax-exempt status affect Harvard?",
      "Harvard could take a financial hit if it were to lose the tax-exempt status. But the extent of any resulting damage would be unclear given that Harvard could use tax strategies to lower its taxable income, similar to how major corporations rely on sophisticated techniques to reduce their tax liability. For instance, Harvard could lower its taxable income by deducting business costs, including its faculty salaries.",
      "By contrast, donors to Harvard could feel the impact because they wouldn't be able to deduct their contributions to the university from their own taxes. That could make it less palatable for donors to make large financial contributions.",
      "\"The biggest cost would be reduced donations,\" Brunson said. \"And the other cost is its endowment, which would no longer be tax exempt.\"",
      "Harvard's endowment stands at $52.3 billion, making it the biggest among all U.S. universities.",
      "What does Harvard say about the risk to its tax-exempt status?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Harvard reiterated that such a decision would be illegal.",
      "\"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission,\" a spokesperson wrote in an email. \"The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth.\"",
      "The spokesperson added, \"There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status.\"",

    "summary": "Some states want to block SNAP recipients from using benefits to buy sugary foods as part of the \"make America healthy again\" movement.",
    "story": [
      "The federal food stamp program is facing scrutiny in some states that want to block enrollees from using their government benefits to buy soda and candy.",
      "Three Republican-led states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho and Indiana \u2014 on Tuesday moved to ban purchases of soda and candy with benefits provided by the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Those states have a combined total of roughly 1 million residents on SNAP out of the program's total 41.7 million U.S. participants.",
      "Other states are also likely to restrict SNAP recipients' food purchases, experts say. Lawmakers in states including Arizona, Kansas and Tennessee\u00a0have introduced similar measures to curtail food stamp purchases of sugary foods and drinks.",
      "The rationale for such legislation is the view that blocking low-income Americans from using food stamps on soda and candy will help improve their health. But anti-hunger advocates say that these restrictions will add to negative perceptions of receiving food aid, while also being unlikely to improve recipients' eating habits.",
      "\"It's stigmatizing to say, 'You who are low income, we don't trust you to make the right choices,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger research group.",
      "Instead, she said, these states would be better off focusing on the biggest obstacle to healthy eating: the high cost of groceries, particularly the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Because SNAP provides an average individual monthly benefit of $187, or a little over $6 per day, many recipients fill up by purchasing the cheapest, most calorie-dense foods they can afford, she added.",
      "Grocery costs soared during the pandemic, surging almost 24% from 2020 to 2024 and outpacing overall inflation by almost three percentage points, according to an analysis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Food prices aren't expected to drop anytime soon, with the USDA forecasting that groceries could rise 2.7% in 2025, adding to the challenges SNAP recipients face in affording healthy food.",
      "Make America healthy again?",
      "In announcing plans to block food stamp purchases of soda and candy, Idaho Governor Brad Little on Tuesday\u00a0proclaimed that the state \"welcomes the MAHA movement,\" referring to the \"make America healthy again\" movement started by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders credited the Trump administration with placing \"a laser focus on solving America's chronic disease epidemic,\" saying that banning candy and soda from food stamp purchases is \"a great place to start.\"",
      "About 80 cents of every $1 in SNAP benefits is used to purchase staples like meat, bread, milk, cereal and rice, with the remainder going to salty snacks, candy and sweetened beverages. Households that rely on food stamps have very similar patterns of spending to households not on food stamps, according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "The Arkansas plan, which would take effect in July 2026, would exclude soda, including no- and low-calorie soda; fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice; \"unhealthy drinks;\" candy, including confections made with flour, like Kit Kat bars; and artificially sweetened candy.",
      "It also would allow participants to use benefits to buy hot rotisserie chicken, which is excluded from the program now under the SNAP program's longstanding ban on hot foods. Food stamp recipients also would be barred from using their benefits to buy nonfood items, such as soap or toothpaste, as well as alcohol or tobacco.",
      "Some industries are pushing back against the SNAP restrictions. Representatives for American Beverage accused state and federal officials of \"choosing to be the food police rather than take truly meaningful steps to lift people off SNAP with good-paying jobs.\"",
      "The National Confectioners Association called the approach \"misguided.\"",
      "\"SNAP participants and non-SNAP participants alike understand that chocolate and candy are treats \u2014 not meal replacements,\" spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health\"",
      "Over the past two decades, lawmakers from both political parties have proposed halting SNAP payments for everything from soda to\u00a0 steak. To date, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the SNAP program, hasn't granted the required waivers for states to curb food stamp purchases.",
      "But the Trump administration is signaling that it will grant the waivers requested this week, with USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins saying in a Tuesday statement\u00a0that she plans to quickly approve Arkansas' request.",
      "\"I have said since my confirmation that USDA has a role to play in improving nutrition programs to better serve individuals in need of support, all while recognizing the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Rollins said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our shared goal should be to lift millions of Americans out of dependency and into hopeful futures and insert new energy and ideas into long-ignored programs like diet-related, chronic disease.\"",
      "Blocking SNAP purchases of candy and soda wouldn't keep recipients from using their own money to buy such items, as food stamp benefits typically pay for roughly\u00a0two-thirds of a household's grocery costs.",
      "But advocates of banning unhealthy foods from SNAP say that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for supporting bad eating habits.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health,\" Sanders said Tuesday at a news conference with Rollins in Little Rock, Arkansas. \"We're paying for it on the front end and the back end.\"",

    "story": [
      "As ongoing inflation continues to deplete household budgets, perhaps nowhere is the pinch felt more strongly\u00a0than in grocery aisles. However, depending on where you live, the pain can be sharper than in other areas.",
      "That's according to a new study from\u00a0SmartAsset\u00a0which reveals notable fluctuations in grocery price increases from city to city. The financial technology company used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to examine how the costs of everyday items like eggs, meat and produce have changed in 12 major metro areas over the last year.",
      "\"While prices of fruits, vegetables and dairy products either increased or decreased depending on the location, eggs, meat and poultry soared almost unanimously, reaching over 9% or higher than just a year before \u2014 tripling the general rate of inflation,\" the study found.",
      "Jaclyn DeJohn, director of economic analysis and author of the SmartAsset study, said the big takeaway is how much location can impact these day-to-day items.",
      "\"We really wanted to do was compare where people's budget is going to get hit the hardest,\" said DeJohn, who noted that the study in not a comprehensive ranking but a snapshot of location-related shifts in the cost of groceries. \"People are noticing these costs, and they're impacting their bottom line.\"",
      "Read on to see how grocery prices\u00a0fluctuated in 12 major U.S. metros.",
      "Which cities are seeing price increases?",
      "Out of the 12 cities included in SmartAsset's analysis, Honolulu, Hawaii, experienced the largest uptick with a 5.3% increase in overall grocery prices since last year. Price hikes in Tampa Bay, Florida, are the second highest at 4.3%, followed by the Twin Cities, Minnesota, at 4.2%.",
      "When it comes to fresh produce, the Twin Cities saw the biggest spike among the 12 metro areas, with the cost of fruits and vegetables rising 6.9% from 2024. In Los Angeles, egg, meat, poultry and fish prices rose the most, at 9.8%, followed by the D.C. metro area at 9.4%.",
      "By contrast, residents of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington experienced only a modest price hike of 2.1% on eggs, meat, poultry and fish.",
      "While the report doesn't specify the factors driving price changes from city to city, a combination of influences could be at play, said SmartAsset's DeJohn. \"A big factor for something like Honolulu is it's isolated from the rest of the U.S.,\" she said. \"So, that's a good illustration of how transportation costs where you're located geographically compared to where your food is sourced can impact the prices big time.\"",
      "While price fluctuations varied from city to city, prices for egg, meats, poultry and fish went up in all metro areas, which DeJohn says were behind overall grocery cost increases across all 12 metro areas. \"As we didn't see such intense price increases across any other category of grocery, it was the egg and meat prices that were really driving the increase in grocery prices across the board in these metros,\" she said.",
      "The rise in egg prices at the metro level tracks with national BLS data. Egg prices have been climbing in large part due to the bird flu outbreak which has\u00a0forced farmers to kill infected flocks to prevent the disease from spreading.",
      "Are any cities seeing lower grocery prices?",
      "Yes. Two metro areas in SmartAsset's study \u2014 Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Boston \u2014 saw a decrease in grocery prices of 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively, from a year ago.",
      "Where are grocery prices headed?",
      "A recent analysis by the Yale Budget Lab estimates that overall food prices will rise by 2.6% in the next three years, as a result of U.S. tariffs as well as reciprocal tariffs from foreign nations in place as of April 15. Fresh produce is estimated to rise 5.4%, according to the think tank, before stabilizing at 3.6% higher.",
      "The USDA's\u00a0food price outlook, based on Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index data from this year and last, forecasts a slightly larger rise in overall food prices of 3.2%, with grocery store or supermarket food purchases, or food-at-home, increasing 2.7%.",
      "Prices for dairy products and fresh vegetables will remain mostly unchanged, according to the USDA, but unfortunately for consumers, the cost of egg prices is expected to climb. Egg prices, which have\u00a0soared over the past year, are expected to rise 57.6% in 2025, according to the report.",

      "European leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier\u00a0can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"",
      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",
      "The hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner.",

      "But the Italian leader will have to try to balance that budding special relationship with her mandate to protect the interests not only of her own nation's economy, but the EU's, with which Italy's financial future is inextricably linked.",
      "Europe has hope, and anxiety, over the Trump-Meloni meeting",
      "Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed strategies on how to approach her meeting with Mr. Trump during multiple phone calls ahead of the trip, according to a commission spokesperson.",
      "Von der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",
      "Meloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.",
      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",
      "In other European capitals, there was clear anxiety over the possibility that the White House could use the meeting to try to undermine EU unity.",
      "\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" the French government's Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, said last week, adding: \"Europe is only strong if it is united.\"",
      "The French news agency AFP said a government spokeswoman later stressed that any voices capable of encouraging dialogue between Washington and the EU were to be welcomed.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/googles-digital-ad-network-illegal-monopoly-federal-judge/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The ruling involving Google's online ad technology follows a similar case last year in which Google's search engine was declared a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google's namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google's ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump's first administration, the same agency went after the company's lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden's ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called remedy hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Brinkema's 115-page decision centers on the marketing machine that Google has spent the past 17 years building around its search engine and other widely used products and services, including its Chrome browser, YouTube video site and digital maps.",
      "The system was largely built around a series of acquisitions that started with Google's $3.2 billion purchase of online ad specialist DoubleClick in 2008. U.S. regulators approved the deals at the time they were made before realizing that they had given the Mountain View, California, company a platform to manipulate the prices in an ecosystem that a wide range of websites depend on for revenue and provides a vital marketing connection to consumers.",
      "The Justice Department lawyers argued that Google built and maintained dominant market positions in a technology trifecta used by website publishers to sell ad space on their webpages, as well as the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of consumers, and the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions in fractions of a second to match buyer and seller.",
      "After evaluating the evidence presented during a lengthy trial that\u00a0concluded just before Thanksgiving last year,\u00a0Brinkema reached a decision that rejected the Justice Department's assertions that Google has been mistreating advertisers while concluding the company has been abusing its power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers forced to rely on its network for revenue.",
      "\"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.\" Brinkema wrote. \"Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features.\"",
      "Despite that rebuke, Brinkema also concluded that Google didn't break the law when it snapped Doubleclick nor when it followed up that deal a few years later by buying another service, Admeld.",
      "The Justice Department \"failed to show that the DoubleClick and Admeld acquisitions were anticompetitive,\" Brinkema wrote. \"Although these acquisitions helped Google gain monopoly power in two adjacent ad tech markets, they are insufficient, when viewed in isolation, to prove that Google acquired or maintained this monopoly power through exclusionary practices.\"",
      "That finding may help Google fight off any attempt to force it to sell its advertising technology to stop its monopolistic behavior.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"",
      "Analysts such as Brian Pitz of BMO Markets had been predicting that Google would likely lose the case, helping to brace investors for the latest setback to the company and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose shares declined 1% in afternoon trading. Alphabet's stock has plunged by 20% so far this year.",
      "As it did in the search monopoly case, Google and its corporate parent Alphabet vehemently denied the Justice Department's allegations. Their lawyers argued the government largely based its case on an antiquated concept of a market that existed a decade ago while underestimating a highly competitive market for advertising spending that includes the likes of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast.",
      "The market as drawn in the Justice Department's case didn't include ads that appear on mobile apps, streaming television services, or other platforms to which internet users have increasingly migrated, prompting Google lawyer Karen Dunn to compare the government's definition a \"time capsule with a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster video card\" during her opening statement\u00a0when the trial began last September.",
      "At trial, the Justice Department's lawyers emphasized the harm to news publishers that has arisen from Google's alleged dominance of the marketplace. Witnesses from Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, and News Corp., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, testified about the difficulties they have faced and what they said was a lack of alternatives to Google's ad tech. Those companies rely on online advertising to fund their news operations and make their articles free to consumers on the internet, government lawyers have argued.",
      "Now, government is in position to try to dismantle that byzantine ad system. When the case was filed more than two years ago during the Biden administration, the Justice Department asserted Google should be forced to sell, at a minimum, its Ad Manager product, which includes the technology used by website publishers and the ad exchange.",

    "story": [
      "Shein and Temu, two popular Chinese e-commerce sites known for their low-cost items, say they will raise prices for U.S. consumers starting next week, a move that comes amid President Trump's 145% tariff on imports from China and the end of a trade loophole.",
      "The sites are popular with U.S. shoppers because of their low prices, with a focus on fast fashion. While they predominantly sell women's apparel and accessories, both also sell men's and children's clothing. Temu carries household items and small personal electronics.",
      "At Shein, women's blouses cost as little as $5, and bikinis can be found for around $10. Temu offers running sneakers for $14.",
      "Beginning April 25, though, the deals won't be as enticing for U.S. consumers. In a notice on its website, Shein told customers that \"price adjustments\" will go into effect late next week. Shein said \"recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\" have caused its own costs to rise, making the price hikes necessary.",
      "\"We're doing everything we can to keep prices low and minimize the impact on you. Our team is working hard to improve your shopping experience and stay true to our mission: making fashion accessible for everyone,\" Shein added, without indicating the size of the price hikes.",
      "Temu posted a nearly identical notice, saying that its operating expenses have risen, and that it will therefore introduce price hikes beginning next week. Until then, prices will remain unchanged, it added.",
      "The \"de minimis\" loophole",
      "The two e-commerce sites have benefitted from a tax law loophole known as the \"de minimis\" exemption, which has allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free. Mr. Trump's recent action\u00a0to eliminate the loophole beginning May 2 throws a wrench in the companies' business models.",
      "In an April 2 executive order, the White House said that shippers in China have previously used the exemption to \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices.\"",
      "\"These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption,\" the executive order said.",
      "Effective May 2, such shipments will be subject to \"all applicable duties,\" the order states.",
      "The end of the \"de minimis\" loophole, as well as the Trump administration's tariffs of 145% on imports from China, have dented the business models of the two platforms.",
      "The changes come at a time when American shoppers have increasingly flocked to the low-cost retailers. The number of de minimis parcels shipped to the U.S. has surged to more than 1 billion in 2023, up from 153 million in 2015, with China accounting for the largest volume of shipments, according to a January Congressional Research Service report. That year, the average package value was $54, according to the report.",

    "summary": "Triple-digit U.S tariffs on China will \"wipe out our business completely,\" one small business owner says.",
    "story": [
      "Small business owners worry that mounting economic uncertainty, driven largely by President Trump's\u00a0shifting tariff policies, could shut their doors for good.",
      "Beth Benike, cofounder of Busy Baby, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lack of clarity on the direction of U.S. tariffs poses serious problems for the Oronoco, Minnesota-based retailer.",
      "\"I am a problem solver. When a decision or policy comes out, I'll find a solution. I will work with it or around it,\" said Benike, whose company makes nonslip placemats and other products for babies. \"The next day, the policy changes and that plan doesn't make sense anymore, so I come up with something else.\"",
      "Smaller enterprises that rely on imported goods and packaging from China, which now faces U.S. tariffs of as high as 145%, are among the most concerned about Mr. Trump's trade policies. But a prolonged period of economic uncertainty alone can prove fatal, obscuring future borrowing costs, dampening consumer spending, and otherwise hindering the strategic planning and managerial decision-making involved in running a small business.",
      "Trump administration officials have staunchly defended their economic policies.",
      "\"Just as it did during President Trump's first term, the administration's America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts and the unleashing of American energy will restore American Greatness from Main Street to Wall Street,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Recently, however, tremors in the economy intensified by Mr. Trump's tariffs have eroded the optimism of small businesses, according to a closely watched confidence\u00a0gauge.",
      "\"The implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months,\" William Dunkelberg, chief economist of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said in a statement.",
      "The decline in optimism comes as Mr. Trump's economic agenda roils financial markets and raises concerns about slowing U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Consumers are concerned about the inflationary effects of the tariffs hikes. They understand if\u00a0prices rise, their real spending power will go down,\" Steven J. Davis, a Stanford University economist who co-developed an economic policy uncertainty\u00a0index, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Also, some of them also feel that maybe their jobs are at risk, so for both reasons many consumers will cut back on discretionary spending.\"",
      "The cost of unpredictability",
      "To be sure, even in the best of times business owners can be caught flat-footed by abrupt changes in the competitive landscape. But risks surge when the economic climate become unpredictable.",
      "\"Uncertainty is the enemy of entrepreneurship,\" Neri Karra Sillaman, an entrepreneurship expert at Oxford University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When the rules of the game are constantly shifting \u2014 one day you have a pause on tariffs, another day you don't have tariffs, if there are interest rate changes or political and economic instability \u2014 businesses cannot then confidently invest in growth.\"",
      "Smaller businesses, which typically have less of a financial cushion than larger enterprises, tend to struggle more in such an environment, she added.",
      "Davis, whose own\u00a0index\u00a0shows a spike in uncertainty in recent months, said trade policy unknowns are \"the big source of uncertainty right now inhibiting business investment and hiring.\"",
      "\"When you have tariffs, they tend to introduce cost unpredictability, which makes it very hard to predict and forecast margins accurately, especially in a product-based business,\" Karra added.",
      "Busy Baby's Benike said the sudden swerves in U.S. trade policy have made planning all but impossible.",
      "\"If I invest time, energy and money and the policy changes again in a way that makes the decision a poor one, I am already invested, the wheels are in motion and I'd be screwed,\" she said.",
      "\"I can't make a decision, so the best thing I can do is get the inventory I've paid for here and ready to sell,\" she added, referring to her latest factory order, now sitting in a Chinese warehouse.",
      "Meanwhile, the new 125% U.S. baseline tariff on Chinese imports means that Benike would owe $229,000 in duties on products worth roughly $158,000. She has launched a fundraising campaign to help cover the tariff costs.",
      "Her plan B, should the steep levies remain in place, is to continue manufacturing her products in China and to sell them to markets outside the U.S.",
      "\"There are babies everywhere. If I can't sell in America, there are other countries that are interested,\" she said.",
      "Business on the brink",
      "Kristin Bear, founder of Kilo Brava, an online lingerie and sleepwear company that sells both directly to consumers as well as to major retailers including Macy's, Nordstrom and Anthropologie, said the sky-high U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports \"wipe out our business completely\" if they stay in place.",
      "\"We have not imported anything yet with the 145% tariffs in place, but it really puts our business in complete jeopardy,\" she said.",
      "Another challenge is that U.S. factories aren't equipped to manufacture the types of garments she designs, Bear said. And because orders for garments intended for sale this fall must be placed with factories by May, it's too late to explore manufacturing options in other countries.",
      "Said Bear, noting that she can't afford to lose a whole season's worth of orders, equivalent to roughly $500,000 in sales: \"If tariffs are still in place when it's time to import them, we'll just have to abandon the goods and close the company.\"",

      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday cautioned that the central bank could face a \"challenging scenario\" of managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy brought on by the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "In written remarks\u00a0at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell reiterated that the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Even so, Powell said the Federal Reserve can stay patient and wait to see how tariffs and other economic policies of the Trump administration play out before making any changes to interest rates. The sharp volatility in financial markets since Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2, only to put most of them on hold a week later, has led to speculation about whether the Fed would soon cut its key interest rate or take other steps to calm investors.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity\" on the impact of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation, and tariffs, Powell said.",
      "Powell said the inflation will likely be temporary, but \"could also be more persistent,\" echoing a concern expressed by a majority of the Fed's 19-member interest rate-setting committee in the minutes of their meeting last month.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have led economists to lower their expectations for U.S. economic growth and forecast higher inflation this year. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers like Walmart, they typically pass on the added costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"Tariffs likely lead to higher prices while softening consumer sentiment and business optimism possibly means slower growth,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, in an email. \"This is going to make economic forecasting more difficult, and the Fed is likely going to widen their bands growth and rates with risks to both price stability and full employment rising.\"",
      "Yet some splits among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee have emerged. On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.",
      "Should the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \"sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\"",
      "But other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.",
      "For now, most recent reports suggest the economy is in solid shape. Hiring has been solid and inflation cooled in March. Yet measures of consumer and business confidence have plunged, raising concerns among economists that spending and business investment could weaken.",

      "\"I would love to make them here, but the U.S. simply doesn't have the infrastructure or the supply chain to do it,\" Ley told CBS News.",

      "After President Trump raised tariffs on China this month,\u00a0eventually totaling 145%, Ley, with the help of the nonpartisan, conservative-funded New Civil Liberties Alliance, filed a federal lawsuit against the president, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and acting U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Pete Flores, alleging illegal use of emergency powers illegally to enact the fees.",
      "Ley said that because Congressional approval was bypassed to impose the tariffs, she and other voters didn't have their positions represented.",
      "\"Had (Congress) had a chance to debate, discuss, vote, be involved,\u00a0I would've then had the opportunity to make my voice heard,\" she explained. \"And same for other Americans who were gonna be impacted by the tariffs. That didn't happen.\"",

      "But according to Ley, \"We can't survive the short-term pain, and especially without any sort of plan in place to create the infrastructure here...It would take years and millions and millions of dollars to build such a thing that's been built overseas over decades.\"",
      "Ley said Simplified has paid nearly $1.2 million in tariffs since Mr. Trump's first term, and is facing between $830,000 and $1 million in payments this year alone under the administration's new tariffs.",
      "While the White House is\u00a0offering exemptions\u00a0to multibillion-dollar Chinese industries that produce smartphones and other electronics, Ley says that to just cover the cost of tariffs at 145%, she would have to raise prices on her $64 signature planner to $82. To maintain a profit on her planners, Ley would have to double the sticker price to about $120.",
      "\"I'm not paying $120 for a planner,\" Ley said.",
      "Ley employs eight other women, and disclosed that she is being forced to consider reducing salaries and possibly eliminating positions, something she says she really doesn't want to do.",
      "She says it comes down to keeping prices manageable for customers while balancing the new tariff burden on her bottom line.",
      "Ley said that China's unique manufacturing infrastructure isn't currently available in the U.S. or other countries internationally. Different elements of her planners are made in several different factories in the Shenzhen region. Because they are located close to one another, the final product is higher quality and more affordable.",
      "In response to Ley's lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, told CBS News in a statement that the president \"has broad authority to impose tariffs to address issues of national emergency, such as the opioid pandemic.

    "summary": "In these major U.S. cities, a family of three earning $100,000 would have a hard time covering basic expenses.",
    "story": [
      "Reaching the six-figure salary threshold may be considered a financial victory for many Americans, but in a many big U.S. cities the once aspirational milestone just doesn't cut it anymore.",
      "In one out of four large metro areas in the United States, a family of three with a household income of $100,000 will still struggle to get by, a LendingTree\u00a0analysis\u00a0reveals. That's a stark realization for many Americans, who continue to face\u00a0rising household expenses\u00a0on everything from\u00a0a dozen eggs to a bag of coffee. The average median household income in then U.S. was $80,610 in 2023,\u00a0according\u00a0to the most recent estimate from the Census Bureau.",
      "\"For generations of Americans, $100,000 has long been a magic number. It has been seen as a level of yearly earnings that says: You've made it. You're successful,\" according to the report. \"However, that has changed dramatically in many of the nation's biggest metros. In 25 of the 100 largest metros in this country, a six-figure household income isn't enough to handle the basics.\"",
      "In determining the metro areas where a $100,000 salary wouldn't stretch far enough, LendingTree considered eight different spending categories a typical family of three might face \u2014 such as two-bedroom apartment and infant daycare \u2014 and then subtracted the total cost from the $8,333 in monthly income the family would be earning on a salary of $100,000. That left a slew of large metro areas, from Los Angeles to New York, with negative monthly income estimates.",
      "In 25 of the 100 largest U.S. cities LendingTree looked at for its report, researchers found that monthly expenditures \u2013 which ranged from food to childcare and health insurance costs \u2013 outweighed net monthly income. The analysis didn't factor in debt payments.",
      "\"It's a rough time out there. The fact that you can make six figures in many, many cities across this country and still be broke, even before you factor in debt payments, is scary,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree and author of the study. \"That's the reality for many families today, though, and unfortunately, there's not much reason to think things are going to improve anytime soon. That means that families are going to be forced to make some tough decisions and real sacrifices to get by.\"",
      "The study comes at a time when consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest levels since the pandemic, as Americans weather a period of economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's tariff rollout. Americans expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month.",
      "Read on to see how your city ranked.",
      "Where is it hardest to get by on $100,000?",
      "In San Jose, the heart of California's pricey Silicon Valley, a family of three with household income of $100,000 a year would find themselves more than $2,000 short every month after covering basic expenses. Researchers say this is attributable to disproportionately high housing and transportation costs. Trailing San Jose are San Francisco and Boston which are the second and third hardest places, respectively, to get by on a $100,000 annual salary.",
      "Notably, the lion's share of locations where family breadwinners making $100,000 might still end up broke were cities on the West or East Coasts. California metro hubs figured prominently on the list, with all 10 of the state's largest cities among the top 25.\u00a0Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York also had multiple metro areas included on the list.",
      "Which cities were the most affordable for a family making $100,000?",
      "In 1 in 3 cities, however, a $100,000 salary \"is still magical,\" even for a family of three. Earners in these areas could still pocket $1,000 or more each month after paying basic expenses, LendingTree found.",
      "McAllen, Texas, located on the U.S. - Mexico border, came in at the top for places where a $100,000 salary will give you the biggest bang for your buck. Residents there would have $1,770 left over after subtracting money for their monthly expenditures. Close behind McAllen are Little Rock, Arkansas and El Paso, Texas, according to the report.",
      "For those facing stubborn costs of living, LendingTree says there are still ways to\u00a0mitigate the impact\u00a0whether it's by staying in your rental longer or reducing the interest rate you're paying.",
      "Schulz's advice for consumers: Build your emergency fund.",
      "\"Even a small emergency fund can help firm up your financial foundation. It means that your next big unexpected expense won't necessarily have to go right on to your credit card,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Plus, online high-yield savings accounts are still offering some of the best returns in years, even though they're down from last year's highs.\"",

    "summary": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in federal court for a second day in a landmark federal antitrust trial accusing Meta of being a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sparred Tuesday with a Federal Trade Commission attorney over the meaning of emails the Facebook founder wrote about why he wanted to acquire Instagram, as a historic antitrust trial alleging Meta illegally monopolized the social media market went into its second day.",
      "Zuckerberg returned to the witness stand on Tuesday to defend Meta's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp, in a trial that could force Meta to divest the two apps, startups the tech giant bought more than a decade ago which have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, who is leading the FTC's case against Meta, contends that Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he saw it as a threat to his company, not because he thought he could make it thrive.",
      "While questioning Zuckerberg on Tuesday morning, Matheson noted that the CEO had referred to Instagram as being a \"rapidly growing, threatening, network.\"",
      "But Zuckerberg, who is the first witness called in the trial, said while Matheson was able to show documents in court that indicated his concern about Instagram's growth, he also had many conversations about how excited his company was to acquire Instagram to make a better product.",
      "Zuckerberg pushed back against Matheson's contention that the reason for buying the company was to neutralize a threat.",
      "\"I think that that mischaracterizes what the email was,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "In his questioning of Zuckerberg, Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company.",
      "Matheson also brought up a February 2012 message in which Zuckerberg wrote to the former chief financial officer of Facebook that Instagram and Path, a social networking app, already had created meaningful networks that could be \"very disruptive to us.\"",
      "Zuckerberg testified that the message was written in the context of a broad discussion about whether they should buy companies to accelerate their own developments.",
      "The CEO was also questioned about why he bought Instagram and WhatsApp instead of building new apps.",
      "\"I'm sure we could have built an app, whether it would have succeeded or not, I think is a matter of speculation\u2026\u00a0 building a new app is hard, and many more times than not, when we've tried to build a new app, it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "Zuckerberg also repeatedly disputed the government's claim that acquiring Instagram was bad for competition and for consumers.",
      "\"What I was focused on is the software infrastructure of different services that they (Instagram) can plug into. I think the explicit strategy for the Instagram integration was that we wanted to let Kevin and Mike, the founders basically tell us what services they needed from Meta in order to help improve the quality of growing Instagram faster,\" he said.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump's FTC's ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "Narrow market definition",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.",
      "However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC's lawsuit \"defies reality.\"",
      "\"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" the company said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Filing a tax extension is easy. But it's important to know what you're getting into, including what to do if you owe money to the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "If you're still scrambling to get your taxes filed before the April 15 deadline, an extension can take the pressure off.",
      "Normally, the IRS recommends\u00a0that people file their income tax return as early as possible. But that's not always feasible, whether because of personal circumstances or a complicated tax situation. For those in a bind, a\u00a0tax extension\u00a0gives people an additional six months to file their federal return. The quick and free process gives Americans plenty of extra time to assemble their forms, work through complex tax situations and submit everything to the government without penalty.",
      "As of April 4, roughly 100 million people had already filed their taxes, according\u00a0to the IRS. The tax agency said\u00a0in January that it is expecting more than 140 million individual tax returns to be filed before the April 15 deadline, meaning there are likely millions of outstanding 1040s yet to be filed.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.",
      "Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxes are typically a major source of stress for Americans. In an April TaxAct survey, a quarter of respondents said one of their top concerns was filing their taxes incorrectly. Those polled also expressed uncertainty around what to expect when filing, with one-quarter of respondents saying they worried about having to pay more taxes than they'd expected.",
      "If you're planning to file a tax extension this year, here are some things to keep in mind.",
      "What is the 2025 filing deadline?",
      "The deadline to file your taxes this year is Tuesday, April 15, by 11:59 p.m. in your local time zone. However, there are exceptions.",
      "U.S. citizens, resident aliens and members of the military on duty who live outside of the U.S. are granted an automatic extension of two months. Military servicemembers serving in combat zones are given 180 days after they leave the area to file and pay their tax returns.",
      "This year, the IRS also extended the deadline for 13 states due to natural disasters in those areas. All taxpayers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and certain locations in Alaska, New Mexico, and Virginia have until May 1 to file their returns. Taxpayers in California's Los Angeles County have until October 15. And people in Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as in certain counties in West Virginia, have until November 3 to file.",
      "How do I file a tax extension online?",
      "The IRS offers a few different ways for people to extend their tax deadline to October 15. The online payment system, which allows you to pay the IRS directly from your bank account, debit card, credit card or digital wallet, has a box you can check if you need to file for an extension.",
      "Taxpayers can also electronically request an automatic tax-filing extension while using IRS File Free, which guides taxpayers through their federal income returns using tax preparation software.",
      "Another option is to file a Form 4868, which is the Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. It asks for basic information including your name, address and Social Security number. You can file a Form 4868 electronically by using IRS e-file or mailing the form to the IRS.",
      "If I get an extension, does that mean I have more time to pay the IRS?",
      "Even if you get an extension, you are still required to pay the IRS by the regular deadline if you owe money. As the IRS says, \"an extension gives extra time to file, but it does not give taxpayers extra time to pay if they owe.\" If taxpayers want to avoid financial penalties, it's best to estimate the amount you owe and pay it by the regular deadline, which is 11:59 p.m, Tuesday, April 15.",
      "Is there a penalty for filing taxes late?",
      "Yes. The IRS charges individuals and businesses a fine if they fail to file their return by the deadline or by their extension date. The \"failure to file penalty\" is 5% of the tax due for each month the return is late and is capped at 25%.",
      "What happens if I file but don't pay?",
      "The IRS levies a fine based on the amount of taxes you didn't pay. The \"failure to pay penalty\" is 0.5% of the unpaid taxes for each month, with a cap of 25% of the unpaid taxes. You would be subject to the penalty if you file your taxes on time but don't pay by the April 15 deadline.",
      "Tax filers can avoid the \"failure to file\" and \"failure to pay\" charges if they can prove that they missed the payment due to a\u00a0reasonable cause. \"Reasonable cause is determined on a case by case basis considering all the facts and circumstances of your situation,\" the IRS says.",
      "What if I can't afford to pay the IRS?",
      "The IRS offers both a short-term and long-term payment plan for taxpayers struggling to pay what they owe to the IRS. Those interested in applying can do so on the IRS website.",

At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "When did this case get started?",
      "The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly.",
      "But the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC introduced more evidence in an amended complaint, according to The Washington Post.",

Still, it's unclear how long the reprieve will last, given that President Trump on Sunday denied that he exempted\u00a0any products from his trade war and plans to study new tariffs on electronics components such as semiconductors.",
      "\"Even if President Trump does reach differing trade deals with some countries in the meantime, the lack of a consistent, clear path for trade policy has added to the overall level of uncertainty for markets, with no clear end to that in sight,\" John Canavan, lead U.S. analyst with Oxford Economics, said in a research note. \"So long as the situation lingers, demand for risk assets is likely to suffer, and volatility will remain significantly elevated as a result.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump's approvals on economy and inflation dip, as Wall Street has one of its most volatile weeks in recent years.",
    "story": [
      "Amid a tumultuous week in the markets, the outlook on President Trump's trade and tariff policy hinges not just on what Americans think will happen, but when.",
      "People split on whether they believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan, and most don't think the tariffs will be permanent \u2014 rather that he's using them to negotiate. More like his goals regarding\u00a0trade policy than his approach to it. For those who think he does have a plan \u2014 predominantly, Republicans \u2014 it'll take months or longer to judge the impact. Republicans stand apart from the public overall in showing that patience.",
      "But in the short term, a big majority of Americans think new tariffs are going to raise prices, and many think that's the case in the long term, too. So, an inflation-weary public is bracing for that to hit their bottom line: a growing number think Trump's policies are making them financially worse off, not better, and most think that tariffs will make the economy worse more immediately, too.",
      "In turn, Trump's ratings for handling inflation and the economy have become more negative.",
      "Either way one lasting impression may be this: in the public mind it is Donald Trump's economy now. A majority say his policies, not Joe Biden's, are responsible for it.",
      "Views about the potential impact on prices are especially important in this context because in recent years inflation has consistently been a top concern for Americans, and it is still a top way people evaluate their finances and the economy.",
      "Opinion is more mixed on how tariffs might impact U.S. manufacturing jobs: it is mostly Republicans who believe they will lead to more jobs.",
      "Trump's trade policies",
      "In all, more people say they like Trump's goals with tariff and trade policy than like his approach.",
      "And new tariffs continue to get net negative \u2014 but very partisan splits \u2014 in support.",
      "As does the view on whether or not Trump has a plan, where almost all Republicans say so.",
      "Most Americans don't think the tariffs will stay \u2014 they think Mr. Trump is using them for negotiations and will remove them later. Republicans especially think that \u2014 and it's related to how they view the long-term impact on prices.",
      "Despite many anticipating short-term price increases, Republicans and most independents say judging Trump's trade policies will take at least a few months to evaluate, while Democrats are more ready to evaluate them sooner.",
      "Support for tariffs is also connected to who people think they'll help or hurt. Either way large numbers think the wealthy and corporations will benefit. Those in favor see the middle and working class benefitting too.",
      "Trump's job handling",
      "When Mr. Trump was entering office, a sizable four in 10 Americans thought he'd make them financially better off \u2014 it was a key reason he won the election. That changed in March, with more seeing the impact as worse, and now that worsening view has continued today.",
      "The market was volatile this week while the poll was being conducted, but overall more Americans said Mr. Trump's policies were making the market go down.",
      "In all, the trend is for sliding ratings for Mr. Trump on handling the economy, handling inflation, and overall. (That overall number is down from its high at the start, but still higher than anything he had in his first term.)",
      "Some of the change in Mr. Trump's overall approval has come from independents disapproving more.",
      "As has been the case, Mr. Trump gets better marks for handling immigration than either the economy and inflation.",
      "Impacting the economy",
      "Ultimately, every president's policies put their stamp on the U.S. economy. In political terms, most of the public considers this Donald Trump's economy now: the majority view his policies (not Joe Biden's) as mostly responsible for the way things are today. And combined, three-quarters assign him at least shared impact.",
      "Here's another way Mr. Trump is a central figure in the economy: given a list of reasons why they might think the economy is either good or bad, in either case, sizable numbers give Mr. Trump as a reason. For the large majority who think it's bad, prices and general lack of confidence are top reasons, along with Donald Trump specifically. Those who think the economy is good \u2014 a group that includes a lot of Republicans \u2014 list Mr. Trump, along with general confidence, and the job market.",
      "Polarization also plays a role in a difference between people's assessments now and their outlook. In the last few weeks, their collective outlook has changed a little more.",
      "First, views about their own outlook for the economy got a little worse, with fewer expecting it to hold steady and more expecting a recession.",
      "And a slight majority of Americans \u2014 and slightly more than last month \u2014 said they think the economy is getting worse. That came from Democrats, as most Republicans say it's getting better. (Separately, in a different study, the consumer confidence index slipped in April.)",
      "Meanwhile, current views of the U.S. economy have been majority negative for years and still are. More Republicans are calling it good now, a partisan effect we often see over the years when the White House changes hands. And Republicans say that's in part due to their confidence in general and because of Donald Trump in particular. Those Republicans pushed the overall economy rating up a bit, even as Democrats and independents rated it worse.",
      "Partisan differences on trade \u2014 how the base sees it",
      "We can see more into Mr. Trump's support from the GOP base by where people go for trusted information about the tariffs and their impact: for Republicans, they trust Trump \"a lot\" for that information, far more than they do Wall Street or business leaders in general.",
      "Along with economics and jobs, Republicans also see tariffs and trade as a matter of fairness and patriotism.",
      "And most Republicans don't want Congress involved, even though it's a Republican-controlled Congress. Democrats and independents, who are less supportive of tariffs, likely for pragmatic reasons would call for more congressional involvement to stop them.",

      "The Democratic senator shared a photo with Abrego Garcia at what appears to be a restaurant.",
      "\"I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar,\" Sen. Van Hollen said. \"Tonight I had that chance. I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.\"",

      "Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele also posted photos\u00a0of the meeting, but suggested Abrego Garcia will remain incarcerated by his government, which is being paid by the United States to hold deportees: \"Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez, said in a statement after the meeting her \"prayers have been answered.\"",
      "\"We still have so many questions, hopes, and fears. I will continue praying and fighting for Kilma's' return home,\" Vasquez wrote.",
      "White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai called Van Hollen's visit \"truly disgusting,\" writing, \"Chris Van Hollen has firmly established Democrats as the party whose top priority is the welfare of an illegal alien MS-13 terrorist.\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers have strongly denied any connections to MS-13.",
      "The surprise meeting with Van Hollen marks Abrego Garcia's first known appearance since last month, when his deportation to El Salvador's notorious Terrorism Confinement Center drew national attention and sparked a legal standoff with the Trump administration.",
      "The administration admitted in court papers Abrego Garcia was sent to El Salvador \u2014 along with hundreds of other Salvadoran and Venezuelan migrants \u2014 due to an \"administrative error.\" U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, and the Supreme Court backed up that order, but he has remained in El Salvador since then, with Xinis suggesting the government hasn't complied with her order and demanding regular updates on his status.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed back, arguing it's up to El Salvador to decide whether to return Abrego Garcia \u2014 an argument an appeals court called \"shocking\" on Thursday. The government has also alleged Abrego Garcia is linked to Salvadoran gang MS-13, citing a confidential informant, though his attorneys have denied that allegation and noted Abrego Garcia has not been charged or convicted of any crimes.",
      "Abrego Garcia, 29, was born in El Salvador but entered the United States illegally in 2011 at the age of 16. He was arrested outside a Maryland Home Depot in 2019, but a judge barred the government from deporting him to El Salvador, warning he could be persecuted by gangs in his home country. Years later, in March of this year, he was detained by immigration agents in Maryland and sent to the Salvadoran detention center, known as CECOT.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case is at the center of a controversial push by the Trump administration to send scores of migrants \u2014 including accused members of MS-13 and Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua \u2014 to CECOT using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to deport citizens of an enemy nation during an \"invasion or predatory incursion.\" The gambit has been challenged in court, with opponents decrying conditions in CECOT and\u00a0arguing the government is denying migrants the right to due process. A \"60 Minutes\" report found most of the 238 Venezuelans sent to CECOT on several planes last month had no apparent criminal record. But the Trump administration has defended its use of the law, arguing it is cracking down on gang violence.",
      "Van Hollen's meeting with Abrego Garcia\u00a0came after the senator was turned away Thursday at a military checkpoint near CECOT. He said he was about three kilometers from the notorious supermax prison, when he was stopped by soldiers, who he said were ordered to prevent him from going toward the prison.",
      "Van Hollen left for El Salvador on Wednesday, intending to check on Abrego Garcia's well-being. He provided updates on his journey.",

      "The White House is starting to rebuild the National Security Council with aides top officials believe are staunchly aligned with President Trump's agenda after six people were ousted earlier this month, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "Derek Harvey, a military intelligence analyst and retired U.S. Army colonel, is expected to be named senior director for intelligence, according to sources.",
      "\"Always, we're letting go of people,\" Mr. Trump told reporters about the firings of aides to National Security Adviser Mike Waltz\u00a0in the wake of the Signal group chat controversy. \"People that we don't like, or people that we don't think can do the job, or people that may have loyalties to somebody else.\"",
      "Havey would replace Brian Walsh, who was among four senior directors let go on April 3. In all, six aides were pushed out.",
      "Retired Lt. Col. Michael Jensen, an Air Force veteran, is also likely to join the NSC, one of the sources said. Jensen was nominated in February for a top Pentagon job as assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict. Senior officials have recently discussed tapping him as Waltz's senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs instead.",
      "That position has been unoccupied.",
      "Harvey was forced out of the NSC during Mr. Trump's first term by then-National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster over a difference in vision. Harvey oversaw Middle East affairs at the time.",
      "Harvey later worked as a congressional aide to former Rep. Devin Nunes, then the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee. He previously was a senior official at the Defense Intelligence Agency, and served as an adviser to retired Gen. David Petraeus,  then-commander of U.S. Central Command, and retired Army Gen. Jack Keane, former Army vice chief of staff.",

    "summary": "President Trump lashed out at Fed Chair Jerome Powell over interest rates, saying he should \"certainly lower them now.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump took aim at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, writing in a social media post that Powell should be cutting interest rates and adding that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comments on his social media app, Truth Social, come after Powell delivered a speech on Wednesday that warned of the potential consequences of the Trump administration's trade war, while reiterating that the central bank plans to hold interest rates steady for now.",
      "The Fed has put the brakes on interest rate cuts this year due to sticky inflation, which has remained higher than its target growth rate of 2% per year.",
      "In the meantime, Mr. Trump has introduced a series of tariffs on major trading partners that economists say could reignite inflation. Powell highlighted those risks on Wednesday in saying that the Trump administration tariffs could create a \"challenging scenario\" for the U.S. that requires both managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy.",
      "Those types of conditions describe \"stagflation,\" a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that describes periods when economic growth falters while price hikes accelerate.",
      "In his social media post, Mr. Trump on Thursday pointed to the European Central Bank, which cut rates by 0.25 percentage points after the president posted his message.",
      "\"The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, 'Too Late' Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete 'mess!'\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "He added, \"Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "A landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 1935 affirmed Congress' authority to create independent federal agencies whose boardmembers could only be forced out before their terms expired \"for cause.\"",
      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president, who has previously criticized his performance. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair.",
      "In a meeting Thursday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Mr. Trump said of Powell, \"Oh, he'll leave. If I ask him to, he'll be out of there.\"",
      "Mr.\u00a0Trump nominated Powell\u00a0to lead the Fed in 2017, and Powell was re-nominated by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Over the years, Powell has steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. In December, he said that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials.",
      "Whether the White House chooses to respect the Fed's independence remains to be seen. Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, ranging from refusing to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election to, since his return to power in January, empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the billionaire's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Research Group, notes that Mr. Trump this week fired two Democrats on the board of another financial regulator, the National Credit Union Administration. In March, the White House also dismissed two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, which historically has operated as an independent, bipartisan commission.",
      "\"The President appears to be moving closer to justifying removal of Democrats on the Federal Reserve Board. By firing the two Democrats from the credit union regulator, the president is establishing the precedent that he has total discretion over financial regulators, which could include the Federal Reserve,\" Seiberg said in a report.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 19:05:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Food safety inspections would be left to state and local authorities under the plan being developed by the FDA.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is drawing up plans that would end most of its routine food safety inspections work, multiple federal health officials tell CBS News, and effectively outsource this oversight to state and local authorities.",
      "The plans have not been finalized and might need congressional action to fully fund, said the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, denied that the FDA was making plans to do this.",
      "Some FDA employees have been working on a possible shift of the agency's routine food efforts to states for years, one current and one former official said, which could free up resources to focus on higher priority and foreign inspections. The FDA already outsources some routine food inspections through contracts with 43 states and Puerto Rico.",
      "\"There's so much work to go around. And us duplicating their work just doesn't make sense,\" one former FDA official, who worked on the plans before leaving the agency and spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "Multiple federal health officials said that the state work currently is often reserved for lower-risk inspections. A third of routine food safety inspections were done by states over recent years, a Government Accountability Office report said earlier this year.",
      "The FDA is ultimately responsible for the safety of much of the U.S. food supply that's distributed over state lines, like packaged products, seafood, eggs and produce. Some kinds of meat are regulated by a different agency inside the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Some higher-risk routine food inspections would likely remain at the FDA under the plans, two officials said. For example, agency staff currently conduct annual visits to infant formula manufacturers, which are overseen separately as \"critical foods\" inspections. States would also not be able to take on the work of routine inspections in foreign food facilities.",
      "It is unclear what would happen for the states that do not have contracts with the FDA to conduct food inspections, which range from Hawaii to Delaware.",
      "In addition to routine inspections, the FDA also does other kinds of inspections in response to issues, like a visit to a Colorado onion processor last year linked to the McDonald's Quarter Pounders outbreak that turned up dozens of violations.",
      "Internal planning around the possibility of outsourcing its routine inspections first picked up after 2010, the former FDA official said, when the agency was working on implementing major food safety legislation passed that year.",
      "The official likened the plans to the FDA's Grade A Milk Safety Program, where states fund the majority of oversight work themselves and have agreements with the agency to standardize how the industry is regulated.",
      "Some states and advocacy groups have called for years for the FDA to move its routine food inspections out to states. States can often do inspections at a lower cost than the FDA, while meeting the same standards, they have argued.",
      "\"FDA audits have determined states inspections to be high quality, and the costs show them to be a good economic value. There is significant cost to managing two systems also,\" said Steve Mandernach, executive director of the Association of Food and Drug Officials, in a statement.",
      "Mandernach drew a parallel to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, under which hospitals and nursing homes are largely inspected by state agencies but overseen by the federal government.",
      "He also pointed to how the FDA regulates produce farms. The FDA has agreements with most states to pay for routine inspections conducted by local agriculture departments, where they often handle inspections and enforcement themselves.",
      "\"Further, we implemented this type of program with produce already and it has been successful, expanding and leveraging those lessons can only provide greater value to the taxpayers, increase oversight of manufacturers, and improve food safety,\" he said.",
      "Ending the FDA's work to do its own routine food safety inspections might also help alleviate an issue elsewhere at the agency: a backlog of inspections overseas, as well as in other markets like medical products.",
      "In the past, FDA inspectors had been trained to do multiple kinds of inspections, officials said, instead of specializing only in food safety inspections.",
      "Steep layoffs at the office's support staff is expected to result in cutbacks to the number of inspections that can be done by the agency, CBS News previously reported. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has also greenlighted plans to hire contractors to attempt to plug the hole left by the laid-off workers.",
      "\"In theory, relying on states to do more routine food inspection work could lead to better food safety,\" said Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, in an email to CBS News.",
      "Gremillion cautioned that a transition in how food inspections are done by the FDA would take significant time and resources.",
      "\"So far, this Administration has acted with reckless disregard for how its policies will affect the detection and prevention of foodborne illness, and any plans to replace federal food inspectors with some other workforce deserves suspicion,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court said Thursday that the Trump administration's assertions in the case of a Maryland man who it admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador should be \"shocking\" to all Americans and made an appeal to the executive branch to vindicate the importance of the rule of law.",
      "The brief unanimous opinion authored by Judge Harvie Wilkinson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit rejected a request from the Trump administration to pause a district judge's order that required it to facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old who lives in Maryland, from Salvadoran custody, and explain the steps it has taken to return him to the U.S.",
      "\"The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,\" Wilkinson, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, wrote. \"Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.\"",
      "Wilkinson was joined in his opinion by Judges Robert King, nominated by President Bill Clinton, and Stephanie Thacker, appointed by President Barack Obama.",
      "The judge acknowledged that the executive branch has \"enormous\" powers to prosecute and deport noncitizens, but warned that the administration's actions so far could put U.S. citizens at risk.",
      "\"If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?\" Wilkinson wrote. \"And what assurance shall there be that the executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies?\"",
      "In his opinion, Wilkinson wrote of the tensions that can exist between the executive and judicial branches, but said that these differences require an effort at \"mutual respect.\" He lamented that \"too often today\" the executive branch has not afforded the courts that respect, and cited calls for judges to be impeached for decisions the government disagrees with, as well as pressure to disregard judicial orders.",
      "\"It is, as we have noted, all too possible to see in this case an incipient crisis, but it may present an opportunity as well,\" he wrote. \"We yet cling to the hope that it is not na\u00efve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos. This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has exploded simmering tensions between the federal judiciary and the Trump administration, which has been undertaking a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "The Salvadoran national came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011 and was arrested in 2019. Administration officials claim that Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant and his attire \u2014 a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie \u2014 at the time of his arrest. Abrego Garcia's lawyers have said he is not a gang member and has never been charged with or convicted of any crime in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from immigration custody in October 2019 and granted withholding of removal by an immigration judge, which is a legal status that forbids the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "He was living with his wife, a U.S. citizen, and their children in Maryland until he was arrested by immigration authorities in March and sent to El Salvador, where he and more than 200 others have been confined at the Terrorism Confinement Center, a notorious prison known as CECOT.",
      "Immigration officials in the Trump administration have acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador last month was an \"administrative error\" because of the withholding of removal, but efforts to have him brought back to the U.S. have sparked a fierce legal battle.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration earlier this month to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador, and the case landed before the Supreme Court. The high court then ruled last week that Xinis properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release from custody in El Salvador, but said she should clarify the scope of her decision as to effectuating Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "The district judge issued an amended decision that ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody as soon as possible. She also required the government to give her information about his whereabouts, as well as what steps it was taking to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration has so far rebuffed her requests for that information, but has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia is alive and detained at CECOT. Justice Department lawyers have said they will remove \"any domestic barriers\" to his return, but they have argued the U.S. does not have the power to force the Salvadoran government to release him.",
      "In his decision, Wilkinson said the court will not \"micromanage\" Xinis' attempt to implement the Supreme Court's decision, which he acknowledged requires lower courts to give consideration to the deference owed to the executive branch when conducting foreign affairs.",
      "\"The Supreme Court's decision does not, however, allow the government to do essentially nothing,\" he wrote.",

    "summary": "President Trump has suggested stripping Harvard of its tax-exempt status, a step that experts say would be unusual and face  legal challenges.",
    "story": [
      "The battle between President Trump and Harvard University has moved to a new front, with the IRS now considering whether to revoke the Ivy League school's tax-exempt status.",
      "A final decision has not yet been made by the IRS, CBS News' Aaron Navarro reports. But the effort comes after Mr. Trump on Tuesday\u00a0suggested that Harvard could lose its tax exemption. The tax agency's move to consider whether to strip Harvard of its designation as a 501(c)(3) organization was earlier reported by CNN.",
      "The IRS has awarded tax-exempt status to almost 2 million organizations, ranging from universities like Harvard to charities such as churches and foundations. The designation exempts these groups from paying federal income taxes, while donations to these groups are considered tax-deductible by the IRS.",
      "Mr. Trump's scrutiny of Harvard's tax status comes after the university on Monday rejected his administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration this week moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard.",
      "The Trump administration has also threatened to cut off federal funding at other\u00a0top universities\u00a0as it exerts pressure on the institutions' policies governing student expression on campus and academic programs.",
      "But stripping an organization of its tax-exempt status is an unusual step, especially for an institution the size and reputation of Harvard, experts said.",
      "\"It would be historically unprecedented,\" Brian Galle, professor of tax policy at Georgetown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Certainly no major research university has ever lost its tax exemption.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the issue.",
      "Why is Harvard tax exempt?",
      "Organizations that have a purpose deemed to be \"charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals\" can qualify for tax-exempt status, according to the IRS.",
      "Most private and public universities and colleges have been granted tax-exempt status by the IRS because of their educational mission, which the federal government has recognized for their importance in fostering the productivity and civic contributions of American citizens, the Association of American Universities says.",
      "Can Mr. Trump order the IRS to remove Harvard's tax-exempt status?",
      "Not legally, according to Sam Brunson, a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and an expert on federal income tax and nonprofit organizations.",
      "That's because Congress in 1998 passed a law that forbids the president from directing the IRS to audit or investigate taxpayers, he explained. If Mr. Trump instructed the IRS to remove Harvard's tax exemption, \"that runs exactly contrary to law,\" Brunson said.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said, \"Any forthcoming actions by the IRS will be conducted independently of the President, and investigations into any institution's violations of its tax status were initiated prior\" to Mr. Trump's social media post this week questioning Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Could the IRS remove Harvard's tax exemption?",
      "The IRS has legal authority to strip organizations of their tax-exempt status, and it occasionally exercises that power. But that is usually due to groups failing to meet tax requirements, like neglecting to file an annual information return for more than three consecutive years.",
      "One famous case involved a university losing its tax-exempt status, Galle and Brunson noted. In the 1970s, Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, a Christian institution, lost its tax-exempt status due to a policy that banned interracial relationships.",
      "That case ended up at the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1983 that the IRS was correct in depriving Bob Jones of the status because its rules had violated a \"fundamental national public policy\" about racial discrimination in education.",
      "The IRS could argue that Harvard is in violation of public policy either by failing to crack down on protestors rallying against Israel's actions in Gaza or by refusing to comply with the Trump administration's push against diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Brunson said. But both he and Galle expressed skepticism that such rationales would hold up in court, partly because universities have a constitutional right to freedom of speech, while also representing issues that are far different from the practices that Bob Jones engaged in.",
      "\"There isn't a society-wide agreement that allowing protests on your campus is inconsistent with fundamental public policy,\" Galle said.",
      "He added, \"Let's be clear: There is absolutely no basis for Harvard to lose its exemption. Zero.\"",
      "What happens if the IRS strips Harvard of its tax-exempt status?",
      "The IRS would first do an investigation and then inform Harvard of its reason for removing its tax-exempt status, Brunson said. Harvard could then file an appeal to the IRS. If that appeal failed, the university could then take the issue to the courts.",
      "As the case proceeded, it's likely that a court would issue an injunction or order to halt the IRS' decision, which means that Harvard would likely continue to operate as a tax-exempt institution until the case was resolved, experts said.",
      "\"Harvard isn't going to lose this \u2014 they have the money and the resources and the alumni to get the best people representing them,\" Brunson said. He predicted that Harvard would win a court case and \"set a precedent.\"",
      "How could losing tax-exempt status affect Harvard?",
      "Harvard could take a financial hit if it were to lose the tax-exempt status. But the extent of any resulting damage would be unclear given that Harvard could use tax strategies to lower its taxable income, similar to how major corporations rely on sophisticated techniques to reduce their tax liability. For instance, Harvard could lower its taxable income by deducting business costs, including its faculty salaries.",
      "By contrast, donors to Harvard could feel the impact because they wouldn't be able to deduct their contributions to the university from their own taxes. That could make it less palatable for donors to make large financial contributions.",
      "\"The biggest cost would be reduced donations,\" Brunson said. \"And the other cost is its endowment, which would no longer be tax exempt.\"",
      "Harvard's endowment stands at $52.3 billion, making it the biggest among all U.S. universities.",
      "What does Harvard say about the risk to its tax-exempt status?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Harvard reiterated that such a decision would be illegal.",
      "\"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission,\" a spokesperson wrote in an email. \"The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth.\"",
      "The spokesperson added, \"There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status.\"",

    "story": [
      "The wife of a 29-year-old Maryland man who was mistakenly deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador last month filed a protective order against him back in 2021 over allegations of domestic violence, according to court records obtained by CBS News.",
      "Jennifer Vasquez sought and received a temporary protective order in civil court against Kilmar Abrego Garcia in May 2021, per court records filed in Prince George's County District Court. The order alleges Abrego Garcia \"punched and scratched\" Vasquez, \"ripped off\" her shirt and \"grabbed and bruised\" her \u2014 though she has since said she didn't move forward with the court process because the situation \"did not escalate.\"",
      "In a court petition, Vasquez describes multiple incidents over the course of several days in May 2021. In one case, Vasquez wrote that Abrego Garcia got angry with her at a gas station, insulted her and drove very fast. Days later, Vasquez alleges Abrego Garcia yelled at her to turn off her laptop, and when she said she wasn't tired, she said he \"got angry\" and threw her laptop on the floor. She alleged she pushed him off of her, and \"he then punched\" and \"[scratched] me on my left eye, leaving me bleeding.\"",
      "Later that day, Abrego Garcia allegedly tore off Vasquez's shorts and shirt and \"grabbed me by the arm\" when she ran away, leaving a mark on her left arm. The following morning, after he allegedly didn't give her a set of car keys, she called an Uber for her and the kids because she was \"scared of him\" and \"afraid to be close to him.\"",
      "\"I have multiple photos/videos of how [violent] he can be and all the bruises he has left me,\" Vasquez wrote in the petition.",
      "At the time, the judge in the case ordered Abrego Garcia not to contact Vasquez, and to vacate their home and stay away from the home of another family member. He was also ordered to surrender firearms.",
      "The case, however, was dismissed in June 2021 after Vasquez failed to appear for a final hearing, according to court records. The two returned to living together.",
      "Abrego Garcia's legal team responded to Vasquez's protective order after the Department of Homeland Security posted it on X Wednesday, noting he hasn't been criminally convicted.",
      "\"If the government believes there is a legitimate case to be made, it should present that case in a court of law and have a judge review and decide his fate\u2014not on social media,\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers wrote. \"But that cannot happen until Mr. Abrego Garcia is returned to the United States and given full due process. These allegations, without more, prove why due process and access to counsel is so important.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Wednesday evening, Vasquez confirmed seeking the court order.",
      "\"After surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship, I acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar by seeking a civil protective order in case things escalated,\" Vasquez said. \"Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling. Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect. That is not a justification for ICE's action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation. Kilmar has always been a loving partner and father, and I will continue to stand by him and demand justice for him.\"",
      "Court records show Vasquez sought and obtained a separate temporary protective order in August 2020, also alleging domestic violence.",
      "Vasquez is a U.S. citizen and Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran national.",
      "The Trump administration has admitted that an \"administrative error\" led to Abrego Garcia's deportation on March 15, but has claimed Abrego Garcia is \"not a sympathetic figure,\" sharing Vasquez's protective order on X Wednesday.",
      "The case has prompted a string of legal wrangling that made its way to the Supreme Court, which last week upheld a lower court decision that the Trump administration be required to \"facilitate\" his release.",
      "Despite the Supreme Court's ruling, the case has appeared to languish. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has repeatedly rebuked the Trump administration for stonewalling her and not complying with her order to both provide information on Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and facilitate his return to the U.S.",
      "Abrego Garcia was among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadoran migrants that were placed aboard three March 15 deportation flights to El Salvador after the White House alleged, often without evidence, that the men are members of transnational gangs.",
      "President Trump invoked the wartime 1798 Alien Enemies Act as justification for deporting many of the migrants to El Salvador. Another federal judge who had ordered the three flights to El Salvador be turned around found Wednesday that there was probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for defying his orders.",
      "The men are reportedly being held in the notorious Salvadoran supermax prison, known as CECOT, under an agreement with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.",
      "During a White House meeting with Mr. Trump Monday, Bukele told reporters he would not be returning Abrego Garcia to the U.S., and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that same day it is \"up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old.",
      "In 2019, he was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but an immigration judge barred his removal from the U.S. after determining that he could face persecution by gangs if deported to El Salvador. The judge granted him what is known as \"withholding of removal\" status.",
      "He was arrested again on March 12 following a traffic stop. Citing information from an informant who officials have said is credible, the Department of Homeland Security has alleged that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim his family and attorneys deny. Abrego Garcia has no criminal record in the U.S. or El Salvador, according to government documents.",
      "In an interview with CBS News earlier this month, Vasquez said that Abrego Garcia is \"not a criminal. My husband is an amazing person. An amazing father.\"",

    "story": [
      "Dakota Meyer, a Marine who was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism in the Afghanistan War but later became a sharp critic of the Biden administration over its chaotic withdrawal from that conflict, is reenlisting in the military and will serve in the Marine Reserves.",
      "In a briefing with reporters on Thursday before his reenlistment ceremony, 36-year-old Meyer said he is returning to military service after 15 years out of uniform because he felt he \"had more to give.\" He's also close to President Trump's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth.",
      "But Meyer said he would refrain from politics while in uniform.",
      "\"The great part about being in the reserves is I'm still a citizen when I'm not on orders,\" he said. \"When I'm on orders I'll comply obviously with whatever the standard is.\"",
      "In brief remarks during the ceremony, Hegseth said Meyer's reenlistment is \"not common practice\" and the Marine Corps \"doesn't do things like this lightly,\" but praised Meyer's \"uncommon valor.\" Hegseth said the reenlistment shows \"you're never too old, you're never too experienced, you've never done too much that you can't continue to contribute.\"",
      "Originally from Kentucky, Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor, the military's highest honor, by then-President Barack Obama in 2011 for his heroics in Afghanistan when he charged five times in a Humvee into heavy gunfire to rescue comrades under attack by Taliban insurgents.",
      "On Sept. 8, 2009, Meyer was part of a security team supporting a patrol moving into a village in the Ganjgal Valley. Suddenly, the lights in a nearby village went out and gunfire erupted. About 50 Taliban insurgents on mountainsides and in the village had ambushed the patrol.",
      "His actions during the six-hour attack and firefight saved the lives of 36 people, both Americans and Afghans. He killed at least eight Taliban insurgents. Firing from a gun turret on top of a Humvee driven by a fellow Marine, he provided cover for his team, allowing many to escape likely death.",
      "Meyer described the events in a 2011 interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" telling correspondent David Martin, \"I didn't think I was going to die. I knew I was.\"",
      "Four American soldiers died in the ambush: 1st Lt. Michael Johnson, 25, from Virginia Beach, Virginia; Staff Sgt. Aaron Kenefick, 30, of Roswell, Georgia; Corpsman James Layton, 22, of Riverbank, California; and Edwin Wayne Johnson Jr., a 31-year-old gunnery sergeant from Columbus, Georgia. A fifth man, Army Sgt. Kenneth W. Westbrook, 41, of Shiprock, New Mexico, died later from his wounds.",
      "After leaving the military, Meyer remained in the spotlight. In 2016 he married former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's daughter, Bristol, and they had two children. Years later, in 2019, he told \"60 Minutes\" about his experience with a\u00a0new post-traumatic stress disorder treatment.",
      "He's been outspoken about the jailing of another Marine \u2014 Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller \u2014 who criticized the Biden administration for the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan in social media posts while in uniform, which is a violation of military conduct.",

      "European leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier\u00a0can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"",
      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",
      "The hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner.",
      "\"If I wouldn't think it's a reliable partner, I wouldn't be here,\" Meloni responded.",
      "Meloni said she's \"here to find the best way to make us both stronger.\"",
      "\"The goal for me is to make the West great again,\" Meloni said. \"And I think we can do it together.\"",

      "Von der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",
      "Meloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.",
      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",

      "\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" the French government's Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, said last week, adding: \"Europe is only strong if it is united.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear arguments on May 15 on a Trump administration request to partially enforce the president's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said that it will hear oral arguments next month over whether the Trump administration can partially enforce an executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship while proceedings in a challenge to the directive move forward.",
      "The court said in an unsigned order that arguments on the Justice Department's request for emergency relief will take place during a special sitting on May 15. The administration has asked the Supreme Court to limit the scope of three separate injunctions that blocked implementation of President Trump's order nationwide.",
      "If the high court decides to grant the Justice Department's request, it would prevent the administration from enforcing Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship order only against the plaintiffs in the ongoing cases: seven individuals, specific members of immigrants' rights groups and residents of 22 states.",
      "The dispute over the president's attempt to unwind birthright citizenship is the latest in which the Supreme Court has been asked to intervene, with more requests expected. More than 100 cases that seek to knock down Mr. Trump's second-term policies have been filed since he returned to the White House in late January, and several have already made their way to the high court.",
      "The president's executive order on birthright citizenship was one of the first that he signed on his first day back in office and is among several directives that seek to target migrants who are in the U.S. unlawfully. The Trump administration's immigration policies have led to high-profile clashes with the courts \u2014 namely Mr. Trump's use of the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members of a Venezuelan gang and the administration's mistaken removal of a Maryland man in the U.S. unlawfully to El Salvador.",
      "While the 14th Amendment has for more than a century been understood to guarantee citizenship to all people born in the U.S., Mr. Trump's order denied birthright citizenship to children born to a mother who is unlawfully present in the U.S. or who is lawfully present on a temporary basis; or whose father is neither a citizen nor lawful permanent resident.",
      "The president's order directed federal agencies to stop issuing documents recognizing U.S. citizenship to children born after Feb. 19.",
      "More than half-dozen lawsuits challenging the measure were filed in courts throughout the country before it took effect, and three federal district courts in Washington, Maryland and Massachusetts each blocked the government from implementing the birthright citizenship order.",
      "Federal appeals courts in San Francisco, Boston and Richmond, Virginia, then refused requests by the Trump administration to partly block the lower court orders.",
      "The Justice Department filed emergency appeals of the three decisions with the Supreme Court in mid-March and asked it to limit enforcement of the birthright citizenship order to 28 states and individuals who are not involved in the ongoing cases. Then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said that a minimum, the Supreme Court should allow agencies to develop and issue public guidance regarding implementation of Mr. Trump's executive order while proceedings continue.",
      "Like other requests made to the Supreme Court, Harris took aim at the breadth of the injunctions issued by the district courts, which are nationwide in scope and cover states and individuals who are not involved in the litigation before them.",
      "The president and his allies have attacked judges for issuing nationwide injunctions in the slew of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies, and even called for some to be impeached.",
      "\"Universal injunctions have reached epidemic proportions since the start of the current administration,\" Harris wrote. \"Courts have graduated from universal preliminary injunctions to universal temporary restraining orders, from universal equitable relief to universal monetary remedies, and from governing the whole nation to governing the whole world.\"",
      "She argued that nationwide, or universal, injunctions prevent the executive branch from carrying out its work and impede Mr. Trump's ability to address what he says is a \"crisis\" at the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\"The district courts' universal injunctions threaten to perpetuate those problems by holding out a nationwide incentive for illegal immigration: the prospect of American citizenship for the unlawful migrants' children and of derivative immigration benefits for the migrants themselves,\" Harris wrote.",
      "But the challengers urged the Supreme Court to leave the district court orders untouched.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, officials from 18 states, the District of Columbia and San Francisco called the Trump administration's request \"remarkable,\" as it would allow the government to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship while the legal challenges move forward and render them \"deportable on birth and at risk of statelessness.",
      "The states argued that the Justice Department is seeking to violate binding Supreme Court precedent that recognized that birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.",
      "Two immigrants' rights groups, CASA Inc and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, refuted the suggestion by the government that it needs emergency relief.",
      "\"The Executive Branch has been complying with the settled interpretation of the Citizenship Clause for 125 years, and the government has demonstrated no urgent need to change now,\"\u00a0 they wrote in a filing.",
      "The groups also noted that with more than 800,000 members across all 50 states, \"nationwide consistency\" is important in the context of U.S. citizenship.",
      "\"Whether a child is a citizen of our nation should not depend on the state where she is born or the associations her parents have joined,\" lawyers for the groups said.",

    "story": [
      "After nearly 11 hours of debate, the Texas House approved early Thursday a controversial bill that would provide eligible families with public funds to help pay for private school tuition.",
      "The school choice bill was passed in an 85-63 vote \u2013 two were absent. The measure will provide taxpayer-funded education savings accounts, also known as school vouchers, allowing students in public schools to attend private institutions if accepted into the state's program.",
      "Eligibility for Texas school vouchers and funds allocation",
      "Under the bill,\u00a0students will receive $10,000 each year\u00a0if they attend a private school. Disabled students would receive up to $30,000 a year and home-schooled students would get $2,000.",
      "\"This is an extraordinary victory for the thousands of parents who have advocated for more choices when it comes to the education of their children\u2026I applaud the legislators who took a stand with the overwhelming majority of Texans who support school choice,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said.",
      "Abbott and Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows have said for months that they have more than the 76 votes required to pass the bill.",
      "\"Today marks a historic chapter for education in our state, with the Texas House passing its landmark 'Texas Two Step' proposals to deliver more education opportunities for students alongside the largest-ever increase in public school funding,\" Burrows said.",
      "The vote marks the first time since 1957 that the Texas House has approved legislation making state money available for families to use on their children's private schooling, according to the Texas Tribune.",
      "The vote took place just after 2 a.m. Thursday, after the Texas House heard 43 amendment proposals to the bill. All proposed amendments were tabled. The vote was divided between Democrats and Republicans. Out of all the votes, two Republicans joined all Democrats to vote against the bill.",
      "\"Welfare for the rich\"",
      "Texas Democrats expressed disappointment about the outcome, calling it \"welfare for the rich.\" Democrats also expressed concern that the program will hurt school districts by taking money away from them.",
      "Most state Republicans supported the legislation.",
      "\"Working families are going to be the ones who will foot the bill for this voucher scam,\" said Texas Democrats Chair Kendall Scudder. \"We're deeply disappointed in the lawmakers who chose to fall in line instead of standing up for their communities.\"",
      "The House will take a final vote later on Thursday. The bill will then go to the Texas Senate, where lawmakers will decide whether to go along with the House's changes or make their own changes.",
      "Trump weighs in",
      "Ahead of the vote, Abbott said that President Trump supported school choice as well.",
      "\"[Trump] called this morning to share his support for the Texas House passing SB 2 today,\" Abbott posted on social media.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on social media on Thursday congratulating his \"friends\" Abbott, Burrows and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick \"along with Texas Legislators for finally passing SCHOOL CHOICE, which I strongly endorsed.\"",
      "\"This is a gigantic Victory for students and parents in the Great State of Texas!\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"We will very soon be sending Education BACK TO ALL THE STATES, where it belongs. It is our goal to bring Education in the United States to the highest level, one that it has never attained before.\"",
      "HB 2: Public school funding bill",
      "On Wednesday, the Texas House passed HB 2, the public school funding bill. It passed 144-4, with two absent. Republican leaders said it represents the largest increase in funding for public schools.",
      "\"Texas public schools are the backbone of our communities, and today the House delivered a historic investment to bolster public education for the next generation,\" Burrows said Wednesday. \"House Bill 2 lays the foundation for a modernized, responsive school finance system that will grow with the needs of Texas students while targeting taxpayer dollars where they'll make the greatest impact for students and teachers.",
      "Under this bill's proposals and others, the House will inject $9 billion in new money. That includes raising the basic allotment to school districts by $395. Forty percent of the new funding will go toward teacher pay raises and salary increases for other staff. The basic allotment would increase every two years.",
      "Democrats have said the state doesn't spend enough money on public education when compared to other states. Republicans, though, said they have continued to spend more money on schools.",
      "As lawmakers debate the bills, various local school districts across North Texas have passed deficit budgets because of record inflation and after Republican lawmakers left $4.5 billion for schools on the sidelines. The districts have also faced declining student enrollment, which has cost them funding as well.",

      "Bismarck, N.D. \u2014 More than 9,000 Catholic employers don't need to abide by federal regulations protecting workers who seek abortions and fertility treatments under a ruling issued this week by a federal judge in North Dakota.",

      "U.S. District Judge Daniel Traynor later granted a preliminary injunction to temporarily block the commission's final rule for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and enforcement guidance for harassment protections for workers that includes gender identity under sex-based discrimination.",
      "On Tuesday, Traynor issued a permanent block on the regulations, finding the association and the diocese succeeded on the merits of their claim that the Pregnant Worker Fairness Act violated a federal law protecting religious freedom.",
      "The judge said the case's facts and evidence haven't changed since the initial block he issued last year.",
      "Last year, he wrote: \"It is a precarious time for people of religious faith in America. It has been described as a post-Christian age. One indication of this dire assessment may be the repeated illegal and unconstitutional administrative actions against one of the founding principles of our country, the free exercise of religion.\"",
      "The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act took effect in 2023. The law requires covered employers make reasonable accommodations for workers' pregnancy or childbirth-related needs. In 2024, the EEOC issued the rule implementing the law and the harassment enforcement guidance.",
      "In earlier court papers, the association and the diocese said, \"The combined effect of EEOC's pronouncements is that they require CBA Members, contrary to their Catholic faith, to accommodate their employees' abortions and immoral fertility treatments, to use false pronouns when requested by transitioning employees, to abstain from expressing Catholic teaching regarding sexual issues, and to give employees of one sex access to private spaces reserved to those of the other sex.\"",
      "The EEOC previously asked the judge to deny a permanent injunction and said the other side can't back up its claims.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/guantanamo-trump-migrants-without-criminal-records/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 07:05:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay, allowing officials to send non-criminal detainees there despite a vow to hold \"the worst\" offenders at the naval base.",
      "As part of his aggressive crackdown on immigration, President Trump in late January directed officials to convert facilities inside the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into holding sites for migrants living in the country illegally. At the time, Mr. Trump said \"the worst\" migrants would be held at the base, directing officials to make space for \"high-priority criminal aliens.\"",
      "But a previously undisclosed agreement between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense indicates that the Trump administration gave officials wide-ranging discretion to decide who to send to Guantanamo Bay, enacting criteria not predicated on the severity of detainees' criminal history or conduct. In fact, the memo does not mention any criminality assessment. [Read the full memo at the bottom of this story.]",
      "Instead, the agreement, signed on March 7 by top DHS and Pentagon officials, says the departments agreed to use the Guantanamo base to detain migrants with final deportation orders who have \"a nexus to a transnational criminal organization (TCO) or criminal drug activity.\"",
      "Officials defined \"nexus\" in broad terms. A nexus can be satisfied, the memo says, if migrants with final deportation orders are part of a transnational criminal group or if they paid one \"to be smuggled into the United States.\" The latter condition could be used to describe many of the migrants and asylum-seekers who have illegally crossed the U.S. southern border, as criminal groups in Mexico largely control the illicit movement of people and drugs there.",
      "Migrants who overstayed a visa are not eligible to be sent to Guantanamo Bay, the document says. But if the nature of a migrant's entry is unclear, the memo allows officials to assume that the person paid a criminal group to enter the U.S. and to send them to Guantanamo if they hail from a nation \"where the preponderance of aliens from that country enter the United States in that fashion.\"",
      "The conditions for transferring migrants to Guantanamo, as outlined in the memo, seem to be at odds with statements by Mr. Trump and high-ranking members of his administration that have suggested the base would be used as a detention site for dangerous criminals.",
      "Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former U.S. immigration official during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said the memo's rules \"apply very broadly to any immigrant who came to the U.S. via the U.S.-Mexico border.\"",
      "\"It's very well known that almost every immigrant who makes it to the U.S.-Mexico border would have to pay some sort of money to the cartels that control the territory on the Mexican side, directly or indirectly,\" she said.",
      "Cardinal Brown added that the rules do not appear to include \"any individualized assessment\" to determine whether migrant detainees pose a threat, before transferring them to Guantanamo.",
      "Department of Defense spokeswoman Kingsley Wilson confirmed the existence of the memo, saying it \"strengthens DoD and DHS collaboration by clarifying roles and responsibilities, and fostering efficient and coordinated operations at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to DHS representatives for comment.",
      "The Guantanamo operation is not the only Trump administration immigration effort to face scrutiny over who exactly has been targeted. In mid-March, for example, the administration deported 238 Venezuelans to El Salvador, so they could be imprisoned inside that country's infamous mega-prison. The Trump administration said they were all criminals and gang members, but a \"60 Minutes\" investigation did not find a criminal record for 75% of the Venezuelan deportees.",
      "A high-profile yet largely secretive operation",
      "The Trump administration first began sending migrants to Guantanamo in February, initially only transferring Venezuelans there, including men it accused of having ties to the Tren de Aragua prison gang. The first group of Venezuelan detainees was eventually flown to Honduras, where the Venezuelan government picked them up so they could be transported back to their homeland.",
      "Since then, the administration has sporadically flown migrants from different countries to the base, before transferring them back to the U.S. or other nations. Administration officials have regularly touted the flights to Guantanamo but have provided limited details about the operation, including on costs and who is eligible to be sent to the base.",
      "What has been publicly revealed, by CBS News and other media outlets, is that officials have transferred both detainees considered to be \"high-threat\" and \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo, including migrants whose relatives have denied allegations of gang membership and criminality.",
      "Government guidelines define migrant detainees as posing a \"high\" threat if they have violent or serious criminal records, histories of disruptive conduct or alleged gang ties. Low-risk detainees are defined as migrants who face deportation because they are in the U.S. illegally but who lack any serious criminal record \u2014 or any at all.",
      "Those sent to Guantanamo and considered to be \"high-threat\" migrants have been held at Camp VI, a section of the post-9/11 prison that still houses roughly a dozen terrorism suspects. Migrant detainees deemed to pose a \"low\" risk have been transferred to the base's Migrant Operations Center, a barrack-like facility that has historically housed asylum-seekers intercepted at sea.",
      "Wilson, the Department of Defense spokeswoman, said there are currently 42 migrants detained at Guantanamo, 32 of them housed at the Migrant Operations Center and 10 so-called \"high-threat\" detainees held at Camp VI.",
      "The March 7 memo obtained by CBS News sheds light on other aspects of operations at Guantanamo. For example, it confirms the migrant detainees transported there remain in the legal custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even though the military is providing access to its facilities to detain them.",
      "As part of the agreement, DHS also accepted the conditions at Camp VI and the Migrant Operations Center as adequate to hold migrant adults, noting it would not transfer children to the base. The department agreed to send ICE officers or contractors to the base, including to oversee security at the Migrant Operations Center.",
      "The memo makes DHS responsible for providing detainees services like recreation and religious accommodations; determining whether migrants get access to lawyers; and administering \"involuntary medical treatment,\" such as force-feeding during hunger strikes.",
      "The agreement also charges DHS with overseeing the transfer of detainees from and to Guantanamo, requiring the department to relocate migrants from the base no more than 180 days after their deportation orders are issued.",
      "The military, as stipulated by the agreement, is principally responsible for providing security at Camp VI and in the perimeter of the facilities. It also agreed to provide toilets and hygiene facilities, as well as medical care to both ICE personnel and detained migrants.",
      "The memo says the Department of Defense committed to erect tents at the base to hold additional detainees, though those sites have not been used to detain migrants yet. The agreement notes, however, that those tents \"do not have power, lighting, or heating/air conditioning.\"",
      "The effort to hold migrants at Guantanamo faces legal challenges by advocates, including at the American Civil Liberties Union, the Trump administration's chief adversary in federal court.",
      "The ACLU alleged in court filings that migrants were initially held incommunicado at Guantanamo, without access to relatives or lawyers. The administration subsequently said it took steps to give migrant detainees access to lawyers.",
      "The ACLU has also described detention conditions at Guantanamo as deplorable, citing declarations from migrants held there. In one of those declarations, a Venezuelan man previously held at the base said he went on a hunger strike after feeling he had been \"kidnapped.\"",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the lead architect of the Trump administration's immigration agenda, said earlier this week there are no plans to stop using Guantanamo to detain migrants.",
      "\"It's wide open,\" Miller said on Fox News. \"Gitmo is open.\"",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday his state will file a lawsuit challenging President Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs that have set off a global trade war.",
      "The suit will argue Mr. Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China or a 10% tariff on all imports is unlawful. The act enables a president to freeze and block transactions in response to foreign threats.",
      "The lawsuit, which will be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, will argue that enacting such tariffs requires approval from Congress, Newsom's office said in a news release.",
      "\"No other state will be more impacted by the impacts of this,\" Newsom said at a Wednesday press conference alongside California Attorney General Rob Bonta in the Central Valley.",
      "\"Already, vendors have warned us that they're going to pass the costs of Trump's tariffs onto the state of California,\" Bonta said.",
      "Bonta and Newsom noted that the lawsuit will be the 14th in less than 14 weeks that California has filed against the Trump administration.",
      "\"We're asking the court to rein in the president,\" Bonta said.",
      "Mr. Trump has offered many justifications for increasing tariffs, including that they are designed to spur U.S. manufacturing and stop the flow of illicit fentanyl into the country. California's move follows rapidly changing tariff plans by the Trump administration. The government briefly imposed steep \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries\u00a0last week, before pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days \u2014 but Mr. Trump left in place a 10% tariff on most imported goods, and hiked levies on imports from China to a total of 145%.",
      "Newsom said the tariffs have, in effect, resulted in inflated costs and billions of dollars in damage in California, which has the largest economy among the states and is a massive exporter of goods.",
      "\"No state is poised to lose more than the state of California,\" Newsom said.",
      "California's lawsuit makes it the first U.S. state to sue the Trump administration over tariffs. The state will ask the court to immediately block the tariffs.",

      "\"Tariffs likely lead to higher prices while softening consumer sentiment and business optimism possibly means slower growth,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, in an email. \"This is going to make economic forecasting more difficult, and the Fed is likely going to widen their bands growth and rates with risks to both price stability and full employment rising.\"",
      "Yet some splits among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee have emerged. On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.",
      "Should the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \"sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\"",
      "But other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.",
      "For now, most recent reports suggest the economy is in solid shape. Hiring has been solid and inflation cooled in March. Yet measures of consumer and business confidence have plunged, raising concerns among economists that spending and business investment could weaken.",

    "summary": "The owner of a small stationery business based in Pensacola, Florida, says her company is facing up to $1 million in tariff payments this year alone under the Trump administration's new tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Pensacola, Florida\u00a0\u2014 Emily Ley has spent the last 17 years building Simplified, her small stationery business based in Pensacola, Florida.",
      "The company produces its planners in China, but for American shoppers.",
      "\"I would love to make them here, but the U.S. simply doesn't have the infrastructure or the supply chain to do it,\" Ley told CBS News.",
      "That stationery is now subject to the recent slew of\u00a0sky-high tariffs.",
      "\"We don't have the same options as large businesses,\" Ley said. \"We don't have the same capital or ability to pivot.\"",
      "After President Trump raised tariffs on China this month,\u00a0eventually totaling 145%, Ley, with the help of the nonpartisan, conservative-funded New Civil Liberties Alliance, filed a federal lawsuit against the president, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and acting U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Pete Flores, alleging illegal use of emergency powers illegally to enact the fees.",
      "Ley said that because Congressional approval was bypassed to impose the tariffs, she and other voters didn't have their positions represented.",
      "\"Had (Congress) had a chance to debate, discuss, vote, be involved,\u00a0I would've then had the opportunity to make my voice heard,\" she explained. \"And same for other Americans who were gonna be impacted by the tariffs. That didn't happen.\"",
      "\"If this is the end of my American dream, I'm gonna go down swinging,\" Ley said.",
      "The president has argued that the tariffs represent short-term pain that will result in long-term gain.",
      "But according to Ley, \"We can't survive the short-term pain, and especially without any sort of plan in place to create the infrastructure here...It would take years and millions and millions of dollars to build such a thing that's been built overseas over decades.\"",
      "Ley said Simplified has paid nearly $1.2 million in tariffs since Mr. Trump's first term, and is facing between $830,000 and $1 million in payments this year alone under the administration's new tariffs.",
      "While the White House is\u00a0offering exemptions\u00a0to multibillion-dollar Chinese industries that produce smartphones and other electronics, Ley says that to just cover the cost of tariffs at 145%, she would have to raise prices on her $64 signature planner to $82. To maintain a profit on her planners, Ley would have to double the sticker price to about $120.",
      "\"I'm not paying $120 for a planner,\" Ley said.",
      "Ley employs eight other women, and disclosed that she is being forced to consider reducing salaries and possibly eliminating positions, something she says she really doesn't want to do.",
      "She says it comes down to keeping prices manageable for customers while balancing the new tariff burden on her bottom line.",
      "Ley said that China's unique manufacturing infrastructure isn't currently available in the U.S. or other countries internationally. Different elements of her planners are made in several different factories in the Shenzhen region. Because they are located close to one another, the final product is higher quality and more affordable.",
      "In response to Ley's lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, told CBS News in a statement that the president \"has broad authority to impose tariffs to address issues of national emergency, such as the opioid pandemic. The Trump Administration looks forward to victory in court.\"",
      "Ley says her business cannot survive such tariffs.",
      "\"That's what's terrifying,\" Ley said. \"...It's just not sustainable. And it's truly catastrophic to so many businesses, and big businesses and small businesses alike. But I really think small businesses are gonna be the casualty of this trade war.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:29:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge said he could recommend criminal prosecutions against the Trump administration, setting up an unprecedented showdown.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg threatened on Wednesday to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for defying a court order to return Venezuelan migrants en route to a Salvadoran prison last month \u2014 possibly setting the stage for an unprecedented showdown between President Trump and the judicial branch.",
      "Boasberg, who said the government \"deliberately flouted\" his orders, warned if the administration doesn't change course, he could hold hearings, recommend criminal charges and hire a private attorney to prosecute the case if the Department of Justice refuses.",
      "Why could Judge Boasberg hold the Trump administration in contempt of court?",
      "In a searing written decision, Boasberg said the Trump administration showed a \"willful disregard\" for his orders not to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The government has cited the 18th-century law to fly hundreds of alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador, whose government is holding scores of U.S. deportees in a notorious maximum-security prison. The Trump administration has touted the deportations as ridding the U.S. of foreign gang members, but an analysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the men sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%.",
      "Some of those migrants sued to prevent their removal last month, and Boasberg quickly ordered the government verbally to return the migrants to the United States, even if that requires officials to \"turn a plane around.\" The judge later issued a written order barring the administration from removing migrants under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Boasberg wrote Wednesday the government disobeyed those orders by not returning the migrants to the United States. Since then, he said he's given officials \"ample opportunity\" to explain what happened, but found their responses unsatisfactory.",
      "The Trump administration has denied violating the judge's order, and White House communications director Steven Cheung says the government will appeal Boasberg's ruling. \"The President is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,\" he wrote in a statement.",
      "What is contempt of court?",
      "Under federal law, criminal contempt of court is defined as disobeying a federal court's \"lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"",
      "As with any criminal case, prosecutors would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant \u2014 in this case, potentially a federal official \u2014 willfully violated an order, says Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.",
      "Contempt cases are extremely rare, according to Epner. He said that during his three-year stint as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, he can't recall anyone even threatening to bring a criminal contempt of court case, much less actually bringing charges.",
      "\"In my experience as a lawyer over the last 30 years, even the hint of being held in contempt by a judge is ordinarily enough in order to cause litigants to correct their behavior,\" Epner said.",
      "What happens next in this case?",
      "Before moving forward, Boasberg gave the government an opportunity to \"purge\" its alleged contempt, saying the government could take the migrants back into U.S. custody so they can potentially seek relief from a court. If the administration decides to go down that route, he gave officials one week to file court papers \"explaining the steps they have taken and will take.\"",
      "Boasberg said he is also open to other solutions.",
      "Otherwise, Boesberg says the Trump administration has one week to give the court the names of whoever \"made the decision not to halt the transfer\" of the migrants covered by his orders. If needed, Boasberg said he'll hold hearings or order depositions to gather more details.",
      "After that, Boasberg said he could recommend a criminal prosecution for contempt of court, though it's unclear who the defendant would be.",
      "However, Boasberg can't necessarily force charges to be brought. Federal prosecutions are generally handled by the Department of Justice, which has the power to decide which cases it pursues, making it highly unlikely the Trump administration will choose to criminally charge its own officials. Epner told CBS News he \"cannot imagine a circumstance\" where the DOJ chooses to bring those charges.",
      "Can Boasberg appoint a private lawyer to prosecute the administration?",
      "It's complicated. Boasberg notes that if the Justice Department decides not to bring contempt charges, he has the right to appoint a private attorney to step in and prosecute the case. That option isn't unheard-of: In one well-known 2023 case, the Supreme Court chose not to strike down a contempt conviction against lawyer Steven Donziger that was prosecuted by private attorneys.",
      "But that route is extremely unusual and would almost certainly face legal pushback, Epner says. In the small handful of situations where judges have appointed lawyers to step in and act as prosecutor, it has generally been because the DOJ simply decided bringing contempt charges wasn't worth its time, according to Epner. Boasberg's case is far thornier because it would involve a direct confrontation with federal officials.",
      "\"Actually trying to prosecute a criminal contempt here would be a mess because all of these issues would have to be unpacked,\" Epner said.",
      "Any effort to prosecute Trump administration officials privately could reach the Supreme Court, and Epner argues \"all evidence is that they are bending over in every possible supine position to avoid a showdown with Donald Trump.\" The court has already weighed in, overturning Boasberg's order on the grounds that cases should have been brought in another court district.",
      "For those reasons, Epner thinks it's unlikely that Boasberg will go with private attorneys, saying, \"it is literally setting up a constitutional crisis.\"",
      "Could the Trump administration face other contempt charges?",
      "It's unclear, though the administration has run into resistance from federal judges in other cases.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the government to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who the Trump administration conceded was mistakenly sent to the same Salvadoran prison as the Venezuelan migrants. In a hearing Tuesday, Xinis said the administration \"has not yet fulfilled the mandate, the order, that I issued,\" and ordered expedited discovery in the case, saying, \"there will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers have suggested the government be held in contempt. Xinis said Tuesday, \"I will have the record before me to call it like I see it\" before ruling on contempt.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge said Wednesday that probable cause exists to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt over what he said was its defiance of an order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants who were bound for El Salvador.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote in a 46-page decision that the government's actions on March 15 \"demonstrate a willful disregard\" for his order barring the government from transferring certain migrants into Salvadoran custody under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Those actions, he wrote, are \"sufficient for the court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt. The court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory.\"",
      "\"The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders \u2014 especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "The judge's ruling marks the most direct rebuke of the Trump administration amid its escalating tensions with the federal judiciary, which have particularly grown over challenges to the president's efforts surrounding immigration.",
      "President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Boasberg over his handling of the case that arose after the president issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a seldom-used law from 1798, to summarily deport Venezuelans who his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "The judge said the Trump administration can remedy the breach of his order before contempt proceedings are initiated by asserting custody over the migrants who were removed in violation of it, so they can assert their right to challenge their removability. Administration officials will also have the chance to suggest \"other methods\" of coming into compliance with the order, Boasberg wrote.",
      "White House communications director Steven Cheung said the administration will seek immediate relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.",
      "\"The president is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Boasberg, who sits on the district court in Washington, D.C., was overseeing a challenge brought by a group of Venezuelan migrants who sought to prevent their removal under the more than 200-year-old wartime law. The judge swiftly blocked the Trump administration from removing the plaintiffs from the U.S. for 14 days and, after convening an emergency hearing, told government lawyers in-person that they should return people subject to the proclamation who were on planes headed to El Salvador back to the U.S.",
      "A written order issued shortly after blocked the Trump administration from conducting any deportations of noncitizens in its custody under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg's order did not block the government from deporting the alleged gang members or others under other immigration authorities.",
      "But the judge said that despite his written and oral directives, the government did not stop the removal process, and planes carrying migrants subject to deportation under the Alien Enemies Act later landed in El Salvador, where most were transferred to its Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT.",
      "The Trump administration's actions sparked questions as to whether it had violated Boasberg's order. The judge wrote in his opinion that \"boasts\" by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele \"intimated that they had defied the court's order deliberately and gleefully.\"",
      "Who, exactly, in the Trump administration ordered the two planes to continue on to El Salvador, is unclear. In his opinion, Boasberg wrote that he plans to find that out through further proceedings and potentially live witness testimony under oath if needed.",
      "In the last hearing on the matter, a Justice Department attorney named two Department of Homeland Security officials and one State Department official as his points of contact after the judge's decision but said he did not know who directed the planes to continue their flights.",
      "Boasberg found that the Trump administration failed to dispel of any concerns that they violated his injunction, and during further proceedings, declined to \"admit to a grave mistake, explain how it transpired, and detail plans to rectify it.\"",
      "He accused the government of \"increasing obstructionism\" and \"stonewalling\" over its refusal to answer basic questions that aimed to resolve whether noncitizens who were removable solely under Mr. Trump's proclamation were transferred out of U.S. custody after the judge issued his order forbidding their deportation.",
      "\"Defendants provide no convincing reason to avoid the conclusion that appears obvious from the above factual recitation: that they deliberately flouted this court's written order and, separately, its oral command that explicitly delineated what compliance entailed,\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged Tren de Aragua members reached the Supreme Court late last month. The high court last week said that the Trump administration could resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants it claims are Tren de Aragua members under the law, but only if they are given due process.",
      "The high court also said that migrants challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act must seek judicial review through habeas petitions filed in the district where they are detained. As a result, the dispute before Boasberg in Washington, D.C., should instead be filed in Texas, where the Venezuelan migrants are confined, the Supreme Court said.",
      "Boasberg wrote that the Supreme Court's order \"does not affect \u2014 let alone moot \u2014 the compliance inquiry presently teed up here.\"",
      "The Trump administration invoked the state-secrets privilege in an effort to keep details out of Boasberg's reach in his efforts to find out more information about the two flights. But the judge found it is \"exceedingly doubtful that the privilege applies here\" because he was not asking about diplomatic agreements between the U.S. and El Salvador, or the operational specifics of how the deportations were arranged.",
      "\"Instead, the court is simply seeking to confirm times and numbers: how many passengers the two flights carried, whether they were all deported pursuant to the proclamation, and when they were transferred out of U.S. custody,\" Boasberg wrote. \"The court is skeptical that such information rises to the level of a state secret.\"",
      "The judge also rejected the Trump administration's contentions that his order infringed on the president's authority, saying it merely restricted executive actions, which courts routinely do.",
      "\"It in no way invaded any Article II powers, despite defendants' effort to incant new ones into existence,\" he wrote. \"In any event, even if the TRO did somehow overstep the court's Article III power, defendants cannot now evade a contempt charge on that basis.\"",
      "Boasberg said that if the Trump administration and Justice Department do not prosecute his criminal contempt of court case, he will appoint someone who will.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump plans to overhaul the Endangered Species Act to make it easier to build in the U.S. where endangered species live, a White House official confirmed Wednesday.",
      "The president has voiced frustration with the 1973 law and similar environmental protections, saying environmentalists are impeding growth. Real Clear Politics first reported Mr. Trump's plans to overhaul the law.",
      "A White House source was granted anonymity as the announcement is not official.",
      "It's not yet exactly clear how Mr. Trump would alter the use of the law, since only Congress can change or repeal it, but it would likely come through the federal rule-making process. The law was established to protect species of wildlife, fish and plants that have been depleted enough to be in danger of extinction.",
      "Last week, the president directed agencies regulating energy and the environment to sunset a number of environmental protections, among other steps to curb environmental protections to spur construction and economic growth.",
      "One step the administration is considering is to repeal the definition of 'harm,' which would remove nearly all habitat protections for endangered species across the country. Currently, if any business or activity harms a protected species, it's a violation of the law, as established by the ESA. The law defines \"harm\" as including \"any activity that can modify a species' habitat.\" Loss of habitat is the single greatest threat to most species, since many aren't \"taken\" or killed to the point of extinction.. By eliminating this legal definition of \"harm,\" it would clear the way for many forms of economic development, including logging, oil and gas drilling, or critical mineral mining that could eradicate a species, environmentalists say.",
      "\"We'll go to court to fight as many of these rollbacks as possible,\" said Brett Hartl, director of government affairs for the Center for Biological Diversity. \"The federal government is large and they're throwing everything at the wall hoping to overwhelm us, but we'll do our damnedest to make sure nothing becomes permanent.\"",
      "The Endangered Species Act was established in 1973 to protect \"various species of fish, wildlife, and plants in the United States that had been rendered extinct as a consequence of economic growth and development untampered by adequate concern and conservation.\" By designating\u00a0 species with a protected status, this ensures that the ecosystems where the species live will be conserved and steps are taken to help support the species to avoid extinction. This, by extension, means that Congress and federal agencies will work with state and local governments to address water resources that impact species, as well as habitat.",
      "Critics of the Endangered Species Act claim the law goes far beyond the initial intent and is overly burdensome. Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, has frequently suggested changes to the ESA and last month proposed the Endangered Species Amendment Act of 2025. He said in a statement, \"The Endangered Species Act has consistently failed to achieve its intended goals and has been warped by decades of radical environmental litigation into a weapon instead of a tool.\"",
      "Much of what the Trump administration is proposing, by sunsetting regulations and overhauling the ESA, aligns with Westerman's bill.\"Environmental is the biggest tool for stopping growth,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan last year.",
      "Environmentalists, however, are concerned about weakening the law.",
      "\"This is a full-out assault on America's heritage,\" said Andrew Wetzler, the senior vice president of nature at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"If Trump is successful, it will turn the ESA into a shell of itself, and this would be open season for our most important wildlife.\"",
      "In the 50 years since the law was enacted, the ESA has been credited with saving 99% of the listed species. Notable species saved include the bald eagle, American alligators, whooping cranes and peregrine falcons.",
      "CBS News reported in 2023 that since the passage of the law, more than 1,7000 plants, mammals, fish, insects and other species in the U.S. have been listed as threatened or endangered. But federal data shows that of the roughly $1.2 billion a year spent on endangered and threatened species, about half goes toward recovery of just two types of fish: salmon and steelhead trout along the West Coast.",

Van Hollen said. \"If you listen to President Trump and the Trump administration, you would think that U.S. courts have found that Mr. Abrego Garcia is part of MS-13, but they have not found that. In fact, recently, a U.S. federal court judge said that the Trump administration did not have evidence to support the claim that he had ever been part of MS-13.\"",

    "summary": "Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Wednesday that the Justice Department is filing a civil lawsuit against Maine's Department of Education, claiming it violated Title IX.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Wednesday that the Justice Department is filing a civil lawsuit against Maine's Department of Education for \"discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women's sports\" in what she alleged is a violation of Title IX.",
      "\"The Department of Justice will not sit by when women are discriminated against in sports,\" Bondi said. \"This is about sports, this is also about these young womens' personal safety.\"",
      "The move marks an escalation between the Trump administration and Maine over the issue. President Trump signed an executive order in February to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity, mandating that Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, be interpreted as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. President Trump said states not in compliance would jeopardize any federal funding they receive.",
      "Then, in a tense moment between Mr. Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, later in February, the president threatened that her state wouldn't get federal funding if it didn't comply with the executive order barring transgender athletes from competing on women's sports teams. Mills replied, \"See you in court.\"",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who appeared alongside Bondi on Wednesday, said \"I hope Gov. Mills will recognize that her political feud with the president will deprive the students in her state of much more than the right to fair sporting events.\"",
      "The attorney general outlined that the Justice Department had \"exhausted every other remedy,\" saying it has \"repeatedly notified Maine of its infractions and urged them to remedy the situation to protect women.\" Bondi noted that the administration has stripped grants to Maine through other agencies, and would \"continue to fight for women.\"",
      "The federal government said in its lawsuit filed in Maine's federal court that the state's Department of Education is \"openly and defiantly flouting anti-discrimination law by enforcing policies that require girls to compete against boys in athletic competitions designated exclusively for girls,\" arguing that the practice violates Title IX's \"core protections.\"\u2028It cited three examples of boys participating in girls sports.",
      "\"The United States accordingly files this action to stop Maine's unapologetic sex-discrimination against female student athletes,\" the Justice Department said in the lawsuit.",
      "Mills pledged to \"vigorously defend our state against the action announced today from the Department of Justice\" in a statement Wednesday, arguing that the fight isn't about women's sports, but \"states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will.\"",
      "\"Let today serve as warning to all states: Maine might be among the first to draw the ire of the Federal government in this way, but we will not be the last,\" Mills said.",
      "Last week, the state of Maine secured a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, blocking the Agriculture Department from \"terminating, freezing, or otherwise interfering with the State's access to federal funds based on alleged Title IX violations without following the process required by federal statute.\" The lawsuit was brought by Maine after the Trump administration cut funds for administrative and technological funds in the state's schools.",
      "The Justice Department's actions against Maine may be followed by similar moves in other states, Bondi said.",
      "\"We're looking at Minnesota, we're looking at California,\" Bondi said. \"We're looking at many, many states, but they are the top two that should be on notice.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Associated Press said its reporters were prevented from attending an Oval Office event with President Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele even though a federal judge had ordered the White House to restore the news outlet's access as of Monday.",
      "An AP spokesperson said in a statement that its \"journalists were blocked from the Oval Office\" on Monday despite the order requiring the White House to rescind its restrictions on the AP's access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other places where space is limited when they're open to other members of the White House press pool.",
      "The AP also reported that one of its reporters was not allowed to attend an event on the South Lawn of the White House recognizing the Ohio State University's championship football team that was open to credentialed media, though two AP photographers were permitted to cover it.",
      "A White House official separately confirmed Tuesday night that the White House is changing the makeup of the press pool, which is the small group of rotating journalists who cover the president each day, to remove a spot designated for news wire services like the AP. The official said the pool will instead consist of a second print journalist, and wire reporters will be eligible for the pool's daily print journalist position.",
      "Eugene Daniels, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said in response to the changes that the wire services \u2014 the AP, Bloomberg News and Reuters \u2014 play a crucial role in coverage of the presidency and should have their traditional spot in the press pool.",
      "\"The changes to the press pool today show that the White House is \u00a0just using a new means to do the same thing: retaliate against news organizations for coverage the White House doesn't like,\" he said. \"The WHCA is working to find out what this means in practice but what we do know is that restrictions on White House media coverage only hurt the American people who rely on unfiltered journalism to stay informed and make decisions critical to their lives.\"",
      "Daniels said the White House's insistence that they will maintain discretion over the composition of the pool, instead of using regular rotations, \"underscores that the administration remains unwilling to provide guarantees they will not continue to engage in the viewpoint discrimination that was ruled unlawful by a federal court.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden ruled last week that the White House cannot deny AP journalists access to spaces made available to the pool or events open to all credentialed members of the White House press corps because of its refusal to use the name Gulf of America in its Stylebook and reporting. McFadden, who was appointed to the federal bench by Mr. Trump in his first term, put his order on hold until Monday.",
      "The Trump administration has appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A panel of three judges is set to consider Thursday whether to grant the administration's request to pause the district court's decision \u2014 which would reinstate the restrictions on the AP \u2014 while it considers the appeal.",
      "The AP spokesperson said in the statement that the outlet expects \"the White House to restore AP's participation in the pool as of [Monday], as provided in the injunction order.\" The White House did not return a request for comment.",
      "The AP, which says its news reporting reaches roughly 4 billion people daily, filed its lawsuit against three senior White House officials after it was informed in February that it would no longer be allowed in places like the Oval Office and on Air Force One as part of the press pool until the AP revised its influential Stylebook to use the name Gulf of America instead of Gulf of Mexico.",
      "The Stylebook is a writing and editing guide that is used by newspapers, magazines and other media outlets throughout the country. It covers a wide range of topics, from abbreviations of state names to describing ages to jargon used in different sports.",
      "In addition to being denied admittance to the press pool, AP reporters have also been turned away from larger events open to the broader White House press corps, the outlet said in court papers.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order renaming the body of water in January. But the AP said it would not update its Stylebook, which is used in newsrooms worldwide, to reflect the change because the president's directive only carries authority within the U.S. The AP said that as an international news agency, it \"must ensure that places, names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.\"",
      "McFadden last week said that the White House likely violated the First Amendment when it excluded the AP from press events because of its refusal to change the Gulf of Mexico's name in its Stylebook.",
      "The judge stressed that he is not ordering the Trump administration to grant the AP permanent access to the Oval Office, East Room or other media events, and noted that the AP is not entitled to the permanent press pool access it previously enjoyed.",
      "But McFadden wrote that the AP \"cannot be treated worse than its peer wire services either. The court merely declares that the AP's exclusion has been contrary to the First Amendment, and it enjoins the government from continuing down that unlawful path.\"",
      "\"The AP seeks restored eligibility for admission to the press pool and limited-access press events, untainted by an impermissible viewpoint-based exclusion,\" he wrote. \"That is all the court orders today: For the government to put the AP on an equal playing field as similarly situated outlets, despite the AP's use of disfavored terminology.\"",
      "As a news wire service, the AP is a regular participant in the White House press pool, which is a group of rotating reporters, videographers and photographers who cover the president daily and travel with him when he leaves the White House grounds.",
      "One iteration of the press pool, which attends most White House events in the Oval Office and other small spaces, has 21 members. The smallest iteration, which travels with the president aboard Air Force One, has 13 members. The AP typically had two of the 13 core spots in the press pool.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday said she will prevent the Trump administration from enforcing portions of an executive order that targets the law firm Susman Godfrey, finding that the directive likely retaliates against the firm and its clients for their exercise of constitutionally protected speech.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan granted the firm's request for a temporary restraining order following a hearing and said Susman Godfrey is likely to succeed on its claims that the executive order, signed by President Trump last week, violates the First and Fifth Amendments. She specifically blocked the administration from enforcing provisions relating to federal contracting and restricting Susman employees' access to federal buildings and from engaging with government workers.",
      "AliKhan said while delivering her ruling from the bench that the government \"sought to use its immense power to dictate the positions that law firms may or may not take,\" which threatens the foundation of legal representation in the U.S. She said the executive order is \"based on a personal vendetta\" against Susman Godfrey.",
      "\"The framers of our Constitution would see this as a shocking abuse of power,\" AliKhan, who sits on the federal district court in Washington, D.C., said.",
      "Following the hearing, the firm said in a statement it is grateful to the court for addressing the unconstitutionality of Mr. Trump's order.",
      "\"This fight is bigger and more important than any one firm. Susman Godfrey is fighting this unconstitutional executive order because it infringes on the rights of all Americans and the rule of law. This fight is right, it is just, and we are duty-bound to pursue it,\" it said.",
      "Susman Godfrey is the fourth law firm to succeed in the early stages of lawsuits that challenge executive orders signed by Mr. Trump. The orders, signed over the past few weeks, each threaten the firms with sanctions because of their legal work, as well as lawyers who are currently or were previously on their payrolls.",
      "Susman Godfrey represented Dominion Voting Systems in a defamation lawsuit filed against Fox News over baseless claims it aired about the 2020 election, which Mr. Trump falsely claims was rigged against him. The case ended with a $787 million settlement agreement before the start of the trial. The firm is also representing Dominion in a defamation case against Newsmax, a conservative television network. A jury trial in that dispute is slated to begin at the end of the month.",
      "During the hearing, Donald Verrilli, who is representing Susman Godfrey, called Mr. Trump's executive order \"one of the most brazenly unconstitutional exercises of executive power in the history of this nation.\" He told the court it \"runs roughshod\" over the separation of powers.",
      "Pointing to other law firms that have reached deals with the White House, likely to head-off being targeted by Mr. Trump, Verrilli said they have done so to \"stay on the president's good side.\" Those nine firms have agreed to provide between $40 million and $125 million in pro bono work to causes backed by the president.",
      "\"We're sliding very fast into an abyss,\" Verrilli said. \"There's only one way to stop that slide: for courts to act decisively and act decisively now.\"",
      "In addition to Susman Godfrey, Mr. Trump has signed executive orders that seek to punish the firms Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr. The firms have all filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the orders, and judges have issued temporary orders\u00a0blocking enforcement of portions of them while the litigation continues.",

    "story": [
      "Greenbelt, Maryland \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday admonished the Department of Justice for not complying with her order to facilitate the release of a Maryland man who the Trump administration admitted had been mistakenly deported to a prison in El Salvador, and ordered expedited discovery in the case.",
      "\"We have to give process to both sides, but we're going to move\u2026 there will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding,\" U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis said at the start of a hearing in the case involving Kilmer Abrego Garcia, who was sent to El Salvador last month.",
      "Xinis ordered for depositions to be completed by April 23. When the Justice Department suggested they might invoke privilege, Xinis told them\u00a0 \"cancel vacation, cancel other appointments\" and added that she expects \"all hands on deck.\"",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia and the Justice Department faced off in Xinis' courtroom Tuesday, one day after El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said he would not be returning Abrego Garcia. Drew Ensign, a Justice Department attorney, said Tuesday that the Trump administration would facilitate Abrego Garcia's return if he arrived at a port of entry, and continued to dodge straightforward questions on what the Trump administration is doing, if anything, to return the man.",
      "Joseph Mazzarra, acting general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a filing shortly before the hearing that if Abrego Garcia does show up at a port of entry, he would be detained by the Department of Homeland Security and either removed to a third country or stripped of a legal protection that he was granted in 2019, which forbid immigration authorities from removing him to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "To revoke that legal status, known as withholding of removal, the Department of Homeland Security would have to re-open his immigration case and ask an immigration judge to terminate it.",
      "Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, said before the hearing that she is asking the Trump administration to \"stop playing games with the life of Kilmar.\"",
      "During the proceedings, Xinis said the Justice Department \"has not yet fulfilled the mandate, the order, that I issued,\" while lawyers for the Justice Department asked for any orders to be stayed after the Supreme Court ruling.",
      "Xinis said Tuesday that \"every day Mr. Abrego Garcia is detained in CECOT is another date of irreparable harm,\" and gave both sides two weeks to complete expedited discovery, or fact finding, in the case, including sworn depositions from Trump administration officials with first-hand knowledge of the efforts to return him.",
      "\"I've gotten nothing, I've gotten no real response [from the government],\" Xinis said, calling the Justice Department's arguments thus far \"two misguided ships passing in the night.\"",
      "Xinis responded to the Justice Department's suggestions that the back and forth is simply a legal dispute, and that there is \"so much daylight between what you keep saying and what the posture of the case is.\"",
      "\"I will have the record before me to call it like I see it\" before she rules on whether to hold the government in contempt of her order, Xinis said.",
      "Despite the Justice Department's filings this week citing the exchange between President Trump and Bukele, in which Bukele said he would not be returning Abrego Garcia to the United States, Xinis said that \"if that were in a court of law \u2014 it would have real infirmities in a trial, in a court of law.\"",
      "\"No press release is going to move the court the same way that sworn, under oath testimony from persons with knowledge,\" Xinis said.",
      "Xinis had ordered the Justice Department to provide her with answers to three questions about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and efforts to bring him back to the U.S. after the Supreme Court last week\u00a0affirmed a portion of an earlier order that required the U.S. to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody.",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia argued in a filing that the Trump administration defied the district court and Supreme Court orders by refusing to provide \"even basic information\" about their client's location and what it is doing to follow the directive to return him to the U.S. They asked Xinis to provide three types of relief, including ordering the government to explain why it shouldn't be held in contempt for failure to comply with her prior rulings.",
      "During a hearing Friday, after the high court released its decision, Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer, repeatedly said he could not provide information about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts. Xinis said in a written order after the proceedings that the Trump administration \"failed to comply\" with her directive and \"made no meaningful effort to\" obey it.\u00a0 She ordered the government to provide daily updates to the court about Abrego Garcia's location and custodial status, as well as the efforts taken by the administration to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the court Saturday, Michael Kozak, a senior State Department official, said Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, in El Salvador.",
      "\"He is alive and secure in that facility,\" Kozak wrote. \"He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\"",
      "In another declaration filed Sunday, Evan Katz, assistant director for the Removal Division at ICE, said the administration had no updates for the court beyond what had already been shared. The latest filing, submitted Monday from Mazzara said the agency \"does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have been defiant in their response to Xinis' order that they take steps to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and have argued that their obligations are limited only to removing \"any domestic obstacles\" that would impede his ability to return to the U.S., where he has lived since arriving unlawfully in 2011.",
      "Federal courts, they said in a filing Sunday, are powerless \"to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was arrested by immigration authorities in March and flown to El Salvador with more than 200 other migrants who are now confined at CECOT. His lawyers have argued that his removal to El Salvador was unlawful, as an immigration judge in 2019 granted him a withholding of removal, a legal status that forbids the Department of Homeland Security from returning him to his home country of El Salvador because he is likely to face persecution from local gangs.",
      "Numerous Trump administration officials at the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security \u2014 including Solicitor General John Sauer \u2014 have acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Savaldor was an \"administrative error\" because he was granted withholding of removal.",
      "But Katz, the ICE official, said in his declaration that Abergo Garcia is no longer eligible for that relief because of his alleged membership in the gang MS-13, which President Trump designated as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "While the Department of Homeland Security has claimed that Abrego Garcia has ties to MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant, his lawyers argue that he is not a member of MS-13 or any other gang. They have also said he has never been charged or convicted of any crimes in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case landed before the Supreme Court last week after Xinis issued an order on April 4 that directed the Trump administration to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return by 11:59 p.m. on April 7.",
      "The Justice Department appealed, and Chief Justice John Roberts issued a temporary order pausing that deadline to allow the Supreme Court more time to consider whether to grant the Trump administration's request to block Xinis' order.",
      "The high court on Thursday upheld part of the decision that required the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody, but said the district court should clarify its directive that the Trump administration \"effectuate\" his return.",
      "Xinis moved swiftly in responding, and issued a new order requiring the Trump administration to take all available steps to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. \"as soon as possible.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have claimed that it is up to the Salvadoran government to decide if they want to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. But during a meeting with President Trump on Monday, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said he does not \"have the power\" to do so.",
      "\"How can I return him to the United States?\"he said in response to questions from reporters. \"I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous.\"",
      "The U.S. is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to house migrants at CECOT.",

      "Ryan Routh's attorneys had asked that their expert be allowed to inspect, photograph and test the rifle in order to evaluate a government expert's findings, as well as test it for other information that they thought was relevant. In Tuesday's order, District Judge Aileen Cannon \u2014 who was nominated by Mr. Trump \u2014 limited the testing to just its operability, with a May 15 deadline.",
      "Routh, who has pleaded not guilty, was charged with attempted assassination of a presidential candidate and two firearm charges. His federal trial is scheduled for September, and he's expected to face additional state charges.",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump \u2014 then a presidential candidate \u2014 for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club. Before the president came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent.

    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Thursday that they had detected the most promising \"hints\" of potential life on a planet beyond our solar system, though other scientists expressed skepticism.",
      "There has been vigorous debate in scientific circles about whether the planet K2-18b, which is 124 light years away in the Leo constellation, could be an ocean world capable of hosting microbial life, at least.",
      "Using the James Webb Space Telescope, a British-U.S. team of researchers detected signs of two chemicals in the planet's atmosphere long considered to be \"biosignatures\" indicating extraterrestrial life.",
      "On Earth, the chemicals dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide are produced only by life, mostly microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton.",
      "The researchers emphasized caution, saying that more observations were needed to confirm these findings, and that they were not announcing a definitive discovery.",
      "But the implications could be huge, according to Nikku Madhusudhan, a Cambridge University astrophysicist and lead author of the study, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "Madhusudhan told BBC News that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there,\" he said. \"I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "But outside experts pointed to disputes over previous discoveries about the exoplanet, adding that these chemicals could have been created by unknown means having nothing to do with life.",
      "\"Goldilocks\" zone",
      "More than eight times the mass of Earth and 2.5 times as big, K2-18b is rare among the roughly 6,000 exoplanets discovered so far in that it orbits its star in a habitable or \"goldilocks\" zone.",
      "This means it is neither too hot nor too cold to have liquid water, considered the most important ingredient for life.",
      "Telescopes observe such far-off exoplanets when they cross in front of their star, allowing astronomers to analyze how molecules block the light streaming through their atmosphere.",
      "In 2023, the Webb telescope detected methane and carbon dioxide in K2-18b's atmosphere, the first time such carbon-based molecules were detected on an exoplanet in a habitable zone.",
      "It also detected weak signals of the chemical DMS, leading astronomers to turn Webb towards the planet again a year ago, this time using its mid-infrared instrument to detect different wavelengths of light.",
      "They found much stronger signs of the chemicals, though still well below the \"five sigma\" threshold of statistical significance scientists seek for such discoveries.",
      "Even if the results are confirmed, it would not necessarily mean that the planet is home to life.",
      "Last year, scientists found traces of DMS on a comet, which suggested it can be produced in non-organic ways and is perhaps not a \"biosignature.\"",
      "However the concentration of the chemical observed on K2-18b appears to be thousands of times stronger than levels on Earth, likely suggesting a biological origin, Madhusudhan said.",
      "\"Hellishly hot\"",
      "K2-18b has long been considered the premier candidate for a \"hycean planet\" \u2014 an ocean world bigger than Earth with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.",
      "Hycean planets, much like Earth, are covered in oceans and have atmospheres rich with hydrogen, an element that is essential for life. Many of the planets are bigger and hotter than Earth \u2014 up to 2.6 times larger than our planet and reaching atmospheric temperatures up to nearly 200 degrees Celsius, or 392 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "These planets would not be expected to be home to intelligent alien life, but rather tiny microbes similar to those in Earth's oceans billions of years ago.",
      "\"Hycean planets open a whole new avenue in our search for life elsewhere,\" Madhusudhan said previously.",
      "Some research has questioned whether the currently proposed hycean planets are too close to their stars to support liquid water \u2014 including K2-18b, which orbits its star every 33 days.",
      "Raymond Pierrehumbert, a planetary physics professor at Oxford University, has conducted separate research indicating K2-18b is too hot for life.",
      "If the planet did have water, it would be \"hellishly hot\" and uninhabitable, he told AFP, adding that oceans of lava were more plausible.",
      "Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science at MIT, called for patience, pointing to previous claims of water vapor in K2-18b's atmosphere that turned out to be a different gas.",
      "Madhusudhan estimated that it would take just 16 to 24 more hours of Webb's time to reach the five-sigma threshold, which could happen in the next few years.",
      "The current three-sigma is comparable to the odds of flipping a coin 10 times and getting the same result each time, Cambridge University statistician Stephen Burgess explained.",
      "Five sigma would be getting that result after 20 flips, and would mean \"we can be very confident that this observation isn't just a chance finding,\" he said.",
      "Even beyond K2-18b, Madhusudhan said Webb and future telescopes could allow humanity to discover life outside our home planet sooner than one might think.",

      "Unique design of Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft",
      "Blue Origin's spacecraft carries a crew of six and is fully autonomous, not controlled by a pilot on board.",
      "The crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight.",
      "At an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad.",
      "About three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth.",
      "After a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home.",
      "\"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News.",
      "Plunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace.",
      "The New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule.",
      "\"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\"",
      "The system is also designed to ensure a survivable landing even if two of the main parachutes fail to open and fully inflate.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/googles-digital-ad-network-illegal-monopoly-federal-judge/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The ruling involving Google's online ad technology follows a similar case last year in which Google's search engine was declared a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google's namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google's ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump's first administration, the same agency went after the company's lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden's ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called remedy hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Brinkema's 115-page decision centers on the marketing machine that Google has spent the past 17 years building around its search engine and other widely used products and services, including its Chrome browser, YouTube video site and digital maps.",
      "The system was largely built around a series of acquisitions that started with Google's $3.2 billion purchase of online ad specialist DoubleClick in 2008. U.S. regulators approved the deals at the time they were made before realizing that they had given the Mountain View, California, company a platform to manipulate the prices in an ecosystem that a wide range of websites depend on for revenue and provides a vital marketing connection to consumers.",
      "The Justice Department lawyers argued that Google built and maintained dominant market positions in a technology trifecta used by website publishers to sell ad space on their webpages, as well as the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of consumers, and the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions in fractions of a second to match buyer and seller.",
      "After evaluating the evidence presented during a lengthy trial that\u00a0concluded just before Thanksgiving last year,\u00a0Brinkema reached a decision that rejected the Justice Department's assertions that Google has been mistreating advertisers while concluding the company has been abusing its power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers forced to rely on its network for revenue.",
      "\"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.\" Brinkema wrote. \"Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features.\"",
      "Despite that rebuke, Brinkema also concluded that Google didn't break the law when it snapped Doubleclick nor when it followed up that deal a few years later by buying another service, Admeld.",
      "The Justice Department \"failed to show that the DoubleClick and Admeld acquisitions were anticompetitive,\" Brinkema wrote. \"Although these acquisitions helped Google gain monopoly power in two adjacent ad tech markets, they are insufficient, when viewed in isolation, to prove that Google acquired or maintained this monopoly power through exclusionary practices.\"",
      "That finding may help Google fight off any attempt to force it to sell its advertising technology to stop its monopolistic behavior.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"",
      "Analysts such as Brian Pitz of BMO Markets had been predicting that Google would likely lose the case, helping to brace investors for the latest setback to the company and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose shares declined 1% in afternoon trading. Alphabet's stock has plunged by 20% so far this year.",
      "As it did in the search monopoly case, Google and its corporate parent Alphabet vehemently denied the Justice Department's allegations. Their lawyers argued the government largely based its case on an antiquated concept of a market that existed a decade ago while underestimating a highly competitive market for advertising spending that includes the likes of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast.",
      "The market as drawn in the Justice Department's case didn't include ads that appear on mobile apps, streaming television services, or other platforms to which internet users have increasingly migrated, prompting Google lawyer Karen Dunn to compare the government's definition a \"time capsule with a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster video card\" during her opening statement\u00a0when the trial began last September.",
      "At trial, the Justice Department's lawyers emphasized the harm to news publishers that has arisen from Google's alleged dominance of the marketplace. Witnesses from Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, and News Corp., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, testified about the difficulties they have faced and what they said was a lack of alternatives to Google's ad tech. Those companies rely on online advertising to fund their news operations and make their articles free to consumers on the internet, government lawyers have argued.",
      "Now, government is in position to try to dismantle that byzantine ad system. When the case was filed more than two years ago during the Biden administration, the Justice Department asserted Google should be forced to sell, at a minimum, its Ad Manager product, which includes the technology used by website publishers and the ad exchange.",

    "story": [
      "Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday in a Washington, D.C., courtroom to defend his social media company from federal allegations that the technology giant is a monopoly.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is facing off with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, for Day one of a landmark antitrust trial that could result in the company's breakup. For Zuckerberg, the case could determine whether the business empire he started building while still a student at Harvard University will be forced to break apart.",
      "The trial will be the first big test of the FTC's willingness under President Trump to challenge Big Tech, a long-time target of Republicans. The lawsuit was initially filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Mr. Trump's first term, before being amended in 2021.",
      "In its\u00a0complaint, the FTC accuses Meta of \"anticompetitive conduct,\" alleging that the company's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp gives it excessive control of the social media market.",
      "\"There's nothing wrong with Meta innovating,\" said Daniel Matheson, lead attorney for the FTC in his opening statements for the agency Monday, \"It's what happened next that is a problem.\"",
      "During his testimony Monday, Zuckerberg defended his decision to buy Instagram and pushed back against FTC claims that he did not invest in developing the app.",
      "Purchased by Facebook in\u00a02012\u00a0and\u00a02014, respectively, Instagram and WhatsApp have grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "To restore competition, Meta must part ways with Instagram and WhatsApp, the government agency says in\u00a0court filings. The FTC also wants Meta to provide the government with prior notice for any future mergers and acquisitions.",
      "With the landmark trial underway, here's what you need to know.",
      "How long will the Meta trial last, and who will testify?",
      "The trial, which begins Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg will preside over the case, which could see a range of witnesses including Meta CEO and founder Zuckerberg; former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; former Meta Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer; Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom; and executives from rival social media platforms.",
      "What is happening in court today?",
      "The FTC and Meta made their opening arguments on Monday, with witness testimony expected to start in the afternoon.",
      "In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.",
      "Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly.",
      "If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.",
      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",

    "story": [
      "A fintech startup that raised $40 million based on the premise of its artificial intelligence capabilities was fueled by human labor, allegedly defrauding investors lured by the new technology of millions, federal prosecutors said this week in a statement.",
      "Albert Saniger, 35, the former CEO\u00a0 and founder of nate in 2018, who is from Barcelona, Spain, was indicted in the Southern District of New York for engaging in a scheme to allegedly defraud investors and making false statements about his company's AI capabilities.",
      "Nate, an e-commerce company, launched the nate app that claimed to streamline the online shopping checkout process via a single AI-powered tap option. But the app was not powered by advanced AI technology at all, according to the indictment.",
      "With the promise of custom-built \"deep learning models\" that would allow the app to directly purchase goods on product pages in fewer than three seconds, Saniger raised over $40 million. While instructing employees to keep nate's reliance on overseas workers secret, he pitched investors an AI-driven product capable of 10,000 daily transactions.",
      "Instead, the app allegedly relied heavily on overseas workers in two different countries who manually processed transactions, mimicking what users believed was being done by automation. Saniger, meanwhile, allegedly told investors and the public that the transactions were being completed by AI.",
      "\"Saniger allegedly abused the integrity associated with his former position as the CEO to perpetuate a scheme filled with smoke and mirrors,\" the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement.",
      "In the technology's absence, Saniger allegedly relied heavily on hundreds of workers at a call center in the Philippines, court documents said. When a deadly tropical storm struck the country in October 2021, the indictment said, nate established a new call center in Romania to handle the backlog of customer services. Investors were likely never exposed to the lull in transactions because Saniger directed that transactions by investors be prioritized to avoid suspicion.",
      "The aftermath of the company's fallout in 2023, left investors with near-total losses, the indictment said.",
      "U.S. private AI investment grew to $109.1 billion last year\u00a0\u2014 and the U.N. trade and development arm said market share is poised to climb to $4.8 trillion by 2033.",
      "AI is widely perceived as being free from human intervention but the reality paints a more complicated picture. Nate is not the only company that has capitalized on AI through cheap labor overseas.",

      "The agency's teams do careful inspections of the hospital's facilities, assessing how air is moving, he said, which can be difficult to accurately do over the phone with people unfamiliar with the technical details of how HVAC systems work.",
      "In one example, an isolation room at a hospital was found to have been pressurized wrongly, with air flowing out of the room with the measles patient, Neu said. Another hospital had skipped a key step in setting up an air filter in their waiting room: unwrapping the filter before turning it on.",
      "\"They might say in an interview, 'Yeah, we purchased HEPA filters. They've been running in the waiting room.' But if they're not actually out of the plastic bag, they're not doing what they think they're doing,\" Neu said.",
      "While Neu remains on the job for now, he received a notice on April 1 warning him to expect to be laid off by HHS in the coming weeks.",
      "\"This action is necessary to align our workforce with the agency's current and future needs and to ensure the efficient and effective operation of our programs,\" Neu's notice from the department said.",
      "Neu said he received the notice while in his hotel room in Texas, as he prepared to return from his deployment. Most of his colleagues and the leadership above him within NIOSH have either been laid off, offered reassignments to other agencies or warned to expect cuts.",
      "\"My current understanding is that I'll be working in the office until the end of this month, and then I'll be on 60 days administrative leave until June 30th, and then we'll be separated at that point,\" he said.",
      "Agency officials scrapped plans to offer future ventilation assessments to Texas, he said, because of the prospect that he might get laid off while in the field and cut off from the agency's systems.",
      "A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "While much of the work Neu's team does at NIOSH is research, he said that experts on his team have often been tapped to deploy to emergency responses as the agency's primary experts on topics like ventilation and contamination.",
      "He recounted several past deployments, ranging from helping hospitals around the country draw up plans to prepare for Ebola cases during the Obama administration, to helping the agency's quarantine station at Detroit's airport build an isolation room to screen passengers early during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We're involved in pretty much every response the CDC is involved in. Especially if there's some sort of engineering or ventilation component, NIOSH gets called in as that scientific expertise,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs have also upended other work done by NIOSH to respond to requests like health hazard evaluations, where workplaces can call on the agency for help investigating health issues on the job, like cancer clusters\u00a0or fungal outbreaks.",
      "Impact on the CDC's measles response also goes beyond NIOSH. CBS News previously reported that multiple agency staff assigned to the effort had been let go.",
      "An official said Tuesday that the CDC was now \"scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support\" to Texas and other states now facing outbreaks.",

Ahead of the shooting, Mangione, who is from a prominent Maryland family, came to New York City in late November, where he stayed in a hostel under a fake New Jersey identification card.",

    "story": [
      "An immigration judge on Wednesday denied bond for R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, a Tufts University graduate student from Turkey who was detained last month after her visa was revoked, her lawyers said.",
      "\u00d6zt\u00fcrk, 30, is in custody at a federal detention facility in Basile, Louisiana, where she was eventually transferred after being detained last month by immigration authorities outside her apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts.",
      "Her attorneys \u2014 who allege she was detained after co-writing an op-ed in the campus newspaper \u2014 argue her detention violated her First and Fifth Amendment rights, and are seeking to have her either released on bail or transferred to Vermont from Louisiana.",
      "\u00d6zt\u00fcrk's attorney Marty Rosenbluth said in a statement Thursday her detention is a \"complete violation of due process and the rule of law.\"",

      "Her lawyers said the Department of Homeland Security presented one document to support their opposition to \u00d6zt\u00fcrk's bond request: a one-paragraph State Department memo revoking her student visa. The memo says her visa was revoked following an assessment that she had been involved in associations \"'that may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization' including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.\"",
      "\u00d6zt\u00fcrk's lawyers said the immigration judge denied bond based on the \"untenable conclusion\" that she was \"both a flight risk and a danger to the community.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment.",
      "Immigration officials took \u00d6zt\u00fcrk into custody on March 25 when she was returning from an iftar dinner. After being taken to New Hampshire and then Vermont, she was put on a plane the next day and moved to an ICE detention center in Basile, Louisiana.",
      "\u00d6zt\u00fcrk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, last year criticizing the university's response to student activists demanding that Tufts \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,\" disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.",
      "\u00d6zt\u00fcrk is one of several people with ties to American universities whose visas were revoked or have been stopped from entering the U.S. after they were accused of participating in demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians.

      "\u00d6zt\u00fcrk's lawyers are challenging the legal authority for ICE's detention. They also have asked U.S. District Judge William Sessions in Vermont, where her detention case was transferred after lawyers first petitioned for her release in Massachusetts, to take jurisdiction of it and release her.",
      "Sessions, who held a hearing Monday, has not ruled yet. He had asked \u00d6zt\u00fcrk's lawyers if there was any evidence suggesting that she was a member of the organization that was later \"temporarily banned,\" according to the State Department memo. Her lawyers said there wasn't.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 19:05:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Food safety inspections would be left to state and local authorities under the plan being developed by the FDA.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is drawing up plans that would end most of its routine food safety inspections work, multiple federal health officials tell CBS News, and effectively outsource this oversight to state and local authorities.",
      "The plans have not been finalized and might need congressional action to fully fund, said the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, denied that the FDA was making plans to do this.",
      "Some FDA employees have been working on a possible shift of the agency's routine food efforts to states for years, one current and one former official said, which could free up resources to focus on higher priority and foreign inspections. The FDA already outsources some routine food inspections through contracts with 43 states and Puerto Rico.",
      "\"There's so much work to go around. And us duplicating their work just doesn't make sense,\" one former FDA official, who worked on the plans before leaving the agency and spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "Multiple federal health officials said that the state work currently is often reserved for lower-risk inspections. A third of routine food safety inspections were done by states over recent years, a Government Accountability Office report said earlier this year.",
      "The FDA is ultimately responsible for the safety of much of the U.S. food supply that's distributed over state lines, like packaged products, seafood, eggs and produce. Some kinds of meat are regulated by a different agency inside the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Some higher-risk routine food inspections would likely remain at the FDA under the plans, two officials said. For example, agency staff currently conduct annual visits to infant formula manufacturers, which are overseen separately as \"critical foods\" inspections. States would also not be able to take on the work of routine inspections in foreign food facilities.",
      "It is unclear what would happen for the states that do not have contracts with the FDA to conduct food inspections, which range from Hawaii to Delaware.",
      "In addition to routine inspections, the FDA also does other kinds of inspections in response to issues, like a visit to a Colorado onion processor last year linked to the McDonald's Quarter Pounders outbreak that turned up dozens of violations.",
      "Internal planning around the possibility of outsourcing its routine inspections first picked up after 2010, the former FDA official said, when the agency was working on implementing major food safety legislation passed that year.",
      "The official likened the plans to the FDA's Grade A Milk Safety Program, where states fund the majority of oversight work themselves and have agreements with the agency to standardize how the industry is regulated.",
      "Some states and advocacy groups have called for years for the FDA to move its routine food inspections out to states. States can often do inspections at a lower cost than the FDA, while meeting the same standards, they have argued.",
      "\"FDA audits have determined states inspections to be high quality, and the costs show them to be a good economic value. There is significant cost to managing two systems also,\" said Steve Mandernach, executive director of the Association of Food and Drug Officials, in a statement.",
      "Mandernach drew a parallel to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, under which hospitals and nursing homes are largely inspected by state agencies but overseen by the federal government.",
      "He also pointed to how the FDA regulates produce farms. The FDA has agreements with most states to pay for routine inspections conducted by local agriculture departments, where they often handle inspections and enforcement themselves.",
      "\"Further, we implemented this type of program with produce already and it has been successful, expanding and leveraging those lessons can only provide greater value to the taxpayers, increase oversight of manufacturers, and improve food safety,\" he said.",
      "Ending the FDA's work to do its own routine food safety inspections might also help alleviate an issue elsewhere at the agency: a backlog of inspections overseas, as well as in other markets like medical products.",
      "In the past, FDA inspectors had been trained to do multiple kinds of inspections, officials said, instead of specializing only in food safety inspections.",
      "Steep layoffs at the office's support staff is expected to result in cutbacks to the number of inspections that can be done by the agency, CBS News previously reported. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has also greenlighted plans to hire contractors to attempt to plug the hole left by the laid-off workers.",
      "\"In theory, relying on states to do more routine food inspection work could lead to better food safety,\" said Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, in an email to CBS News.",
      "Gremillion cautioned that a transition in how food inspections are done by the FDA would take significant time and resources.",
      "\"So far, this Administration has acted with reckless disregard for how its policies will affect the detection and prevention of foodborne illness, and any plans to replace federal food inspectors with some other workforce deserves suspicion,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court said Thursday that the Trump administration's assertions in the case of a Maryland man who it admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador should be \"shocking\" to all Americans and made an appeal to the executive branch to vindicate the importance of the rule of law.",
      "The brief unanimous opinion authored by Judge Harvie Wilkinson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit rejected a request from the Trump administration to pause a district judge's order that required it to facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old who lives in Maryland, from Salvadoran custody, and explain the steps it has taken to return him to the U.S.",
      "\"The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,\" Wilkinson, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, wrote. \"Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.\"",
      "Wilkinson was joined in his opinion by Judges Robert King, nominated by President Bill Clinton, and Stephanie Thacker, appointed by President Barack Obama.",
      "The judge acknowledged that the executive branch has \"enormous\" powers to prosecute and deport noncitizens, but warned that the administration's actions so far could put U.S. citizens at risk.",
      "\"If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?\" Wilkinson wrote. \"And what assurance shall there be that the executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies?\"",
      "In his opinion, Wilkinson wrote of the tensions that can exist between the executive and judicial branches, but said that these differences require an effort at \"mutual respect.\" He lamented that \"too often today\" the executive branch has not afforded the courts that respect, and cited calls for judges to be impeached for decisions the government disagrees with, as well as pressure to disregard judicial orders.",
      "\"It is, as we have noted, all too possible to see in this case an incipient crisis, but it may present an opportunity as well,\" he wrote. \"We yet cling to the hope that it is not na\u00efve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos. This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has exploded simmering tensions between the federal judiciary and the Trump administration, which has been undertaking a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "The Salvadoran national came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011 and was arrested in 2019. Administration officials claim that Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant and his attire \u2014 a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie \u2014 at the time of his arrest. Abrego Garcia's lawyers have said he is not a gang member and has never been charged with or convicted of any crime in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from immigration custody in October 2019 and granted withholding of removal by an immigration judge, which is a legal status that forbids the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "He was living with his wife, a U.S. citizen, and their children in Maryland until he was arrested by immigration authorities in March and sent to El Salvador, where he and more than 200 others have been confined at the Terrorism Confinement Center, a notorious prison known as CECOT.",
      "Immigration officials in the Trump administration have acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador last month was an \"administrative error\" because of the withholding of removal, but efforts to have him brought back to the U.S. have sparked a fierce legal battle.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration earlier this month to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador, and the case landed before the Supreme Court. The high court then ruled last week that Xinis properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release from custody in El Salvador, but said she should clarify the scope of her decision as to effectuating Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "The district judge issued an amended decision that ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody as soon as possible. She also required the government to give her information about his whereabouts, as well as what steps it was taking to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration has so far rebuffed her requests for that information, but has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia is alive and detained at CECOT. Justice Department lawyers have said they will remove \"any domestic barriers\" to his return, but they have argued the U.S. does not have the power to force the Salvadoran government to release him.",
      "In his decision, Wilkinson said the court will not \"micromanage\" Xinis' attempt to implement the Supreme Court's decision, which he acknowledged requires lower courts to give consideration to the deference owed to the executive branch when conducting foreign affairs.",

      "The battle between President Trump and Harvard University has moved to a new front, with the IRS now considering whether to revoke the Ivy League school's tax-exempt status.",
      "A final decision has not yet been made by the IRS, CBS News' Aaron Navarro reports. But the effort comes after Mr. Trump on Tuesday\u00a0suggested that Harvard could lose its tax exemption. The tax agency's move to consider whether to strip Harvard of its designation as a 501(c)(3) organization was earlier reported by CNN.",
      "The IRS has awarded tax-exempt status to almost 2 million organizations, ranging from universities like Harvard to charities such as churches and foundations. The designation exempts these groups from paying federal income taxes, while donations to these groups are considered tax-deductible by the IRS.",
      "Mr. Trump's scrutiny of Harvard's tax status comes after the university on Monday rejected his administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration this week moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard.",
      "The Trump administration has also threatened to cut off federal funding at other\u00a0top universities\u00a0as it exerts pressure on the institutions' policies governing student expression on campus and academic programs.",

      "\"It would be historically unprecedented,\" Brian Galle, professor of tax policy at Georgetown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Certainly no major research university has ever lost its tax exemption.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the issue.",
      "Why is Harvard tax exempt?",
      "Organizations that have a purpose deemed to be \"charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals\" can qualify for tax-exempt status, according to the IRS.",
      "Most private and public universities and colleges have been granted tax-exempt status by the IRS because of their educational mission, which the federal government has recognized for their importance in fostering the productivity and civic contributions of American citizens, the Association of American Universities says.",
      "Can Mr. Trump order the IRS to remove Harvard's tax-exempt status?",

      "That's because Congress in 1998 passed a law that forbids the president from directing the IRS to audit or investigate taxpayers, he explained. If Mr. Trump instructed the IRS to remove Harvard's tax exemption, \"that runs exactly contrary to law,\" Brunson said.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said, \"Any forthcoming actions by the IRS will be conducted independently of the President, and investigations into any institution's violations of its tax status were initiated prior\" to Mr. Trump's social media post this week questioning Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Could the IRS remove Harvard's tax exemption?",
      "The IRS has legal authority to strip organizations of their tax-exempt status, and it occasionally exercises that power. But that is usually due to groups failing to meet tax requirements, like neglecting to file an annual information return for more than three consecutive years.",
      "One famous case involved a university losing its tax-exempt status, Galle and Brunson noted. In the 1970s, Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, a Christian institution, lost its tax-exempt status due to a policy that banned interracial relationships.",
      "That case ended up at the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1983 that the IRS was correct in depriving Bob Jones of the status because its rules had violated a \"fundamental national public policy\" about racial discrimination in education.",
      "The IRS could argue that Harvard is in violation of public policy either by failing to crack down on protestors rallying against Israel's actions in Gaza or by refusing to comply with the Trump administration's push against diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Brunson said. But both he and Galle expressed skepticism that such rationales would hold up in court, partly because universities have a constitutional right to freedom of speech, while also representing issues that are far different from the practices that Bob Jones engaged in.",
      "\"There isn't a society-wide agreement that allowing protests on your campus is inconsistent with fundamental public policy,\" Galle said.",
      "He added, \"Let's be clear: There is absolutely no basis for Harvard to lose its exemption. Zero.\"",
      "What happens if the IRS strips Harvard of its tax-exempt status?",
      "The IRS would first do an investigation and then inform Harvard of its reason for removing its tax-exempt status, Brunson said. Harvard could then file an appeal to the IRS. If that appeal failed, the university could then take the issue to the courts.",
      "As the case proceeded, it's likely that a court would issue an injunction or order to halt the IRS' decision, which means that Harvard would likely continue to operate as a tax-exempt institution until the case was resolved, experts said.",
      "\"Harvard isn't going to lose this \u2014 they have the money and the resources and the alumni to get the best people representing them,\" Brunson said. He predicted that Harvard would win a court case and \"set a precedent.\"",
      "How could losing tax-exempt status affect Harvard?",
      "Harvard could take a financial hit if it were to lose the tax-exempt status. But the extent of any resulting damage would be unclear given that Harvard could use tax strategies to lower its taxable income, similar to how major corporations rely on sophisticated techniques to reduce their tax liability. For instance, Harvard could lower its taxable income by deducting business costs, including its faculty salaries.",
      "By contrast, donors to Harvard could feel the impact because they wouldn't be able to deduct their contributions to the university from their own taxes. That could make it less palatable for donors to make large financial contributions.",
      "\"The biggest cost would be reduced donations,\" Brunson said. \"And the other cost is its endowment, which would no longer be tax exempt.\"",
      "Harvard's endowment stands at $52.3 billion, making it the biggest among all U.S. universities.",
      "What does Harvard say about the risk to its tax-exempt status?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Harvard reiterated that such a decision would be illegal.",
      "\"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission,\" a spokesperson wrote in an email. \"The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth.\"",
      "The spokesperson added, \"There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status.\"",

    "summary": "Some states want to block SNAP recipients from using benefits to buy sugary foods as part of the \"make America healthy again\" movement.",
    "story": [
      "The federal food stamp program is facing scrutiny in some states that want to block enrollees from using their government benefits to buy soda and candy.",
      "Three Republican-led states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho and Indiana \u2014 on Tuesday moved to ban purchases of soda and candy with benefits provided by the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Those states have a combined total of roughly 1 million residents on SNAP out of the program's total 41.7 million U.S. participants.",
      "Other states are also likely to restrict SNAP recipients' food purchases, experts say. Lawmakers in states including Arizona, Kansas and Tennessee\u00a0have introduced similar measures to curtail food stamp purchases of sugary foods and drinks.",
      "The rationale for such legislation is the view that blocking low-income Americans from using food stamps on soda and candy will help improve their health. But anti-hunger advocates say that these restrictions will add to negative perceptions of receiving food aid, while also being unlikely to improve recipients' eating habits.",
      "\"It's stigmatizing to say, 'You who are low income, we don't trust you to make the right choices,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger research group.",
      "Instead, she said, these states would be better off focusing on the biggest obstacle to healthy eating: the high cost of groceries, particularly the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Because SNAP provides an average individual monthly benefit of $187, or a little over $6 per day, many recipients fill up by purchasing the cheapest, most calorie-dense foods they can afford, she added.",
      "Grocery costs soared during the pandemic, surging almost 24% from 2020 to 2024 and outpacing overall inflation by almost three percentage points, according to an analysis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Food prices aren't expected to drop anytime soon, with the USDA forecasting that groceries could rise 2.7% in 2025, adding to the challenges SNAP recipients face in affording healthy food.",
      "Make America healthy again?",
      "In announcing plans to block food stamp purchases of soda and candy, Idaho Governor Brad Little on Tuesday\u00a0proclaimed that the state \"welcomes the MAHA movement,\" referring to the \"make America healthy again\" movement started by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders credited the Trump administration with placing \"a laser focus on solving America's chronic disease epidemic,\" saying that banning candy and soda from food stamp purchases is \"a great place to start.\"",
      "About 80 cents of every $1 in SNAP benefits is used to purchase staples like meat, bread, milk, cereal and rice, with the remainder going to salty snacks, candy and sweetened beverages. Households that rely on food stamps have very similar patterns of spending to households not on food stamps, according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "The Arkansas plan, which would take effect in July 2026, would exclude soda, including no- and low-calorie soda; fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice; \"unhealthy drinks;\" candy, including confections made with flour, like Kit Kat bars; and artificially sweetened candy.",
      "It also would allow participants to use benefits to buy hot rotisserie chicken, which is excluded from the program now under the SNAP program's longstanding ban on hot foods. Food stamp recipients also would be barred from using their benefits to buy nonfood items, such as soap or toothpaste, as well as alcohol or tobacco.",
      "Some industries are pushing back against the SNAP restrictions. Representatives for American Beverage accused state and federal officials of \"choosing to be the food police rather than take truly meaningful steps to lift people off SNAP with good-paying jobs.\"",
      "The National Confectioners Association called the approach \"misguided.\"",
      "\"SNAP participants and non-SNAP participants alike understand that chocolate and candy are treats \u2014 not meal replacements,\" spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health\"",
      "Over the past two decades, lawmakers from both political parties have proposed halting SNAP payments for everything from soda to\u00a0 steak. To date, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the SNAP program, hasn't granted the required waivers for states to curb food stamp purchases.",
      "But the Trump administration is signaling that it will grant the waivers requested this week, with USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins saying in a Tuesday statement\u00a0that she plans to quickly approve Arkansas' request.",
      "\"I have said since my confirmation that USDA has a role to play in improving nutrition programs to better serve individuals in need of support, all while recognizing the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Rollins said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our shared goal should be to lift millions of Americans out of dependency and into hopeful futures and insert new energy and ideas into long-ignored programs like diet-related, chronic disease.\"",
      "Blocking SNAP purchases of candy and soda wouldn't keep recipients from using their own money to buy such items, as food stamp benefits typically pay for roughly\u00a0two-thirds of a household's grocery costs.",
      "But advocates of banning unhealthy foods from SNAP say that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for supporting bad eating habits.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health,\" Sanders said Tuesday at a news conference with Rollins in Little Rock, Arkansas. \"We're paying for it on the front end and the back end.\"",

      "In a court petition, Vasquez describes multiple incidents over the course of several days in May 2021. In one case, Vasquez wrote that Abrego Garcia got angry with her at a gas station, insulted her and drove very fast. Days later, Vasquez alleges Abrego Garcia yelled at her to turn off her laptop, and when she said she wasn't tired, she said he \"got angry\" and threw her laptop on the floor. She alleged she pushed him off of her, and \"he then punched\" and \"[scratched] me on my left eye, leaving me bleeding.\"",

      "The case, however, was dismissed in June 2021 after Vasquez failed to appear for a final hearing, according to court records. The two returned to living together.",
      "Abrego Garcia's legal team responded to Vasquez's protective order after the Department of Homeland Security posted it on X Wednesday, noting he hasn't been criminally convicted.",
      "\"If the government believes there is a legitimate case to be made, it should present that case in a court of law and have a judge review and decide his fate\u2014not on social media,\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers wrote. \"But that cannot happen until Mr. Abrego Garcia is returned to the United States and given full due process. These allegations, without more, prove why due process and access to counsel is so important.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Wednesday evening, Vasquez confirmed seeking the court order.",
      "\"After surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship, I acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar by seeking a civil protective order in case things escalated,\" Vasquez said. \"Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling. Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect. That is not a justification for ICE's action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation. Kilmar has always been a loving partner and father, and I will continue to stand by him and demand justice for him.\"",
      "Court records show Vasquez sought and obtained a separate temporary protective order in August 2020, also alleging domestic violence.",
      "Vasquez is a U.S. citizen and Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran national.",
      "The Trump administration has admitted that an \"administrative error\" led to Abrego Garcia's deportation on March 15, but has claimed Abrego Garcia is \"not a sympathetic figure,\" sharing Vasquez's protective order on X Wednesday.",
      "The case has prompted a string of legal wrangling that made its way to the Supreme Court, which last week upheld a lower court decision that the Trump administration be required to \"facilitate\" his release.",
      "Despite the Supreme Court's ruling, the case has appeared to languish. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has repeatedly rebuked the Trump administration for stonewalling her and not complying with her order to both provide information on Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and facilitate his return to the U.S.",
      "Abrego Garcia was among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadoran migrants that were placed aboard three March 15 deportation flights to El Salvador after the White House alleged, often without evidence, that the men are members of transnational gangs.",
      "President Trump invoked the wartime 1798 Alien Enemies Act as justification for deporting many of the migrants to El Salvador. Another federal judge who had ordered the three flights to El Salvador be turned around found Wednesday that there was probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for defying his orders.",
      "The men are reportedly being held in the notorious Salvadoran supermax prison, known as CECOT, under an agreement with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.",
      "During a White House meeting with Mr. Trump Monday, Bukele told reporters he would not be returning Abrego Garcia to the U.S., and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that same day it is \"up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old.",
      "In 2019, he was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but an immigration judge barred his removal from the U.S. after determining that he could face persecution by gangs if deported to El Salvador. The judge granted him what is known as \"withholding of removal\" status.",
      "He was arrested again on March 12 following a traffic stop. Citing information from an informant who officials have said is credible, the Department of Homeland Security has alleged that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim his family and attorneys deny. Abrego Garcia has no criminal record in the U.S. or El Salvador, according to government documents.",

    "summary": "A new study from SmartAsset reveals varied increases in grocery prices depending on where you live.",
    "story": [
      "As ongoing inflation continues to deplete household budgets, perhaps nowhere is the pinch felt more strongly\u00a0than in grocery aisles. However, depending on where you live, the pain can be sharper than in other areas.",
      "That's according to a new study from\u00a0SmartAsset\u00a0which reveals notable fluctuations in grocery price increases from city to city. The financial technology company used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to examine how the costs of everyday items like eggs, meat and produce have changed in 12 major metro areas over the last year.",
      "\"While prices of fruits, vegetables and dairy products either increased or decreased depending on the location, eggs, meat and poultry soared almost unanimously, reaching over 9% or higher than just a year before \u2014 tripling the general rate of inflation,\" the study found.",
      "Jaclyn DeJohn, director of economic analysis and author of the SmartAsset study, said the big takeaway is how much location can impact these day-to-day items.",
      "\"We really wanted to do was compare where people's budget is going to get hit the hardest,\" said DeJohn, who noted that the study in not a comprehensive ranking but a snapshot of location-related shifts in the cost of groceries. \"People are noticing these costs, and they're impacting their bottom line.\"",
      "Read on to see how grocery prices\u00a0fluctuated in 12 major U.S. metros.",
      "Which cities are seeing price increases?",
      "Out of the 12 cities included in SmartAsset's analysis, Honolulu, Hawaii, experienced the largest uptick with a 5.3% increase in overall grocery prices since last year. Price hikes in Tampa Bay, Florida, are the second highest at 4.3%, followed by the Twin Cities, Minnesota, at 4.2%.",
      "When it comes to fresh produce, the Twin Cities saw the biggest spike among the 12 metro areas, with the cost of fruits and vegetables rising 6.9% from 2024. In Los Angeles, egg, meat, poultry and fish prices rose the most, at 9.8%, followed by the D.C. metro area at 9.4%.",
      "By contrast, residents of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington experienced only a modest price hike of 2.1% on eggs, meat, poultry and fish.",
      "While the report doesn't specify the factors driving price changes from city to city, a combination of influences could be at play, said SmartAsset's DeJohn. \"A big factor for something like Honolulu is it's isolated from the rest of the U.S.,\" she said. \"So, that's a good illustration of how transportation costs where you're located geographically compared to where your food is sourced can impact the prices big time.\"",
      "While price fluctuations varied from city to city, prices for egg, meats, poultry and fish went up in all metro areas, which DeJohn says were behind overall grocery cost increases across all 12 metro areas. \"As we didn't see such intense price increases across any other category of grocery, it was the egg and meat prices that were really driving the increase in grocery prices across the board in these metros,\" she said.",
      "The rise in egg prices at the metro level tracks with national BLS data. Egg prices have been climbing in large part due to the bird flu outbreak which has\u00a0forced farmers to kill infected flocks to prevent the disease from spreading.",
      "Are any cities seeing lower grocery prices?",
      "Yes. Two metro areas in SmartAsset's study \u2014 Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Boston \u2014 saw a decrease in grocery prices of 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively, from a year ago.",
      "Where are grocery prices headed?",
      "A recent analysis by the Yale Budget Lab estimates that overall food prices will rise by 2.6% in the next three years, as a result of U.S. tariffs as well as reciprocal tariffs from foreign nations in place as of April 15. Fresh produce is estimated to rise 5.4%, according to the think tank, before stabilizing at 3.6% higher.",
      "The USDA's\u00a0food price outlook, based on Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index data from this year and last, forecasts a slightly larger rise in overall food prices of 3.2%, with grocery store or supermarket food purchases, or food-at-home, increasing 2.7%.",
      "Prices for dairy products and fresh vegetables will remain mostly unchanged, according to the USDA, but unfortunately for consumers, the cost of egg prices is expected to climb. Egg prices, which have\u00a0soared over the past year, are expected to rise 57.6% in 2025, according to the report.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear arguments on May 15 on a Trump administration request to partially enforce the president's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said that it will hear oral arguments next month over whether the Trump administration can partially enforce an executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship while proceedings in a challenge to the directive move forward.",
      "The court said in an unsigned order that arguments on the Justice Department's request for emergency relief will take place during a special sitting on May 15. The administration has asked the Supreme Court to limit the scope of three separate injunctions that blocked implementation of President Trump's order nationwide.",
      "If the high court decides to grant the Justice Department's request, it would prevent the administration from enforcing Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship order only against the plaintiffs in the ongoing cases: seven individuals, specific members of immigrants' rights groups and residents of 22 states.",
      "The dispute over the president's attempt to unwind birthright citizenship is the latest in which the Supreme Court has been asked to intervene, with more requests expected. More than 100 cases that seek to knock down Mr. Trump's second-term policies have been filed since he returned to the White House in late January, and several have already made their way to the high court.",
      "The president's executive order on birthright citizenship was one of the first that he signed on his first day back in office and is among several directives that seek to target migrants who are in the U.S. unlawfully. The Trump administration's immigration policies have led to high-profile clashes with the courts \u2014 namely Mr. Trump's use of the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members of a Venezuelan gang and the administration's mistaken removal of a Maryland man in the U.S. unlawfully to El Salvador.",
      "While the 14th Amendment has for more than a century been understood to guarantee citizenship to all people born in the U.S., Mr. Trump's order denied birthright citizenship to children born to a mother who is unlawfully present in the U.S. or who is lawfully present on a temporary basis; or whose father is neither a citizen nor lawful permanent resident.",
      "The president's order directed federal agencies to stop issuing documents recognizing U.S. citizenship to children born after Feb. 19.",
      "More than half-dozen lawsuits challenging the measure were filed in courts throughout the country before it took effect, and three federal district courts in Washington, Maryland and Massachusetts each blocked the government from implementing the birthright citizenship order.",
      "Federal appeals courts in San Francisco, Boston and Richmond, Virginia, then refused requests by the Trump administration to partly block the lower court orders.",
      "The Justice Department filed emergency appeals of the three decisions with the Supreme Court in mid-March and asked it to limit enforcement of the birthright citizenship order to 28 states and individuals who are not involved in the ongoing cases. Then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said that a minimum, the Supreme Court should allow agencies to develop and issue public guidance regarding implementation of Mr. Trump's executive order while proceedings continue.",
      "Like other requests made to the Supreme Court, Harris took aim at the breadth of the injunctions issued by the district courts, which are nationwide in scope and cover states and individuals who are not involved in the litigation before them.",
      "The president and his allies have attacked judges for issuing nationwide injunctions in the slew of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies, and even called for some to be impeached.",
      "\"Universal injunctions have reached epidemic proportions since the start of the current administration,\" Harris wrote. \"Courts have graduated from universal preliminary injunctions to universal temporary restraining orders, from universal equitable relief to universal monetary remedies, and from governing the whole nation to governing the whole world.\"",
      "She argued that nationwide, or universal, injunctions prevent the executive branch from carrying out its work and impede Mr. Trump's ability to address what he says is a \"crisis\" at the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\"The district courts' universal injunctions threaten to perpetuate those problems by holding out a nationwide incentive for illegal immigration: the prospect of American citizenship for the unlawful migrants' children and of derivative immigration benefits for the migrants themselves,\" Harris wrote.",
      "But the challengers urged the Supreme Court to leave the district court orders untouched.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, officials from 18 states, the District of Columbia and San Francisco called the Trump administration's request \"remarkable,\" as it would allow the government to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship while the legal challenges move forward and render them \"deportable on birth and at risk of statelessness.",
      "The states argued that the Justice Department is seeking to violate binding Supreme Court precedent that recognized that birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.",
      "Two immigrants' rights groups, CASA Inc and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, refuted the suggestion by the government that it needs emergency relief.",
      "\"The Executive Branch has been complying with the settled interpretation of the Citizenship Clause for 125 years, and the government has demonstrated no urgent need to change now,\"\u00a0 they wrote in a filing.",
      "The groups also noted that with more than 800,000 members across all 50 states, \"nationwide consistency\" is important in the context of U.S. citizenship.",
      "\"Whether a child is a citizen of our nation should not depend on the state where she is born or the associations her parents have joined,\" lawyers for the groups said.",

      "Shein and Temu, two popular Chinese e-commerce sites known for their low-cost items, say they will raise prices for U.S. consumers starting next week, a move that comes amid President Trump's 145% tariff on imports from China and the end of a trade loophole.",
      "The sites are popular with U.S. shoppers because of their low prices, with a focus on fast fashion. While they predominantly sell women's apparel and accessories, both also sell men's and children's clothing. Temu carries household items and small personal electronics.",
      "At Shein, women's blouses cost as little as $5, and bikinis can be found for around $10. Temu offers running sneakers for $14.",
      "Beginning April 25, though, the deals won't be as enticing for U.S. consumers. In a notice on its website, Shein told customers that \"price adjustments\" will go into effect late next week. Shein said \"recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\" have caused its own costs to rise, making the price hikes necessary.",
      "\"We're doing everything we can to keep prices low and minimize the impact on you. Our team is working hard to improve your shopping experience and stay true to our mission: making fashion accessible for everyone,\" Shein added, without indicating the size of the price hikes.",
      "Temu posted a nearly identical notice, saying that its operating expenses have risen, and that it will therefore introduce price hikes beginning next week. Until then, prices will remain unchanged, it added.",
      "The \"de minimis\" loophole",
      "The two e-commerce sites have benefitted from a tax law loophole known as the \"de minimis\" exemption, which has allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free. Mr. Trump's recent action\u00a0to eliminate the loophole beginning May 2 throws a wrench in the companies' business models.",
      "In an April 2 executive order, the White House said that shippers in China have previously used the exemption to \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices.\"",
      "\"These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption,\" the executive order said.",
      "Effective May 2, such shipments will be subject to \"all applicable duties,\" the order states.",
      "The end of the \"de minimis\" loophole, as well as the Trump administration's tariffs of 145% on imports from China, have dented the business models of the two platforms.",
      "The changes come at a time when American shoppers have increasingly flocked to the low-cost retailers. The number of de minimis parcels shipped to the U.S. has surged to more than 1 billion in 2023, up from 153 million in 2015, with China accounting for the largest volume of shipments, according to a January Congressional Research Service report.

      "Beth Benike, cofounder of Busy Baby, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lack of clarity on the direction of U.S. tariffs poses serious problems for the Oronoco, Minnesota-based retailer.",
      "\"I am a problem solver. When a decision or policy comes out, I'll find a solution. I will work with it or around it,\" said Benike, whose company makes nonslip placemats and other products for babies. \"The next day, the policy changes and that plan doesn't make sense anymore, so I come up with something else.\"",
      "Smaller enterprises that rely on imported goods and packaging from China, which now faces U.S. tariffs of as high as 145%, are among the most concerned about Mr. Trump's trade policies. But a prolonged period of economic uncertainty alone can prove fatal, obscuring future borrowing costs, dampening consumer spending, and otherwise hindering the strategic planning and managerial decision-making involved in running a small business.",
      "Trump administration officials have staunchly defended their economic policies.",
      "\"Just as it did during President Trump's first term, the administration's America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts and the unleashing of American energy will restore American Greatness from Main Street to Wall Street,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Recently, however, tremors in the economy intensified by Mr. Trump's tariffs have eroded the optimism of small businesses, according to a closely watched confidence\u00a0gauge.",
      "\"The implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months,\" William Dunkelberg, chief economist of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said in a statement.",
      "The decline in optimism comes as Mr. Trump's economic agenda roils financial markets and raises concerns about slowing U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Consumers are concerned about the inflationary effects of the tariffs hikes. They understand if\u00a0prices rise, their real spending power will go down,\" Steven J. Davis, a Stanford University economist who co-developed an economic policy uncertainty\u00a0index, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Also, some of them also feel that maybe their jobs are at risk, so for both reasons many consumers will cut back on discretionary spending.\"",
      "The cost of unpredictability",
      "To be sure, even in the best of times business owners can be caught flat-footed by abrupt changes in the competitive landscape. But risks surge when the economic climate become unpredictable.",
      "\"Uncertainty is the enemy of entrepreneurship,\" Neri Karra Sillaman, an entrepreneurship expert at Oxford University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When the rules of the game are constantly shifting \u2014 one day you have a pause on tariffs, another day you don't have tariffs, if there are interest rate changes or political and economic instability \u2014 businesses cannot then confidently invest in growth.\"",
      "Smaller businesses, which typically have less of a financial cushion than larger enterprises, tend to struggle more in such an environment, she added.",
      "Davis, whose own\u00a0index\u00a0shows a spike in uncertainty in recent months, said trade policy unknowns are \"the big source of uncertainty right now inhibiting business investment and hiring.\"",
      "\"When you have tariffs, they tend to introduce cost unpredictability, which makes it very hard to predict and forecast margins accurately, especially in a product-based business,\" Karra added.",
      "Busy Baby's Benike said the sudden swerves in U.S. trade policy have made planning all but impossible.",
      "\"If I invest time, energy and money and the policy changes again in a way that makes the decision a poor one, I am already invested, the wheels are in motion and I'd be screwed,\" she said.",
      "\"I can't make a decision, so the best thing I can do is get the inventory I've paid for here and ready to sell,\" she added, referring to her latest factory order, now sitting in a Chinese warehouse.",
      "Meanwhile, the new 125% U.S. baseline tariff on Chinese imports means that Benike would owe $229,000 in duties on products worth roughly $158,000. She has launched a fundraising campaign to help cover the tariff costs.",
      "Her plan B, should the steep levies remain in place, is to continue manufacturing her products in China and to sell them to markets outside the U.S.",
      "\"There are babies everywhere. If I can't sell in America, there are other countries that are interested,\" she said.",
      "Business on the brink",
      "Kristin Bear, founder of Kilo Brava, an online lingerie and sleepwear company that sells both directly to consumers as well as to major retailers including Macy's, Nordstrom and Anthropologie, said the sky-high U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports \"wipe out our business completely\" if they stay in place.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/autism-rate-cdc-study-2025/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:08:18 -0400",
    "summary": "CDC experts were not made available to discuss the findings showing a rise in autism prevalence.",
    "story": [
      "One out of 31 children \u2014 more than 3% of kids \u2014 have been identified with autism, according to the latest results published Tuesday from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that tracks trends of autism's prevalence across some communities in the U.S.",
      "\"They've again gone up dramatically, just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, 1 out of 31 kids. And when I was, in my generation today, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday in Indiana, announcing the new findings. \"And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease.\"",
      "Kennedy often cites the CDC's figures from this study as evidence for his claim that the U.S. is now seeing a growing \"epidemic\"\u00a0of autism, which experts and advocacy groups have criticized as stigmatizing and misleading.",
      "\"As the report indicates, more children have access to evaluations for autism and more children are being identified as autistic. This is encouraging because when children are identified early, appropriate supports and services can be tailored to help them, and their families thrive,\" said Dr. Kristin Sohl, of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism, in a statement shared before Kennedy's remarks and the report's release.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told \"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0that the definition of what autism is has also expanded.",
      "\"It's a spectrum. It's not just one thing. ... So that's part of it,\" she said. \"We also are being much more aggressive about looking for it \u2014 pediatricians, educators.\"",
      "The definitions used in this study are also quite broad, Gounder added.",
      "\"They were looking at both health records, educational records, did a student access special ed supports, that sort of thing,\" she said. \"So part of it is the way in which we're looking for it. But there also does seem to be an underlying increase that has been occurring over time.\"",
      "For years, CDC scientists have said that the data indicating a rise in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, could be reflecting improved screening and access to autism services in some communities. However, the agency's experts were not made available for a press briefing about the latest findings, marking a change from previous years.",
      "\"Research has not demonstrated that living in certain communities puts children at greater risk for developing ASD,\" the CDC's authors said in their report.",
      "The study's authors said estimated autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black and Hispanic children compared to White children. Factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning could be contributing to this gap, the report says.",
      "Data from sites in 16 communities were collected for the new CDC report. The last report found a rate of 1 in 36 children through 2020, based on data from 11 communities.",
      "While the network's data is not nationally representative, figures from other federally-funded surveys and studies have also tracked a rise in autism's prevalence over the past two decades, accelerating in the early 2000s.",
      "\"Autistic children add value to our communities. Advocating for resources and funding to support autistic people across the lifespan is essential for a productive and healthy America,\" Sohl said in the statement.",
      "It comes as federal spending into autism research has also surged, largely going into efforts to study the biology suspected to underlie the condition. While scientists have linked up to 90% of autism to genetic traits, other factors are also suspected to play a role in changing its risk.",
      "Kennedy has said he believes \"an environmental toxin\" is causing autism, pointing to a range of potential culprits from food contaminants to vaccines.",
      "Many studies have debunked the claim that vaccines cause autism. But there is less research for some other factors that studies suggest might be linked to autism, ranging from pesticides to time between pregnancies.",
      "\"While the number of studies investigating the epidemiology of autism is increasing, most potential environmental factors have not been investigated sufficiently to draw firm conclusions,\" the federal government's autism research coordination office said in 2023.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Kennedy claimed that autism was preventable and said that it was \"unforgivable that we have not yet identified the underlying causes.\"",
      "\"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September,\" he said. Leading autism organizations have expressed skepticism over that promise and concern that he will revive debunked theories.",
      "Finding an answer to the cause or causes of autism by September is \"not realistic,\" Gounder said.",
      "\"Some of the theories include diabetes during pregnancy that might be affecting the development of the child, air pollution, exposure to micro plastics, antibiotic use and the way that changes the microbiome and the gut,\" she said. \"There's a whole bunch of different theories. And again, because it's so many different diseases actually labeled Autism Spectrum Disorder, it's going to take a while to really tease that out.\"",
      "The CDC also released a statement noting that prevalence varied widely between different sites in the study. That variation \"could reflect differences in availability of services for early detection, evaluation, and diagnostic practices,\" Dr. Karyl Rattay, head of the CDC's Division of Human Development and Disability, said.",
      "CDC delayed report, barred agency experts from media",
      "The CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities was initially planning to release the report in March this year, multiple officials told CBS News. Its publication was pushed back by CDC officials amid a department-wide pause on communications ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Plans to make the agency's experts available to explain and interpret the results were also scrapped, said multiple CDC officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ahead of the agency's last release of autism figures in 2023, CDC scientists appeared at press briefings and interviews with media outlets about the report.",
      "That year, news outlets were also provided with embargoed copies of the report ahead of time to give journalists time to prepare their reports and interview experts. This longstanding practice has also now been abandoned agency-wide under the Trump administration, officials said, both for the autism report and many other studies published by the agency.",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to requests for the embargoed report, or to make any experts available for an interview.",
      "Most of the communications staff working with the center have also been laid off, officials said, as part of Kennedy's sweeping restructuring of the department this month.",
      "The branch responsible for producing the autism figures is one of the few teams remaining on the job in the CDC's birth defects and disabilities center.",
      "Officials expect it to be cleaved off from the CDC and merged into Kennedy's new Administration for a Healthy America agency.",

    "story": [
      "A colossal squid \u2014 the world's largest squid species \u2014 was filmed and photographed in its natural habitat for the first time since scientists discovered it about a century ago. Crew members on board a research vessel in the South Atlantic Ocean recorded the video March 9, said the nonprofit organization Schmidt Ocean Institute, which owns the ship.",
      "The crew's remotely operated vehicle technically facilitated the sighting, which occurred about 2,000 feet below the surface of waters around the South Sandwich Islands, a volcanic archipelago located between the tip of South America and Antarctica. The unprecedented footage of the elusive deep-sea creature  came 100 years after it was initially identified and given a name, according to the institute.",
      "As their moniker suggests, colossal squid can grow to be enormous, with some ultimately weighing as much as 1,100 pounds and measuring more than 20 feet, according to Schmidt Ocean Institute. That's the height of a multi-story building. The squid caught on video in the South Atlantic was a juvenile and much smaller than a full-grown adult, with the research team placing its size at around 11 inches long.",
      "\"It's exciting to see the first in situ footage of a juvenile colossal and humbling to think that they have no idea that humans exist,\" said Kat Bolstad, a professor and researcher at the Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand, who the crew consulted to verify their squid footage after the expedition. \"For 100 years, we have mainly encountered them as prey remains in whale and seabird stomachs and as predators of harvested toothfish.\"",
      "The expedition occurred during a 35-day voyage where researchers sought to find new marine life, according to the Schmidt Ocean Institute.",
      "Colossal squid belong to the \"glass squid\" family, a group of about 60 squid species that earned that label because of their transparent bodies. Scientists said that while colossal squid have this appearance as juveniles, their bodies become more opaque over time. Although not much is known about the life cycle of the massive squid, this change has been documented by fishermen who have encountered colossal squid as they die.",
      "The Schmidt Ocean Institute's research trips have so far led to the first sightings of four species of squid, including the latest colossal squid sighting, the organization said. The institute's executive director Jyotika Virmani described the encounters as \"unforgettable moments,\" which \"continue to remind us that the Ocean is brimming with mysteries yet to be solved.\"",

Lately, I\u2019ve focused on\u2026 pic.twitter.com/JSybxCujDH",
      "Hall told CBS News that he was blocked by the department from being directly interviewed by a reporter from The New York Times, asking about\u00a0recent research\u00a0on how ultra-processed foods can be addictive.",
      "The study found that ultra-processed foods did not appear to be addictive in the same way as addictive drugs, which trigger outsized dopamine responses in the brain. That means overconsumption of ultra-processed foods might be happening for more complex reasons.",
      "\"It just suggests that they may not be addictive by the typical mechanism that many drugs are addictive. But even this bit of daylight between the preconceived narrative and our study was apparently too much,\" Hall said in a message.",

      "The surprise meeting with Van Hollen marks Abrego Garcia's first known appearance since last month, when his deportation to El Salvador's notorious Terrorism Confinement Center drew national attention and sparked a legal standoff with the Trump administration.",
      "The administration admitted in court papers Abrego Garcia was sent to El Salvador \u2014 along with hundreds of other Salvadoran and Venezuelan migrants \u2014 due to an \"administrative error.\" U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, and the Supreme Court backed up that order, but he has remained in El Salvador since then, with Xinis suggesting the government hasn't complied with her order and demanding regular updates on his status.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed back, arguing it's up to El Salvador to decide whether to return Abrego Garcia \u2014 an argument an appeals court called \"shocking\" on Thursday. The government has also alleged Abrego Garcia is linked to Salvadoran gang MS-13, citing a confidential informant, though his attorneys have denied that allegation and noted Abrego Garcia has not been charged or convicted of any crimes.",
      "Abrego Garcia, 29, was born in El Salvador but entered the United States illegally in 2011 at the age of 16. He was arrested outside a Maryland Home Depot in 2019, but a judge barred the government from deporting him to El Salvador, warning he could be persecuted by gangs in his home country. Years later, in March of this year, he was detained by immigration agents in Maryland and sent to the Salvadoran detention center, known as CECOT.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case is at the center of a controversial push by the Trump administration to send scores of migrants \u2014 including accused members of MS-13 and Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua \u2014 to CECOT using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to deport citizens of an enemy nation during an \"invasion or predatory incursion.\" The gambit has been challenged in court, with opponents decrying conditions in CECOT and\u00a0arguing the government is denying migrants the right to due process. A \"60 Minutes\" report found most of the 238 Venezuelans sent to CECOT on several planes last month had no apparent criminal record. But the Trump administration has defended its use of the law, arguing it is cracking down on gang violence.",

      "European leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier\u00a0can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"",
      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",
      "The hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner.",
      "\"If I wouldn't think it's a reliable partner, I wouldn't be here,\" Meloni responded.",
      "Meloni said she's \"here to find the best way to make us both stronger.\"",

      "Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed strategies on how to approach her meeting with Mr. Trump during multiple phone calls ahead of the trip, according to a commission spokesperson.",
      "Von der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",
      "Meloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.",
      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",
      "In other European capitals, there was clear anxiety over the possibility that the White House could use the meeting to try to undermine EU unity.",
      "\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" the French government's Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, said last week, adding: \"Europe is only strong if it is united.\"",

Sullivan, originally from Tennessee, was abducted at gunpoint\u00a0during a prayer meeting at his church in South Africa on the evening of April 10.",
      "According to a statement issued by the the South African Police Service, a specialized unit dedicated to serious crime, known as the Hawks, they led the operation to rescue the 45-year-old.",
      "The American was abducted from his Fellowship Baptist Church in Motherwell Township, outside the coastal city of Gqeberha, and was rescued from a safehouse being used by his captors in that city.",
      "\"The operation followed verified intelligence wherein a coordinated team (of several police units) moved swiftly to the identified location,\" police said. \"As officers approached the house, they observed a vehicle on the premises. The suspects inside the vehicle upon seeing law enforcement allegedly attempted to flee and opened fire on the team. The officers responded with tactical precision, leading to a high-intensity shootout in which three unidentified suspects were fatally wounded.\"",
      "Police said Sullivan was discovered in the same vehicle and \"miraculously unharmed, he was immediately assessed by medical personnel and is currently in an excellent condition.\"",
      "Police have said that four armed, masked male suspects entered the church on Thursday, stole two cellphones and then abducted Sullivan, in his car, a Toyota Fortuner, which was found a short time later in Motherwell.",
      "Rev. Jeremy Hall, a local pastor, told French news agency AFP that Sullivan's abduction was likely \"financially related.\"",
      "Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge told AFP that cases are typically turned over to the Hawks unit when ransoms are demanded. Kidnappings, including by criminal gangs taking people they think can command large ransoms, have increased in South Africa in recent years.",

The 24-year-old was initially arrested more than six years after another American was\u00a0killed\u00a0with arrows by the tribe on the same island.",

      "Polyakov, from Scottsdale, Arizona, was arrested on March 31, two days after he set foot on the restricted territory of North Sentinel Island in a bid to meet people from the reclusive Sentinelese tribe.",
      "\"It may be claimed to be an adventure trip, but the fact is that there has been a violation of Indian laws. Outsiders meeting Sentinelese could endanger the tribe's survival,\" said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity as he isn't authorized to speak about the case under investigation.",
      "Polyakov is suspected of violating Indian laws that carry a possible sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine.",
      "Visitors are banned from traveling within 3 miles of North Sentinel Island, whose population has been isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years. The inhabitants use spears and bows and arrows to hunt the animals that roam the small, heavily forested island. Deeply suspicious of outsiders, they attack anyone who lands onto their beaches.",
      "In 2018, John Allen Chau, an American missionary who landed illegally on the beach was killed by North Sentinelese Islanders who apparently shot him with arrows and then buried his body on the beach. In 2006, the Sentinelese had killed two fishermen who had accidentally landed on the shore.",
      "An official from the U.S. consulate visited Polyakov in jail earlier this week. The U.S embassy in Delhi didn't immediately respond to a request confirming the visit or any further updates on Polyakov.",
      "Police said Polyakov had conducted detailed research on sea conditions, tides and accessibility to the island before starting his journey. He stayed on the beach for about an hour, blowing a whistle to attract the attention but got no response from the islanders.",
      "The young American had twice attempted to visit the island in the past, and left a can of Diet Coke and a coconut as offering for the tribe this time after he failed to contact the Sentinelese. He shot a video of the island on his camera and collected some sand samples before returning to his boat.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/guantanamo-trump-migrants-without-criminal-records/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 07:05:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay, allowing officials to send non-criminal detainees there despite a vow to hold \"the worst\" offenders at the naval base.",
      "As part of his aggressive crackdown on immigration, President Trump in late January directed officials to convert facilities inside the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into holding sites for migrants living in the country illegally. At the time, Mr. Trump said \"the worst\" migrants would be held at the base, directing officials to make space for \"high-priority criminal aliens.\"",
      "But a previously undisclosed agreement between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense indicates that the Trump administration gave officials wide-ranging discretion to decide who to send to Guantanamo Bay, enacting criteria not predicated on the severity of detainees' criminal history or conduct. In fact, the memo does not mention any criminality assessment. [Read the full memo at the bottom of this story.]",
      "Instead, the agreement, signed on March 7 by top DHS and Pentagon officials, says the departments agreed to use the Guantanamo base to detain migrants with final deportation orders who have \"a nexus to a transnational criminal organization (TCO) or criminal drug activity.\"",
      "Officials defined \"nexus\" in broad terms. A nexus can be satisfied, the memo says, if migrants with final deportation orders are part of a transnational criminal group or if they paid one \"to be smuggled into the United States.\" The latter condition could be used to describe many of the migrants and asylum-seekers who have illegally crossed the U.S. southern border, as criminal groups in Mexico largely control the illicit movement of people and drugs there.",
      "Migrants who overstayed a visa are not eligible to be sent to Guantanamo Bay, the document says. But if the nature of a migrant's entry is unclear, the memo allows officials to assume that the person paid a criminal group to enter the U.S. and to send them to Guantanamo if they hail from a nation \"where the preponderance of aliens from that country enter the United States in that fashion.\"",
      "The conditions for transferring migrants to Guantanamo, as outlined in the memo, seem to be at odds with statements by Mr. Trump and high-ranking members of his administration that have suggested the base would be used as a detention site for dangerous criminals.",
      "Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former U.S. immigration official during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said the memo's rules \"apply very broadly to any immigrant who came to the U.S. via the U.S.-Mexico border.\"",
      "\"It's very well known that almost every immigrant who makes it to the U.S.-Mexico border would have to pay some sort of money to the cartels that control the territory on the Mexican side, directly or indirectly,\" she said.",
      "Cardinal Brown added that the rules do not appear to include \"any individualized assessment\" to determine whether migrant detainees pose a threat, before transferring them to Guantanamo.",
      "Department of Defense spokeswoman Kingsley Wilson confirmed the existence of the memo, saying it \"strengthens DoD and DHS collaboration by clarifying roles and responsibilities, and fostering efficient and coordinated operations at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to DHS representatives for comment.",
      "The Guantanamo operation is not the only Trump administration immigration effort to face scrutiny over who exactly has been targeted. In mid-March, for example, the administration deported 238 Venezuelans to El Salvador, so they could be imprisoned inside that country's infamous mega-prison. The Trump administration said they were all criminals and gang members, but a \"60 Minutes\" investigation did not find a criminal record for 75% of the Venezuelan deportees.",
      "A high-profile yet largely secretive operation",
      "The Trump administration first began sending migrants to Guantanamo in February, initially only transferring Venezuelans there, including men it accused of having ties to the Tren de Aragua prison gang. The first group of Venezuelan detainees was eventually flown to Honduras, where the Venezuelan government picked them up so they could be transported back to their homeland.",
      "Since then, the administration has sporadically flown migrants from different countries to the base, before transferring them back to the U.S. or other nations. Administration officials have regularly touted the flights to Guantanamo but have provided limited details about the operation, including on costs and who is eligible to be sent to the base.",
      "What has been publicly revealed, by CBS News and other media outlets, is that officials have transferred both detainees considered to be \"high-threat\" and \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo, including migrants whose relatives have denied allegations of gang membership and criminality.",
      "Government guidelines define migrant detainees as posing a \"high\" threat if they have violent or serious criminal records, histories of disruptive conduct or alleged gang ties. Low-risk detainees are defined as migrants who face deportation because they are in the U.S. illegally but who lack any serious criminal record \u2014 or any at all.",
      "Those sent to Guantanamo and considered to be \"high-threat\" migrants have been held at Camp VI, a section of the post-9/11 prison that still houses roughly a dozen terrorism suspects. Migrant detainees deemed to pose a \"low\" risk have been transferred to the base's Migrant Operations Center, a barrack-like facility that has historically housed asylum-seekers intercepted at sea.",
      "Wilson, the Department of Defense spokeswoman, said there are currently 42 migrants detained at Guantanamo, 32 of them housed at the Migrant Operations Center and 10 so-called \"high-threat\" detainees held at Camp VI.",
      "The March 7 memo obtained by CBS News sheds light on other aspects of operations at Guantanamo. For example, it confirms the migrant detainees transported there remain in the legal custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even though the military is providing access to its facilities to detain them.",
      "As part of the agreement, DHS also accepted the conditions at Camp VI and the Migrant Operations Center as adequate to hold migrant adults, noting it would not transfer children to the base. The department agreed to send ICE officers or contractors to the base, including to oversee security at the Migrant Operations Center.",
      "The memo makes DHS responsible for providing detainees services like recreation and religious accommodations; determining whether migrants get access to lawyers; and administering \"involuntary medical treatment,\" such as force-feeding during hunger strikes.",
      "The agreement also charges DHS with overseeing the transfer of detainees from and to Guantanamo, requiring the department to relocate migrants from the base no more than 180 days after their deportation orders are issued.",
      "The military, as stipulated by the agreement, is principally responsible for providing security at Camp VI and in the perimeter of the facilities. It also agreed to provide toilets and hygiene facilities, as well as medical care to both ICE personnel and detained migrants.",
      "The memo says the Department of Defense committed to erect tents at the base to hold additional detainees, though those sites have not been used to detain migrants yet. The agreement notes, however, that those tents \"do not have power, lighting, or heating/air conditioning.\"",
      "The effort to hold migrants at Guantanamo faces legal challenges by advocates, including at the American Civil Liberties Union, the Trump administration's chief adversary in federal court.",
      "The ACLU alleged in court filings that migrants were initially held incommunicado at Guantanamo, without access to relatives or lawyers. The administration subsequently said it took steps to give migrant detainees access to lawyers.",
      "The ACLU has also described detention conditions at Guantanamo as deplorable, citing declarations from migrants held there. In one of those declarations, a Venezuelan man previously held at the base said he went on a hunger strike after feeling he had been \"kidnapped.\"",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the lead architect of the Trump administration's immigration agenda, said earlier this week there are no plans to stop using Guantanamo to detain migrants.",
      "\"It's wide open,\" Miller said on Fox News. \"Gitmo is open.\"",

    "summary": "All 1.4 million Luma Energy clients across Puerto Rico were without power on Wednesday. The blackout comes less than five months after another island-wide power outage on New Year's Eve.",
    "story": [
      "An island-wide blackout hit Puerto Rico on Wednesday as the largely Catholic residents of the U.S. territory prepared to celebrate the Easter weekend, a power company spokesman said.",
      "All hospitals on the island are operating on generators after the power went out at 12:38 p.m. Eastern Time, Veronica Ferraiuoli, acting governor and secretary of state for Puerto Rico, said at a news conference. All 1.4 million clients on the island were without power, Hugo Sorrentini, spokesman for Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The entire island is without generation,\" he said.",
      "Why is Puerto Rico without power?",
      "The source of the outage was in the southern part of the island where a transmission line was affected, according to Josu\u00e9 Col\u00f3n, executive director of Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority.",
      "Late Wednesday, Luma said \"a combination of factors\" led to the blackout, the latest in a string of major outages on the island in recent years \u2014 with the last major blackout occurring\u00a0less than five months ago on New Year's Eve.",
      "\"Preliminary analysis points to a failure in the protection system as the initial trigger, followed by the presence of vegetation on a transmission line between Cambalache and Manat\u00ed,\" Luma said in an update. \"This sequence of failures triggered a chain of events that resulted in an island-wide outage.\"",
      "When will power in Puerto Rico turn back on?",
      "Restoring most of the power will likely at least 48-72 hours, Luma said Wednesday evening. At least 78,000 customers were also without water, according to the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority.",
      "Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez, who was traveling, said officials were \"working diligently\" to address the outage. Ferraiuoli said the governor is trying to return as soon as possible.",
      "Puerto Ricans react to another outage",
      "Thousands of Puerto Ricans were fuming over the latest outage, with many renewing their calls that the government cancel the contract with Luma and Genera PR, which oversees generation of power on the island.",
      "Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny said in Spanish on X, \"when are we going to do something?,\" apparently referring to the outage.",
      "\"This is a total disaster,\" said Orlando Huertas, 68, as he sipped a drink with a friend at a streetside bar and criticized the government for not doing enough to tackle the chronic outages.",
      "Dozens of people were forced to walk next to the rails of the rapid transit system that serves the capital, San Juan, while scores of businesses including the biggest mall in the Caribbean were forced to close. Professional baseball and basketball games were cancelled as the hum of generators and smell of smoke filled the air.",
      "\"Following today's island-wide power outage, our administration is actively engaged in ongoing communication with the White House and all relevant federal agencies,\" the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration said in a statement. \"We are working closely with the federal government to ensure that Puerto Rico receives the necessary support and that all essential services are restored as quickly and safely as possible.\"",
      "By late Wednesday afternoon, some 5,000 to 7,000 clients had their power restored, although that number is expected to fluctuate. Those without generators crowded around grocery stores and other businesses to buy ice.",
      "\"I'm desperate. My generator is broken,\" said Carmen Suriel, who worried about the impact of the blackout on her two children, a six-month-old and a five-year-old with Down syndrome, as the temperature rose across Puerto Rico on Wednesday.",
      "Alma Ram\u00edrez, 69, said she was frustrated with the constant outages, some of which had already damaged her TV and microwave, forcing her to buy new appliances.",
      "\"They have to improve,\" she said of the government. \"Those who are affected are us, the poor.\"",
      "The island of 3.2 million residents has a more than 40% poverty rate, and not everyone can afford solar panels or generators. While there was a push to use more renewable energy sources under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, which\u00a0provided Puerto Rico with mega generators\u00a0and other resources, experts worry that won't happen under U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Puerto Rico has struggled with chronic outages since September 2017 when Hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing a power grid that crews are still struggling to rebuild. As the island was just starting to rebuild, it was hit hard again by Hurricane Fiona in 2022.",
      "The grid already had been deteriorating as a result of decades of a lack of maintenance and investment.",
      "In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, the Puerto Rico government in 2021 hired Luma, a private Canadian-American company based in San Juan, to handle the transmission and distribution of electricity on the island. Power was previously overseen by the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which went\u00a0bankrupt in 2017\u00a0as the government faced billions of dollars in public debt payments.",

    "story": [
      "During the first day of his trip to El Salvador, Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen was denied a meeting or phone call with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to that country. Van Hollen was able to meet with the vice president of El Salvador.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has sparked a series of court proceedings, during which a federal judge ordered the government to return him to the U.S. from the El Salvador supermax prison, CECOT.",
      "The Trump administration raised the case to the Supreme Court, which also ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to check on Abrego Garcia's well-being and to meet with Salvadoran government leaders after promising Abrego Garcia's family that he would try to aid in his release.",
      "Maryland senator hopes to see Abrego Garcia",
      "Sen. Van Hollen said he hoped to meet with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele. Instead, he met with Vice President F\u00e9lix Ulloa on Wednesday. During that meeting, Van Hollen said that Ulloa indicated he would need a little more time to arrange an in-person prison meeting between Abrego Garcia and the senator.",
      "However, when the senator offered to return next week, he said Ulloa told him he could not promise a meeting would happen at all. Van Hollen was also denied a phone call with Abrego Garcia. Ulloa suggested that the requests be handled by the U.S. Embassy instead.",
      "\"We have an unjust situation here,\" Van Hollen said during a livestreamed news conference. \"The Trump administration is lying about Abrego Garcia. The American courts have looked at the facts.\"",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia's wrongful deportation",
      "During his update, Sen. Van Hollen emphasized that Abrego Garcia should not have been deported, as he had been granted a \"withholding of removal\" order from an immigration judge.",
      "\"Abrego Garcia is legally in the U.S.,\" Van Hollen said. \"An immigration judge found years ago that it would put his life in danger if he was returned to El Salvador.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was arrested by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) in March as he was leaving his job in Baltimore, Maryland and returning home to Prince George's County. On March 15, he was deported to El Salvador on a plane with more than 200 other migrants that the Trump administration claims had gang affiliations.",
      "ICE later admitted that Abrego Garcia was deported because of an \"administrative error,\" however, they did not take action to return him to the U.S.",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia's alleged ties to MS-13",
      "The Trump administration has said that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim his attorney and family deny. He also has no criminal history in any country.",
      "\"The case of Abrego Garcia does not have to do with MS-13,\" Sen. Van Hollen said. \"If you listen to President Trump and the Trump administration, you would think that U.S. courts have found that Mr. Abrego Garcia is part of MS-13, but they have not found that. In fact, recently, a U.S. federal court judge said that the Trump administration did not have evidence to support the claim that he had ever been part of MS-13.\"",
      "Why can't El Salvador return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.?",
      "During his update in El Salvador, Sen. Van Hollen questioned why Abrego Garcia is still being held at CECOT and asked if the government has any evidence of Abrego Garcia's gang ties.",
      "\"The government of El Salvador has no evidence that he is part of MS-13, so why is El Salvador continuing to hold him in CECOT?\" the senator questioned.",
      "According to Van Hollen, the vice president said the Trump administration is paying El Salvador to keep Abrego Garcia at CECOT.",
      "When asked again why El Salvador could not release Abrego Garcia, Vice President Ulloa referred to a statement that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele gave while visiting the White House, saying the country cannot smuggle Abrego Garcia back into the U.S."

    "published": "Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:29:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.K. Supreme Court has ruled the country's 2010 Equality Act defines a woman as someone born biologically female in a potential landmark case for transgender rights.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0In a potential landmark decision, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that in a 2010 civil rights law called the Equality Act, the word \"woman\" refers to someone's biological sex.",
      "The five judges on the court stressed that their ruling was limited to interpreting the 2010 law as it pertains to women, and that \"it is not the role of the court to adjudicate on the arguments in the public domain on the meaning of gender or sex, nor is it to define the meaning of the word 'woman' other than when it is used in the provisions of\" that legislation.",
      "What the U.K. Supreme Court said about the definition of \"woman\"",
      "Monday's ruling was in response to a series of challenges brought by the campaign group For Women Scotland (FWS). The group initially challenged the definition of the term \"woman\" as included in Scottish legislation from 2018, which set targets to increase the proportion of women serving on public bodies.",
      "That legislation, for its own purposes, initially defined the term \"woman\" as including people \"(i) with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment; (ii) living as a woman; and (iii) proposing to undergo / undergoing / who have undergone a gender reassignment process,\" Monday's Supreme Court judgement said.",
      "FWS challenged that definition and subsequent statutory guidance was issued amending the definition of a \"woman\" under the Scottish law to bring it in line with the U.K.-wide Equality Act of 2010, which included people with Gender Recognition Certificates. Those government-issued GRCs allow a person's affirmed gender to be legally recognized in the U.K.",
      "That further guidance was appealed by FWS, however, and the case eventually made it to the Supreme Court, which ruled Wednesday that \"the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex,\" though the court stressed that the definition was solely for the purpose of interpreting the specific part of the legislation in question.",
      "\"The questions raised by this appeal directly affect women and members of the trans community,\" the Supreme Court said. \"On the one hand, women have historically suffered from discrimination in our society and since 1975 have been given statutory protection against discrimination on the ground of sex. On the other hand, the trans community is both historically and currently a vulnerable community which Parliament has more recently sought to protect by statutory provision.\"",
      "\"It is not the role of the court to adjudicate on the arguments in the public domain on the meaning of gender or sex, nor is it to define the meaning of the word 'woman' other than when it is used in the provisions of the EA 2010,\" the judges said.",
      "The Supreme Court said using a wider definition of \"woman\" under the Equality Act could have created confusion among those trying to use the law to protect women and trans people from discrimination.",
      "\"Gender reassignment and sex are separate bases for discrimination and inequality,\" the judgement said.",
      "It explained that in the court's view, including trans people with a GRC certificate under the category of \"woman,\" for the purposes of interpreting the Equality Act, \"would create two sub-groups within those who share the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, giving trans persons who possess a GRC greater rights than those who do not. Those seeking to perform their obligations under the Act would have no obvious means of distinguishing between the two sub-groups to whom different duties were owed.\"",
      "Responses to the U.K. Supreme Court's judgement",
      "The ruling by the U.K. Supreme Court comes at the same time as efforts by the Trump administration in the United States to to\u00a0prohibit\u00a0gender-affirming care for minors and\u00a0bar trans people\u00a0from serving in the U.S. military or participating\u00a0in women's sports.",
      "Activist Grahame Park Girl told Britain's Press Association news service on Monday that the court's judgement was \"the only common sense decision you can make. Anything else would be farcical and appalling for women's rights.\"",
      "J.K. Rowling, who has campaigned for the primacy of biological sex, celebrated the judgement on social media.",
      "\"It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the U.K.,\" Rowling said.",
      "LGBTQ+ rights group Stonewall said it would work with partners to understand the implications of Monday's ruling for trans people, and cautioned against anyone attempting to interpret it too broadly.",
      "\"Stonewall shares the deep concern at the widespread implications for today's ruling from the Supreme Court. It will be incredibly worrying for the trans community and all of us who support them,\" Stonewall CEO Simon Blake said in a statement.",
      "\"It's important to be reminded the Court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on Gender Reassignment, and will continue to do so,\" Blake said.",
      "\"We are really shocked by today's Supreme Court decision \u2014 which reverses twenty years of understanding on how the law recognizes trans men and women with Gender Recognition Certificates,\" the rights group Scottish Trans said in a statement. \"The judgement seems to have totally missed what matters to trans people \u2014 that we are able to live our lives, and be recognized, in line with who we truly are.\"",

      "A doctor in Berlin has been charged with murder over the deaths of 15 patients under palliative care, prosecutors said Wednesday, alleging he acted out of a \"lust\" for killing. He is also accused of trying to cover up the evidence by starting fires in their homes.",
      "The doctor was part of a nursing service's end-of-life care team and was initially suspected in the deaths of just four patients. That number has crept higher since last summer, and investigators now say they've found evidence linking him to the deaths of 15 people between Sept. 22, 2021, and July 24 last year.",

      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip\u00a0\u2014 An Israeli airstrike hit the northern gate of a field hospital in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, killing a medic and wounding 10 other people, the hospital's director said. The strike that hit the Kuwaiti Field Hospital in the Muwasi area was the second on a Gaza health facility in three days, coming after the last major hospital still providing critical care in the Palestinian enclave was hit Sunday in an attack the United Nations said had left it \"out of service.\"",
      "Israel's attacks in Gaza have continued for almost a month, since the country abandoned a ceasefire with Hamas that had been negotiated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar. Efforts to strike a new ceasefire agreement have made little apparent headway since then, though Hamas has said it is considering a new proposal from Israel this week.",
      "Multiple news agencies cited Hamas officials as saying Israel had offered a 45-day halt in the fighting in exchange for the release of hostages. But Hamas officials cited by multiple news agencies reiterated that their would be no ceasefire agreement without a commitment by Israel to end the war and withdraw forces from Gaza. Hamas officials were also quoted as saying Israel had included a demand for the group to agree to disarm \u2014 something one representative was quoted as saying \"is not up for discussions.\"",
      "Israel's government had not confirmed the new offer to Hamas as of Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had sought shelter in sprawling tent camps around the Kuwaiti Field Hospital, but the wounded from Tuesday's strike were all patients and medics, including two patients who were left in critical condition, according to hospital spokesman Saber Mohammed.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israel Defense Forces on the Tuesday strike. The IDF has bombed hospitals on several occasions during the 18-month war, accusing Hamas, which has long been designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israel, of hiding out in them or using them for military purposes. Hamas and Gazan hospital staff have denied the allegations and accused Israel of recklessly endangering civilians and deliberately gutting the territory's health system.",
      "On Sunday, Israel struck the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City after ordering an evacuation. The United Nations said a child patient with a reported head injury died while being evacuated, and the strike severely damaged the emergency room, pharmacy and surrounding buildings.",
      "Al Ahli Hospital \"is out of service,\" Director-General of the U.N.'s World Health Program Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet, adding: \"Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Attacks on health care must stop. Once again we repeat: patients, health workers and hospitals must be protected. The aid blockade must be lifted. Ceasefire.\"",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesman echoed that sentiment, saying: \"Under international humanitarian law, wounded and sick, medical personnel and medical facilities, including hospitals, must be respected and protected,\" according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "The Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which runs the hospital, also condemned the strike.",
      "Israel said it targeted a Hamas command and control center within the facility, without providing evidence. Hamas denied the allegations.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 51,000 people, according to an updated toll released by the Gaza Ministry of Health on Tuesday. That includes more than 1,600 people killed since Israel ended the ceasefire and resumed its offensive last month to pressure Hamas to accept changes to the agreement. The ministry is led by medical professionals but reports to Gaza's Hamas-run government. Its casualty count is seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts, though Israel has challenged its numbers. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The ministry does not say how many were civilians or combatants but says women and children make up more than half of the dead. The offensive has destroyed much of the territory and displaced around 90% of its population of roughly 2 million Palestinians.",
      "The war was sparked by the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, which killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza. Israeli officials say 59 of those hostages remain in Gaza, 24 of whom are still believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",

      "Boeing declined to comment. The aviation giant's shares fell $2.59, or 1.6%, to $156.74 in morning trading.",
      "The order to stop accepting Boeing jets comes after China boosted its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. That matches the level of tariffs that President Trump has placed on Chinese imports, although those taxes can rise as high as 145% for some products. China's tariffs would have more than doubled the price of U.S.-made aircraft and parts, making the cost unaffordable, Bloomberg reported.",
      "Boeing is scheduled to ship about 10 737 Max aircraft to Chinese carriers, including China Southern Airlines, Air China and Xiamen Airlines, Bloomberg reported, citing data from Aviation Flights Group. During the first quarter, Boeing delivered 130 aircraft in all, including more than 100 737 jets, the company\u00a0said on April 8.",
      "Mr. Trump addressed the report in a Truth Social post on Tuesday, writing that China \"just reneged on the big Boeing deal, saying that they will 'not take possession' of fully committed to aircraft.\"",
      "Bloomberg reported that some of the payment and delivery paperwork on some of those jets ordered by Chinese airlines might have been completed before the trade war expanded earlier this month. In that case, some planes might be able to enter China, the news service reported.",

    "summary": "A Russian court convicted four journalists of extremism for working for an anti-corruption group founded by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny.",
    "story": [
      "A Russian court on Tuesday convicted four journalists of extremism for working for an anti-corruption group founded by the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny and sentenced each to 5 1/2 years in prison.",
      "Antonina Favorskaya, Kostantin Gabov, Sergey Karelin and Artyom Kriger were found guilty of involvement with a group that had been labeled as extremist. All four had maintained their innocence, arguing they were being prosecuted for doing their jobs as journalists.",
      "The closed-door trial was part of an unrelenting crackdown on dissent that has reached an unprecedented scale after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "The authorities have targeted opposition figures, independent journalists, rights activists and ordinary Russians critical of the Kremlin with prosecution, jailing hundreds and prompting thousands to flee the country.",
      "Favorskaya and Kriger worked with SotaVision, an independent Russian news outlet that covers protests and political trials. Gabov is a freelance producer who has worked for multiple organizations, including Reuters. Karelin, a freelance video journalist, has done work for Western media outlets, including The Associated Press.",
      "The four journalists were accused of working with Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption, which was designated as extremist and outlawed in 2021 in a move widely seen as politically motivated.",
      "Navalny was President Vladimir Putin's fiercest and most prominent foe and relentlessly campaigned against official corruption in Russia. Navalny died in February 2024 in an Arctic penal colony while serving a 19-year sentence on a number of charges, including running an extremist group, which he had rejected as politically driven.",
      "Favorskaya said at an earlier court appearance open to the public that she was being prosecuted for a story she did on abuse Navalny faced behind bars. Speaking to reporters from the defendants' cage before the verdict, she also said she was punished for helping organize Navalny's funeral.",
      "Gabov, in a closing statement prepared for court that was published by the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, said the accusations against him were groundless and the prosecution failed to prove them.",
      "\"I understand perfectly well ... what kind of country I live in. Throughout history, Russia has never been different, there is nothing new in the current situation,\" Gabov said in the statement. \"Independent journalism is equated to extremism.\"",
      "In a statement Karelin prepared for his closing arguments that also was published by Novaya Gazeta, he said he had agreed to do street interviews for Popular Politics, a YouTube channel founded by Navalny's associates, while trying to provide for his wife and a young child. He stressed that the channel wasn't outlawed as extremist and had done nothing illegal.",
      "\"Remorse is considered to be a mitigating circumstance. It's the criminals who need to have remorse for what they did. But I am in prison for my work, for the honest and impartial attitude to journalism, FOR THE LOVE for my family and country,\" he wrote in a separate speech for court that also was published by the outlet, in which he emphasized his feelings in capital letters.",
      "Kriger, in a closing statement published by SotaVision, said he was imprisoned and added to the Russian financial intelligence's registry of extremists and terrorists \"only because I have conscientiously carried out my professional duties as an honest, incorruptible and independent journalist for 4 1/2 years.\"",
      "\"Don't despair guys, sooner or later it will end and those who delivered the sentence will go behind bars,\" Kriger said after the verdict.",
      "Supporters who gathered in the court building chanted and applauded as the four journalists were led out of the courtroom after the verdict.",
      "The Russian human rights group Memorial designated all four as political prisoners, among more than 900 others held in the country. That number includes Mikhail Kriger, Artyom Kriger's uncle, a Moscow-based activist who was arrested in 2022 and is serving a seven-year prison sentence.",
      "Mikhail Kriger was convicted of justifying terrorism and inciting hatred over Facebook comments in which he expressed a desire \"to hang\" Putin.",
      "The four journalists are not the only people linked to Navalny who have faced charges from the Russian legal system. In January , three lawyers who had defended Navalny were convicted of participating in an \"extremist organization\" and sentenced to prison. The lawyers had helped transmit Navalny's prison statements to the world before his death. Vadim Kobzev, the most high-profile member of the team, was given a 5 1/2 year sentence. Alexey Lipster was sentenced to five years, and Igor Sergunin was sentenced to 3 1/2 years.",
      "In July 2024, five months after Navalny's death was reported, Russia\u00a0issued an arrest warrant for his wife,\u00a0Yulia Navalnaya. The country accused Navalnaya of participating in an \"extremist organization.\" Navalnaya, who lives in Germany and was named the chairperson of the Human Rights Foundation in July 2024, derided the decision on social media.",

    "summary": "A trove of buried treasure that metal detectorists recently discovered in Transylvania once belonged to an ancient people that inhabited the region in modern-day Romania.",
    "story": [
      "Two men with metal detectors recently discovered a trove of ancient treasure in Transylvania, which shed new light on early settlements in the storied historical region, local officials said. Encompassing much of present-day Romania, Transylvania is known for its medieval towns, Gothic architecture and vampiric folklore, with a mythical reputation tied to the fictional character Dracula and his real-life inspiration, the notorious 15th-century ruler Vlad the Impaler.",
      "The treasure unearthed this spring in the Transylvanian town of Breaza dates back much farther than the brutal monarch's reign. In an announcement shared last week, officials in Breaza said the metal detectorists found jewelry that originally belonged to Dacian people, who inhabited what is now Transylvania and some of its surrounding areas from around the 1st century B.C.E. until the 1st century of the common era. Dacia was eventually conquered by the Roman Empire.",
      "Silver brooches and a bracelet decorated with plant motifs were among the artifacts discovered, in addition to a chain necklace and a belt constructed out of circular metallic pendants, each marked with solar symbols. The treasure weighed 550 grams altogether, officials said, equating to more a pound.",
      "The Mures County Museum, near Breaza, confirmed the jewelry's origins in ancient Dacian society. An archaeologist at the museum, Daniel Ciota, will study the treasure as it is prepared for display.",
      "Officials in Breaza said the silver pieces were likely worn by a Dacian aristocrat, citing its lavishness as a signal of its owner's status, potentially as a \"high-ranking\" member of their society. As for why the jewels were ultimately buried in the ground, the officials suggested they could have been used as offerings to some unknown deity long ago. However, they also acknowledged someone may have hidden them for more personal reasons.",
      "There were no previous records of Dacian settlements in this part of Transylvania, and the treasure is the first physical evidence off Dacian people living around Breaza. Moving forward, officials said archaeologists and researchers will begin to explore the area in hopes of finding remnants of a settlement where the owner of the jewels may have lived.",
      "\"These historical artifacts remind us of the cultural heritage and importance of our region in the history of Dacia,\" the town of Breaza wrote in a social media post unveiling the treasure. \"This discovery honors and encourages us to proudly protect and promote our heritage.\"",

      "A Dutch court last year handed down lengthy jail sentences to three of the main suspects in the murder, sentencing the organizer of the hit to 30 years, while two other men received 28 years. Three other men received sentences of between 10 to 14 years for complicity in the murder.",
      "The latest suspect, born in Curacao but who had Dutch nationality, has been behind bars on the island since 2014.",

      "The celebrity journalist then moved into television, where he ran his own crime program called \"Peter R. de Vries, Crime Reporter.\"",

      "But the court last year ruled that since Taghi was not part of the trial, a definite link could not be established between that case, known as Marengo, and the de Vries murder trial.",

      "During the 2022 trial for two of the suspects, close-circuit television images showed de Vries being shot. The court saw images at a distance of de Vries crossing the street, a figure running behind him and then the moment when the journalist was shot and fell to the ground.

    "story": [
      "Dr. Nick Norwitz, a study leader and independent researcher at the University of Oxford, discusses the surprising findings of a new study on the link between ketogenic diets and heart disease risk.",
      "Researchers have discovered an experimental medication that significantly reduces a cholesterol-like particle that can increase the risk of\u00a0heart attacks and strokes.",

      "Elevated Lp(a) cannot be modified with lifestyle changes, and has been called \"one of the last untreatable frontiers of cardiovascular risk\" by Cleveland Clinic, who led the study.",
      "LOW-CARB KETO DIET MAY NOT RAISE HEART DISEASE RISK, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "This new research confirmed earlier findings showing that the experimental drug \u2014 lepodisiran, made by Eli Lilly, who funded the study \u2014 can \"silence\" the main gene responsible for synthesizing Lp(a).",
      "(Other experimental gene therapies with a similar mechanism of action are also in development, according to Cleveland Clinic.)",
      "Researchers have discovered an experimental medication that significantly reduces a cholesterol-like particle that can increase the risk of\u00a0heart attacks and strokes. (iStock)",
      "The findings were published in The New England Journal of Medicine and were also presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology on March 30.",
      "What to know about Lp(a)",
      "Lipoprotein(a) levels are elevated in approximately 20-25% of people worldwide, according to the American Heart Association.",
      "This equates to approximately 64 million people in the U.S. and 1.4 billion people globally.",
      "Lp(a) shares similarities with another lipoprotein that doctors target to reduce the risk of heart disease, known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) \u2013 often referred to as \"bad cholesterol.\"",
      "HEART DISEASE RISK HIGHER FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE THESE UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE HABITS",
      "But lipoprotein(a) is more prone to plaque buildup and clots in the arteries than LDL, according to lead author Steven Nissen, M.D., chief academic officer of the Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic.",
      "\"Lipoprotein(a) is an independent risk factor for heart disease that is largely determined by genetics \u2014 that is, it is inherited,\" added Dr. Deepak L. Bhatt, director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, told Fox News Digital. (He was not part of the study.)",
      "Lipoprotein(a) levels are elevated in approximately 20-25% of people worldwide, according to the American Heart Association.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Lp(a) is primarily determined by differences in one gene, while LDL cholesterol levels are influenced by multiple genes.",
      "\"That's a very big difference, and LDL has a much larger environmental component,\" Nissen noted.",
      "\"Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for heart disease that is largely determined by genetics.\"",
      "Diet, exercise and weight loss can help decrease LDL levels, but they do not have an impact on Lp(a) levels, experts say.",
      "And unlike LDL, which can be reduced with medications like statins, there are currently no approved drug treatments that lower Lp(a).",
      "\"There is no approved pharmacotherapy for lipoprotein(a) by regulatory authorities in any country in the world,\" Nissen confirmed.",
      "Study design",
      "The researchers performed a clinical trial of 320 individuals from Argentina, China, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the U.S. from Nov. 11, 2022, to April 17, 2023.",
      "The participants were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or one or two subcutaneous injections of lepodisiran.",
      "Diet, exercise and weight loss can help decrease LDL levels, but they do not have an impact on Lp(a) levels, experts say. (iStock)",
      "The normal level of Lp(a) is less than 75 nanomoles per liter and the average level for people in the trial was about 250 nanomoles per liter, Nissen told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"They were very high \u2014 more than three times the upper limit of normal,\" he added.",
      "WHEN MEASURING HEART ATTACK RISK, ONE IMPORTANT RED FLAG IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED, DOCTORS SAY",
      "After one injection of the highest dose, participants showed a nearly 100% reduction in levels of lipoprotein(a) at six months.",
      "Those who received a second dose at six months maintained an almost 100% reduction at the one-year mark.",
      "In other words, the therapy removed virtually all lipoprotein(a) from the blood, according to Nissen.",
      "Unlike traditional cholesterol, which doctors typically monitor over time, lipoprotein(a) only needs to be checked once in a lifetime. (iStock)",
      "Cardiologists say these findings may ultimately help treat millions of Americans who have elevated levels of Lp(a).",
      "\"The results are very impressive,\" Bhatt said.",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The researchers noted that there were no major safety concerns, but 12% of participants reported mild reactions at the injection site.",
      "The study had only a few Black participants \u2014 a population that needs more research, as they are more likely to have elevated lipoprotein(a) concentrations than White persons, according to previous studies.",
      "(To address this concern, the researchers are enrolling many more Black patients in their larger phase 3 clinical trial.)",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Another limitation was that only two doses of lepodisiran were administered in the trial, so the effect of more doses is not known.",
      "The study also did not show that reducing Lp(a) levels also reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes, outside experts noted.",
      "The European Society of Cardiology and the National Lipid Association in the U.S. both recommend that all adults check their Lp(a) levels. (iStock)",
      "\"A phase 3 trial testing the clinical impact of this drug is needed to see if the large reduction of Lp(a) translates into lower rates of heart attack,\" Bhatt said.",
      "Nissen confirmed that the phase 3 trial to address this question is already underway.",
      "\"Whatever your level is when you're 24 years old is the level when you're 64 years old \u2013 it doesn't change, because it's genetic.\"",

      "Identifying a home as a primary residence versus a secondary home or vacation home comes with financial incentives, Debbas explained, because banks will offer lower interest rates to primary residences, with homeowners less likely to default on such loans compared to a second home.",
      "\"As a real estate attorney, we represent every major lending institution in the country,\" he said. \"And a common underwriting requirement for banks is to solidify what the use of the property is going to be, meaning, is it a primary residence, second home or investment property.\"And the reason banks do that is that clearly there's a higher rate of default when it comes to investment properties and second homes as opposed to primary residences.\"",

Now, would they have given you a loan if it were a second home? Potentially, but the difference is the interest rate would be significantly higher.\"",

      "Debbas explained that five-unit properties are identified as commercial properties, which would require a commercial loan that has higher interest rates than a residential loan. However, the banks carry the burden of confirming whether a building is commercial or residential.",
      "\"If the borrower has the ability to tell the bank or convince the bank that it's actually four units, it's to their financial benefit,\" he said. \"Now, when you look at a certificate of occupancy, certificate of the occupancy is issued by the Department of Buildings, which tells you the legal use of the building.",

      "THIS IS HOW TO PROTECT YOUR CREDIT AND BANK CARDS FROM GETTING HACKED",
      "Some credit cards include RFID chips that make contactless payments easy and convenient. However, this same feature can be exploited if someone with the right equipment gets close enough to scan your card without your knowledge. Using\u00a0RFID-blocking gear such as a wallet, card sleeve or passport holder is a simple and affordable way to prevent this type of theft. These items are widely available and effective at blocking unauthorized scans.",
      "Limiting the number of cards you bring reduces the risk of your wallet being lost or stolen. Ideally,\u00a0take only one or two credit cards that you plan to use during your trip. Keep any backup cards in your hotel safe and store a secure digital record of your card details in a\u00a0password manager. This can be helpful if you need to cancel or replace a card while you\u2019re abroad. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Most credit card companies offer instant notifications through their mobile apps. Turning on transaction alerts ensures you\u2019ll be notified the moment your card is used, allowing you to spot suspicious activity quickly. If your card issuer offers the ability to lock your card directly from the app, enable that feature as well, so you can act immediately if anything looks off.",
      "Public Wi-Fi at airports, hotels and caf\u00e9s is rarely secure. Avoid entering credit card information or logging into banking websites while on these networks, unless you're using a virtual private network (VPN). A reliable VPN encrypts your internet traffic and protects your data from prying eyes on shared networks.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Gently wiggle the card reader or look for anything that seems loose, bulky or out of place. When possible, use ATMs inside banks or secure buildings instead of freestanding machines, which are easier for thieves to target.",
      "Many credit card apps now allow you to temporarily lock your card with a single tap. If you're not planning to use a card for a day or two, consider locking it until you're ready to make a purchase. This simple habit adds an extra layer of protection. If someone tries to use the card while it\u2019s locked, the transaction will be declined.",
      "Apple Pay and\u00a0Google Pay provide an additional level of security by creating unique, one-time-use codes for every transaction.

      "What is 3D digital twin technology in sports?",
      "At its core, 3D digital twin technology creates a virtual replica, or \"digital twin,\" of a real-world environment or event. In the context of sports, this means replicating entire stadiums and live games with incredible accuracy. For example, Arcturus places cameras around the edges of baseball stadiums to capture real-time action and generate a 3D digital clone of the game. Fans can then pinch, zoom and view the game from any angle in the stadium, offering an unprecedented level of immersion.",

By creating virtual replicas of players using biomechanical and physiological data, teams can simulate match scenarios, track fatigue levels and prevent injuries with precision. Coaches can use digital twins to simulate different game strategies without risking player fatigue or injury.",

Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or even lab records, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the LSC breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the LSC breach, including Social Security numbers, insurance info and even medical IDs. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Keep tabs on your medical records:\u00a0The LSC breach included lab results, diagnoses and treatment data, making medical identity theft a growing concern. Someone could use your info to get care or prescriptions under your name. Regularly review your medical records and insurance claims. If anything looks off, report it to your provider or insurer immediately.",
      "6. Watch out for suspicious snail mail: After the LSC data breach, attackers may use your stolen information to send official-looking letters by post, posing as healthcare providers, insurers or even government agencies. These letters might ask you to call a number, visit a website or provide additional personal information. Just because it arrives in your mailbox doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s trustworthy. Always verify the source by looking up contact details independently and avoid responding directly to unsolicited mail asking for sensitive information.",
      "7. Use multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable\u00a0MFA on all critical accounts like email, banking apps and healthcare portals. Look in account settings under \"security\" or \"login options\" to activate it. MFA ensures that even if hackers have your password, they\u2019ll need another verification method (like a text code) before accessing your account.",
      "8. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year, or more frequently if you're concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "9. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "11. Secure your online accounts: Review security settings across all important accounts (email, especially). Update recovery options like backup emails or phone numbers and log out of devices you don\u2019t recognize. Compromised accounts can lead hackers straight into other parts of your digital life.",
      "By following these steps, you\u2019ll be taking comprehensive action against potential threats stemming from the LSC data breach.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The LSC breach isn\u2019t just another headline. It\u2019s a serious reminder of how exposed we really are. When personal, medical and financial information is stolen, the consequences are immediate and long term. Identity theft, fraudulent transactions and misuse of health data are all very real risks. If your information may have been affected, act now. Review your records, freeze your credit and be vigilant.",

    "story": [
      "From face recognition to dynamic lock, there are options you may be unfamiliar with.",
      "Windows 11 is the latest and greatest operating system from Microsoft, but it has its flaws, so much so that even four years after its release, some people are sticking with older versions. Windows 10 remains the operating system of choice for many, even though Microsoft has shifted its focus entirely to Windows 11. In fact, the Redmond-based company will end security updates for Windows 10 this October.",
      "If that\u2019s not enough to push you toward upgrading, the latest news might be. The 240 million Windows 10 users are vulnerable to dozens of security vulnerabilities, six of which are reportedly already being exploited by bad actors.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "A person typing on a Windows laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Critical Windows 10 security flaws exploited",
      "The vulnerabilities in question were part of a recent Microsoft Patch Tuesday update, a monthly release where the company addresses security flaws. In this case, six specific exploits were identified as being actively used by hackers to target Windows 10 systems. These exploits are particularly alarming because they are already in the wild, meaning attackers are leveraging them to compromise systems before all users have had a chance to update their devices.",
      "The affected population, estimated at 240 million, refers to users whose PCs cannot upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations, such as lacking TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) or other system requirements.",
      "The six exploits include a mix of flaws that allow hackers to achieve various malicious outcomes, such as executing arbitrary code, escalating privileges to take full control of a system or bypassing security features.",
      "For example, one exploit might overload system memory to overwrite critical data (a buffer overflow), while another could allow attackers to access sensitive information by exploiting a flaw in the Windows Kernel. These vulnerabilities are especially dangerous because they can be triggered remotely or through seemingly innocuous actions, like opening a malicious file or mounting a compromised virtual hard disk.",

      "Microsoft has released patches to address these issues, and\u00a0America\u2019s Cyber Defense Agency has urged users to update their systems immediately, ideally by this month, or risk severe consequences. The agency even suggested turning off unpatched computers as a precaution. Updating to the latest Windows 10 patch is the simplest and most effective way to protect against these exploits right now.",
      "However, a bigger problem looms later this year. Microsoft will officially end free security updates for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025. After that, systems running Windows 10 will no longer receive critical security patches, unless users enroll in Microsoft\u2019s Extended Security Updates (ESU) program.",
      "This ESU program will be available to individual users for the first time and will cost $30 per device for one additional year of updates. It\u2019s designed to give users more time to transition, especially those who can\u2019t upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations. While this offers a temporary reprieve, it's not a long-term solution; the ESU program will only extend support for a limited time (typically three years in enterprise settings) and prices may increase annually.",
      "The scale of the problem remains significant. Millions of devices lack the hardware requirements for Windows 11, such as TPM 2.0 and newer CPUs, making the shift costly or impractical for some. Analysts warn this could contribute to a surge in electronic waste, unless recycling and repurposing efforts improve dramatically.",

Strong antivirus software can act as a second line of defense, detecting and neutralizing malware that exploits vulnerabilities before they cause harm. Look for solutions with real-time protection and frequent updates to tackle emerging threats. While this won\u2019t fix unpatched system flaws after October 2025, it can reduce risks from common attack vectors like phishing or malicious downloads.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3) Plan for the future:\u00a0The clock is ticking on Windows 10\u2019s security updates. If your hardware can\u2019t handle Windows 11, weigh your long-term options. Buying a new PC might be inevitable, but you could also explore alternatives like Linux, which offers free, secure operating systems (e.g., Ubuntu or Linux Mint) that run well on older hardware.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The road ahead for Windows 10 users is anything but smooth. With critical vulnerabilities emerging and official support coming to an end, millions are being pushed into a difficult decision. They can upgrade their hardware, pay for temporary patches or continue using increasingly vulnerable systems. As October draws closer, the risks will only increase. Updating your system is essential, but it\u2019s just a short-term measure. Now is the time to start preparing for what comes after, before the window of protection closes for good.",

      "Picture this: A dairy barn full of cows being milked, fed and cleaned up after, but there\u2019s no farmer in sight. Sounds a bit unusual, right? Well, it\u2019s not as far-fetched as you might think. Thanks to cutting-edge agricultural robotics, this kind of scene is becoming more common. At this farm, a team of autonomous robots is taking care of all the essential chores, completely changing the way dairy farming works.",

      "The rise of robotic dairy farms",
      "In a dairy barn managed by robots, cows can choose to be milked whenever they like, which is often more frequent than the twice-a-day schedule in traditional farms. This increased frequency is more comfortable for the cows and can lead to roughly a 10% increase in milk production.",
      "Lely, established in 1948 in the Netherlands, introduced its first Astronaut milking robot in the early 1990s. Since then, the company has developed various robotic systems that assist with cleaning, feeding and ensuring cow comfort. Today, Lely is focused entirely on robots for dairy farms, with approximately 135,000 units deployed worldwide.",

      "Traditional dairy farms rely heavily on human labor for repetitive daily tasks, which can take up about a third of a farmer's workday. These tasks include milking, feeding and manure management. Lely's robots automate these tasks, allowing dairy farmers to focus on other aspects of their business and enjoy a more flexible lifestyle. The Astronaut A5 milking robot, for example, uses a laser-guided robot arm to clean the cow's udder before attaching teat cups. It also monitors milk output and collects data on 32 parameters, including milk quality and cow health indicators.",

Lely believes that robots will enable small dairy farms to continue scaling sustainably. While dairy robots are expensive, Lely argues that they pay for themselves over time through increased milk production and lower labor costs. Other robots, such as the Vector mobile robot for continuous feeding and feed pushing, and the Discovery Collector, a robotic manure vacuum, further reduce labor needs.",
      "AI also plays a critical role in optimizing feeding systems, reducing waste and improving sustainability, which are key factors in modern dairy farming.

This includes modifying the robots' design and programming, such as adding contact-sensing bumpers and relocating emergency stop buttons. Engineers have also had to consider the social dynamics within a herd. For example, the Discovery Collector robot had to be programmed to assert its dominance within the herd to avoid being blocked by cows.",

      "Flexibility and sustainability",
      "Many dairy farms are adopting robots to decrease their dependence on hired help and gain greater flexibility. Farmers report that robots have allowed them to prioritize their personal lives and spend more quality time with their families. Robots also contribute to the long-term viability of smaller dairy farms by making the profession more appealing to younger generations. The reduced workload and commitment associated with robotic farming make it a more attractive career path.",

What makes quantum internet even safer is a phenomenon called entanglement. When qubits become entangled, they stay connected no matter how far apart they are. If one qubit is changed, the other changes instantly. Any attempt to disrupt the entanglement, such as hacking, would immediately alert both people communicating.",

      "While the potential of quantum internet is exciting, there are still hurdles to overcome. The technology is still in early development, with most experiments confined to research labs. Unlike the traditional internet, quantum networks need specialized equipment to keep signals strong across cities or even countries. Developing this technology requires massive investments and breakthroughs before quantum internet can become widely available. Another key challenge is the transition from today\u2019s internet to quantum internet.",
      "Since most existing technology is built for current networks, the shift won\u2019t happen overnight. Instead, hybrid systems that combine elements of both traditional and quantum communication can serve as a bridge, helping businesses, governments and everyday users to adapt without disrupting the current digital infrastructure.",
      "Despite these challenges, progress is happening. Major countries, including the U.S., are investing heavily in quantum research, and scientists have successfully demonstrated that the technology works. While it may take years before quantum internet reaches everyday users, these breakthroughs are laying the foundation for a safer, more private digital future.",
      "Ways to stay safe while surfing the internet",
      "While quantum internet is a ways away, it's important to stay safe on the internet we use today. Until that new technology arrives, here are a few ways to protect yourself online.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Until a more secure internet becomes available, it's important to use tools that help protect against everyday threats like unsafe links and malware. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Be careful when using public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi remains one of the easiest ways for hackers to access your data.\u00a0The temptations and risks of free Wi-Fi make it important to think twice before connecting to an unsecured network. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts or entering personal details unless you're using a VPN or other form of encryption.",
      "3) Use a VPN: Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Until more advanced security becomes mainstream,\u00a02FA is a simple way to protect your accounts. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second step to log in, like a code sent to your phone. For even stronger protection, consider using a\u00a0security key that plugs into your device.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Quantum internet represents a large shift in how we think about communication, privacy and security. By harnessing the power of physics, it promises to create a network that\u2019s faster, more secure and more private than anything we\u2019ve seen before. While the technology is still emerging, it has the potential to change the internet forever.",

      "A new way to explore the outdoors",
      "CORLEO isn\u2019t your typical off-road vehicle. Instead of wheels, it has four robotic legs that move independently, allowing it to handle uneven ground like rocks, grass and steep inclines. Kawasaki says the design was inspired by the skeletal structure of lions. The name CORLEO is derived from Cor Leonis, the brightest star in the constellation Leo. Riders mount it like they would a horse, but instead of gripping handlebars or using pedals, you control CORLEO with your body. Lean forward, and it moves ahead. Shift your weight to the side, and it adjusts its steps accordingly.",
      "CORLEO is also environmentally friendly. It uses a battery paired with a 150cc hydrogen engine. The hydrogen engine generates electricity, which is stored in the battery. Kawasaki has been pushing hydrogen-powered vehicles for years, and CORLEO is their latest effort to combine sustainability with innovation.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt \u2018CyberGuy\u2019 Knutsson says a tech support scam used a fake Windows Defender pop-up, tricking the victim to call and download software.",
      "All Windows PCs come with a built-in security feature called Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC), which helps prevent unauthorized software from running by allowing only trusted applications.",
      "However, despite its purpose, hackers have discovered several ways to bypass WDAC, exposing systems to malware, ransomware and other cyber threats.",
      "As a result, what was once considered a strong layer of defense may now serve as a potential vulnerability if not properly managed.",

      "Image of a Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) bypass?",
      "Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) is a security feature in Windows that enforces strict rules about which applications can run. It helps block unauthorized software, but researchers have found ways to bypass these protections.",
      "Bobby Cooke, a red team operator at IBM X-Force Red,\u00a0confirmed that Microsoft Teams could be used as a WDAC bypass. He explained that during Red Team Operations, they were able to get around WDAC and execute their Stage 2 Command and Control payload.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To find and fix these security gaps, Microsoft runs a bug bounty program that rewards researchers for reporting vulnerabilities in WDAC and other security components. However, some bypass techniques go unpatched for long periods.",
      "Teams Electron API Surface revealed. (IBM)",
      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS",
      "How hackers bypass Windows Defender Application Control",
      "One of the key ways attackers get around WDAC is by using Living-off-the-Land Binaries, or LOLBins. These are legitimate system tools that come pre-installed with Windows, but hackers can repurpose them to execute unauthorized code while avoiding security detection. Since these tools are trusted by the system, they provide an easy way to slip past defenses.",
      "Some bypass techniques involve DLL sideloading, where attackers trick legitimate applications into loading malicious DLLs instead of the intended ones. Additionally, if WDAC policies are not enforced properly, attackers can modify execution rules to allow unauthorized software to run.",
      "Hackers also use unsigned or loosely signed binaries. WDAC relies on code signing to verify an application\u2019s authenticity. However, attackers sometimes exploit misconfigurations where loosely signed or unsigned binaries are mistakenly allowed, letting them execute malicious payloads.",
      "Once an attacker bypasses WDAC, they can execute payloads without being flagged by traditional security solutions. This means they can deploy ransomware, install backdoors, or move laterally within a network without triggering immediate suspicion. Since many of these attacks use built-in Windows tools, detecting malicious activity becomes even more difficult.",
      "WINDOWS DEFENDER VS ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE: FREE PROTECTION FALLS SHORT",
      "Image of a Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID",
      "3 ways you can protect your PC from WDAC hackers",
      "Since this attack exploits a vulnerability within WDAC, there is little you can do to fully protect yourself. It is up to Microsoft to fix the issue. However, here are three best practices you can follow to reduce your risk.",
      "1. Keep Windows updated:\u00a0Microsoft regularly releases security updates that patch vulnerabilities, including those related to WDAC. Keeping Windows and Microsoft Defender up to date ensures you have the latest protection against known threats. If you\u2019re not sure how to do that, see my\u00a0guide on how to keep all your devices and apps updated.",
      "2. Be cautious with software downloads:\u00a0Only install applications from trusted sources like the Microsoft Store or official vendor websites. Avoid pirated software, as it can come bundled with malicious code that bypasses security protections like WDAC.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Based on the report, it does not appear that hackers require user interaction to bypass WDAC. The methods described suggest that an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities without direct user input, especially if they already have some level of access to the system.",
      "However, in real-world scenarios, attackers often combine such exploits with social engineering or phishing to gain initial access. For example, if an attacker gains access through a phishing attack, they might then use WDAC bypass methods to execute further malicious payloads.",
      "So, while direct user input may not be necessary for some bypass techniques, attackers often use user actions as an entry point before exploiting WDAC vulnerabilities. The best way to avoid becoming a victim is to have a strong antivirus software installed.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) offers a valuable layer of security, it isn\u2019t foolproof. Hackers are actively developing and using WDAC bypass techniques to exploit gaps in system defenses. Understanding how WDAC bypass works is essential to protecting your devices. By keeping your software up to date, using trusted applications, and relying on reputable security tools, you can significantly lower your risk.",

This is a 12-year-old who watched her mother be brutally killed by Mr. Sanders. Then, he kidnapped her and traveled halfway across the United States to rural Catahoula Parish in Louisiana, where he shot this 12-year-old three times in the head and once in the chest with a 22-caliber rifle and then slit her throat with a homemade knife.\"",

      "Rodgers, considered one of the greatest signal-callers in league history, played his first 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers, leading the franchise to a Super Bowl victory in 2011. He was named the NFL's most valuable player four times and was a 10-time Pro Bowler.",

      "BROOMFIELD, Colo. \u2014 A Colorado man was convicted Thursday of killing his wife after stalking her while posing as her ex-boyfriend.",
      "Jurors reached the verdict against Daniel Krug, 44, a day after beginning deliberations. They found him guilty of all four charges he faced \u2014 first-degree murder as well as two counts of stalking and one count of criminal impersonation.",
      "As soon as the verdict was read, a police officer put handcuffs on Krug, who was wearing a gray suit and sitting with his lawyers. Krug is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday. He faces a mandatory sentence of life without parole.",
      "Krug\u2019s parents sat behind him as the verdict was read in the quiet courtroom. The family of his wife, Kristil Krug, sat on the other side of the courtroom.",
      "With his marriage to Kristil Krug falling apart, prosecutors said Krug decided to play \u201cpuppet master\u201d by scaring his wife and then trying to win her back by protecting her from the fake stalking, uniting them against a common threat.",
      "Kristil Krug, a biochemical engineer, kept a log tracking the increasingly threatening texts and emails that suggested she was being watched. As police investigated the messages, prosecutors said Daniel Krug began to realize that he could face criminal charges and started plotting how to kill his wife to silence her and because she didn\u2019t want to be with him anymore.",
      "Prosecutors said he waited for her to return to their suburban Denver home on Dec. 14, 2023, after taking two of their children to school and then knocked her unconscious and stabbed her in the heart.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t love her. He hated her. Think about what he did to her,\u201d Senior Deputy District Attorney Kate Armstrong said during closing arguments Wednesday.",
      "At the time of the killing, the ex-boyfriend was an eight-hour drive away in Utah, where he was living, according to investigators.",
      "The defense stressed there was no physical evidence linking Daniel Krug to the violent killing, noting that there was no blood found in his car or his clothes, which his daughter said were the same he was wearing when he drove her to the bus stop that morning. None of Daniel Krug\u2019s DNA was found at the scene, though partial DNA from an unknown person was found on her neck, the defense said.",
      "Daniel Krug\u2019s lawyers alleged that sloppy police work had failed to keep Kristil Krug safe before she was killed and then bungled the investigation into her death. The detective who investigated the stalking that Kristil Krug had first reported in October 2023 was lazy and incompetent, they said. The defense also stressed that police failed to test Kristil Krug\u2019s phone for fingerprints even though they alleged Daniel Krug sent texts from it after killing her.",
      "Shortly after the time when authorities said Krug killed his wife, he was at his usual coffee shop buying his morning latte. He complained that he had been given an iced drink instead of a hot one and waited for a replacement. During closing arguments, defense attorney Phillip Geigle questioned whether that is something a \u201ccold-blooded killer\u201d would bother to do.",
      "Prosecutors said that he wanted to be seen as \u201ccool as a cucumber\u201d getting his regular morning coffee before heading to work and also likely planned to wear gloves so he would not leave any DNA linking him to the killing.",
      "According to investigators, the email account that was used to send messages to Kristil Krug was created on the computer network at Daniel Krug\u2019s workplace. A burner phone used to send some of the texts, purchased with a gift card registered to Daniel Krug, was often found to have been in the same general location as his phone, Armstrong said.",
      "Three of the home\u2019s surveillance cameras, which Kristil Krug\u2019s mother said she installed because of the recent stalking, were not recording when she was found, according to Daniel Krug\u2019s arrest affidavit. The one in the garage was covered with tape. The defense said the tape also had DNA from an unknown source.",
      "Prosecutors say Daniel Krug told police that he thought the ex-boyfriend was to blame for her killing. But after police confirmed that man was at home in Utah when his wife was killed, he said maybe Kristil Krug was having affairs, they said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always the husband,\u201d Armstrong quoted Daniel Krug as telling detectives as she said he rolled his eyes."

      "On his return he was spotted by local fishermen, who informed the authorities and Polyakov was arrested in Port Blair, an archipelago nearly 750 miles east of India\u2019s mainland."

      "The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia amid accusations that the administration has been giving short shrift to deportees\u2019 due process rights, and after President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance have complained those protections are hampering their efforts at mass deportations.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The administration is challenging a judge\u2019s order that it \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Abrego Garcia, who the Justice Department has acknowledged should not have been sent to a prison in his native El Salvador because of an immigration judge\u2019s 2019 order barring such action.",
      "It\u2019s part of a larger running battle between the Trump administration and the courts. The administration has stretched existing law with new executive orders and novel legal theories, and a number of federal courts have acted to rein it in \u2014 with Trump and allies then firing back in the court of public opinion, accusing the judges of overstepping their authority.",
      "\u201cThe relief the government is requesting is both extraordinary and premature,\u201d U.S. Circuit Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III\u00a0wrote in Thursday\u2019s unanimous decision by a three-judge panel.",
      "The government\u00a0\u201cclaims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.\u201d",
      "The administration downplayed the lack of due process in its filing to the appeals court. It contended that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim he denies, and is legally eligible to be deported to El Salvador since Trump has designated the gang a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "What due process for Abrego Garcia would look like",
      "The administration did not go through formal procedures, which would involve filing a motion to reopen Abrego Garcia\u2019s deportation case, immigration law experts told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThere would be a process. ICE would need to move to reopen his removal case, provide due process, have a hearing,\u201d said Rebekah Niblock, an immigration lawyer at the Catholic Legal Immigration Network.",
      "There would also be litigation over his alleged membership in MS-13.",
      "\u201cThat is an issue that a judge would have to rule on and would be litigated heavily,\u201d said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "An immigration judge determined Abrego Garcia was a member of the gang in 2019, but the evidence that judge relied was recently questioned by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, the federal judge in Maryland presiding over the mistaken deportation case.",
      "Xinis noted that Abrego Garcia has no criminal convictions in the U.S. or El Salvador, and said the evidence meant to support allegations of gang affiliation \u201cconsisted of nothing more than his Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie, and a vague, uncorroborated allegation from a confidential informant claiming he belonged to MS-13\u2019s \u2018Western\u2019 clique in New York \u2014 a place he has never lived.\u201d",
      "Wilkinson, who was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, pointed to that dispute in his ruling.",
      "\u201cThe government asserts that Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and a member of MS-13. Perhaps, but perhaps not. Regardless, he is still entitled to due process. If the government is confident of its position, it should be assured that position will prevail in proceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Trials would take '100 years'",
      "In posts on social media this week, Trump and Vance have complained that courts giving due process protections to deportees are slowing the administration\u2019s efforts to ramp up deportations.",
      "On Truth Social, Trump criticized court proceedings around immigration, saying it would take \u201cmany years of long and tedious trials to fly each and every one of them back home. Where is the JUSTICE here???\u201d",
      "Trump was referring to an order Monday from a federal judge in Massachusetts blocking the administration\u2019s plan to bring an early end to a program allowing hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela and Nicaragua to temporarily live and work in the U.S. legally. The judge said the participants had been accepted into the program on a case-by-case basis, and therefore any revocations should be done on a case-by-case basis as well.",
      "\u201cBased on the Court System, that would take approximately 100 years,\u201d Trump complained.",
      "In a series of X posts on Tuesday, Vance suggested the scale of the issue outweighed due process concerns.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s a useful test: ask the people weeping over the lack of due process what precisely they propose for dealing with Biden\u2019s millions and millions of illegals. And with reasonable resource and administrative judge constraints, does their solution allow us to deport at least a few million people per year?\u201d he wrote in one post.",
      "Limited due process for immigrants",
      "Legal experts say that immigrants who try to enter the U.S. illegally or who have lived in the country without legal status are already at a legal disadvantage and have limited due process rights.",
      "That applies especially to those who are detained at or close to the border, where they can be quickly ejected. While long-term U.S. residents could assert due process rights, that doesn\u2019t mean they will, as often they do not have legal assistance.",
      "That situation has gotten worse as the Trump administration has cut resources for groups that represent refugees, Niblock noted.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not much help out there,\u201d she said.",
      "Contempt and more due process concerns",
      "Concerns over due process have been an issue in other court cases against the administration. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday found probable cause to hold\u00a0the administration\u00a0in contempt for disregarding an order halting deportation flights to El Salvador last month.",
      "Judge James Boasberg had issued the order after lawyers for immigrants the administration accuses of being in the Tren de Aragua gang said their clients, who denied they\u2019re members, were being deported without notice or the opportunity to challenge the administration\u2019s allegations against them under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The Supreme Court later vacated the order on jurisdictional grounds, but held that \u201cAEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.\u201d",
      "In a court filing Thursday, attorneys for the detainees said the administration was not giving detainees a \u201creasonable\u201d amount of time, and had said at a hearing in Texas last week \u201cthat it was not ruling out the possibility that AEA removals would resume with only 24 hours\u2019 notice.\u201d",
      "Boasberg said the government could purge his contempt by taking custody of the people it deported despite his order and giving them hearings so they can challenge the allegations against them. The \u201cGovernment would not need to release any of those individuals, nor would it need to transport them back to the homeland\u201d for that process,\u00a0he\u00a0wrote.",
      "The Justice Department is appealing his ruling.",
      "The administration\u2019s appeal in the Abrego Garcia case is challenging Xinis\u2019 ruling directing federal officials to try to secure his return, and her order for them to turn over more information on what steps have been taken to get him back \u2014 language that predominantly mirrored a Supreme Court ruling last week that largely upheld her prior order.",
      "Wilkinson said the administration should comply with Xinis\u2019 order.",
      "\u201cWhile we fully respect the Executive\u2019s robust assertion of its Article II powers, we shall not micromanage the efforts of a fine district judge attempting to implement the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cWe yet cling to the hope that it is not na\u00efve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos. This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time,\u201d Wilkinson added.",
      "The administration also asked Xinis to pause her ruling while it appeals. She rejected that request Thursday."

      "Mangione's attorneys have filed a motion seeking to preclude the death penalty, arguing in part that Bondi is seeking it as \u201ca political stunt.\u201d",
      "They cited Bondi's announcement about seeking the death penalty, in which she said, \"I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump\u2019s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.\u201d",

    "summary": "Trump has paved the way for a sprawling, animated and consequential set of policy fights within the Republican Party over taxes, tariffs and more.",
    "story": [
      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, Jonathan Allen explores how the major policy fights in Washington are happening within the Republican Party. Plus, after we noted yesterday that outspoken progressives are seeing an influx of campaign cash, Natasha Korecki and Bridget Bowman dive further into how the anti-Trump 2.0 resistance is starting to find its footing.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "How Trump has paved the way for new GOP policy fights",
      "As they stare into the abyss of rising national debt, Republicans are starting to talk about the possibility of raising taxes on the wealthy.",
      "Yes, you read that right, and NBC News\u2019 Sahil Kapur and Peter Nicholas have the reporting to back it up.",
      "Since the days of George H.W. Bush\u2019s breaking his \u201cread my lips\u201d promise, Republicans have run for the hills any time a tax hike is mentioned. Now, that option is part of a sprawling, animated and consequential set of policy fights between the ascendent populist wing of the GOP and the grasping-for-relevance old guard conservatives.",
      "What happened? President Donald Trump. His eagerness to take both sides on certain issues \u2014 sometimes in a single sentence \u2014 allows him to maintain the dominant voice on public policy and makes it harder for his adversaries to pin him down. In his second term, fellow Republicans are starting to adjust.",
      "As long as they support him in the end, they are freer to take positions against one another \u2014 and party orthodoxy \u2014 before he makes a final call.",
      "It\u2019s not just on domestic taxes. Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again tariffs may be a threat to the economy and his long-term political success. But in the interim, they have upset traditional Washington partisan paradigms and blocked out coverage of other issues.",
      "While progressives Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez hold rallies across the country, bringing tens of thousands of people to rallies that accuse Trump of selling out the working class to line the pockets of the wealthiest people in the country, the MAGA wing of the GOP is rhetorically \u2014 and in some cases on a policy level \u2014 arguing for a stick-it-to-the-rich agenda.",
      "The dynamic is still nascent, but it\u2019s somewhat reminiscent of the mid-20th century era of Democratic dominance in Congress \u2014 when a party that was on both sides of civil rights, both sides of foreign policy and both sides of the distribution of benefits held all the power and had all the energy in policymaking.",
      "The cart, of course, should not be put before the horse. There are plenty of reasons to think that the GOP won\u2019t actually increase the tax burden on the wealthiest. After all, Trump is in the process of gutting the IRS, which already under-collects hundreds of billions of dollars in owed taxes, mostly from the rich.",
      "But for now, at least, the Trump model of triangulating against himself \u2014 and of fellow Republicans\u2019 following suit \u2014 is making it even harder for the Democratic minority to lock on a target and define its own agenda.",
      "Democrats draw on renewed energy in the fight against Trump",
      "In the red state of Montana on Wednesday, a crowd swelled for two political stars of the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who vowed to \u201cfight oligarchy\u201d in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "That night, Rep. Nikki Budzinski, D-Ill., had her largest-ever town hall crowd, with many people wanting to know how Democrats were pushing back.",
      "And hours later, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., traveled to El Salvador to bring attention to a case at the center of the party\u2019s arguments that Trump\u2019s immigration policies have gone beyond existing law and court orders.",
      "Those events of the last 24 hours point to a similar phenomenon: In ways big and small, the second-term resistance to Trump is growing stronger and bolder.",
      "The pushback is from not just politicians but also some of the powerful institutions that have come under attack by the administration. They include Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u00a0and Princeton, all of which refused to yield to a list of Trump demands that would overhaul hiring, disciplinary and other practices in the face of billions of dollars in federal funding freezes.",
      "While it is far from a full-fledged revolt, more of those being targeted by Trump\u2019s policies are putting up a fight now, compared with the universities, law firms and even Democratic politicians who bent his way in the first weeks and months of his term. Yet amid the bursts of resistance is a steady flow of appeasement by some of the country\u2019s most powerful institutions, such as major law firms that have struck deals with the White House \u2014 including five more last week \u2014 to collectively provide hundreds of millions of dollars in free legal work.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to harness anti-Trump energy as the party regroups from 2024 and refocuses on next year\u2019s midterm elections. But that could get complicated, as some of that anxiety is aimed at Democratic leaders.",

      "A U.S.-born American citizen was being detained at the request of immigration authorities Thursday despite an advocate showing his U.S. birth certificate in court and a county judge finding no reason for him to be considered an \u201cillegal alien\u201d who illegally entered Florida.",
      "Juan Carlos Gomez-Lopez, 20, was arrested Thursday evening by Florida Highway Patrol and charged under a state immigration law that has been temporarily blocked since early this month. Details of Gomez-Lopez\u2019s arrest and detention were first reported by the Florida Phoenix news site.",
      "After inspecting his birth certificate, Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans said during the hearing that \u201cthis is indeed an authentic document,\u201d but that she did not have jurisdiction beyond finding no probable cause for the charge.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s role is to enforce immigration laws that generally apply to noncitizens. American citizens are protected under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution from unreasonable search and seizure, arrest and detention.",
      "Nonetheless, he remains detained locally at ICE\u2019s request, said Thomas Kennedy, a spokesperson at the Florida Immigrant Coalition who attended Thursday\u2019s hearing.",
      "\u201cEverything tracks for him being sent to an ICE detention center,\u201d he told NBC News in a phone interview.",

      "Gomez-Lopez was in a vehicle with other passengers and was traveling to work from Georgia when they were stopped after entering Florida.",
      "A sweeping immigration law signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2023  makes it a state crime for an undocumented immigrant over age 18 to enter the state illegally.",
      "Gomez-Lopez was born in Georgia but lived much of his life in Mexico. His first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, the Florida Phoenix reported.",
      "His mother burst into tears when she saw her son virtually at his hearing, the news site reported.",
      "\u201cI felt immense helplessness because I couldn\u2019t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there,\u201d she told the Florida Phoenix.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s like this bureaucratic, dystopian nightmare of poorly written laws,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe are living in a time when this man could get sent to El Salvador because, what, is he going to be treated like a stateless person?\u201d",
      "Kennedy was referring to the hundreds of immigrants who have been sent by the Trump administration to an El Salvador megaprison after they were accused of being gang members under the wartime Alien Enemies Act. Families, attorneys and some U.S. legislators have not been able to have any contact with them.",
      "On Thursday night, Sen.\u00a0Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., confirmed he had a meeting in El Salvador with Kilmar Abrego Garc\u00eda, a man who had been living in Maryland for several years and who the Trump administration said it mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March. Van Hollen traveled there after Abrego Garc\u00eda had not been transported back to the U.S. despite a Supreme Court ruling ordering the Trump administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return."

    "story": [
      "Drake is expanding his legal battle with Universal Music Group over Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d claiming the rival rapper\u2019s Grammys success and Super Bowl performance further damaged his reputation.",
      "Both Drake and Lamar are signed to UMG, under different divisions. (UMG has no relationship to NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.) They engaged in a prolific diss track battle last year, with Lamar coming out on top in the charts.",
      "Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham, originally sued UMG in January, alleging\u00a0that it defamed him by spreading a \u201cfalse and malicious narrative\u201d when it promoted Lamar\u2019s diss track. The song\u2019s lyrics describe Drake as a \u201ccertified pedophile\u201d and a \u201cpredator\u201d who needs to be \u201cplaced on neighborhood watch.\u201d",
      "UMG filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit last month, arguing the claims are \u201cno more than Drake\u2019s attempt to save face for his unsuccessful rap battle\u201d with Lamar.",
      "In the amended complaint, filed Wednesday in federal court in New York City, Drake\u2019s lawyers claim\u00a0that the Super Bowl and the Grammys were \u201cprestigious and high-exposure events\u201d that \u201cintroduced new listeners\u201d to the allegedly defamatory song.",
      "\u201cNot only did streams of the Recording increase significantly following these two mega-cultural events, but threats against Drake and his family did as well,\u201d according to the amended lawsuit.",
      "Lamar took home five Grammy awards in February and went on to headline the halftime show a week later. He omitted the word \u201cpedophile\u201d during his performance, which averaged 133.5 million viewers, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Drake\u2019s complaint says the lawsuit is \u201cnot about\u201d Lamar but rather that it is aimed at \u201cthe music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\u201d Representatives for Lamar, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Drake\u2019s lawyers argue that by continuing to promote \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d UMG \"intentionally sought to turn Drake into a pariah, a target for harassment, or worse.\u201d",
      "The complaint alleges several instances of assailants\u2019 attempting to threaten Drake at his home last May in the days after the song was released, including one case of a gunman shooting and wounding his security guard.",
      "\u201cEven though UMG enriched itself and its shareholders by exploiting Drake\u2019s music for years, and knew that the salacious allegations against Drake were false, UMG chose corporate greed over the safety and well-being of its artists,\u201d the complaint says, adding that the label \u201ccontinued to fan the flames even after learning of the incitement to violence on May 7 and 8, along with the unrelenting vitriol towards Drake that has followed.\u201d",
      "Drake\u2019s attorneys claim that UMG leveraged its connections to platform Lamar\u2019s diss track at one of the biggest cultural events of the year.",
      "\u201cIt was the first, and will hopefully be the last, Super Bowl halftime show orchestrated to assassinate the character of another artist,\u201d the complaint says.",
      "The lawsuit also accuses UMG of conferring benefits and leveraging business relationships \u201cto secure Grammy nominations (and eventually wins)\u201d for \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "In a statement responding to the latest claims in the lawsuit, a spokesperson for UMG called it \u201cfrivolous and reckless.\u201d",
      "\u201cDrake, unquestionably one of the world\u2019s most accomplished artists and with whom we\u2019ve enjoyed a 16-year successful relationship, is being misled by his legal representatives into taking one absurd legal step after another,\u201d the statement said.",
      "\u201cIt is shameful that these foolish and frivolous legal theatrics continue,\u201d it added. \u201cThey are reputationally and financially costly to Drake and have no chance of success.\u201d",
      "A federal judge this month denied UMG\u2019s request to delay discovery in the case, thus allowing both parties to request sensitive documents that may be used as evidence.",
      "\u201cWith discovery now moving forward, Drake will expose the evidence of UMG\u2019s misconduct, and UMG will be held accountable for the consequences of its ill-conceived decisions,\u201d Drake\u2019s attorney Michael Gottlieb said in a statement.",
      "In response to the ruling, a spokesperson for UMG said: \u201cDrake will personally be subject to discovery as well. As the old saying goes, \u2018be careful what you wish for.\u2019\u201d"

      "\u201cIt was just me and like three other people that noticed at first, but we were walking in the opposite direction away from the union, so we started running. I just told everybody that I could see, stay away from campus,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI ran back to my apartment as fast as I could.\u201d",
      "The campus was initially locked down, with FSU sending out an alert urging students to take cover and to lock doors. Students have since been allowed to return to their residence halls but have been asked to continue to avoid the student union."

    "story": [
      "In the red state of Montana on Wednesday, a crowd swelled for two political stars of the left who vowed to \u201cfight oligarchy\u201d in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\u00a0That night, in a Midwestern swing district, a congresswoman saw her largest ever town hall crowd, with many wanting to know how Democrats were pushing back.",
      "And hours later, a Democratic senator traveled to El Salvador to bring attention to a case at the center of the party\u2019s arguments that Trump\u2019s immigration policies have gone beyond existing law and court orders.",
      "Those events of the last 24 hours point to a similar phenomenon: In ways big and small, the second-term resistance to Trump is\u00a0growing stronger and bolder.",
      "The pushback is not just from politicians, but also from some of the powerful institutions that have come under attack by the administration. These include Harvard University, MIT and Princeton, all of which refused to yield to a list of Trump demands that would overhaul hiring, disciplinary and other practices in the face of billions of dollars in federal funding freezes.",
      "While it is far from a full-fledged revolt, more of those being targeted by Trump\u2019s policies are putting up a fight now, compared to the universities, law firms and even Democratic politicians who bent his way in the first weeks and months of his term. Yet amid the bursts of resistance is a steady flow of appeasement by some of the country\u2019s most powerful institutions, such as major law firms that have struck deals with the White House \u2014 including five more last week \u2014 to collectively provide hundreds of millions of dollars in free legal work.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to harness anti-Trump energy as the party regroups from 2024 and refocuses on next year\u2019s midterm elections. But that could get complicated, as some of that angst is aimed at Democratic leaders.",
      "The shift comes as Democratic leaders have gotten a \u201cmassive earful\u201d from their base over the last couple of months from those upset with a lack of resistance to the administration\u2019s actions, said Leah Greenberg, a co-founder of Indivisible, an organizing force on the left.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re starting to see from some corners of higher education, of business, et cetera, is people recognizing that there\u2019s not a path, short of complete and utter subjugation, that will satisfy this administration,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cSo you might as well find some ground you\u2019re comfortable on and fight.\u201d",
      "Rep. Nikki Budzinski, a Democrat in a district covering parts of central and southern Illinois, said her constituents, including the roughly 400 people who poured into a Wednesday-evening town hall, are also fearful of fluctuating tariffs and what\u2019s ahead with Medicaid, Social Security and disability rights.",
      "In January, Budzinski said, \u201cI heard from a lot of Democrats, \u2018The news is just too hard to pay attention to, and I can\u2019t turn it on.\u2019 I think what I hear now is that people are paying attention, and they\u2019re trying to figure out what best ways they can be involved.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty is really kind of the killer. Your tariff\u2019s on one day, tariff\u2019s off another. A Social Security office closed. Does that mean that there\u2019s not going to be one in the county?\u201d\u00a0Budzinski added.",
      "Earlier this month, Americans flooded the streets of cities across the country as part of hundreds of \u201cHands Off\u201d protests against the administration.\u00a0Even former President Joe Biden, who has remained quiet in the face of repeated needling by Trump, held his first post-presidential public appearance Monday, warning of the administration\u2019s approach to Social Security.",
      "Greenberg described a post-election disconnect between the Democratic Party\u2019s rank and file and its \u201celites,\u201d who she said spent months second-guessing or sulking while law firms and universities yielded to Trump\u2019s early demands.",
      "From her standpoint, the burst of energy was immediate after Trump\u2019s election \u2014 and it\u2019s steadily rising.",
      "\u201cThe upsurge in regular people organizing came in the vacuum of a lack of elite leadership from both the political class and from the kinds of institutions that you think of as upholding norms around liberal democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the last couple of months, the breadth and the scope and the ferocity of the assault [from the Trump administration] has demonstrated to at least some of the folks in the elite circles that they actually have to push back.\u201d",
      "Democrats look to capitalize",
      "Democrats see the rising energy to push back on Trump as a positive sign for the party heading into next year\u2019s midterm elections, where they would need to net three seats to flip the House and four seats to flip the Senate.",
      "Small-dollar donations are ticking up, said Chris Korge, the Democratic National Committee\u2019s fundraising chair.\u00a0The most recently monthly campaign finance filings show the party pulling in more small dollars in January and February this year ($10.7 million) than during the same period in 2017 ($8 million) \u2014 just after Trump took office for his first term.",
      "\u201cDemocrats are starting to get a head of steam,\u201d Korge said. \u201cDonors, large donors are becoming less depressed about the past election and more enthused about where we go from here and what our prospects are.\u201d",
      "Korge said Trump has not come through with the economic panacea he promised but instead has wrought \u201ctotal chaos\u201d on the markets, emboldening Democrats to feel they can win back the message on the economy after struggling on economic issues in the 2024 campaign.",
      "The party, having already pushed back billionaire Elon Musk in a battle over a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat earlier this month, is eagerly looking forward to upcoming gubernatorial campaigns in Virginia and New Jersey this year, before the 2026 midterms. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Suzan DelBene of Washington pointed to recent special elections, in which Democrats have improved on the party\u2019s performance in November, as evidence that Democrats have the momentum.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen in just a few months that the public has already turned on Republicans and their record of broken promises,\u201d DelBene said.",
      "Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., who is co-chairing the DCCC\u2019s recruitment effort, told reporters at an event last week with the think tank Third Way that the committee has seen a \u201cflood of enthusiasm\u201d from potential candidates, including military veterans, former federal workers and small-business owners.",
      "Republicans say Democrats are overconfident. The National Republican Congressional Committee, the GOP\u2019s campaign arm focused on House races, recently said in a statement, \u201cVoters aren\u2019t buying it, and they know Democrats are too extreme, too unpopular, and totally out of touch.\u201d",
      "At the very least, Democrats figure to head into 2026 with a growing bench of candidates. The organization Run for Something, which launched after Trump\u2019s first election in 2016 and recruits candidates for state and local office, announced Wednesday that nearly 40,000 people had expressed interest in running for office since the November election.",
      "The group saw \u201cmajor spikes\u201d in interest after Trump\u2019s inauguration, as the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency sought to slash the size of the federal government, and after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., voted to advance a GOP-led government funding measure.",
      "Angst also takes aim at Democrats",
      "Schumer\u2019s vote, which drew the ire of his fellow Democrats,\u00a0underscored one potential complication of the burgeoning energy to take on Trump: Those feelings could also be directed at Democrats\u2019 own leaders.",
      "Democratic voters have been itching for their party to fight Trump. An NBC News poll conducted in March found nearly two-thirds of Democratic voters said they want Democrats in Congress to stick to their positions even if it leads to gridlock, and just one-third wanted their leaders to compromise with Trump \u2014 a complete reversal from Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "David Hogg, a DNC vice chair, warned that energy will inevitably lead to primary challenges against sitting Democratic lawmakers, and some younger Democrats have already launched campaigns against longtime incumbents. Hogg said he is looking to channel that angst by supporting challengers in deep-blue seats \u2014 instead of competitive districts that could decide the majority \u2014 as part of a new effort from his PAC, Leaders We Deserve.",
      "\u201cWith the approval rating we have right now, this is coming. It is going to happen,\u201d Hogg said, referring to the Democratic Party\u2019s low favorability ratings in recent polling. \u201cThe question is: Is it going to be productive or is it going to be total chaos that is very destructive? And I\u2019m trying to make sure that this is done productively. And that we\u2019re showing our base, too, that there is an effort to change and things are not staying the same, even if that does piss off some people in D.C.\u201d",
      "Hogg said his group will target lawmakers who are \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d and not sufficiently fighting Trump. He laid out examples of lawmakers who are successfully taking on Trump, in his view, noting New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201cFighting the\u00a0Oligarchy\u201d rallies; Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen\u2019s trip to El Salvador this week to investigate what the Trump administration said in court was a mistaken deportation; New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s record-breaking Senate speech; and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy\u2019s online videos.",
      "But Hogg also plans to support Democratic nominees in competitive districts, and he pushed back on critics who say his effort would divert resources from those races, pointing to the millions of dollars that flowed to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 campaigns as proof that the party\u2019s base will support candidates who push back on Trump.",
      "\u201cThe things that Democrats are struggling with are not fundraising,\u201d Hogg said.",
      "Asked if she was concerned about the efforts to challenge incumbents in primaries, DelBene said, \u201cDemocrats are united on taking back the majority in the House of Representatives, and that\u2019s the top focus of the DCCC. And what I would tell anyone who wants to be helpful, to donate, is to focus on the races where we can take back the majority.\u201d"

      "The episode was part of a special crossover with \u201cLaw & Order\u201d and \u201cSVU\u201d titled \u201cPlay with Fire.\u201d Stabler popped up near the end of the event on \u201cSVU.\u201d",
      "Chris Meloni tells TODAY.com he \u201cabsolutely\u201d sees his character, Stabler, as a protector, but that\u2019s not the only character he views in that role.",
      "\u201cI feel as though you have to give the caveat that does not diminish Mariska \u2014 Benson\u2019s own agency and toughness and street savvy,\u201d he says.",
      "Benson teams up with Lt. Jessica Brady (Maura Tierney), and their squads work together to solve some gruesome murders. The most recent victim is Detective Maria Recinos, whom Benson once saved when Recinos was just a young girl.",
      "They eventually start to suspect a fellow cop, Lt. Paul Gomez, who has been assisting along the way, to be responsible for the crimes.",
      "After Benson and Brady have a chat with Gomez, it seems he\u2019s also aware they are catching on to him.",
      "Benson goes to pick up her son from school and sees him beside a car talking to someone through the window.",
      "She asks Noah who he\u2019s talking to, and he responds, \u201cI don\u2019t know. This guy was trying to tell me to go into his car. I wasn\u2019t going to, though.\u201d",
      "Benson approaches the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle and knocks on the window asking who the driver is and why he\u2019s talking to her son. The car pulls away before she can get any sort of answer.",
      "She\u2019s clearly rattled by the threat to Noah and expresses these feelings to ADA Carisi (Peter Scanavino) and EADA Nolan Price (Hugh Dancy). It\u2019s another man, however, who eventually handles the threat.",
      "Enter her longtime partner, Stabler, who approaches the driver of the vehicle while he\u2019s using a urinal in the men\u2019s room. This isn\u2019t the first time Benson has called on Stabler to protect her son. In Season 24, she asked him to safely bring Noah home after a threat from a gang. Benson also said at the time there was no one she trusted more to keep her son safe than Stabler.",
      "Stabler takes the adjacent urinal and says, \u201cYou might not know me, but I know you \u2014 and not in a vague kind of way.\u201d",
      "Stabler continues to list off the man\u2019s name and life history before sliding over and slamming him up against the wall, noting he\u2019s aware Gomez \u201cowns\u201d the man.",
      "\u201cYou and I are just going to cut through the noise,\u201d Stabler continues, further pressing the guy into the wall.",

      "Amidst the flurry of shots included in the trailer, Austin's father, Gil (Aaron Ashmore), bangs on what looks to be an interrogation room table in anger, Paul (Scott Porter) hugs Georgia, Marcus (Felix Mallard) and Ginny almost kiss and Georgia asks someone, \"Don't you want to ask me if I did it?\"",
      "Meanwhile, Ginny attends a dance with her friends, a young Georgia (Nikki Roumel) pockets some cash in her bra, Ellen (Jennifer Robertson) is shocked about something and it\u2019s clear there is some sort of court proceeding (assumingly related to Georgia) going on.",
      "\"I'm not a bad person,\" Georgia says. \"It's all about perception.\"",
      "How did Season 2 end?",
      "After ups and downs in their relationship as Marcus battled a depressive episode, Ginny and Marcus broke up, opting to be friends instead. Although from the trailer, it seems like they may be a little more than that.",
      "Georgia finally confessed to her fianc\u00e9, Mayor Paul Randolph, that Gil (Austin's father) was blackmailing her after she framed him for fraud. While this was a huge step for Georgia \u2014 who barely trusts anyone \u2014 she still didn't confess all of her dirty secrets to Paul (like the murders she committed).",
      "Paul and Georgia ended up having a surprise wedding.However, it was interrupted by the police, arresting Georgia for the murder of Tom Fuller \u2014 Cynthia's husband. While Georgia did do this, she considered it a mercy killing after Cynthia confessed to her how hard it was prolonging death in hospice."

But just by the nature of it being live, it\u2019s not going to be a replica,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s more of an adaptation, if you will, but still keeping some of the things that make the show, the show. Then, because it\u2019s Netflix, they can add to it in different ways.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t encounter some bumps along the way. She reveals that she, the producers and the streamer spoke following the premiere about how to improve \u201cPop the Balloon Live\u201d going forward.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re all kind of finding our footing, because it does take on a different shape when it\u2019s live. So we\u2019re all like, \u2018Alright, did that work?\u2019 What I love about the producers and network (is) we\u2019re all on the same page in terms of refining and just keeping the show what we intended it to be,\u201d she explains.",

      "\u201cListen, I was in the heat of it,\u201d she replies. \u201cI said, \u2018This is not what we rehearsed. This is not what we practiced. This is not the show.\u2019\u201d",
      "She continues, \u201cI, on stage, had to let a couple people know, like, \u2018Hey, babe, this is not what we\u2019re doing.\u2019 But, it\u2019s live. We can\u2019t reset. We can\u2019t stop.

      "What did some of those conversations address? Well, Orji wants to make sure the show reflects some of the reasons she agreed to be the host: love and joy.",
      "She says, \u201cI love, love. I had conversations with the producers. I had a conversation with the network. I was like, \u2018What\u2019s the tone? Are we really going for love? Because that\u2019s why I would sign on. They were like, \u2018Yes, we want people to find their matches, if possible. But we also know that it\u2019s live. So we also want someone that can carry that aspect of the show, as well.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cThey all agree that\u2019s the tone of the show that they want. Obviously we cannot control what people say or do, but what I can do is make the pivots in real time,\u201d she explains.",
      "The \u201cInsecure\u201d star compliments Amuli and B.M., who are executive producers of the Netflix version.

I\u2019m going to be me. All I can be is myself, right? So if you want me to be a replica of someone else, all I can be is Yvonne Orji.\u201d",
      "Although she is not an executive producer on the series, the \u201cInsecure\u201d alum says she has talked to the producers about being involved with casting the contestants. Orji says she feels she'd be able to anticipate possible matches if she knew more about the cast ahead of time, though she says she'd stay away from trying to influence their decision. She adds that it was challenging seeing some contestants dismiss others too quickly when they could be a good fit.",
      "\u201cMy tagline for the show is, \u2018We listen, we don\u2019t judge, but I do have follow up questions,\u2019\u201d she says, laughing.",
      "Fans can tune in to see what changes are implemented and how Orji holds up to the next batch of contestants when new episodes of \"Pop the Balloon Live\" stream Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET / 5 p.m. PT."

That\u2019s truly just the world that I as a child I grew up through, and I think to give voice to that is an interesting callback for generations that may not have experienced that. I think the younger generations don\u2019t \u2014 I know don\u2019t have the lived experience I do.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all. No big deal. But I was like, oh, this is almost like reliving history, hearing history. You know, \u2018Smile, smile.\u2019\u201d"

      "\u201cLaw & Order: Organized Crime\u201d star Chris Meloni took Season Five into his own hands \u2014 literally.",
      "The actor, who also serves as an executive producer on the series, wrote the second episode of the new season, \u201cDante\u2019s Inferno,\u201d which premiered Thursday, April 17, on Peacock.",
      "(Peacock is part of our parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "One of the most unique elements of the hour is the series of dreams his character, Detective Elliot Stabler, has while in a coma. In Episode One, \u201cLost Highway,\u201d Stabler gets hit by a semitruck while in the driver\u2019s seat of his truck, which also has a little girl, Bunny, he rescued hiding out in the back seat.",
      "Stabler is undercover at the time of the accident while his team at the Organized Crime Control Bureau investigates a biker gang using trucking operations to transport weapons and drugs. There\u2019s also another layer to the madness, as some of the men involved appear to be sex trafficking young girls, which is why Stabler gets concerned when Bunny goes missing before he saves her.",
      "As the first episode rolls into the second, Stabler is wheeled into the hospital and experiences his first of many dream sequences. He\u2019s calling from his bed for a nurse in a scene that\u2019s clearly set decades earlier, based on visuals including the uniform on a police officer who walks by (a reference to Stabler\u2019s late father, maybe?). Then Stabler sees a bunny in the hallway before he hears a voice calling his name. The voice belongs to Capt. Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay), his former longtime partner at the Special Victims Unit. He calls for her, and her voice shouts back, \u201cI\u2019m here! I\u2019m here!\u201d Back in the real world, Benson actually is there, at Stabler\u2019s bedside while he\u2019s in a coma.",
      "\u201cI wrote it from, obviously, Elliot\u2019s perspective and what are the imageries that are rattling around in his noodle,\u201d Meloni tells TODAY.com of his thought process for crafting the script for the episode, \u201cand how much of it is the trauma?\u201d",
      "A second dream shows the girl he saved earlier, Bunny, telling him to find a missing woman, nicknamed \u201cSad Eyes.\u201d A later one again shows the old-school cop walking the halls and Bunny dead under a sheet on a table in the hospital (Benson later informs Stabler Bunny did die after the accident). In Stabler\u2019s final dream, he\u2019s in his hospital bed with Benson beside him staring at him intently. He asks her what\u2019s wrong, and she gets up and walks out of his room without answering.",
      "\u201cLiv, don\u2019t leave!\u201d Stabler shouts after her.",
      "\u201cMy intention was for each person to have their own intention,\u201d Meloni says when asked about the purpose of including Stabler\u2019s dreams and what they mean.",
      "\u201cI try not to spoon-feed, because I think in the end that\u2019s not as nourishing or satisfying for the person. I like it,\u201d Meloni adds. \u201cI like people to lean forward and go, \u2018OK, what the heck was that? And why?\u2019 And have, just, differing opinions about it.\u201d",
      "When pressed about if the throwback hospital and police uniform imagery is supposed to symbolize Stabler\u2019s father, Joe Sr. \u2014 who was also a cop and eventually took his own life \u2014 and the possible guilt associated with that relationship, Meloni jokes, \u201cGive me the answer! You can\u2019t handle the truth.\u201d",
      "He remains similarly vague about if Stabler\u2019s guilt increases with each dream, like how in Dante Alighieri\u2019s \u201cInferno\u201d the circles intensify the further he proceeds on his journey through hell. Stabler\u2019s final dream is about Benson, so could that mean he holds the most guilt about that relationship? He left her without any explanation or contact after over 12 years as partners at the Special Victims Unit before returning to her life after a 10-year absence.",
      "Meloni laughs and says, \u201cThese are all really good interpretations of it all. I feel as though if I were to confirm any of these \u2014 kind of like, you know, I\u2019m the spoiler-alert guy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI like it when other people interpret it and actually come back to me and give me theirs,\u201d Meloni says, adding he isn\u2019t intentionally trying to be coy.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you if there was a conscious message or mission,\u201d he explains. \u201cI wrote what felt right to me. \u2026 There was not a conscious \u2014 I didn\u2019t go like this: \u2018Ah, this is the road.\u2019 I just went, \u2018Oh, that feels good. That feels right.\u2019 You know, it\u2019s a feeling.\u201d",
      "Another reason Meloni wanted to write this episode was because Hargitay would be guest starring.",
      "\u201cI intentionally wrote this because when she and I are together, I inevitably rewrite it, and not out of \u2014 you know, just simply because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone alive that knows the relationship as intimately and as well as I do. Or she does,\u201d he says of his and Hargitay\u2019s characters, which have a history that spans over 25 years.",
      "\u201cI feel as though, the episode I wrote, it\u2019s Olivia that\u2019s able \u2014 she\u2019s the icebreaker that can almost break through his, where (Stabler\u2019s) at in his coma,\u201d Meloni says. \u201cIt\u2019s her voice that he hears.\u201d"

      "Grace, a Ukrainian orphan with dwarfism, had been adopted by the Barnetts in 2010, before they accused her of being a grown woman pretending to be an adult. The Barnetts had Grace tested and were able to legally change her birth certificate to show that she was born in 1989, the document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana stated.",

      "Hamas was withholding supplies from civilians \"in order to create an image of shortage,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein told NBC News on Wednesday without providing evidence.",
      "OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said the U.N. body's team on the ground described \"no evidence of diversion of aid.\" Etefa said the WFP also had not seen any evidence, adding that the organization did not experience any looting during the ceasefire.",
      "Hamas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusation. But Thursday, the militant group, which has faced protests calling for its ouster and an end to the war, accused Israel of committing a war crime by \"declaring the use of starvation as a weapon.\"",
      "Under international humanitarian law, parties of a conflict cannot use starvation of a civilian population as a method of warfare or deprive civilians of essential supplies as a legitimate means to subdue an enemy.",
      "Marmorstein previously denied that Israel is violating international humanitarian law with its blockade in a post on X, saying war parties are not obliged to allow aid in if  it is \"likely to assist the military or economic efforts of the enemy.\"",
      "The war in Gaza began after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, which killed 1,200 and saw around 250 kidnapped, according to Israeli counts. Israel's military offensive in the enclave since then has killed more than 51,000 people, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, which has been run by Hamas since 2007.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Data published by COGAT, the Israeli military's liaison with the Palestinians, shows that 25,200 aid trucks entered Gaza during the ceasefire, carrying more than 447,500 tons of aid into the enclave.",
      "Before the war began, around 500 trucks carrying food and other supplies were entering Gaza each day, according to the British Red Cross. This suggests that by prewar standards, the 25,200 trucks that entered during the ceasefire, according to COGAT's data, would likely be sufficient for around 1\u00bd months, a point reached this week.",
      "COGAT's database shows \u201cno data\u201d for aid entering the enclave between March 2 and April 16.",
      "Presented with the above data and asked to comment on the current aid situation on the ground, a spokesperson for COGAT told NBC News they could only confirm that more than 25,000 aid trucks had entered Gaza during the ceasefire. The spokesperson referred other questions related to the flow of aid to Israel's political leadership.",
      "In a report released this month, the WFP warned that humanitarian aid is the \u201cprimary food source\u201d for 80% of households across Gaza.",
      "Meanwhile, it said Israel\u2019s closure of crossings into the territory had \u201cexacerbated the fragility of the Gaza market,\u201d leading prices to soar between 150% and 700% compared with prewar levels, and by 29% to as much as 1,400% above prices during the ceasefire.",
      "As officials debate the reality of the situation on the ground, families across the enclave tell NBC News that they are struggling to survive.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been deprived of everything \u2014 food, water, school \u2014 even clothes,\u201d 12-year-old Hasan Abu Jazar told NBC News\u2019 crew on Monday after waiting in line in Al-Mawasi to gather water at an increasingly rare distribution point. \"I'm tired.\""

      "Recovered\u00a0from the phone of one of the paramedics killed, the footage which has been reviewed by NBC News shows an ambulance with its lights on and its emergency lights flashing.",
      "The vehicle was also marked with the Palestine Red Crescent Society\u2019s insignia. Lights on two other vehicles can also be seen flashing when soldiers opened fire on the convoy.",
      "The bodies of the killed workers were found buried in a mass grave in the southern Gaza Strip a week later.",

      "It did not obtain the autopsy result for one United Nations worker who was also killed.",
      "The reports showed that four had been shot in the head, while at least six were shot in their chests or backs, the newspaper reported, adding that 11 had gunshot wounds and had been shot multiple times.",
      "All 14 had been wearing either part of or their whole Red Crescent or Civil Defense uniforms at the time they were killed, the Times reported citing the reports about the autopsies. The autopsies were carried out between April 1 and April 5 by Ahmad Dhair, the forensic head of the Health Ministry in Gaza.",
      "Norwegian pathologist Arne Stray-Pedersen, who had been in Gaza earlier in March, subsequently reviewed photos of the autopsies and consulted with Dhair to write the summary report, the Times reported.",
      "NBC News has not been able to view the autopsy reports.",

      "Meanwhile, Cardon of the ICRC said the organization had not been granted access to Nassasra or any other Palestinian detainees since the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023 which saw 1,200 killed and around 250 people taken hostage, according to Israeli counts, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "More than 51,000 people have been killed in the Israeli military assault on the Gaza Strip since then, according health officials in the enclave, which has been run by Hamas since 2007.",
      "\u201cThe ICRC continues to call for access to all places of detention and reiterates publicly and privately that all detainees must always be treated humanely and with dignity,\u201d Cardon said."

      "According to a study from Barcelona\u2019s Universitat Pompeu Fabra, the number of Chinese students taking its translation and language science classes has risen 37% from five years ago, but China\u2019s formal educational resources for learning Spanish are far less developed than they are for learning English.",

      "The report says that around 2 in 3 translators get past the barriers of language and culture by swapping Spanish expressions with other Chinese imagery. The expression \u201cget stood up,\u201d for example, becomes \u201cfree[ing] a dove\u201d \u2014 a Chinese expression for breaking a promise.",

      "As with TikTok, certain words and phrases are redacted on Chinese social media, especially those containing sexual references, which regularly come up in reggaeton songs.",
      "While asterisks placed between Chinese characters by translators can help bypass this censorship, Mandarin phrases and characters are usually not separated by spaces as they are in English. That means starring out frowned-upon language can alter the meanings of lyrics and add an extra challenge to translators.",
      "Using cultural output such as French cinema or Italian cooking is a language learning method that has long been deployed by teachers the world over. Spreading reggaeton to China may be helping drive an interest in Spanish culture \u2014 at least at UPF anyway.",

      "Scientists have detected unique chemical patterns similar to those produced by Earth's algae and seaweed \u2014 raising the possibility of the presence of a warm ocean, perhaps teeming with life, on a planet 729 trillion miles away.",
      "The signs were found on K2-18b, an exoplanet planet orbiting a red dwarf star twice the size of Earth and 124 light-years away, according to a team of researchers led by Cambridge University. In the scale of the universe, the planet is a neighbor, sharing the Milky Way galaxy with Earth.",
      "They made their groundbreaking discovery after conducting a repeated analysis of observations made on K2-18b using NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope, detecting the chemical fingerprints that on Earth are primarily produced by microbial life, such as  algae, seaweed or marine phytoplankton.",
      "The findings are \"the strongest evidence yet that life may exist on a planet outside our solar system,\" Cambridge University said in a press statement Thursday.",
      "But the team \u2014 which published its study in the Astrophysical Journal Letters on the same day \u2014 remains cautious about what exactly the new findings can reveal about life beyond the solar system.",
      "\u201cIt is in no one\u2019s interest to claim prematurely that we have detected life,\u201d Cambridge astrophysicist Nikku Madhusudhan, who led the study, said during a news conference Tuesday.",
      "But, he added, \u201cWe want to remain open and do more experiments and theoretical calculations\u201d that can strengthen evidence that the molecule they detected, known as dimethyl sulfide (DMS), is present on the exoplanet that was discovered in 2015 by NASA\u2019s Kepler mission.",
      "Madhusudhan and his colleagues are building on their research from 2023, in which they detected carbon-based molecules in the atmosphere of K2-18b using the James Webb Telescope's mid-infrared instrument.",
      "That finding suggested that an almost identical molecule to DMS, known as dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), could also be present on the exoplanet \u2014 the first hint that K2-18b may be a hycean world, meaning one with a warm ocean abundant with life under a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.",
      "\u201cThe only scenario that currently explains all the data obtained so far from JWST, including the past and present observations, is one where K2-18 b is a hycean world teeming with life,\u201d Madhusudhan said.",
      "At the same time, he noted, there was still a 0.3% chance that their observation was a statistical fluke. \u201cWe need to be open and continue exploring other scenarios,\u201d he added.",
      "K2-18b is part of the \u201csub-Neptune\u201d class of nearly 6,000 exoplanets that have been discovered beyond the solar system since the 1990s.",
      "Finding evidence of life in the cosmos was the \"holy grail\" of exoplanet science, Madhusudhan said.",
      "Jake Taylor, an astrophysics and supernumerary fellow at Oxford University, also expressed caution over the findings while adding that they were \u201ca good first step\u201d in the search for biosignature gases, which are found in a planet\u2019s atmosphere and suggest the presence of life.",
      "\u201cI do not believe this is the biosignature detection that will revolutionize astronomy,\u201d he said, adding that DMS and DMDS molecules could also be produced abiotically, for example, in comets.",
      "Taylor added that a re-analysis of the data from the MIRI instrument, which has proven to be difficult among the exoplanet community in the past, along with an independent verification from a different team of scientists, would \u201cconvince me that these signals are real.\u201d",
      "Despite the unknowns that can only be answered by repeated observations and more theoretical and experimental studies, Madhusudhan said in a video, finding signs of life elsewhere was \u201cone of the most profound moments for me personally as well as an astronomer.\u201d",
      "He added that even suggestions of \u201ca new chemical process that is not produced by life,\u201d could be a monumental breakthrough, because, \u201chowever you put it, we are seeing new chemical processes on a planet that could be habitable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is, in my view, a transformational moment for finding our place in the universe as a species,\u201d Madhusudhan said.",
      "CORRECTION (April 17, 2025, 2:50 p.m. ET): Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated how far away K2-18b is. It is 729 trillion miles away, not 7 trillion miles."

      "France \u201csubjected the people of Haiti to a heavy financial indemnity, ... This decision placed a price on the freedom of a young nation, which was thus confronted with the unjust force of history from its very inception,\u2019\u2019 Macron said in a statement.",
      "It comes on the 200th anniversary of the April 17, 1825 document issued by King Charles X of France, which recognized Haiti\u2019s independence after a slave revolt \u2014 but also imposed a 150 million gold francs debt as compensation for the loss of France\u2019s colony and enslaved labor force.",

The spectrum of protections around the world ranges widely, from none at all in a number of countries to the existence of anti-discrimination protections and legal gender identity changes in some others.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at actions in some countries recently:",
      "United Kingdom",
      "The decision from U.K. Supreme Court revolved around the U.K. Equality Act, which bars discrimination along protected categories including age, race and sex. The court\u2019s ruling said that for the purposes of the act, the definition of a woman is someone born biologically female, which excludes transgender people. The unanimous decision means trans women can be barred from places like women-only changing rooms and homeless shelters and kept from groups like those offering medical or counseling services only to women. But the ruling also said the decision didn\u2019t mean transgender people were without any legal protection, because the Equality Act also recognizes gender reassignment as a protected category.",
      "Supporters of For Women Scotland, the group that brought the suit, celebrated the decision while advocates for transgender rights called it a setback.",
      "Hungary",
      "Rights for transgender people were restricted as part of a wider crackdown on LGBTQ communities in Hungary through an amendment to its constitution passed on April 14. The measure was proposed by the ruling coalition led by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and easily sailed through Hungary\u2019s parliament.",
      "Under the new amendment, the nation\u2019s constitution says there are two sexes, male and female. A government spokesman called it \u201ca clarification that legal norms are based on biological reality.\u201d It lays a constitutional groundwork for denying transgender people the ability to have their gender identities protected.",
      "Critics of the amendment said it was about humiliating and excluding people, and part of the ruling party\u2019s moves toward authoritarianism. The amendment also banned any public events from LGBTQ communities, which Hungary\u2019s government has strongly campaigned against in recent years.",
      "United States",
      "President Donald Trump has made a ban on transgender participation in sports a central focus of his administration. On Wednesday, he sued the state of Maine for not following an executive order he signed that banned transgender athletes from participating in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports.",
      "In a February meeting with state governors, Trump called out Gov. Janet Mills for not complying with his order, and threatened to pull federal funding, to which Mills replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d",
      "The administration\u2019s lawsuit calls for Maine to be ordered to tell its schools that it\u2019s prohibited for males to participate in athletic competition designated for females.",
      "Another of Trump\u2019s executive orders insists on a rigid definition of the sexes, rather than gender, for federal government purposes. The orders are facing court challenges. For its part, Maine sued the administration after the Department of Agriculture said it was pausing some money for the state\u2019s educational programs. A federal judge on Friday ordered the administration to unfreeze funds intended for a Maine child nutrition program.",
      "It\u2019s not just on the federal level; the question of legal protections for transgender people is a political issue in many American states as well. In twenty-six states, transgender girls from are banned from girls school sports.

      "Right now, there is little love lost between these transatlantic trading partners.",
      "The Italian leader is part of a relatively new crop of hard-right European leaders who have developed ties with the Trump administration. Sharing the president's predilection for hard-line anti-immigration policies, Meloni has gained a reputation as something of a Trump whisperer \u2014 the president has called her \u201ca real live wire\u201d and a \u201cfantastic woman.\u201d",
      "Meloni is just one of dozens of leaders scrambling to react to Trump\u2019s sweeping global tariffs. The E.U. faced a 20% tax on all goods sold into the United States, before an international market meltdown saw Trump pause these levies and instead impose a 10% rate across the board.",

It must act in unison with the 27-member trading bloc, which Trump has described as a competitor formed to \u201cscrew\u201d over Washington. He has made no secret of his enmity for the E.U. \u2014 as with many other international, multilateral organizations \u2014 and would prefer to deal one on one.",

      "Von der Leyen and Meloni had been in regular contact ahead of the trip, a spokesperson for the European Commission told Reuters. And even those centrist European figures who may disagree with Meloni on her hard-line domestic agenda are hoping that she will act as a bridge to Washington.",
      "\u201cEverybody hopes that, but nobody knows what she\u2019s going to be able to achieve,\u201d said Charles Grant, founding director of the Center for European Reform think tank.",
      "Despite her rapport with Trump, Meloni\u2019s Italy is to some extent also \u201cin the doghouse\u201d with Trump's team, Grant said, because of its low defense spending and trade deficit with Washington \u2014 two of Trump\u2019s biggest bugbears.",
      "Italy spends 1.49% of its gross domestic product on its military, lower than NATO\u2019s recommended 2% and only ahead of Canada, Belgium, Luxemburg, Slovenia and Spain, according to the alliance\u2019s latest figures. At the same time, it has a $45 billion trade deficit with the U.S., selling far more goods \u2014 mainly manufacturing and medical products, cars and wine \u2014 than it buys from the U.S.",
      "This also makes Rome particularly vulnerable to Trump\u2019s tariffs, with American trade making up around 10% of its total exports.",
      "\u201cWhether her personal charm can overcome these problems,\u201d Grant said, \u201cremains to be seen \u2014 but I\u2019m sure she will give it a go.\u201d",

      "On Wednesday, Trump inserted himself directly into negotiations between the Japanese delegation visiting Washington and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "Before stepping back from the brink, Trump initially slapped a 24% tax on all Japanese goods coming into the U.S. Nevertheless, the president's own glowing view of the talks \u2014 championing \"Big Progress!\" on Truth Social afterward \u2014 was echoed by Japan's chief negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa.",
      "\"One of the messages he was sending was that these negotiations with Japan are a top priority,\" Akazawa told reporters. \"What really impressed me was that he showed that if it\u2019s a task that\u2019s really important to you, is to show leadership and be directly involved.\""

      "MUNICH \u2014 A German doctor who cared for palliative patients was charged with killing more than a dozen people using a nursing service and then setting fire to some of their homes to cover up the crime, prosecutors said.",
      "The doctor, who was not named because of German privacy laws, was arrested in August on a warrant that was \"repeatedly amended\" as the investigation went on, the Berlin Public Prosecutor's Office said.",
      "Authorities mentioned four known cases at the time of his arrest last year. On Wednesday, the office announced it had filed 15 counts of murder with malice against the 40-year-old doctor.",
      "\"To commit the crimes, he is alleged to have administered an anesthetic inducer and then a muscle relaxant to his patients without medical indication and without their knowledge and consent,\" the prosecutor's office said.",
      "Death occurred within a few minutes, prosecutors said, because the muscle relaxant paralyzed the respiratory muscle and caused respiratory\u00a0arrest.",
      "All of the patients, ages 25 to 94, were using a nursing service the doctor worked with and died between September 2021 and July 2024.",
      "The first known death he was charged with was that of a 25-year-old woman who died on Sept. 22, 2021, in Berlin-Buckow. No details were provided.",
      "Some of the details German prosecutors provided included accusations that the doctor set fire to the patients' residences after having injected them with the drug cocktail.",
      "They include the death of an 87-year-old woman in Neuk\u00f6lln. He is alleged to have set fire to her apartment on June 11, 2024, but when the fire department arrived, paramedics were able to revive the woman at the scene, the prosecutor's office said. She died a short time later at the hospital.",
      "Weeks later, the doctor is alleged to have killed two people on the same day. The first was a 75-year-old man in his apartment on the morning of July 8 in Kreuzberg, prosecutors said.",
      "He then went to the apartment of a 76-year-old woman in Neuk\u00f6lln just hours later, prosecutors said.",
      "\"His attempt to set the apartment on fire is said to have failed, as the fire extinguished itself,\" prosecutors said. \"When he noticed this, he allegedly informed a relative of the woman and claimed that he was standing in front of her apartment and no one was responding to the doorbell.\"",
      "Berlin police and prosecutors have examined 395 cases, and suspicion was \"confirmed\" in at least 95. The prosecutor's office said 75 more investigations are still ongoing.",
      "At least 12 bodies have been exhumed, and five of those cases were included in the indictment, prosecutors said.",
      "The doctor has not made a statement, and an attorney has not been identified.",
      "Because of the severity of the allegations, prosecutors said they are seeking not only a conviction but also a \"lifelong professional ban and subsequent preventive detention.\"",
      "A German nurse, Niels Hoegel, was sentenced to life in prison in 2019 for murdering 85 patients. At one of his first trials, Hoegel said he intentionally put his patients in cardiac arrest because he liked the feeling of resuscitating them.",
      "At the time of his sentencing, he was believed to be the worst serial killer in German history.",
      "Carlo Angerer reported from Munich and Doha Madani from New York City."

      "The German government on Wednesday warned against Russian efforts to \u201cinstrumentalize\u201d events marking the 80th anniversary of World War II after the Russian ambassador to Berlin attended a local event in the eastern town of Seelow.",
      "The commemoration marked the Battle of the Seelow Heights, one of the final battles in the war before the Soviet army\u2019s march on Berlin and Germany\u2019s capitulation in May 1945. At least 30,000 Soviet soldiers were killed in one of the hardest fought battles for Russia\u2019s troops.",
