      "New Zealand's Associate Immigration Minister Chris Penk has overturned a visa refusal for the U_S_ conservative commentator Candace Owens, citing \u201cthe importance of free speech.\"",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand immigration official has overturned a ban on the U.S. conservative political commentator Candace Owens entering the country, citing \u201cthe importance of free speech,\" a spokesperson for the official said Thursday.",
      "Owens is scheduled to speak at events in several Australian cities and in Auckland, New Zealand, in February and March. But Australia\u2019s Immigration Minister Tony Burke barred her from that country in October, mentioning remarks in which she denied Nazi medical experimentation on Jews in concentration camps during World War II.",
      "The commentator, who has more than 3 million followers on YouTube, is accused by her detractors of promoting conspiracy theories and stoking antisemitism, and has ignited firestorms with her remarks opposing Black Lives Matter, feminism, vaccines and immigration.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s immigration agency refused her an entertainer\u2019s work permit in November on the ground that visas legally cannot be granted to those who have been excluded from another country.",
      "Owens appealed the decision to Associate Immigration Minister Chris Penk, according to a statement by Penk\u2019s office on Thursday. Penk, who is allowed discretion on visa decisions, granted Owens a visa \u201cafter considering representations made to him, including the importance of free speech,\u201d the statement said.",
      "She remains unable to enter Australia, however. Burke told reporters in October that Owens \u201chas the capacity to incite discord in almost every direction,\u201d citing her remarks about the Holocaust and about Muslims.",
      "Burke\u2019s spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.",
      "The Sydney-based promoter of the tour, Rocksman, welcomed the New Zealand reversal as \u201ca win for free speech, and for all those who believe in the importance of robust debate and open dialogue.\u201d",
      "The statement quoted Owens as saying that the reversal was \u201ca step toward a world where individuals are allowed to express their views without fear of censorship or government interference.\u201d",
      "Owens had promised Australian and New Zealand audiences a discussion of free speech and her Christian faith when she announced the speaking tour in August. The promoter is still selling tickets in both countries."

      "Cooler temperatures, calmer winds and a chance of rainfall in Southern California this week are forecast to help firefighters as they battle a wind-driven wildfire",
      "MALIBU, Calif. -- Cooler temperatures, calmer winds and a chance of rainfall in Southern California this week are forecast to help firefighters as they battle a wind-driven blaze in steep, rugged terrain that's driven thousands, including celebrities, from their homes in Malibu.",
      "The weather improved so much Wednesday that meteorologists said all red flag warnings, which indicate conditions for high fire danger and the notorious Santa Ana winds, were discontinued. The conditions allowed firefighters to have \u201ca lot of success\u201d despite the nearly inaccessible terrain, CalFire Assistant Chief Dusty Martin said.",
      "Still, some 20,000 residents remained under evacuation orders and warnings Wednesday evening from the blaze, dubbed the Franklin Fire, which was only 7% contained over 6 square miles (16 square kilometers).",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the blaze started. Officials said nine structures had been destroyed and at least six others had been damaged, though crews had only surveyed about 25% of the affected area, said Deputy Chief Albert Yanagisawa of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.",
      "Much of the devastation occurred in Malibu, a community of about 10,000 people on the western edge of Los Angeles known for its stunning bluffs and Zuma Beach, which features in many Hollywood films.",
      "Flames burned near horse farms, celebrities\u2019 seaside mansions, and Pepperdine University, where students were forced to shelter in place on campus for a second night Tuesday.",
      "Faculty members are determining how best to complete the semester, which ends at Pepperdine this week. Final exams were postponed or canceled, depending on the class, university spokesperson Michael Friel said. An early analysis showed little to no damage to structures on campus, the university said.",
      "Lonnie Vidaurri\u2019s four-bedroom home in the Malibu Knolls neighborhood is one of those destroyed. After evacuating to a hotel in Santa Monica with his wife and two young daughters, a neighbor called to tell Vidaurri that firefighters would need to break into his house.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty torched all around,\u201d Vidaurri said. He expects that the family\u2019s pet bunnies did not survive the fire, and that they lost most of their things. \u201cMy girls cried, obviously, but it could have been worse.\u201d",
      "Mimi Teller, a Red Cross spokesperson who worked in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, said many people arrived in their pajamas and were \u201cdefinitely in shock.\u201d",
      "\u201cNobody even had a backpack, it was, \u2018Get out now,\u2019\u201d Teller said. \u201cOne lady didn\u2019t even have a leash for her dog, she just scooped them up.\u201d",
      "Shawn Smith said he was asleep early Tuesday when someone knocked on his RV at 3 a.m. to wake him up to evacuate the Malibu RV Park.",
      "\u201cYou could see the fires rolling in, in over the canyon,\" he said. \u201cIt was like \u2018Holy crap, this is real.'\u201d",
      "He returned Wednesday to find that the RV park had been saved \u2014 firefighters stopped the flames just before they entered the area.",
      "\u201cWe got lucky,\u201d he said.",
      "Dick Van Dyke, one of many celebrities with homes in Malibu, said in a Facebook post that he and his wife, Arlene Silver, evacuated as the fire swept in. And Cher evacuated from her Malibu home when ordered and is staying at a hotel, her publicist, Liz Rosenberg, said Tuesday.",
      "The fire erupted shortly before 11 p.m. Monday and swiftly moved south, jumping over the famous Pacific Coast Highway and extending all the way to the ocean. It was propelled by Santa Ana winds, with gusts that reached 40 mph (64 kph). Santa Anas are notorious seasonal winds that blow dry air from the interior toward the coast, pushing back moist ocean breezes.",
      "Alec Gellis stayed behind Monday night to save his home in Malibu\u2019s Serra Retreat neighborhood from the flames. He used pumps in the home\u2019s swimming pool to help spray water over the house and surrounding vegetation, turning the lush area \u201cinto a rainforest.\u201d",
      "Gellis said there were flames within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the home on all sides. \u201cThe whole canyon was completely lit up.\u201d",
      "Utilities preemptively shut off power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses, starting Monday night, to mitigate the impacts of the Santa Ana winds, whose strong gusts can damage electrical equipment and spark wildfires.",
      "As of Wednesday afternoon, electricity was still out for roughly 600 Southern California Edison customers, and the majority of those were in Los Angeles County, said utility spokesperson Gabriela Ornelas.",
      "\u201cWe have been making significant progress,\u201d she said.",
      "Outages in Malibu were not included in that figure, Ornelas said. Some 3,300 customers in the Malibu area remained without power, due to safety shutoffs and for firefighter safety. Power was first shut off to most customers in Malibu on Monday evening.",
      "The Woolsey Fire that roared through the area in 2018, killing three people and destroying 1,600 homes, was sparked by Edison equipment. Asked Wednesday if Edison equipment was involved in the Franklin Fire, Ornelas referred all questions regarding the cause to fire officials.",

      "Woody Allen\u2019s former personal chef has filed a lawsuit against the filmmaker and his wife Soon-Yi Previn",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Woody Allen 's former personal chef claims in a lawsuit that the filmmaker and his wife fired him because of his service in the U.S. Army Reserves and questions about his pay, then \u201crubbed salt on the wounds\u201d by saying they didn't like his cooking.",
      "Allen and Soon-Yi Previn \u201csimply decided that a military professional who wanted to be paid fairly was not a good fit to work in the Allen home,\u201d private chef Hermie Fajardo said in a civil complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "Allen and Previn knew Fajardo would need time off for military training exercises when they and their home manager hired him as their full-time chef in June 2024 at an annual salary of $85,000, the complaint said. But he was fired the following month, soon after returning from a training that lasted a day longer than expected, it said.",
      "When Fajardo returned to work, \u201che was immediately met with instant hostility and obvious resentment by defendants,\u201d according to the lengthy complaint.",
      "At the time, Fajardo had been raising concerns about his pay \u2014 first that his employers weren't properly withholding taxes or providing a paystub, then that they shortchanged him by $300, according to the complaint.",
      "Allen, Previn and manager Pamela Steigmeyer are accused in the lawsuit of violating the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act and New York labor law, as well as causing Fajardo humiliation, stress and a loss of earnings.",
      "Representatives for Allen did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Fajardo said he was hired after being showered with compliments following a meal of roasted chicken, pasta, chocolate cake and apple pie he prepared for the defendants and two guests. According to the complaint, it was only after Previn fired him and he hired a lawyer that he was told his cooking was not up to par, a claim Fajardo said was untrue."

      "The new film \u201cSeptember 5\" is a fictionalized account of ABC\u2019s live coverage of the hostage crisis during the 1972 Munich Olympics",
      "News junkies will find much to love in \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d a fictionalized account of ABC\u2019s live coverage of the hostage crisis during the 1972 Munich Olympics. There are spirited debates about reporting with only one source, use of words like \u201cterrorism\u201d and what to do if violence breaks out during a live shot. There are negotiations with rival networks over satellite usage, disguises and fake badges made to get reels of 16mm film in and out of the locked down Olympic village and plenty of confused men (and a few women) trying to keep up with an ever-escalating situation.",
      "The film is a moment by moment retelling of how a group of sports broadcasters brought this story to the world in real time, despite the technical limitations and their own inexperience across a confusing 22 hours. Everyone came to the studio that night ready for breaking sports news, scores and pre-packaged interviews. Even that was going to be a test for the man running the control room for the first time. Geoffrey Mason, portrayed by John Magaro, was a 28-year-old coordinating producer. Someone wonders about his experience and is assured that he\u2019s covered minor league baseball games.",
      "But in the early hours of Sept. 5, 1972, eight members of a Palestinian group called Black September broke into the Olympic village and attacked the Israeli delegation killing wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg and weightlifter Yossi Romano. Some escaped, but nine others were taken hostage.",
      "While the tragedy of the Munich Olympics has certainly been told many times, writer and director Tim Fehlbaum saw an opportunity in the team behind the live broadcast. And he commits fully to staying in the newsroom, with all of its glorious old technologies, from the walkie-talkies they used to stay in touch and to taking time to show how they had to manually add text to the screens. He and his screenwriter were able to reconstruct the events almost minute-by-minute, which helped shape the screenplay.",
      "The players are many in this large ensemble. Peter Sarsgaard, who\u2019s looked right in a newsroom since \u201cShattered Glass,\u201d gives gravitas to Roone Arledge, then-president of ABC Sports, and Ben Chaplin is operations engineer Marvin Bader. Leonie Benesch is Marianne Gebhardt, a German-speaking interpreter who is the only person there able to understand the language of the country. She might be a bit of a composite who checks off a lot of boxes as both an entrepreneurial woman and a younger German offering perspective and insight into what this moment might mean for the country trying to put on a good front in the aftermath of World War II. An actor (Benjamin Walker) plays broadcaster Peter Jennings, and real archival footage of anchor Jim McKay from that day is used in the film.",
      "And while they all rise to the occasion, mistakes are made \u2013 including a rather big one at the end, following imperfect secondhand information from the Fuerstenfeldbruck airfield. They don\u2019t call it the first draft of history for nothing, after all, and it may be illuminating for audiences to see how it\u2019s handled.",
      "The film looks of its time, but it also feels fairly modern in its sensibilities which makes it always seem more like a re-telling than an in-the-moment experience. This may be to its detriment, yet it\u2019s still an undeniably riveting and compelling watch. The word thrilling doesn\u2019t seem appropriate, however. This is not \u201cApollo 13\u201d after all. The end is not a happy one.",
      "But at time when trust in the media is in crisis, this film is a great humanizer, reminding audiences that the media is far from a monolith, but a group of individuals under immense pressure to get the story right, get the story out and go back and do it again the next day.",
      "\u201cSeptember 5,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language. Running time: 94. Three stars out of four."

      "Kraven the Hunter can climb sheer walls like a gorilla, snatch fish out of streams like a bear and outrun deer. But there's something this slab of human beef can't do: Anchor a decent movie.",
      "Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the titular hero in \u201cKraven the Hunter,\u201d the sixth attempt in Sony's sputtering efforts to stock enemies for Spider-Man in movies that don't feature the webslinger. It's stuck in time, a callback to years ago when convoluted superhero origin stories were hot, and studios were dusting off even the poorest IP to tell stories.",
      "The screenplay by Richard Wenk, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway attempts to build the backstory of Kraven but soon loses interest and begins adding origin stories for third-rate bad guys, like The Rhino and The Foreigner, before introducing Chameleon right at the end, as if another Kraven movie is coming. (Sony, make it stop).",
      "Kraven, we learn, was born Sergei Kravinoff, the son of a Russian mobster who is turned into a superhero in a laughably weird plot twist. After being attacked by a lion on safari in Ghana, he's given a mystical botanical serum mixed with lion's blood and some mumbo jumbo about a tarot card. Clinically dead for three minutes, Kraven wakes up and is a world-class hunter. At least that's what he keeps saying.",
      "\u201cHunting people down is kind of my thing,\u201d he says. And later: \u201cI am the greatest hunter on the planet.\u201d Soon he's assassinating bad guys, but his motives aren't always clear. Hunting isn't exactly the same as infiltrating a high-security Siberian prison and killing a cartel boss.",
      "Director J.C. Chandor has a very lose hand, never shaping a taut narrative or reining in his actors and sometimes letting scenes just sort of drop. The additional villains distract from what seems to be a meditation on masculinity, and the special effects are jerky and ludicrous, like a fistfight between Kraven and The Rhino \u2014 somehow still wearing pants \u2014 that prompted some laughter at a recent screening.",
      "Part of the problem is that Kraven's powers aren't clearly defined. He\u2019s supposed to use animal skills to hunt, but are there many four-legged predators out there proficient with a blow dart or a pen to the trachea? He hates poachers but wears a tooth necklace and a leather bomber jacket.",
      "Kraven's eyes sometimes glow but with no apparent benefit other than to make Taylor-Johnson look even more badass as he glares into the camera, shirtless. He does have the ability to focus his attention on faraway objects, like when he spots a dropped cigarette and identifies it as a Turkish brand, a skill really low on the superhero must-haves.",
      "The movie suggests Kraven can communicate with animals, like Aquaman, but, if so, he's really, really bad at it. At best, they just sort of tolerate him. A tiger at one point jumps him and you can't blame it.",
      "Kraven has been shaped largely in opposition to his drug kingpin dad played by Russell Crowe, who has apparently watched \u201cThe Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle\u201d to nail his thick, comical Russian accent. \u201cNever fear death,\u201d he tells his son. \u201cMan who kill legend, become legend.\u201d",
      "Crowe's dad is a whisky-neat, all-testosterone, Tony Bennett-loving guy who detests any sign of weakness or kindness. He kills animals for fun, uses cocktail waitresses as human shields, doesn't pay ransoms because that makes him seem soft and dismisses his wife's suicide with the comment: \u201cShe was weak.\u201d",
      "If Crowe is cartoonish to the point of parody, Alessandro Nivola as a human-rhino hybrid makes him look like Sir Laurence Olivier. There are few instances of someone overacting more in a movie, unnecessarily adding an undercurrent of murderous, jokey psychotic to an already bizarre creation. The costume department has also dropped the ball here, giving The Rhino a small, stringed backpack that looks like it was found in the discount bins at Kohl\u2019s.",
      "Two good actors \u2014 Fred Hechinger as Kraven's younger brother and Ariana DeBose as his lawyer-ally \u2014 are left marooned in a movie that tumbles and slips to a unsatisfactory end. Is Kraven a hero or a villain? Who cares? Without Spider-Man, what's really the point, right?",
      "\u201cKraven the Hunter,\u201d a Sony Pictures release that hits theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cstrong bloody violence and language.\u201d Running time: 127 minutes. One star out of four."

Its gift shop rivals MoMA\u2019s, and there\u2019s a private garden and small restaurant. The museum is housed in the former home of industrial magnate Andrew Carnegie. Completed in 1902, the mansion was the first in the U.S. to have a structural steel frame, and one of the first in the city to have a residential Otis passenger elevator. It also was among the first homes to feature central heating. It is now LEED-certified and features other cutting-edge technologies.",

      "Now in its 41st year, the festival remains a place of discovery for independent cinema and emerging voices. Because of its January timing, it\u2019s also a gathering that arrives alongside the presidential inauguration. At the 2017 festival following Donald Trump\u2019s first inauguration, Main Street was taken over by a lively women\u2019s march full of celebrities. This year, no such plans have been announced.",
      "\u201cSundance as a festival has endured as a place to gather through inaugurations every four years, through different cultural moments and political moments,\u201d said festival director Eugene Hernandez. \u201cWe have a program that both engages with the world and also offers at the very same time an escape.\u201d",
      "Narrative films and documentaries premiering this year will touch on politicized topics like transgender stories and rights, \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws, incarceration, the right to die and book banning. But Sundance doesn\u2019t program by theme or have mandates about topics, said Kim Yutani, the festival\u2019s director of programming.",
      "\u201cI think what you see across the program are stories that are told with real authenticity. There\u2019s an innovative quality to many of these films,\u201d Yutani said. \u201cAnd the idea of free expression is something that is just as important to us.\u201d",
      "Documentaries are always a highlight at Sundance, where the conversation starts and often continues through the year into the Oscar race. Chernov follows his Oscar winning\u201c20 Days in Mariupol\u201d with \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d which looks at a Ukrainian platoon on a mission to liberate a village from Russian occupation.

      "Some performances that may have people talking into the year include: Benedict Cumberbatch in \u201cThe Thing with Feathers,\u201d about a father processing the loss of his wife; Joel Edgerton and Felicity Jones in \u201cTrain Dreams\u201d about a railroad day laborer from the \u201cSing Sing\u201d writer and director; John Lithgow and Olivia Colman as father and daughter in \u201cJimpa\u201d; Lopez in Condon\u2019s lush and vibrant musical adaptation; Lily Gladstone and Youn Yuh-jung in Andrew Ahn\u2019s \u201cThe Wedding Banquet\u201d; Josh O\u2019Connor in \u201cRebuilding\u201d; and Ben Whishaw and Rebecca Hall in \u201cPeter Hujar\u2019s Day,\u201d about New York\u2019s downtown art scene in the 1970s, from Ira Sachs.",
      "Over 40% of the films, selected from nearly 16,000 submissions, are directorial debuts, like Rachael Abigail Holder's \u201cLove, Brooklyn\u201d with Andr\u00e9 Holland.",
      "Yutani also highlighted Rashad Frett\u2019s \u201cRicky,\u201d starring Stephan James as a man trying to rebuild his life post incarceration. Another notable debut is \u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d which Eva Victor wrote, directed and stars in and Barry Jenkins produced.",
      "\u201cThere are scenes in this film that I have never seen before,\u201d Yutani said. \u201cIt was a real revelation.\u201d",
      "Film enthusiasts don\u2019t need to make the trek through the snow to pricey Park City to engage with the festival\u2019s offerings anymore. As with the past few years, about 60% of the program will be available online starting on Jan. 30. Tickets go on sale for individual films on Jan. 16 for the general public and even earlier for members.",
      "\u201cIt's a really a great opportunity to just get a sampling of what\u2019s to come in the new year for films that will travel far and wide to other festivals or make it into theaters down the line,\u201d Hernandez said.",
      "This will be one of the last years that the festival is primarily based out of Park City. Over the past year, the Sundance Institute has been exploring options for host cities starting in 2027. Finalists include Salt Lake City, Utah (with some events still in Park City), Boulder, Colorado, and Cincinnati, Ohio. An announcement is expected in the first quarter of 2025."

      "George Joseph Kresge Jr., otherwise known to TV watchers as the mesmerizing entertainer and mentalist The Amazing Kreskin, has died at age 89",
      "NEW YORK -- George Joseph Kresge Jr., who was known to generations of TV watchers as the mesmerizing entertainer and mentalist The Amazing Kreskin, has died at age 89.",
      "Kreskin's friend and former road manager, Ryan Galway, told The Associated Press that he died Tuesday at his home in Caldwell, New Jersey, where he spent much of his life. Galway said Kreskin had not been feeling well in recent weeks but otherwise did not provide a cause of death.",
      "Inspired by the crime-fighting comic book character Mandrake the Magician, Kreskin launched his television career in the 1960s and remained popular for decades, making guest appearances on talk shows hosted by everyone from Merv Griffin to Johnny Carson to Jimmy Fallon.",
      "Fans would welcome, if not entirely figure out, his favorite mind tricks \u2014 whether correctly guessing a playing card chosen at random, or, most famously, divining where his paycheck had been planted among the audience. He also hosted his own show in the 1970s, gave live performances and wrote numerous books, including \u201cSecrets of the Amazing Kreskin\u201d and \u201cMental Power Is Real.\u201d",
      "Although he was a talk show regular, one host wasn't amused by a Kreskin stunt. In 2002, he claimed that a UFO would appear over Las Vegas on the night of June 2, and added that he would donate $50,000 to charity if he was wrong. Hundreds of people gathered in the desert, in vain. Kreskin acknowledged to radio personality Art Bell that his prediction was a hoax, a way of proving that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks the year before had made people susceptible to manipulation. Bell called the ruse \u201clame, lame, lame\u201d and banned him from his show.",
      "Galway said that Kreskin continued to make live appearances well into his 80s, and only stopped earlier this year after injuring himself in a fall. Kreskin never married and left no immediate survivors.",
      "\u201cHis career was his life. That was his marriage,\u201d Galway said. \u201cHe was dedicated to his craft.\u201d",

      "If there was one thing that united us during a polarized 2024, it was likely the solar eclipse, a reminder of the awesome forces in our galaxy as one star disappeared, albeit briefly. Throughout the year, luckily, we saw the birth of more stars on Earth.",
      "Aaron Pierre announced himself in the taut, suspenseful thriller \u201cRebel Ridge,\u201d Nicholas Alexander Chavez frightened in the one-two punch of \u201cMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story\u201d and \u201cGrotesquerie,\u201d and GloRilla emerged as one of rap\u2019s most promising new voices.",
      "An appropriately named celestial being \u2014 Maleah Joi Moon \u2014 blew up on Broadway, while Myha\u2019la stamped her authority on the series \u201cIndustry,\u201d Adria Arjona soared in \u201cBlink Twice\u201d and \u201cHit Man,\u201d and Fred Hechinger ruled as a Roman emperor in \u201cGladiator II.\u201d",
      "All seven have ended 2024 with critical and popular attention and have been named The Associated Press\u2019 Breakthrough Entertainers of the Year. The latest class join a range of Breakthrough Entertainers anointed since 2017, including Ayo Edebiri, SZA, Rachel Zegler, Megan Thee Stallion and Daniel Kaluuya.",
      "\u201cIt felt like I was doing the thing that I was put on earth to do,\u201d says Chavez, who cut his teeth on ABC\u2019s \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d before starring in two Ryan Murphy shows this fall.",
      "GloRilla established herself as a proven hitmaker with \u201cWanna Be\u201d featuring Megan Thee Stallion and the breakout hit \u201cYeah Glo!,\u201d which earned two Grammy nominations.",

      "Moon has had quite a 2024 \u2014 winning a best actress Tony Award, going to the Met Gala and appearing on the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade. She calls all of the events \u201cwonderful sprinkles on an already really good cupcake.\u201d",
      "Arjona doesn\u2019t take it lightly that she is one of the few Latina actors able to play multidimensional roles. Her long-term dream is to see more varied Latin American stories on screen.",
      "\u201cI just hope that it gets less and less complicated and that the opportunities of playing real dimensional characters just doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d she says.",
      "Pierre \u2014 who once had an otherworldly part in SyFy\u2019s \u201cKrypton\u201d \u2014 will next showcase his vocal talents in \u201cMufasa: The Lion King.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want to always feel like I\u2019m growing, like I\u2019m shifting the needle. You know, I never want to feel stagnant. I never want to feel comfortable,\u201d he says.",
      "Hechinger, with his breakthrough role as Caracalla in \u201cGladiator II,\u201d is on a roll: He's in the Spider-Man spinoff \u201cKraven the Hunter,\u201d along with \u201cNickel Boys,\u201d based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.",

      "NEW YORK -- As a young woman, Maleah Joi Moon used to join the crowds outside Broadway stage doors to cheer the stars and maybe get an autograph. Now she's the one that people line up to meet.",
      "\u201cIt all feels like a very vivid dream, if that makes sense,\u201d says the New Jersey-born theater star. \u201cIf I could give anybody the advice that I needed then: Just trust your heart and just go do it.\u201d",
      "Moon has had quite a 2024 \u2014 winning a best actress Tony Award, going to the Met Gala, appearing on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d and \u201cToday\u201d show, and leading her musical at a rainy Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Moon will add to her trophies this month \u2014 being named one of The Associated Press\u2019 Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024.",
      "She calls it \u201cthe most vibrant and and dynamic year I think I\u2019ve ever had in my entire life.\u201d The whirlwind events after her Tony win \u201cwere all such wonderful sprinkles on an already really good cupcake.\u201d",
      "\u201cHell's Kitchen\u201d uses Alicia Keys songs to tell the semi-autobiographical story of 17-year-old Ali's coming of age in 1990s New York City. It has some of Keys\u2019 best-known hits, like \u201cFallin\u2019,\u201d \u201cNo One\u201d and \u201cGirl on Fire,\u201d as well as several new songs, including the terrific \u201cKaleidoscope.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlicia was very kind and very giving and very generous about how much of my own individuality I was able to channel into Ali,\u201d says Moon.",
      "\u201cThe show\u2019s just about love, to put it as simply as possible \u2014 the love story between a girl and her first love, the love story between a girl and her community, and, of course, to bring it all home, the love story between a mother and a daughter,\u201d she adds.",
      "Ali's mother is played by Tony nominee Shoshana Bean, whom Moon recalls asking for her autograph when she was a high school student watching Bean in \u201cWaitress.\u201d Now they're colleagues: \u201cIt\u2019s really insane. There\u2019s no words for it,\u201d says Moon.",
      "\u201cHell's Kitchen\u201d remains a hot ticket and critics have been impressed, with The New York Times labeling Moon \u201csensational\u201d and the AP calling her \u201ca jaw-dropping vocalist who is funny, giggly, passionate and strident, a star turn.\u201d",
      "For the Tony win, Moon, then 21, beat out stage veterans Kelli O\u2019Hara in \u201cDays of Wine and Roses,\u201d Maryann Plunkett in \u201cThe Notebook,\u201d Eden Espinosa from \u201cLempicka\u201d and Gayle Rankin from \u201cCabaret at the Kit Kat Club.\u201d",
      "Moon grew up not too far from the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood \u2014 in Franklin Township, New Jersey \u2014 with a burning ambition to be on stage and blessed with plenty of encouragement. She won the role of Dorothy for a school production of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d at age 10 and auditioned for \u201cThe Lion King\u201d and \u201cSix\u201d on Broadway. \u201cI kind of just caught the bug,\u201d she says.",
      "A few frustrating years followed, ending when she went through the grueling audition process to earn the lead in \u201cHell's Kitchen\u201d off-Broadway three years ago, her first professional role.",
      "\u201cI did lose sight, honestly, of what made me sparkle or what made me feel like I sparkled. But this process has been such a gift in the way that it has brought me back to what made me want to do theater to begin with,\u201d she says.",
      "What's next is anyone's guess. Moon says she'd love to do film, TV and more theater: \u201cThis process has kind of showed me just how much I can connect with people through art.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want to continue to see where my heart leads me,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s what got me here in the first place. And I hope that it carries me far in the future.\u201d",

      "Myha\u2019la is best known for playing a steely, manipulative investment banker on HBO\u2018s \u201cIndustry.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Myha\u2019la is best known for playing a steely, manipulative investment banker on HBO's \u201cIndustry,\u201d so the thought of her breaking into song seems antithetical.",
      "Yet the graduate of Carnegie Mellon\u2019s prestigious drama school says when she told friends and former acting teachers she landed a starring role in the series, they assumed it was a stage comedy or musical.",
      "\u201cNobody saw this trajectory for me. Not even me,\u201d Myha\u2019la told The Associated Press. \u201cThis has actually been sort of like a very happy accident and surprise that I have any career at all in TV/film. But I really, really love it and I think I\u2019m more suited for it than I thought.\u201d",
      "Although \u201cIndustry\u201d has been around since 2020, it\u2019s this year\u2019s third season that has received the most attention. Myha\u2019la sees this year as the cast and creators\u2019 \u201ccollective breakthrough,\u201d but it\u2019s her own work to find vulnerability in the unshakable, calculating, risk-loving Harper Stern that makes her one of The Associated Press\u2019 Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024.",
      "Myha\u2019la, 28, had expected and hoped to start her career in theater when she got the part in \u201cIndustry,\u201d and says she \u2014 and most of her castmates \u2014 have learned on the job. \u201cMy first time being #1 on the call sheet was a big deal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d all basically just come out of school and didn\u2019t know what we were doing.\u201d",
      "Though Harper regularly betrays friends and colleagues for personal gain, Myha\u2019la manages to reveal her soft edges: \u201cI don\u2019t think I could do her justice if I didn\u2019t find the humanity in her. I think, us as human beings, we hold multitudes and contradictions. We are the definition of a contradiction and that\u2019s what makes us human. So to find that in every character I play is the most important to me.\u201d",
      "Besides \u201cIndustry,\u201d she's acted in film with stars who have made an impression. She played Mahershala Ali\u2019s daughter in the Netflix science-fiction drama \u201cLeave the World Behind,\u201d with Ethan Hawke and Julia Roberts. Myha\u2019la says she was intimidated to work with \u201ca bunch of legends who\u2019ve been doing it way longer than I have.\u201d But she was pleasantly surprised at how they embraced her. \u201cThey treated me like I was just another person in the cast, not a child, not inexperienced, not a junior. None of that,\u201d Myha\u2019la remembered.",
      "Roberts has become a role model after Myha\u2019la observed how she treated everyone on set.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s incredibly patient. She doesn\u2019t behave like she\u2019s the icon that she is,\u201d the actor said. \u201cA generous, respectful person who has integrity. And I really love the way people responded to her. That\u2019s \u2026 the person I want to be. I want to come in and command a room with kindness and do my job really well.\u201d",
      "Doing her job well landed her roles in two notable films coming next year \u2014 \u201cSwiped,\u201d with Lily James starring as the founder of Bumble, and \u201cThey Will Kill You,\u201d with Zazie Beetz \u2014 in addition to the fourth season of \u201cIndustry.\u201d",
      "Myha\u2019la\u2019s personal life also blossomed this year when she got engaged to her boyfriend of four years. She loves telling the story of their ultimate meet-cute, which started when he direct messaged her on Instagram during the pandemic saying he was an \u201cIndustry\u201d fan.",
      "\u201cHe was incredibly invested in me, and not in a creepy way \u2014 in a really sincere, curious way. And I was so struck by that,\u201d she said.",
      "Grateful for the TV and film roles, Myha\u2019la still holds out hope that one day she\u2019ll make her Broadway debut. \u201cThe dream is not dead!\u201d she said with a smile.",

      "Aaron Pierre is closing out his big year on a literal high note",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Aaron Pierre is closing out his big year on a literal high note.",
      "After donning Malcolm X\u2019s distinctive browline glasses in the \u201cGenius: MLK/X\u201d series and getting his modern-day Rambo on in the Netflix action hit \u201cRebel Ridge,\u201d the 30-year-old English actor showcases his vocal talents in \u201cMufasa: The Lion King.\u201d",
      "To deliver as the titular regal lion, Pierre trained under Lin-Manuel Miranda in what he calls a \u201cwonderful singing boot camp.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy voice was doing things I never imagined it could do. I was hitting notes that I didn\u2019t think existed for my range,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cI\u2019m just really hoping the footage of me singing these songs doesn\u2019t come out because I\u2019m using all the techniques. Lin\u2019s like \u2018Throw the baseball!\u2019 So I\u2019m throwing the baseball trying to hit that high note.\u201d",
      "His Hollywood trajectory keeps going up: He's been named one of The Associated Press' Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024 and HBO announced in October that, opposite Kyle Chandler, Pierre will lead \u201cLanterns.\u201d",
      "That\u2019ll be the broad-shouldered, hazel-eyed actor\u2019s second DC Comics-based series, following his 2018-2019 run on SyFy\u2019s \u201cKrypton,\u201d which explored early days on Superman\u2019s home planet.",
      "As for Pierre\u2019s own origin story: He grew up in South London as the oldest of three, with childhood aspirations of being a track star and a criminologist. At 13, he joined a local theater troupe that performed in a warehouse, sometimes with just several people in the audience.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s actually where I learned some of my foundations. And one of those is irrespective of whether there is one person in the audience or 1,500 people ... you give the same performance, you give the same energy,\u201d Pierre said.",
      "Mark \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cMufasa\u201d director Barry Jenkins down as impressed by that energy. After watching Pierre play Cassio in the Globe Theatre\u2019s \u201cOthello,\u201d Jenkins cast him as Caesar in \u201cThe Underground Railroad.\u201d The small part grew and grew after Pierre arrived on set in Atlanta.",
      "\u201cI found myself just creating scenes for him,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cYou know, that character is in the show for much longer, much longer than his character exists in the narrative (Colson Whitehead\u2019s novel). He just keeps reappearing. And that\u2019s just because it was just a joy to work with him. And it was so clear that his presence was just immediately a part of the spiritual essence of the show.\u201d",
      "Counting Denzel Washington, James Earl Jones and Sidney Poitier as career role models, Pierre has been deliberate with his choices as he moves deeper into stardom. Art is the end goal \u2014 not fame or even fun, really. He hopes new fans go back to watch his 2022 indie \u201cBrother,\u201d about family bonds in 1990s Toronto.",
      "\u201cI always want my community to feel seen. I want them to feel respected. I want them to feel heard and understood. And I think the projects that I choose, that\u2019s my small contribution hopefully to that manifesting itself,\u201d he said.",
      "Pierre, now living mostly in Los Angeles, says he's been reaching out regularly to his mom back in London as he navigates the Hollywood circuit.",
      "\u201cAny time I speak with her, any time I\u2019m present with her, I feel safe. I feel reassured, I feel rejuvenated,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely call her phone a lot and she\u2019ll answer even if she\u2019s at work. Yes, I\u2019m 30 and 6-foot-3 and doing Terry Richmond in \u2018Rebel Ridge.\u2019 But like to me, I\u2019m still her baby and I\u2019m still her little boy and she always makes time for me, no matter what the situation.\u201d",
      "Both on and off-set, Pierre carries himself with a sense of purpose and seriousness. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything frivolous about Aaron Pierre, even in downtime, which is \u2014 I mean that as a compliment,\u201d Jenkins said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very intellectually engaged. But he also looks like a superhero. And there\u2019s a version of him that is only viewed that way. He\u2019s always diligent about protecting against that by doing things that are maybe a bit outside the box,\u201d Jenkins added. \u201cAnd for me, I just hope that he gets to grow and express himself in all the different ways that I think he\u2019s capable of.\u201d",
      "Indeed, when asked about his aspirations for future creative collaborators, the first name out of Pierre's mouth might surprise: \u201cWomen Talking\u201d writer-director Sarah Polley.",
      "\u201cIf you could put a word in for me, please,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cYeah, just to continue to work with filmmakers who inspired me and whose work I admire and respect and that will inevitably put me in a situation where I\u2019m forced to evolve and develop and grow and challenge myself as an actor. And I want to be doing that until the day that I decide to stop doing this,\u201d Pierre added. \u201cI want to always feel like I\u2019m growing, like I\u2019m shifting the needle. You know, I never want to feel stagnant. I never want to feel comfortable.\u201d",

      "\u201cI thought that looked really fun. And now I kind of feel like I work in the circus,\u201d Hechinger told The Associated Press, which selected him as one of its Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024.",
      "Levity suits the 25-year-old, despite his role as the tyrannical Emperor Caracalla in \u201cGladiator II.\u201d While his year \u2014 which has included the highly praised \u201cThelma,\u201d with June Squibb \u2014 has been \u201cfun and busy,\u201d Hechinger says, it also \u201cfeels in some ways like a reflective year at the moment.\u201d",
      "Hechinger kicked off his acting career in Bo Burnham\u2019s adolescent dramedy \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d released in 2018. In 2020, he found himself alongside Tom Hanks in the Paul Greengrass-directed Western \u201cNews of the World.\u201d But it was in 2021, playing Quinn Mossbacher in the first season of HBO\u2019s \u201cThe White Lotus,\u201d that he really made a splash.",

However, blending his private and public lives doesn\u2019t seem to faze him \u2014 within reason, of course.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all human and everyone should be treated as full humans. But I don\u2019t have any particular gripes at the moment,\u201d Hechinger says.",
      "Instead, he expresses gratitude for having the opportunity fulfill his dream.",

      "With his busy schedule, Hechinger has picked up a valuable lesson: Once filming wraps, it\u2019s time to let go. He acknowledges that after he\u2019s done his part, it\u2019s out of his hands. Although he doesn\u2019t have kids of his own, he compares finishing a movie to raising children and sending them off into the world.",

      "Now a member of Ryan Murphy's unofficial acting troupe, he starred in two of the creator's new series. First came the Golden Globe-nominated \u201cMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,\u201d for Netflix. Chavez played Lyle, the elder of two brothers serving a lifetime prison sentence for killing their parents, Jose and Kitty, in 1989.",
      "Chavez recognizes some parts of the series are \u201creally, really difficult to digest\u201d but points out that \u201cMonsters\u201d shows multiple sides to the story. The brothers have said they killed their parents out of self-defense, following sexual abuse by their father.",
      "\u201cTo my knowledge, it\u2019s the first TV show about the Menendez brothers that\u2019s told in that format,\u201d said Chavez, who prepared by watching old court footage. (The drama \u2014 and a new documentary \u2014 reignited public interest in the case, and a judge is weighing Los Angeles County prosecutors' request to resentence the brothers.)",
      "It was toward the end of filming \u201cMonsters\u201d that Murphy invited Chavez to join Niecy Nash in \u201cGrotesquerie,\u201d a double act that earned him a spot as one of The Associated Press\u2019 Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024.",
      "\u201cI was just so excited that he thought of me,\u201d said Chavez of the opportunity. \u201cI had studied Season 1 of \u2018Monsters.\u2019\u201d The opportunity to act with Nash, says Chavez, \u201cwas really kind of a wonderful way for me to close the loop.\u201d To get into character as Father Charlie, Chavez would listen to music: \u201cDon\u2019t Do Anything Illegal\u201d by Charles Manson \u2014 yes, that one \u2014 was on his playlist.",
      "Even before the Murphyverse, the 25-year-old had a loyal following from his work on ABC\u2019s \u201cGeneral Hospital,\u201d TV\u2019s longest-running soap. Chavez was selling cars during the pandemic when he auditioned for and got a part on the daytime show. He played Spencer Cassadine, a grandson of legacy character Laura of the Luke and Laura days. A year later, he won the 2022 Daytime Emmy Award for outstanding younger performer in a drama series.",
      "Of the training that actors get from soap operas, Chavez said the series helped him: \u201cIt\u2019s no joke when they talk about the memorization. I think that my heaviest day on set was something like 85 pages.\u201d",
      "A career in acting wasn't on Chavez's radar until he played Atticus Finch in his high school production of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just really, really enjoyed myself,\u201d recalled Chavez. \u201cI felt really free and present and immersed in the moment. It felt like I was doing the thing that I was put on earth to do.\u201d",
      "He remembers being told afterward by teachers that he should pursue acting as a career. Their encouragement stuck with him: \u201cNot many kids in Denver got told this. It\u2019s not really a part of the infrastructure the way that it is in LA or maybe in New York.\u201d",
      "Cooper Koch, who played Erik Menendez in \u201cMonsters,\u201d credits Chavez\u2019s layered performance in the series. He recalls a scene when his character confesses to the crimes in a therapy session. Lyle bursts through the door to stop him.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s sort of pleading with the doctor like, \u2018We\u2019re going to be OK, right? You can\u2019t tell anyone,\u2019\u201d Koch said. \u201cAfter we cut, me and Nick and our director of photography, Jason McCormick, sort of huddled up outside and we just started crying. It was so beautiful. And I really, really saw his (Lyle\u2019s) humanity and the lion mask kind of come off and he became this wounded child. It was so, so beautiful to witness.\u201d",
      "Next, Chavez has a role in the \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d reboot. He also says he would like to get cast in a comedy. More than anything, he just wants to be on set working.",
      "\u201cMy life feels whole and complete between the words \u2018action\u2019 and \u2018cut.\u2019 I live for those moments,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that is the purpose of my entire existence. I can\u2019t wait to see what the future holds.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Adria Arjona has transformed from the reserved girl growing up across Latin America to the captivating actor booking multiple scene-stealing roles",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Adria Arjona's mother is her biggest fan \u2014 and her fans' biggest supporter.",
      "While in town for Paris Fashion Week this year, Arjona recalls the moment her mother stood outside their hotel, tearfully thanking a crowd of fans who were armed with \u201cAndor\u201d and \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d posters and screaming \u201cAdria!\u201d",
      "\u201cShe didn\u2019t stop crying for 40 minutes,\u201d Arjona recounts. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Remember when you started? That\u2019s all you wanted was to be in a movie. All you wanted was to tell the story, and here you are.\u2019\u201d",
      "Arjona, 32, has transformed from the reserved girl for whom performing wasn't a sure bet while growing up across Latin America to the captivating actor booking multiple scene-stealing roles.",
      "\u201cI always thought I was going to be too shy to actually do it, but once I did it, something switched ... and then I became obsessed,\u201d Arjona says.",
      "Arjona has been named one of The Associated Press' Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024, but her television debut came a decade ago, with a couple spots on network procedurals. Since then, she's secured notable roles in projects like \u201cNarcos,\u201d \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d and \u201cAndor,\u201d crescendoing into a wildly productive 2024 with leading roles alongside A-list colleagues.",
      "\u201cThe best actors understand the importance of patience and the journey within a film, and Adria embodies that,\u201d Glen Powell, Arjona's \u201cHit Man\u201d co-star, wrote in an email.",
      "Beside the Richard Linklater movie, this year alone she starred in \u201cThe Absence of Eden,\u201d alongside Zoe Salda\u00f1a, and was cast in Zo\u00eb Kravitz\u2019s directorial debut \u201cBlink Twice\u201d and the upcoming \u201cLos Frikis\u201d from directors Michael Schwartz and Tyler Nilson.",
      "Growing up, she describes herself as \u201cvery hyper, but quiet and a little shy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanted to learn to do so many things that my dad was like, \u2018I think you might be an actress,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Arjona would perform for her family members, but it was in her adolescent years that art classes gave her confidence in her craft. Still, the actor of Puerto Rican and Guatemalan descent constantly tried to prove herself as an artist and an actor. Arjona doesn\u2019t take it lightly that she is one of the few Latina actors cast in multidimensional roles.",
      "\u201cI always put this pressure on myself of making a difference for Latin Americans in cinema, just playing different roles and trying not to get stereotyped ... it took me a long time,\u201d she said.",
      "Her long-term dream is to see more varied Latin American stories on screen. That's what drew her to \u201cLos Frikis,\u201d the coming-of-age story about a punk rock group set in early 1990s Cuba that she co-stars in and executive produces.",
      "\u201cI just hope that it gets less and less complicated and that the opportunities of playing real dimensional characters just doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d she said.",
      "She quickly learned to advocate for herself in Hollywood and credits collaborators like Linklater for believing in her and presenting her the opportunity to flex her writing skills. While working on \u201cHit Man,\u201d Arjona contributed to the second part of the comedy\u2019s script \u2014 something Powell also noted.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s also incredibly generous as an actor; her off-camera takes were just as electric as her on-camera moments,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Arjona is at a pivotal moment in her career. With multiple projects on the horizon, like \u201cSplitsville\u201d and A24's \u201cOnslaught,\u201d she is enjoying acting and producing and says she's open to writing and directing if presented with the right opportunity.",
      "She attributes her openness to some early advice from her father, Grammy-winning recording artist Ricardo Arjona, who reminded her to never stop learning.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t pretend that you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he told her. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest mistake you can do. Always ask for help and ask questions and you\u2019ll learn faster that way instead of pretending.\u201d",
      "She's taken her father\u2019s advice, soaking in every moment on set and continuously falling in love with the process. She still gets butterflies on her first day.",
      "\u201cI still feel nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope I always stay nervous. I think it\u2019s a sign that I really care, and I still really enjoy what I\u2019m doing.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 GloRilla has gone from choir girl to husky-voiced rap queen, climbing the hip-hop ranks so high that she\u2019s earned a trip to the White House.",
      "The Memphis-born performer has become one of industry\u2019s most promising voices with her genuine character, rap flow and unmistakable Southern drawl. She established herself this year as a proven hitmaker with \u201cWanna Be\u201d featuring Megan Thee Stallion and the breakout hit \u201cYeah Glo!,\u201d which earned two nominations at the upcoming Grammys.",
      "The rapper\u2019s mentality this year has been to \u201cput your foot on the gas and don\u2019t let up,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "In 2024 alone, she's been a guest performer on the domestic leg of Megan's Hot Girl Summer Tour, gaining more confidence performing in sold-out arenas. She's performed at a star-studded party in front of celebrities ranging from Leonardo DiCaprio to Kim Kardashian, and met with President Joe Biden during a women's history month event.",
      "All of this came before the October release of her critically acclaimed debut album \u201cGlorious,\u201d whose \u201cTGIF\u201d had Rihanna dancing in a social media post, earning GloRilla a spot as one of the AP's Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t ever get too comfortable,\u201d said the rapper, who burst onto the hip-hop scene in 2022 with \u201cTomorrow\u201d and the Grammy-nominated \u201cF.N.F. (Let\u2019s Go).\u201d \u201cTake advantage of everything that comes your way. If you drive and apply yourself, it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
      "GloRilla's humble beginnings served as a driving force to chase bigger horizons. Born Gloria Hallelujah Woods (the stage name was a cousin's suggestion), the 25-year-old credits her mother and her church-centered upbringing for preparing her for this pivotal moment in her life.",
      "\u201cMy momma always told me to be humble and grateful,\u201d she said. \u201cI come from nothing almost. My mom is well mannered. My mom taught us right, like, internally, have a great spirit. My personality and spirit come from my momma.\u201d",
      "GloRilla is still adjusting to her rising fame while dealing with some controversies. She was left \u201cheartbroken\u201d after three women were killed in a deadly stampede toward the end of a 2023 concert in upstate New York in which investigators found no criminal wrongdoing. She faced backlash for using a disability-related slur in her lyrics and was charged with drunken driving in Georgia this year.",
      "Despite that, her profile has grown in recent months to become one of rap's biggest names \u2014 thanks to something rapper Yo Gotti spotted when he signed her to his Collective Music Group label in 2022.",
      "\u201cIt's the authenticity,\u201d said Yo Gotti, a fellow Memphis native. \u201cEven when she talks about the struggles throughout this journey, it\u2019s refreshing. I don\u2019t think many artists do that. Everybody wants to play perfect. I think that\u2019s why so many people gravitate to her. She relates to real people.\u201d",
      "While she enjoys snapping photos with fans, she opts for incognito mode on her more casual days: \u201cI don\u2019t like to tell people \u2018No.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be mean to my fans. That's probably the worst part. I hate taking pictures when I'm not prepared.\u201d",
      "Seeking a career role model, GloRilla often examines the work ethic of Beyonc\u00e9, who called the rapper one of her favorite young artists.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a businesswoman. She multitasks a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s something I have to get better at. She\u2019s a super hard worker. Her work ethic is crazy.\u201d",
      "GloRilla could follow Beyonc\u00e9's footsteps as an actor. Since childhood, she's dreamed of starring in a film or TV show \u2014 though she's bracing herself for the marathon days on set that come with it.",
      "\u201cThink I\u2019m still going to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to lie. When I\u2019m on those music video sets, I be like \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can do acting.\u2019 I can only imagine how many times I got to say the script and memorize in my head. I don\u2019t know. ... But I'm going to still try it.\u201d",

      "Richards started memorizing the language's Scrabble word list a year ago, his friend Liz Fagerlund -\u2013 a New Zealand Scrabble official -\u2013 told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cHe can\u2019t understand why other people can\u2019t just do the same thing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe can look at a block of words together, and once they go into his brain as a picture he can just recall that very easily.\u201d",
      "In second place was defending champion Benjam\u00edn Olaizola of Argentina, who won 18 of his games.",
      "Nothing like the New Zealander's feat had ever happened in Spanish Scrabble, said Alejandro Terenzani, a contest organizer.",
      "\u201cIt was impossible to react negatively, you can only be amazed,\u201d Terenzani said. \u201cWe certainly expected that he would perform well, but it is perhaps true that he surpassed our expectations.\u201d",

      "Fagerlund said Richards impressed her when he arrived at his first Scrabble club meeting at age 28. Two years later, in 1997, he cycled 220 miles (350 kilometers) from Christchurch to the city of Dunedin, won the New Zealand title on his first attempt and cycled home again.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers in the Alex Jones bankruptcy case are now in discussions on what could happen next after a federal judge in Texas rejected the auction sale of Jones\u2019 Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet",
      "The Onion's rejected purchase of Infowars in an auction bid supported by families of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting dealt them a new setback Wednesday and clouded the future of Alex Jones' conspiracy theory platform, which will remain in his control for at least the near future.",
      "What's next for Infowars and the Sandy Hook families' long-sought efforts to hold Jones accountable over calling one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history a hoax was unclear, after a federal judge in Houston late Tuesday rejected The Onion's winning bid for the site. The only other bidder was a company aligned with Jones.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston said he did not want another auction but offered no roadmap over how to proceed. One possibility includes ultimately allowing Sandy Hook families \u2014 who comprise most of Jones' creditors \u2014 to return to state courts in Connecticut and Texas to collect on the nearly $1.5 billion in defamation and emotional distress lawsuit judgments that Jones was ordered to pay them.",
      "\u201cOur hope is that when this process ends, and it will end, and it will end sooner rather than later, is that all assets that Alex Jones has available are paid to the families, and that includes Infowars, and that as a result of that process Alex Jones is deprived of the ownership and control of the platform that he\u2019s used to hurt so many people,\u201d Christopher Mattei, an attorney for the Sandy Hook families, said Wednesday.",
      "The families, meanwhile, were preparing to mark the 12th anniversary of the Dec. 14 shooting.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay the $1.5 billion. Jones was sued for repeatedly saying on his show that the 2012 massacre of 20 first graders and six educators was staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "He has since conceded that the shooting did happen.",
      "Lopez said there was a lack of transparency in the bidding process and too much confusion about The Onion's bid, and he expressed concern that the amount of money offered was too low.",
      "The Onion's parent company, Global Tetrahedron, submitted a $1.75 million cash offer with plans to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody. The bid also included a deal with many of the Sandy Hook families for them to forgo $750,000 of their auction proceeds and give it to other creditors.",
      "The other bidder was First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements and planned to let Jones stay on the Infowars platforms. It offered $3.5 million in cash and later, with Jones, alleged fraud and collusion in the bidding process. Lopez rejected those allegations.",
      "Christopher Murray, the trustee who oversaw the auction, said he picked The Onion and its deal with the Sandy Hook families because it would have provided more money to Jones' other creditors.",
      "Lopez directed Murray to come up with a new plan to move forward. Murray and representatives of The Onion did not immediately return messages seeking comment.",
      "The judge said there was a possibility there could be a trial in 2025 to settle Jones' bankruptcy and that Murray could try to sell the equity in Infowars' parent company.",
      "The judge said he wanted to hear back from Murray and others involved in the bankruptcy within 30 days on a plan.",
      "On the social media platform X, Jones called the judge's ruling a \u201cMajor Victory For Freedom Of The Press & Due Process.\"",
      "Jeff Anapolsky, an adjunct professor at the University of Houston Law Center and the managing director and founder of Anapolsky Advisors, a financial consulting firm, said he was not surprised Lopez rejected the sale. He was not involved in the case but said he has appeared before Lopez and described him as a fair judge.",
      "Anapolsky believes the sale of the Infowars assets will ultimately take place and be approved.",
      "\u201cSo that\u2019s up to Mr. Murray now, the trustee, to go do something to make everybody feel like everybody had their say and understand the transparency of the process,\u201d Anapolsky said.",
      "The decision came during a solemn week for relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. The 12th anniversary is Saturday, and some of the victims' relatives were traveling to Washington, D.C., to attend an annual vigil for victims of gun violence. The families usually mark the anniversary out of the public eye.",
      "Many of the families have said their lawsuits against Jones bought back the unbearable pain of losing their loved ones, as well as the trauma of being harassed and threatened by believers of Jones' hoax conspiracy. Relatives said they have been confronted in public by hoax believers and received death and rape threats.",
      "The families have not received any money from Jones since winning the trials.",

      "Nigeria is the latest African country to give a new malaria vaccine to young childen",
      "BAYELSA, Nigeria -- Ominike Marvis has lost count of the number of times her 6-year-old son has had malaria. So when Nigeria started offering a malaria vaccine, she was eager to protect her youngest child.",
      "She took the 6-month-old baby to get his first shot at a health center in hard-hit Bayelsa state, where the country's vaccination campaign kicked off last week. The vaccine aims to prevent severe illnesses and deaths from the mosquito-borne disease.",
      "\u201cAt least I know he\u2019s safe from it now,\u201d Marvis, 31, said.",
      "Africa accounts for the vast majority of malaria in the world. Nigeria, the continent's most populous country, has the biggest burden with about a quarter of the cases.",
      "According to a World Health Organization report released Wednesday, there were an estimated 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths worldwide last year, mostly in children under 5. That is 11 million more malaria cases compared to 2022 with nearly the same number of deaths.",
      "\u201cNo one should die of malaria, yet the disease continues to disproportionately harm people living in the African region, especially young children and pregnant women,\u201d said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, calling for more support.",
      "There are now 17 countries giving new malaria vaccines to young children, the WHO report said. Nigeria began its campaign last week, offering a vaccine developed by Oxford University.",
      "Research suggests it is more than 75% effective at preventing severe disease and death in the first year and that protection is extended for at least another year with a booster.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s health minister, Muhammad Ali Pate, called the vaccination campaign a \u201cmonumental step\u201d in the country\u2019s efforts to eliminate malaria.",
      "The disease is caused by a parasite that is spread through mosquito bites. Experts say other measures like bed nets and insecticide spraying remain essential to curb the disease.",
      "Experts say Nigeria's population of more than 210 million people, as well as its climate, contribute to its high malaria burden, but so do other factors like poor sanitation and limited tools like treated bed nets.",
      "Besides the lack of funding, WHO report said countries with malaria still grapple with fragile health systems, weak surveillance and drug and insecticide resistance.",
      "But progress has also been made on several fronts, the report said, including in the African region where countries have achieved a 16% reduction in malaria deaths since 2015. And in 83 countries where malaria is present, 25 of them now report fewer than 10 cases a year, the report said.",
      "In the oil-rich but poor Bayelsa state, among the worst-hit in Nigeria, malaria is so common in riverside communities that mothers spoke of how no one in their family has been spared.",
      "\u201cHere, malaria is something we are used to,\u201d said Claris Okah, a community health worker.",
      "Among the challenges health workers like Okah face is hesitancy among parents, so they are educating families about the new vaccine and other steps to prevent malaria.",

      "Fewer grandparents were taking care of grandchildren, there was a decline in the number of preschoolers and more people were staying put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared to the last part of the 2010s",
      "Fewer grandparents were living with and taking care of grandchildren, there was a decline in young children going to preschool and more people stayed put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared to the last part of the 2010s, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released Thursday, reflecting some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the most comprehensive survey of American life compares the years of 2014-2018 and 2019-2023, timeframes before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the virus' spread. The American Community Survey data show how lives were changed and family relationships altered by the pandemic and other occurrences like the opioid crisis.",
      "The survey of 3.5 million households covers more than 40 topics, including ancestry, fertility, marital status, commutes, veterans status, disability and housing.",
      "The decrease in grandparents' taking care of their grandchildren is most likely the result of a decline in opioid-related deaths during the more recent timeframe since substance abuse is a leading reason that grandparents find themselves raising grandchildren. A reduction in the number of incarcerated women also likely played a role, said Susan Kelley, a professor emerita of nursing at Georgia State University.",
      "\u201cIt's very rarely for positive reasons that grandparents find themselves in this situation. Usually, it's a tragic situation in an adult child's life, either a death, incarceration or mental health issues which correlate with substance abuse,\" Kelly said. \"Many grandparents thrive in that role, but there are still socioeconomic and emotional burdens on the grandparents.\"",
      "A stronger economy in the most recent period also may be a reason that the number of grandparents living with their grandchildren declined from 7.2 million to 6.8 million by making it less likely that adult children with their own children were seeking housing help from their parents, she said.",
      "The decline in the number of young children enrolled in preschool stemmed from an unwillingness to send young children to school and the closure of many schools at the height of the pandemic, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "\u201cThese data show how the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on patterns of early childhood education,\u201d the bureau said in a separate report. \"Future research will show if this was the start of a long-term trend or if enrollment will bounce back to prior levels.\"",
      "Americans continued to get older, with the median age rising to 38.7 from 37.9 and the nation's share of senior citizens up from 16.8% from 15.2%. The share of households with a computer jumped to almost 95% from almost 89%, as did the share of households with a broadband connection to almost 90% from 80%.",
      "Additionally, fewer people moved and more people stayed put in the most recent time period compared to the earlier one, in many cases because of rising home values and the limited availability of homes to buy.",
      "Home values increased by 21.7% and the percentage of vacant homes dropped from 12.2% to 10.4%. The median home value jumped from $249,400 to $303,400 nationwide.",
      "In some vacation communities popular with the wealthy, the bump was even more dramatic, such as in the county that is home to Aspen, Colorado, where it went from $758,800 to $1.1 million, and in the county which is home to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where it jumped from $812,400 to $1.1 million.",

      "Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes says she is suing a Saudi Arabian agribusiness over what she calls \u201cexcessive pumping\u201d of groundwater",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes announced Wednesday she's suing a Saudi Arabian agribusiness for allegedly violating a public nuisance law, contending that its groundwater pumping threatens the public health, safety and infrastructure of local communities in a rural western county.",
      "The complaint filed in Maricopa County Superior Court alleges that the pumping at a Fondomonte Arizona, LLC. alfalfa farm has had widespread effects in the Ranegras Plain Basin of La Paz County, harming everyone who depends on basin water by drawing down supplies, drying up wells and causing the ground to crack and sink in some areas.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest action by Arizona against foreign companies that use huge amounts of groundwater to grow thirsty forage crops for export because of climate challenges in other countries. Rural Arizona is especially attractive to international businesses because it has no groundwater pumping regulations.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that since 2014, Fondomonte has extracted huge amounts of water that accelerated depletion of the basin\u2019s aquifer. The company is a subsidiary of Saudi dairy giant Almarai Co.",
      "\u201cWe find the allegations of the Attorney General totally unfounded, and we will defend any potential action against Fondomonte and our rights vigorously before the competent authorities,\u201d Fondomonte said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe company has invested significantly to bring the latest conservation technology and applies environmentally sustainable practices on these long-established farms,\u201d it said. \u201cFondomonte has continued to develop responsibly during its time farming in the state and the company complies with all state regulations. \u201d",
      "Years of drought have increased pressure on water users across the West, particularly in states like Arizona, which relies heavily on the dwindling Colorado River. The drought has also made groundwater \u2014 long used by farmers and rural residents without restriction \u2014 even more important for users across the state.",
      "\u201cProtection of Arizona\u2019s precious groundwater is certainly important, but this lawsuit could open a can of worms,\u201d said Kathryn Sorensen, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. \u201cNearly every farm, city, mine, tribe, and power company in the state relies on groundwater.\u201d",
      "Water attorneys said they did not feel qualified to address the legal theory of public nuisance but emphasized the lack of regulation of groundwater pumping in rural Arizona.",
      "Kathleen Ferris, an attorney and Arizona water policy expert who directed the study that led to the current law overseeing the state\u2019s groundwater management, said rural groundwater use in the state \u201cis \u201cgoverned by the rule of reasonable use.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone may drill a well and pump groundwater as long as the use of the groundwater is reasonable,\u201d said Ferris, a senior research fellow at the Kyl Center. \u201cUnfortunately, no use of groundwater has been determined by the courts to be \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 It\u2019s basically a rule that benefits the biggest landowners with the deepest wells.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mayes told reporters Wednesday that the Arizona Legislature has done nothing to fix the groundwater problem despite knowing about the problem for years.",
      "\u201cWhile laws regulating groundwater pumping could have prevented this situation, the legislature\u2019s inaction has allowed the crisis to grow,\u201d Mayes said. \u201cWhen the legislature fails to protect our most basic resources, the attorney general must step in.\u201d",
      "La Paz County Supervisor Holly Irwin, a Republican, commended Mayes, a Democrat, for attempting to address what she described as her community\u2019s \u201cmost challenging\u201d concern.",
      "\u201cI know that my constituents will be thrilled over this, that somebody is actually paying attention to the real problems here,\u201d Irwin said during Wednesday\u2019s news briefing via a video conference call.",
      "Mayes' lawsuit alleges that Fondomonte's actions are a public nuisance under a state statute that prohibits activity that injures health, obstructs property use, or interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property by a community.",
      "Mayes called the company\u2019s groundwater pumping \u201cunsustainable\u201d and said it caused \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d for people in the area.",
      "\u201cArizona law is clear: no company has the right to endanger an entire community\u2019s health and safety for its own gain,\u201d she said.",
      "The lawsuit seeks to enjoin the company from further groundwater pumping it says is \u201cexcessive\u201d and require that an abatement fund be established to cover the costs of damages caused by the company.",
      "Mayes said the dollar figure hasn't been determined but it will be established through the course of litigation.",
      "Arizona officials have been targeting Fondomonte for more than a year over its use of groundwater to grow forage crops, by not renewing or canceling the company's leases in Butler Valley in western Arizona. Some residents there had complained that the company\u2019s pumping was threatening their wells.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 22:58:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria",
    "story": [
      "Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria",
      "NASARAWA, Nigeria -- Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria.",
      "But it\u2019s led to exploitation of children who are often poor and take work in small, illegal mines to support themselves and their families.",
      "The Associated Press recently traveled to the deep bush of Pasali, near the federal capital of Abuja in Nasarawa state, to follow and interview miners operating illegal mines, including some where children work. AP also witnessed negotiations and an agreement to purchase lithium by a Chinese company with no questions about the source of the lithium or how it was obtained.",
      "The International Labour Organization estimates more than 1 million children work in mines and quarries worldwide, a problem particularly acute in Africa, where poverty, limited access to education and weak regulations add to the problem. Children, working mostly in small-scale mines, work long hours at unsafe sites, crushing or sorting rocks, carrying heavy loads of ore, and exposing themselves to toxic dust that can cause respiratory problems and asthma.",
      "Some takeaways from AP's report:",
      "Lithium mining began in Pasali a decade ago, transforming a remote and slumbering community into a bustling site for small-scale illegal mining, said Shedrack Bala, a 25-year-old who began working in the mines at age 15 and now owns his own pit. Dozens of mines now dot the area, all unlicensed.",
      "The mining methods are primitive and dangerous. Miners use chisels and heavy hammers to break through rocks, descending several feet into dark pits. In some old but still viable mines, they crawl through narrow passages snaking between unstable mud walls before starting to dig. For new mines, the ground is blasted open with dynamite.",
      "Bashir Rabiu, now 19, started in the pits as an underage worker. AP journalists watched as he wriggled around at the bottom of a pit, where miners can be at risk if dynamite explodes prematurely. They also face danger of suffocating in narrow tunnels that connect pits, or burial from wall collapse.",
      "Rabiu hauled up raw lithium ore and passed it to six children, all younger than 10. Wearing rubber slippers and dust-stained shorts and shirts, the children hunched over rubble and chipped away with crude stone tools to extract valuable fragments.",
      "A team of six children can sort and bag up to 10 25-kilogram bags of lithium-rich rock a day. For working from early morning to late evening, the children typically share 4,000 naira (about $2.42), according to Bala and others who use them.",
      "None of the children in the group AP saw was attending school. Only two ever had. One, a 5-year-old boy, stopped when he was orphaned. The other was a 6-year-old girl who was pulled out of school by her family, who felt they couldn't afford to send two children to school and prioritized her 11-year-old brother.",
      "The illegal mining thrives on informal networks of buyers and sellers who operate without much fear of the government. Aliyu Ibrahim, a lithium merchant in Nasarawa, owns unlicensed mines and also buys lithium ore from other illegal sites. At his warehouse, he told AP that his business flourishes by paying officials to look the other way. Ibrahim said he then sells his lithium in bulk to Chinese companies.",
      "Ibrahim said he knows that children are working at his mines and others he buys from, but he said many of the children are orphans or poor. He said the work helps them survive.",
      "AP accompanied miners from Pasali illegal mines to Chinese-owned RSIN Nigeria Limited, where a sales agreement was reached without questions about the source of the minerals or the conditions under which they were extracted. Sellers were asked to leave samples to test for lithium content. A price list from the buyers offered 200,000 naira (about $119) for a metric ton of minerals containing up to 3% lithium.",
      "RSIN Nigeria Limited did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But in a statement to AP, the Chinese embassy in Abuja said Chinese mining companies in Nigeria \u201coperate in line with local laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Philip Jakpor, a Nigerian activist, said his nonprofit Renevlyn Development Initiative has documented widespread child labor practices across Nasarawa state.",
      "\u201cRevenue generation seems to have trumped the need to protect human rights,\u201d Jakpor said. \u201cWe expect those operating in the upper spheres of the supply chain to adopt responsible models that prevent abusive conditions in mineral extraction.\u201d",
      "Juliane Kippenberg, associate director of children\u2019s rights at Human Rights Watch, said global demand for lithium is expected to grow rapidly in coming years and it's imperative for governments to protect human rights and press corporations to do the same.",
      "Segun Tomori, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mining and Solid Minerals Development, said ongoing reforms such as amending the Minerals and Mining Act are aimed at minimizing the use of child labor. Tomori also said social safety programs such as school feeding initiatives are being revamped to keep children in school and combat child labor. He also cited a program to add mining marshals announced this year to clamp down on illegal mining.",

      "The International Labour Organization estimates more than 1 million children work in mines and quarries worldwide, a problem particularly acute in Africa, where poverty, limited access to education and weak regulations add to the problem. Children, working mostly in small-scale mines, work long hours at unsafe sites, crushing or sorting rocks, carrying heavy loads of ore, and exposing themselves to toxic dust that can cause respiratory problems and asthma.",
      "The growing demand for lithium has created a new frontier for mining in mineral-rich Nigeria. But it has come with a steep cost, exploiting its poorest and most vulnerable: its children. Their work often provides material for Chinese businesses that dominate Nigeria\u2019s laxly regulated extractive industry and are often blamed for illegal mining and labor exploitation.",
      "The Associated Press recently traveled to the deep bush of Pasali, near the federal capital of Abuja in Nasarawa state, to follow and interview miners operating illegal mines, including the one where Juliet works. AP also witnessed negotiations and an agreement to purchase lithium by a Chinese company with no questions about the source of the lithium or how it was obtained.",
      "That company, RSIN Nigeria Limited, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But in a statement to AP, the Chinese embassy in Abuja said Chinese mining companies in Nigeria \u201coperate in line with local laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Nigeria has laws requiring basic education and prohibiting child labor, but enforcement is a challenge with many illegal mines in hard-to-reach areas. Corruption among regulatory and law enforcement officials is also a problem. The government said it's pursuing reforms that would toughen laws. Earlier this year it also launched a \u201ccorps of mining marshals\u201d to combat illegal mining, but activists say it's too soon to tell if that program is helping.",
      "Lithium mining began in Pasali a decade ago, transforming a remote and slumbering community into a bustling site for small-scale illegal mining, said Shedrack Bala, a 25-year-old who began working in the mines at age 15 and now owns his own pit. Dozens of mines now dot the area, all unlicensed.",
      "The mining methods are primitive and dangerous. Miners use chisels and heavy hammers to break through rocks, descending several feet into dark pits. In some old but still viable mines, they crawl through narrow passages snaking between unstable mud walls before starting to dig. For new mines, the ground is blasted open with dynamite.",
      "Bashir Rabiu, now 19, started in these pits as an underage worker. AP journalists watched as he wriggled around at the bottom of a pit, where miners can be at risk if dynamite explodes prematurely. They also face danger of suffocating in narrow tunnels that connect pits, or burial from wall collapse \u2014 all fates Rabiu has seen befall other miners.",
      "\u201cBut it is God that protects,\u201d he said.",
      "Rabiu hauled up raw lithium ore and passed it to Juliet and five other children, all younger than 10. Wearing rubber slippers and dust-stained shorts and shirts, the children hunched over heaps of rubble and chipped away with crude stone tools to extract valuable fragments. Once sorted, the minerals were bagged to begin their journey from Pasali to the global supply chain.",
      "A team of six children can sort and bag up to 10 25-kilogram bags of lithium-rich rock a day. When the AP visited, they did 22 kilograms (about 48.5 pounds) in one hour. For working from early morning to late evening, the children typically share 4,000 naira (about $2.42), according to Bala and others who use them. They said it is enough money to cover meals at the children\u2019s homes.",
      "In Juliet's group, only she and a 5-year-old boy named Zakaria Danladi had ever attended the local elementary school. Zakaria stopped when he was orphaned. Juliet was pulled out because her family couldn't afford to send both her and her 11-year-old brother, and his education took precedence, her mother said.",
      "Basic education is supposed to be free in Nigeria, at least in government schools like the one in Pasali. But hidden fees often put it out of reach of the poorest families. For example, in Pasali, a Parent-Teacher Association levy of 5,000 Naira (about $3) is charged per term, parents said. For Juliet\u2019s family and others, even this amount is too much. About 63% of Nigeria's population lives in poverty.",
      "Sule Dantini, the schoolmaster, said his classes have become virtually empty with only three pupils turning up when he spoke with AP in early December. \u201cI used to have up to 300 pupils, but attendance has been very poor because of mining.\u201d He denied the school charges fees.",
      "Nigeria is Africa\u2019s top oil producer, but it also has deep mineral resources including granite, limestone, and gold, and it's seeking to tap those to reduce its reliance on petroleum exports. Yet much of this wealth \u2014 including lithium \u2014 is siphoned off through unlicensed mines that cost the nation billions of dollars and drive insecurity, according to a parliamentary probe this year.",
      "The illegal mining thrives on informal networks of buyers and sellers who operate without much fear of the government. Aliyu Ibrahim, a lithium merchant in Nasarawa, owns unlicensed mines and also buys lithium ore from other illegal sites. At his warehouse, he told AP that his business flourishes by paying officials to look the other way. Ibrahim said he then sells his lithium in bulk to Chinese companies.",
      "Ibrahim said he knows that children are working at his mines and others he buys from, but he said many of the children are orphans or poor.",
      "\u201cIt is dangerous, but the work helps them survive, while the government has abandoned poor people,\" he said.",
      "Some of the bush miners avoid middlemen like Ibrahim and sell directly to Chinese companies or Chinese nationals.",
      "AP accompanied miners from Pasali illegal mines to Chinese-owned RSIN Nigeria Limited, where a sales agreement was reached without questions about the source of the minerals or the conditions under which they were extracted. Sellers were asked to leave samples to test for lithium content. A price list from the buyers offered 200,000 naira (about $119) for a metric ton of minerals containing up to 3% lithium.",
      "China's citizens and companies are frequently in the spotlight for environmentally damaging practices, exploitative labor and illicit mining in several countries. Nigeria has seen multiple cases of illegal mining arrests and prosecutions involving Chinese nationals in recent months. Experts say the materials are exported in a variety of ways, including shipping with false documentation or concealment within legitimate shipments.",
      "The Chinese embassy's statement to AP said its government has a zero-tolerance policy toward any illegal mining activity or illegal labor by Chinese companies operating abroad.",
      "Philip Jakpor, a Nigerian activist, said his nonprofit Renevlyn Development Initiative has documented widespread child labor practices across Nasarawa state.",
      "\u201cRevenue generation seems to have trumped the need to protect human rights,\u201d Jakpor said. \u201cWe expect those operating in the upper spheres of the supply chain to adopt responsible models that prevent abusive conditions in mineral extraction.\u201d",
      "Juliane Kippenberg, associate director of children\u2019s rights at Human Rights Watch, said global demand for lithium is expected to grow rapidly in coming years and it's imperative for governments to protect human rights and press corporations to do the same.",
      "Segun Tomori, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mining and Solid Minerals Development, said ongoing reforms such as amending the Minerals and Mining Act are aimed at minimizing the use of child labor. Tomori also said social safety programs such as school feeding initiatives are being revamped to keep children in school and combat child labor. He also cited the program to add mining marshals announced this year to clamp down on illegal mining.",
      "Abigail Samaniya, 6-year-old Juliet's mother, said she hopes her daughter will someday escape the mine.",
      "\u201cI still want her to go to school, have a better life, work in an office, not a mine forever,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The Montana Supreme Court is continuing to block a law that sought to ban gender-affirming medical care for minors while it goes through the courts",
      "HELENA, Mont. -- A Montana law banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors will remain temporarily blocked, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday, after justices unanimously agreed with a lower court judge who found the law likely violates the state's constitutional right to privacy.",
      "The case against the Montana law now goes to trial before District Court Judge Jason Marks in Missoula.",
      "\u201cI will never understand why my representatives are working to strip me of my rights and the rights of other transgender kids,\u201d Phoebe Cross, a 17-year-old transgender boy and lead plaintiff, said in a statement. \u201cJust living as a trans teenager is difficult enough, the last thing me and my peers need is to have our rights taken away.\u201d",
      "The attorney general's office said it looks forward to defending the law, with a spokesperson noting there are recent scientific and legal developments that fall in the state's favor. This comes as the British government on Wednesday indefinitely banned puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria, citing an unacceptable safety risk.",
      "\u201cIn upholding the district court\u2019s flawed decision to temporarily block a duly enacted law, the Supreme Court put the wellbeing of children -- who have yet to reach puberty -- at risk by allowing experimental treatments that could leave them to deal with serious and irreversible consequences for the rest of their lives to continue,\u201d spokesperson Chase Scheuer said.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month heard arguments over Tennessee\u2019s ban on puberty blockers, hormones or surgery for transgender minors, with observers saying it appeared the justices were likely to uphold the ban. The Biden administration had sought to block similar bans that exist in more than half the states.",
      "\u201cBecause Montana's constitutional protections are even stronger than their federal counterparts, transgender youth in Montana can sleep easier tonight knowing that they can continue to thrive for now, without this looming threat hanging over their heads,\u201d said Kell Olsen, an attorney for Lambda Legal.",
      "Republican Sen. John Fuller, who sponsored the bill, said Wednesday's decision \u201cis an egregious example of the hyperpartisanship of the Montana Supreme Court.\" He criticized the courts for upholding the \u201cability to sterilize and mutilate children\u201d and denying protection to children \"from unscientific and experimental drugs and operations that have grown increasingly evident as a danger to children.\u201d",
      "Fuller hasn't decided if he will bring a similar bill in the 2025 Legislature.",
      "Legislative debate over Montana\u2019s bill drew national attention in the spring of 2023 after Republicans punished Democratic Rep. Zooey Zephyr \u2014 the first transgender woman elected to the state\u2019s Legislature \u2014 for admonishing lawmakers who supported the bill.",
      "The Montana Supreme Court \u201chas reaffirmed what we have known all along \u2014 gender-affirming care saves lives, and like all health care decisions, it should be left between doctors and patients,\u201d Zephyr said Wednesday.",
      "Marks blocked the law in late September 2023, just days before it was to take effect. He agreed with transgender youth, their families and health care providers that the law is likely unconstitutional and would harm the mental and physical health of minors with gender dysphoria, rather than protect them from experimental treatments, as supporters said it would.",
      "Marks said he could only conclude the Legislature's stated intent in passing the law was \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and it seemed more likely its purpose is to \u201cban an outcome deemed undesirable by the Montana Legislature, veiled as protection for minors.\"",
      "The law sought to prohibit the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria. However, cisgender minors would still be able to receive puberty blockers to treat early puberty or surgical procedures to treat intersex conditions, the plaintiffs argued.",
      "Montana is one of at least 26 states that have passed bans on gender-affirming medical care for minors and most face lawsuits. Some bans have been temporarily blocked by courts, while others have been allowed to take effect. Fifteen states have enacted protections for gender-affirming medical care for minors.",
      "In Montana\u2019s case, transgender youth argued the law would ban them from continuing to receive gender-affirming medical care, violating their constitutional rights to equal protection, the right to seek health care and the right to dignity. The state Supreme Court upheld the injunction based on the right to privacy, which court rulings have said includes the right to make personal medical decisions free from government interference.",
      "Two justices argued the court should have also clarified that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is a form of sex discrimination that is prohibited by the equal protection clause of the state constitution.",
      "The parents of the plaintiffs argued the law would violate their constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children and two medical providers said it would prevent them from providing effective and necessary care to their patients.",
      "Treatments for gender dysphoria meet standards of care approved by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, the ACLU argued in its complaint.",
      "One of the young plaintiffs was dismissed from the lawsuit in September 2024 after turning 18.",
      "___",
      "This story has been corrected to show that the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on the Tennessee ban earlier this month, not in June."

      "LONDON -- The British government on Wednesday indefinitely banned puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria after independent experts found there was an unacceptable safety risk in prescribing the medication.",
      "The decision, which will be revisited in 2027, effectively bans a common approach to medical gender transitions for youths. It also goes against standards held by medical groups elsewhere, including the European and World Professional Associations for Transgender Health, as well as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "The ban will prevent prescribing medications that can suppress or pause puberty in children with gender dysphoria, providing more time to consider options that could include gender reassignment.",
      "The announcement comes after a judge this summer upheld an emergency ban in a ruling that said the treatment was potentially harmful. The emergency ban was put in place by the center-right Conservative government and has now been extended by the center-left Labour government.",
      "The ban does not apply to those already receiving puberty blockers for gender dysphoria, to their use in clinical studies or in treatment of children with precocious puberty, an uncommon medical condition that causes puberty to begin abnormally early.",
      "It applies across the United Kingdom after consultation with the Scottish and Welsh governments, and an agreement with Northern Ireland.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said a clinical trial will be set up next year to better evaluate use of the drugs.",
      "\u201cWe need to act with caution and care when it comes to this vulnerable group of young people, and follow the expert advice,\u201d Streeting said.",
      "The National Health Service in England stopped prescribing puberty blockers at gender identity clinics last year, saying there was not enough evidence about the benefits and harms.",
      "In July, Justice Beverley Lang said a review commissioned by the NHS found \u201cvery substantial risks and very narrow benefits\u201d to the treatment.

    "summary": "New York City&rsquo;s police commissioner says the gun found on the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare&rsquo;s CEO matches shell casings found at the crime scene",
    "story": [
      "New York City\u2019s police commissioner says the gun found on the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO matches shell casings found at the crime scene",
      "ALTOONA, Pa. -- The gun found on the man charged with killing United Healthcare\u2019s CEO matched shell casings found at the site of the shooting, New York City\u2019s police commissioner said Wednesday as authorities scrutinized evidence and the suspect's experiences with the victim's industry.",
      "Luigi Mangione \u2019s fingerprints also matched a water bottle and a snack bar wrapper that police found near the scene in midtown Manhattan, Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at an unrelated news conference. Police had said earlier that they believed the gunman bought the items at a nearby coffee shop while awaiting his target.",
      "Mangione, 26, remained jailed without bail Wednesday in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested and initially charged with gun and forgery offenses. Manhattan prosecutors were working to bring him to New York to face a murder charge in the death of Brian Thompson, the leader of the United States\u2019 biggest health insurer.",
      "Mangione's lawyer has cautioned the public against prejudging the case.",
      "While the case is in early stages, police believe the suspect may have been motivated by animus toward the health care industry.",
      "Investigators are looking into an accident that injured Mangione\u2019s back and sent him to an emergency room on July 4, 2023, police said Wednesday. They\u2019re scrutinizing his Facebook page, where he posted X-rays of numerous screws that were inserted into his spine. And police are studying his writings about the injury and his disdain for corporate America and the U.S. health care system.",
      "Authorities recovered a spiral notebook that Mangione kept, along with a three-page, handwritten letter found when he was arrested Monday in Pennsylvania, a law enforcement official said Wednesday. Police have not disclosed what was in the notebook.",
      "The letter teased the possibility that clues to the attack \u2014 \u201csome straggling notes and To Do lists that illuminate the gist of it\u201d \u2014 could be found in the notebook, the law enforcement official said. The official wasn\u2019t authorized to disclose information about the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "A law enforcement bulletin obtained by the AP earlier this week said the letter disdained corporate greed and what Mangione called \u201cparasitic\u201d health insurance companies. The prep school and Ivy League graduate wrote that the U.S. has the most expensive health care system in the world and that major corporations' profits continue to rise while life expectancy doesn't, according to the bulletin.",
      "In his first public words since his arrest, Mangione shouted about an \u201cinsult to the intelligence of the American people\u201d on his way into court Tuesday.",
      "At a brief hearing, defense lawyer Thomas Dickey said that he didn't believe there was evidence to support a forgery charge and questioned whether the gun allegation amounts to a crime. Dickey also said Mangione would contest his extradition to New York and wanted a hearing on the issue.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t rush to judgment in this case or any case,\u201d Dickey said afterward. \u201cHe\u2019s presumed innocent. Let\u2019s not forget that.\u201d",
      "Mangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City, after a McDonald\u2019s customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said.",
      "New York police officials have said Mangione was carrying the gun and the same fake ID the suspected shooter had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs.",
      "Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4 as he walked alone to a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference.",
      "There were no fingerprints on the ammunition found at the shooting scene, but work is ongoing to analyze a print on cellphone left nearby, police said Wednesday.",
      "Police are continuing to search for more surveillance video showing Mangione's movements in New York between Nov. 24, when they say he arrived in the city, and the shooting. From video collected already, investigators determined the suspect quickly fled the city, likely by bus, after the killing.",
      "His movements afterward are unclear, but authorities believe he took steps to stay off the radar. Prosecutors said at Mangione's Pennsylvania hearing this week that when arrested, he had what are known as Faraday bags for his cellphone and laptop to block signals authorities can use to track electronic devices.",
      "Mangione, a grandson of a well-known Maryland real estate developer and philanthropist, had a graduate degree in computer science and worked for a time at a car-buying website. During the first half of 2022, he bunked at a co-living space in Hawaii, where those who knew him said he suffered from severe and sometimes debilitating back pain.",
      "His relatives have said in a statement that they are \u201cshocked and devastated\" at his arrest.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- While surveying a room packed with Hollywood's most influential figures, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d star Selena Gomez took center stage to spotlight a critical issue: Prioritizing mental health and supporting underserved communities often left behind in the conversation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about taking action to ensure that underserved communities have access to mental health resources,\u201d Gomez said Tuesday at the Academy Women's Luncheon. The singer-actor has been public about her mental health struggles, revealing she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.",
      "In 2020, Gomez started the Rare Impact Fund and her Rare Beauty line of cosmetics, pledging to donate 1% of all sales to the fund to help expand mental health services and education for young people.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about showing them that when we come together, we can make a real difference,\u201d said Gomez, a Grammy and Emmy-nominated performer who became a Golden Globes double nominee Monday for her roles on \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and \"Only Murders in the Building.\u201d",

      "Gomez talked about the importance of amplifying women's voice and being proud while working on \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\" which she says featured \u201cextraordinary\u201d women from in front and behind the camera. She said the film's director, Jacques Audiard, fostered the idea that \u201cevery single voice is heard and valued.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt reminded me of the power of community, supporting and lifting up each other \u2014 whether in film, music or life itself,\u201d she said.",
      "Many actors in attendance dressed in Chanel clothing, jewelry, shoes, makeup and accessories. The luxury fashion brand, which sponsored the event, has had a long association with film and women creatives since founder Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel saw an opportunity to put her designs in the movies and empower women in film.",
      "Tuesday's event was held to bring together women from all facets of the filmmaking community. It was also a celebration of the Academy Gold Fellowship for Women, a program that supports emerging women filmmakers.",
      "Gomez paid homage to the event for highlighting women filmmakers and the efforts behind creating resources for those in the fellowship.",
      "\u201cIt is honestly such an honor to be in this room with so many women that I love and have inspired me throughout the years,\u201d she said. \u201cThey continue to empower me, not only in our industry, but around world.\""

    "story": [
      "The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that Ohio's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public-nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The Ohio Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the state's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation, a decision that could overturn a $650 million judgment against the pharmacies.",
      "An attorney for the counties called the decision \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "Justices were largely unanimous in their interpretation of an arcane disagreement over the state law, which had emerged in a lawsuit brought by Lake and Trumbull counties outside Cleveland against CVS, Walgreens and Walmart.",
      "The counties won their initial lawsuit \u2014 and were awarded $650 million in damages by a federal judge in 2022 \u2014 but the pharmacies had disputed the court's reading of the Ohio Product Liability Act, which they said protected them from such sanctions.",
      "In an opinion written by Justice Joseph Deters, the court found that Ohio state lawmakers intended the law to prevent \u201call common law product liability causes of action\" \u2014 even if they don't seek compensatory damages but merely \u201cequitable relief\u201d for the communities.",
      "\u201cThe plain language of the OPLA abrogates product-liability claims, including product-related public-nuisance claims seeking equitable relief,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are constrained to interpret the statute as written, not according to our own personal policy preferences.\u201d",
      "Two of the Republican-dominated court's Democratic justices disagreed on that one point, while concurring on the rest of the judgment.",
      "\u201cAny award to abate a public nuisance like the opioid epidemic would certainly be substantial in size and scope, given that the claimed nuisance is both long-lasting and widespread,\u201d Justice Melody Stewart wrote in an opinion joined by Justice Michael Donnelly. \u201cBut just because an abatement award is of substantial size and scope does not mean it transforms it into a compensatory-damages award.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the plaintiffs' co-liaison counsel in the national opioid litigation, Peter Weinberger, of the Cleveland-based law firm Spangenberg Shibley & Liber, lamented the decision.",
      "\u201cThis ruling will have a devastating impact on communities and their ability to police corporate misconduct,\" he said. \u201cWe have used public nuisance claims across the country to obtain nearly $60 billion in opioid settlements, including nearly $1 billion in Ohio alone, and the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s ruling undermines the very legal basis that drove this result.\u201d",
      "But Weinberger said Tuesday's ruling would not be the end, and that communities would continue to fight \u201cthrough other legal avenues.\u201d",
      "\"We remain steadfast in our commitment to holding all responsible parties to account as this litigation continues nationwide,\u201d he said.",
      "In his 2022 ruling, U.S. District Judge Dan Polster said that the money awarded to Lake and Trumbull counties would be used to fight the opioid crisis. Attorneys at the time put the total price tag at $3.3 billion for the damage done.",
      "Lake County was to receive $306 million over 15 years. Trumbull County was to receive $344 million over the same period. Nearly $87 million was to be paid immediately to cover the first two years of payments.",
      "A jury returned a verdict in favor of the counties in November 2021, after a six-week trial. It was then left to the judge to decide how much the counties should receive. He heard testimony the next May to determine damages.",
      "The counties convinced the jury that the pharmacies played an outsized role in creating a public nuisance in the way they dispensed pain medication. It was the first time pharmacy companies completed a trial to defend themselves in a drug crisis that has killed a half-million Americans since 1999.",
      "___",
      "Corrects a previous version that said the judge awarded money to Trump County, rather than Trumbull County."

      "A federal judge has ruled that immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d in 19 states aren't entitled to health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- Young adult immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d in 19 U.S. states will be temporarily blocked from getting health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's public marketplace, a federal judge has ruled, limiting an effort by the Biden administration to help immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.",
      "Judge Daniel Traynor of the U.S. District Court in North Dakota issued the order Monday from Bismarck, dealing a setback to a Biden administration rule that was estimated to allow 147,000 immigrants to enroll for coverage. Traynor's ruling came in a lawsuit filed over the policy and will remain in effect until the matter can go to trial.",
      "The ruling applies to immigrants in 19 states where Republican attorneys general sued to avoid having to comply with the new policy. They cited concern over immigrants possibly qualifying for public subsidies available to many people insured under the ACA.",
      "The GOP state officials argued that the rule created earlier this year by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would be a strong incentive for immigrants to remain in the U.S. illegally and could creating costs for states. They argued that both the Affordable Care Act and a 1996 law prohibit U.S. government benefits flowing to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\u201cDreamers\u201d are part of a program that makes them a low priority for deportation. However, President-elect Donald Trump won the Nov. 5 election promising \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d He will succeed President Joe Biden on Jan. 20.",
      "Traynor, a Trump appointee during his first term in office, concluded through what he called \u201ca common-sense inference\u201d that access to subsidized ACA coverage is a powerful incentive for people to remain in the U.S. illegally, creating a substantial risk that states will \u201csuffer monetary harm.\u201d",
      "Federal law gives CMS the authority to determine whether someone is living in the U.S. legally, but, Traynor wrote, \u201cIt by no means allows the agency to circumvent congressional authority and redefine the term \u2018lawfully present.\u2019\u201d",
      "CMS said in a statement Tuesday that it is reviewing the lawsuit but does not comment on litigation.",
      "Nicholas Esp\u00edritu, deputy legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, said some \u201cDreamers\u201d have been waiting for more than a decade to get \u201clife-sustaining\u201d health coverage through the ACA.",
      "\u201cJudge Traynor\u2019s ruling is both disappointing and wrong on the law,\u201d Esp\u00edritu said, promising his group would continue to fight the issue.",
      "But Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach called the decision \u201ca victory for the rule of law.\" He told reporters after a hearing in Bismarck in October that the Biden administration sought to redefine what it means to be an immigrant living in the U.S. legally by \u201cexecutive fiat,\u201d calling the rule \u201cAlice in Wonderland stuff.\u201d",
      "North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley added then that American taxpayers, through Congress, determine how the federal government treats immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t always come across as friendly and nice and cuddly, but it speaks to the access to our health care system, the cost of our health care system, and the burden on the American public, the taxpayer,\u201d he said.",
      "Kansas and North Dakota are the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed in August. They've been joined by Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.",

      "Americans should eat more beans, peas and lentils and cut back on red and processed meats and starchy vegetables",
      "Americans should eat more beans, peas and lentils and cut back on red and processed meats and starchy vegetables, all while continuing to limit added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",
      "That's the advice released Tuesday by a panel of nutrition experts charged with counseling the U.S. government about the 2025 edition of the dietary guidelines that will form the cornerstone of federal food programs and policy.",
      "But the 20-member panel didn't weigh in on the growing role of ultraprocessed foods that have been linked to health problems, saying there's not enough evidence to tell people to avoid them. And the group steered clear of updating controversial guidance on alcohol consumption, leaving that analysis to two outside reports expected to be released soon.",
      "Overall, the recommendations for the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans sound familiar, said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert.",
      "\u201cThis looks like every other set of dietary guidelines since 1980: eat your veggies and reduce consumption of foods high in salt, sugar and saturated fat,\u201d Nestle said in an email. \u201cThis particular statement says nothing about balancing calories, when overconsumption of calories, especially from ultra-processed foods, is the biggest challenge to the health of Americans.\u201d",
      "The nutrition panel concluded that a healthy diet for people aged 2 years and older is higher in vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish and and vegetable oils that are higher in unsaturated fat.",
      "It is lower in red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, refined grains and saturated fat. It may also include fat-free or low-fat dairy and foods lower in sodium and may include plant-based foods.",
      "The panel, which met for nearly two years, was the first to focus on the dietary needs of Americans through what they called a \u201chealth equity lens,\u201d said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Massachusetts General Hospital obesity expert who was part of the group. That meant considering factors such as household income, race, ethnicity and culture when recommending healthy diets. It will help ensure that the guidance \u201creflects and includes various population groups,\u201d she said in an email.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods include the snacks, sugary cereals and frozen meals that make up about 60% of the American diet.",
      "The panel considered more than 40 studies, including several that showed links between ultraprocessed foods and becoming overweight or developing obesity. But the nutrition experts had concerns with the quality of the research, leaving them to conclude that the evidence was too limited to make recommendations.",
      "That decision is likely to bump up against the views of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the nominee to lead the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, who has questioned potential conflicts of interest among members of the dietary guidelines panel and vowed to crack down on ultraprocessed foods that contribute to chronic disease.",
      "The panel also didn't revise recommendations that suggest limiting alcohol intake to two drinks or less a day for men and one drink or less a day for women.",
      "In 2020, the last time the guidance was updated, the government rejected the advice of scientific advisers to recommend less alcohol consumption.",
      "Two groups \u2014 the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine and a committee of the government agency that oversees substance abuse \u2014 are expected to release reports in the coming months on the effects of moderate alcohol use to inform the guidelines.",
      "The advisory panel acknowledged that the diets of most Americans don't meet the current guidelines. More than half of all U.S. adults have one or more diet-related chronic health conditions and 18 million U.S. households have insecure sources of food, according to the report.",
      "\u201cNutrition-related chronic health conditions and their precursors continue to threaten health through the lifespan,\" the report concludes. \u201cWhich does not bode well for the future of health in the United States.\u201d",
      "The scientific report informs the dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years. Tuesday\u2019s recommendations now go to HHS and the Agriculture Department, where officials will draft the final guidance set for release next year.",
      "Starting Wednesday, the public will have 60 days to comment on the guidance. HHS and USDA officials will hold a public meeting Jan. 16 to discuss the recommendations.",
      "The new guidance, which will be finalized by the incoming Trump administration, is consistent with decades of federal efforts to reduce diet-related disease in the U.S., said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "\u201cBroadly, I think these are well-formulated recommendations that the incoming administration would do well to adopt,\u201d Lurie said.",

      "The number of cases in the region, which includes the United States, is the highest reported since record keeping began in 1980, PAHO director Jarbas Barbosa said at a news conference.",
      "\u201cThis is linked directly to climatic events,\u201d he said, referencing warmer temperatures, droughts and flooding. A fast population growth, unplanned urbanization and poor sanitation have contributed to the rise in dengue.",
      "The virus has surged worldwide since last year and spread to areas previously free of dengue, according to PAHO.",
      "Brazil is reporting the highest number of dengue cases with more than 10 million, followed by Argentina, with more than 580,000, and Mexico with more than half a million.",

      "Many infected people don\u2019t get sick, but some experience headache, fever and flu-like symptoms. Severe cases can cause serious bleeding, shock and death. Repeated infections can be especially dangerous.",
      "Dengue cases usually surge during the wet season, but by late March, Puerto Rico already had declared an epidemic, with officials warning last month that it cannot be controlled unless residents cooperate. The U.S. territory has reported more than 4,900 cases and at least nine deaths so far this year. Victims include a 17-year-old girl and a 31-year-old woman.",
      "The cases in Puerto Rico nearly quadrupled from last year, according to government data.",
      "Lydia Plat\u00f3n, a 55-year-old English professor at the University of Puerto Rico, got dengue in October. \u201cYou have fever all the time. You have horrible chills,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that my energy has returned yet.\u201d",
      "Her neighborhood reported five cases in six weeks, which she blames on heavy rains at the time and stagnant and accumulated water. One of the cases was her 17-year-old daughter. Plat\u00f3n said she now lights incense and sprays herself with repellant every afternoon.",
      "Puerto Rico officials are urging people to get rid of stagnant water where mosquitoes lay eggs. The government in Trinidad and Tobago has started issuing fines to people whose properties have become breeding sites for mosquitoes.",
      "This year, more than one-third of cases in Costa Rica, Mexico and Paraguay have been reported in children younger than 15, with Guatemala reporting a high number of child deaths, Barbosa said.",
      "Vaccines against dengue have been introduced in Peru, Brazil and Argentina, with Honduras slated to receive them next year, but they\u2019re meant mostly for children and are most effective in those already infected with dengue once, dos Santos said.",
      "She noted that supplies are limited and that vaccines are not expected to have a big impact on transmission. She stressed that preventive measures remain crucial.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The federal government has sued South Carolina, saying the state has not done enough to make sure people with serious mental illnesses are taken out of group homes and helped to get back into the community where they can work and lead independent lives.",
      "The lawsuit filed Monday said the state violates the Americans with Disabilities Act by opting, through money and policy decisions, to leave people with mental illnesses in group homes where they can't choose what to eat, pick their own roommate, find a way to work at a job or go to church and other activities.",
      "The state has known about the issues since a different 2016 lawsuit and federal officials warned them of the problems and possible legal action in a 23-page report in May 2023, U.S. Justice Department lawyers said in court papers.",
      "\u201cPeople with disabilities in South Carolina can and must be able to receive services in their own homes, rather than being isolated in institutions,\u201d Kristen Clarke, an assistant attorney in the agency's Civil Rights Division, said in a statement.",
      "While Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster questioned the timing of the lawsuit, coming in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden's administration, he is working on solutions to the problems brought up in the suit, spokesman Brandon Charochak said in a statement.",
      "One idea is to combine the state Department of Mental Health and the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs and put the new agency in the governor's cabinet under his supervision.",
      "\u201cThe fact remains that our state\u2019s healthcare delivery system is fractured with non-cabinet agencies that are unaccountable and inefficient. The governor believes the time to change this is now,\u201d Charochak said.",
      "Federal officials suggested spending more money and making sure the state's Medicaid program makes adequate payments for programs called assertive community treatments.",
      "Under the prgrams, teams visit people with serious mental illnesses in their home. There is at least one psychiatrist, two psychiatric nurses, specialists in employment and substance abuse, and other professionals.",
      "Research has found the teams often can head off a mental health crisis. They also can provide crisis teams that can respond quickly to prevent bigger issues, from police involvement to psychiatric hospital stays, the Justice Department investigation found.",
      "There are only four teams in South Carolina \u2014 in Columbia, Greenville and Dillon \u2014 and they don't provide statewide coverage. They also have low staffing.",
      "Currently, about 1,000 people live in group homes. A large number of them told federal investigators they wanted to live on their own, but ran into problems.",
      "Federal officials spent months investigating what are officially called community residential care facilities, talking to residents, administrators and people who provide treatment outside the homes for those with mental illnesses who are living independently.",
      "The identities of those who spoke were kept anonymous for their privacy, including one group home resident who pointed out the living conditions weren\u2019t much different than decades ago when people with mental illness were housed in giant centers with no private rooms and little individualized care.",
      "Residents of the group home often only get to leave for a monthly outing to Walmart or Dollar General. They have no way of working because they can\u2019t get transportation to a job. Sometimes the home is fenced in with locked doors and security cameras.",
      "\u201cSomething like a little asylum in here,\u201d the resident told investigators.",
      "The homes are required by law to post calendars with activities. Investigators found almost all of them were events inside the home like arts and crafts, \u201cname that tune,\u201d Bible study, bingo, \u201cbubble-blowing fun\u201d and coloring pages, federal officials told the state.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no vision of ever getting out. There\u2019s no vision of having a real life. \u2026 There\u2019s no vision of anything. They just feel stuck. That\u2019s almost like hospitals used to be, 150 years ago,\u201d a state employee who regularly visits one home told investigators.",
      "The report cited the case of a 40-year-old man who lived independently for three years when a break-in at his apartment caused a mental health crisis that led to several months in a psychiatric hospital. He was released to a group home, where he has lived for 11 years. He told investigators he wants to live independently but has been offered no help.",
      "A 43-year-old woman told investigators she had a mental crisis in 2020 and went to a group home because her parents thought it would help her rebuild her independence. Now the parents are trying to get her out because she got no help for living skills.",
      "Others had a financial crisis that coincided with a mental crisis and need help with affordable housing or job skills."

    "summary": "Authorities in Mexico say a total of 17 children have died in central Mexico from suspected contamination of IV feeding bags, after four more deaths were confirmed",
    "story": [
      "Authorities in Mexico say a total of 17 children have died in central Mexico from suspected contamination of IV feeding bags, after four more deaths were confirmed",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Authorities in Mexico said Tuesday that a total of 17 children have died in central Mexico from suspected contamination of IV feeding bags after four more deaths were confirmed.",
      "David Kershenobich, the country\u2019s public health secretary, said 16 of the victims were underweight, premature babies being treated at hospitals; the other victim was 14 years old.",
      "He said that two bacteria, including a multidrug-resistant bug, were suspected in the deaths.",
      "Investigators say the bacterial contamination apparently happened at a plant in the city of Toluca that manufactured the IV nutrition mixture, and that the company had been temporarily shut down and use of the product had been halted.",
      "The first infections were reported starting Nov. 22 and the last was identified on Dec. 3. Around 20 other patients had been sickened by the infection and were being treated for it.",
      "All 13 of the first deaths occurred at three government hospitals and one private one in the State of Mexico, on the outskirts of Mexico City.",
      "Kershenobich said he did not expect any other deaths, but noted authorities had \u201cdetected other possible outbreaks with similar characteristics in Mexico State, which are under investigation.\u201d",
      "Three more deaths were found to have occurred in the neighboring state of Michoacan and one in the north-central state of Guanajuato. Authorities said the same bacteria, and the same IV bags, were implicated in all the deaths.",
      "Earlier, the federal Public Health Department ordered doctors across the country not to use IV nutrition bags made by the company Productos Hospitalarios S.A de C.V., though the exact source of the infections is still under investigation. Phone calls to numbers listed for the company and emails seeking comment went unanswered.",
      "The outbreak appeared to involve Klebsiella oxytoca, a multidrug-resistant bacteria, and enterobacter cloacae, which caused blood infections in the babies.",
      "It was the latest public blow to Mexico\u2019s tottering, underfunded healthcare system. Last month, the director of the country\u2019s flagship national cardiology institute said the hospital didn\u2019t have money to buy essential supplies, calling the situation \u201ccritical.\u201d",
      "Dr. Jorge Gaspar, the hospital\u2019s director, wrote an internal letter saying that budget cuts \u201chave affected the acquisition of supplies necessary for the institution\u2019s functioning.\u201d In a subsequent public letter the next day, he clarified that the initial message was intended for an \u201cinternal\u201d audience and assured the public that \u201cwe are working to solve the situation.\u201d",
      "Mexico has been plagued by contaminated medical supply scandals for years.",
      "In 2023, authorities arrested an anesthesiologist they blamed for an outbreak of meningitis that killed 35 patients and sickened 79.",
      "The doctor, whose name was withheld, apparently carried his own morphine from one private hospital to another, spreading a fungal infection that contaminated the medication at the first clinic, authorities said.",
      "The drug may not have been stored properly. Some smaller hospitals or maternity clinics in Mexico don\u2019t have their own dispensing pharmacies or are not authorized to handle controlled medications like opiates, and thus long relied on anesthesiologists to bring their own.",
      "In 2020, 14 people died after a hospital run by Mexico\u2019s state-owned oil company gave a drug to dialysis patients that was contaminated with bacteria. More than 69 patients were sickened in that outbreak.",
      "Former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30, frequently complained that drug supply companies were charging too much, and so he essentially revamped the whole medical purchasing system, pledging to provide Mexicans healthcare that is \u201cbetter than in Denmark.\u201d",
      "However, the new system of government-run warehouses has foundered, plagued by chronic shortages of supplies and drugs, while a gargantuan government supply depot L\u00f3pez Obrador set up and called the \u201cmega drug store\u201d now sits largely empty.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. health panel says women should have the option of taking their own test samples for cervical cancer screening",
      "Women should have the option of taking their own test samples for cervical cancer screening, an influential health panel said Tuesday.",
      "Draft recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are aimed at getting more people screened and spreading the word that women can take their own vaginal samples to check for cancer-causing HPV.",
      "Women in their 20s should still get a Pap test every three years. But after that \u2014 from age 30 to 65 \u2014 women can get an HPV test every five years, the panel said.",
      "And those HPV tests can be done with samples collected either by a doctor or by the patient herself in a mobile clinic or medical office. Women ages 30 to 65 can still opt for a Pap test done by a doctor every three years, or a Pap plus an HPV test every five years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very hopeful that self-collection will help even more women get screened and help us reduce even further the burden of cervical cancer among women,\u201d said task force vice chair Dr. John Wong of Tufts University School of Medicine.",
      "Earlier this year, U.S. regulators expanded the use of two HPV test kits to include self-collection. Studies show women and doctors take samples with similar accuracy.",
      "For now, the tests are only for use in health care settings; home testing may be on the horizon.",
      "HPV, or human papillomavirus, is very common and is spread through sex. Most HPV infections clear up on their own, but persistent infection can lead to cancer of the cervix. Most cervical cancers occur in women who are inadequately screened, diagnosed or treated.",
      "To collect a sample, a swab or brush from the kit is inserted into the vagina and rotated. It is put in a tube and processed at a lab.",
      "The HPV tests detect high-risk types of the virus. In contrast, a Pap test looks for abnormal cells in the cervix.",
      "Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden already use self-collection for cervical cancer screening.",
      "Deaths from cervical cancers have declined in the U.S. in the past decade, and there is an HPV vaccine recommended for preteens that is preventing cancer in women and men. Still, nearly 14,000 new cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed in the U.S. this year and there were an estimated 4,360 deaths.",
      "Black women, Native American women and Hispanic women still have higher death rates compared to white women. Women living in isolated areas also have higher than average death rates.",
      "For many women, transgender men and nonbinary people, collecting their own sample could be more comfortable than the stirrups and speculum used by a doctor.",
      "The draft advice remains largely the same as the group's previous recommendations from 2018. For example, women younger than 21 don't need to be screened for cervical cancer. Neither do women older than 65 who've had regular screenings with normal results. And women of any age who've had a total hysterectomy don't need to be screened.",
      "The recommendations are open for comment through Jan. 13.",

Mangione was arrested at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, while carrying a gun, mask and writings linking him to the ambush.",
      "Mangione is being held without bail in Pennsylvania on charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. Late Monday, Manhattan prosecutors charged him with five counts, including murder, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a forged instrument.",

      "She declined to comment on the investigation into the Dec. 4 shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson or reports that writings belonging to the suspect, Luigi Mangione, said insurance companies care more about profits than their customers.",
      "\u201cThis is horrific,\u201d Jean-Pierre said of the fatal shooting of Thompson as he walked in Manhattan.",
      "He didn\u2019t appear to say anything as deputies led him to a waiting car outside.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful to the men and women of law enforcement whose efforts to solve the horrific murder of Brian Thompson led to the arrest of a suspect in Pennsylvania,\u201d Gov. Hochul said in the statement. \u201cI am coordinating with the District Attorney\u2019s Office and will sign a request for a governor\u2019s warrant to ensure this individual is tried and held accountable. Public safety is my top priority and I\u2019ll do everything in my power to keep the streets of New York safe.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s according to a spokesperson for the governor who said Gov. Hochul will do it as soon as possible.",
      "Luigi Nicholas Mangione, the suspect in the fatal shooting of a healthcare executive in New York City, apparently was living a charmed life: the grandson of a wealthy real estate developer, valedictorian of his elite Baltimore prep school and with degrees from one of the nation\u2019s top private universities.",
      "Friends at an exclusive co-living space at the edge of touristy Waikiki in Hawaii where the 26-year-old Mangione once lived widely considered him a \u201cgreat guy,\u201d and pictures on his social media accounts show a fit, smiling, handsome young man on beaches and at parties.",
      "Now, investigators in New York and Pennsylvania are working to piece together why Mangione may have diverged from this path to make the violent and radical decision to gun down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in a brazen attack on a Manhattan street.",
      "The killing sparked widespread discussions about corporate greed, unfairness in the medical insurance industry and even inspired folk-hero sentiment toward his killer.",
      "\u25b6 Read more about Luigi Mangione",
      "Peter Weeks, the Blair County district attorney, says he\u2019ll work with New York officials to try to return suspect Luigi Mangione there to face charges.",
      "Weeks said the New York charges are \u201cmore serious\u201d than in Blair County.",
      "\u201cWe believe their charges take precedent,\u201d Weeks said, promising to do what\u2019s needed to accommodate New York\u2019s prosecution first.",
      "Weeks spoke to reporters after a brief hearing at which a defense lawyer said Mangione will fight extradition. The defense asked for a hearing on the issue. In the meantime, Mangione will be detained at a state prison in western Pennsylvania.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office said Tuesday it will seek a Governor\u2019s warrant to secure Mangione\u2019s extradition to Manhattan.",
      "Under state law, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul can issue a warrant of arrest demanding Mangione\u2019s return to the state. Such a warrant must recite the facts necessary to the validity of its issuance and be sealed with the state seal. It would then be presented to law enforcement in Pennsylvania to expedite Mangione\u2019s return to New York.",
      "But Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks says it won\u2019t be a substantial barrier to returning Mangione to New York.",
      "He noted that defendants contest extradition \u201call the time,\u201d including in simple retail theft cases.",
      "Dickey, his defense lawyer, questioned whether the second-degree murder charge filed in New York might be eligible for bail under Pennsylvania law, but prosecutors raised concerns about both public safety and Mangione being a potential flight risk, and the judge denied it.",
      "Mangione will continue to be housed at a state prison in Huntingdon.",
      "He has 14 days to challenge the detention.",
      "Prosecutors, meanwhile, have a month to seek a governor\u2019s warrant out of New York.",

      "Other social media companies such as Meta have removed his accounts. According to X rules, the platform removes \u201cany accounts maintained by individual perpetrators of terrorist, violent extremist, or mass violent attacks, as well as any accounts glorifying the perpetrator(s), or dedicated to sharing manifestos and/or third party links where related content is hosted.\u201d",
      "Mangione is not accused of perpetrating a terrorist or mass attack \u2014 he has been charged with murder \u2014 and his account doesn\u2019t appear to share any writings about the case.",
      "He shouted something that was partly unintelligible, but referred to an \u201cinsult to the intelligence of the American people.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s there for an arraignment on local charges stemming from his arrest Monday.",

      "Local defense lawyer Thomas Dickey is expected to represent the 26-year-old at a Tuesday afternoon hearing at the Blair County Courthouse. Dickey declined comment before the hearing.",
      "Mangione could have the Pennsylvania charges read aloud to him and may be asked to enter a plea.",
      "They include possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. In New York, he was charged late Monday with murder in the death of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Mangione likely was motivated by his anger with what he called \u201cparasitic\u201d health insurance companies and a disdain with corporate greed, said a a law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "He wrote that the U.S. has the most expensive healthcare system in the world and that the profits of major corporations continue to rise while \u201cour life expectancy\u201d does not, according to the bulletin, based on a review of the suspect\u2019s hand-written notes and social media postings.",
      "He appeared to view the targeted killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO as a symbolic takedown, asserting in his note that he is the \u201cfirst to face it with such brutal honesty,\u201d the bulletin said.",
      "Mangione called \u201cUnabomber\u201d Ted Kaczynski a \u201cpolitical revolutionary\u201d and may have found inspiration from the man who carried out a series of bombings while railing against modern society and technology, the document said.",
      "A felony warrant filed in New York cites Altoona Officer Christy Wasser as saying she found the writings along with a semi-automatic pistol and an apparent silencer.",
      "The filing echoes earlier statements from NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny who said Mangione had a three-page, handwritten document that shows \u201csome ill will toward corporate America.\u201d",
      "Mangione is now charged in Pennsylvania with being a fugitive of justice.",
      "A customer at the McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where Mangione was arrested said one of his friends had commented beforehand that the man looked like the suspect wanted for the shooting in New York City.",
      "\u201cIt started out almost a little bit like a joke, my one friend thought he looked like the shooter,\u201d said the customer, who declined to give his full name, on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a joke, but we laughed about it,\u201d he added.",
      "The warrant on murder and other charges is a step that could help expedite his extradition from Pennsylvania.",
      "In court papers made public Tuesday, a New York City police detective reiterated key findings in the investigation he said tied Mangione to the killing, including surveillance footage and a fake ID he used to check into a Manhattan hostel on Nov. 24.",
      "Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania, found that ID when they arrested Mangione on Monday.",
      "Mangione is being held without bail in Pennsylvania on charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. Late Monday, Manhattan prosecutors charged him with five counts, including murder, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a forged instrument.",
      "Mangione doesn\u2019t yet have a lawyer who can speak on his behalf, court officials said.",
      "Images of Mangione released Tuesday by Pennsylvania State Police showed him pulling down his mask in the corner of the McDonald\u2019s while holding what appeared to be hash browns and wearing a winter jacket and ski cap. In another photo from a holding cell, he stood unsmiling with rumpled hair.",
      "Mangione\u2019s cousin, Maryland lawmaker Nino Mangione, announced Tuesday morning that he\u2019s postponing a fundraiser planned later this week at the Hayfields Country Club north of Baltimore, which was purchased by the Mangione family in 1986.",
      "\u201cBecause of the nature of this terrible situation involving my Cousin I do not believe it is appropriate to hold my fundraising event scheduled for this Thursday at Hayfields,\u201d Nino Mangione said in a social media post. \u201cI want to thank you for your thoughts, prayers, and support. My family and I are heartbroken and ask that you remember the family of Mr. Thompson in your prayers. Thank you.\u201d",
      "Officers used New York City\u2019s muscular surveillance system. Investigators analyzed DNA samples, fingerprints and internet addresses. Police went door to door looking for witnesses.",
      "When an arrest came five days later, those sprawling investigative efforts shared credit with an alert civilian\u2019s instincts. A customer at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Pennsylvania noticed another patron who resembled the man in the oblique security-camera photos New York police had publicized.",
      "He remains jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. By late Monday evening, prosecutors in Manhattan had added a charge of murder, according to an online court docket.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether Luigi Nicholas Mangione has an attorney who can comment on the allegations. Asked at Monday\u2019s arraignment whether he needed a public defender, Mangione asked whether he could \u201canswer that at a future date.\u201d"

      "The mission\u2019s call follows increasing alarm over a reported suspension of medical education and training for women and girls.",
      "Authorities have neither confirmed the suspension nor responded to the reports, which said that Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada has ordered educational institutions to stop providing medical courses for females.",
      "The U.N. mission said that the theme for this year\u2019s International Human Rights Day emphasized how rights empowered people to build a better future.",
      "\u201cRegrettably, we continue to see the opposite unfold in Afghanistan,\u201d said Roza Otunbayeva, who is the head of the mission. \u201cThere is an ongoing, dangerous erosion of human rights protections, with women and girls bearing the brunt.\u201d",
      "The human rights record of authorities was especially marked by their systemic discrimination against women and girls, who are excluded from most areas of daily and public life, including education and work, according to the mission.",
      "\u201cIf Afghans, in particular women and girls, continue to be denied their rights, this constitutes a clear and intentional failure to protect and be responsible for the well-being of all who live in Afghanistan,\u201d said Fiona Frazer, representative of the U.N.

      "Haqqani leads a powerful network blamed for some of the bloodiest attacks against Afghanistan\u2019s former Western-backed government.",
      "But, in the past three years, he has made some speeches acknowledging the hardships facing Afghans and alluding to his discontent with the Taliban's current style of leadership and decision-making.",
      "Those in government shouldn't be narrow-minded, Haqqani said in a 12-minute audio file shared by the Interior Ministry with The Associated Press on Monday. He didn't mention any names.",
      "\u201cWe should not think the sky will fall if people do not follow us,\u201d the minister said. The government was unresponsive to people because it didn't have answers to their questions, creating a challenge within the Taliban's Islamic system, he said.",
      "Haqqani is still wanted by the U.S. on an up to $10 million bounty over his involvement in an attack that killed an American citizen and other assaults."

      "The suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO struggled with deputies and shouted while arriving for a court appearance in Pennsylvania a day after he was arrested at a McDonald\u2019s and charged with murder",
      "ALTOONA, Pa. -- The man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO struggled with deputies and shouted while being led into court Tuesday as new details emerged about his possible motivation behind the ambush.",
      "In his first public words since a five-day search ended with his arrest at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, Luigi Nicholas Mangione emerged from a patrol car shouting about an \u201cinsult to the intelligence of the American people\u201d while deputies pushed him inside a courthouse.",
      "The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland real estate family is fighting attempts to extradite him to New York so that he can face a murder charge in the Manhattan killing of Brian Thompson, who led the United States\u2019 largest medical insurance company.",
      "A law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press said that at the time of his arrest, Mangione was carrying a handwritten document expressing anger with what he called \u201cparasitic\u201d health insurance companies and a disdain for corporate greed and power.",
      "He wrote that the U.S. has the most expensive health care system in the world and that profits of major corporations continue to rise while \u201cour life expectancy\u201d does not, according to the bulletin.",
      "In social media posts, Mangione called \u201cUnabomber\u201d Ted Kaczynski \u2014 who carried out a series of bombings while railing against modern society and technology \u2014 a \u201cpolitical revolutionary,\u201d according to the police bulletin.",
      "Mangione remained jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors were beginning to take steps to bring Mangione to New York, but at a brief hearing Tuesday, defense lawyer Thomas Dickey said his client will not waive extradition and instead wants a hearing on the issue. Mangione was denied bail after prosecutors said he was too dangerous to be released.",
      "He mostly stared straight ahead at the hearing, occasionally looking at papers, rocking in his chair or looking back at the gallery. At one point, he began to speak to respond to the court discussion but was quieted by his lawyer.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t rush to judgment in this case or any case,\u201d Dickey said afterward. \u201cHe\u2019s presumed innocent. Let\u2019s not forget that.\u201d",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Tuesday night on the social platform X that she will sign \u201ca request for a governor\u2019s warrant to ensure the suspect in the murder of Brian Thompson is held accountable in New York.\u201d",
      "Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City, after a McDonald\u2019s customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said.",
      "Images of Mangione released Tuesday by Pennsylvania State Police showed him pulling down his mask in the corner of the McDonald's while holding what appeared to be hash browns and wearing a winter jacket and beanie. In another photo from a holding cell, he stood unsmiling with rumpled hair.",
      "New York police officials have said Mangione was carrying a gun like the one used to kill Thompson and the same fake ID the shooter had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs.",
      "A law enforcement official who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity said a three-page, handwritten document found with Mangione included a line in which he claimed to have acted alone.",
      "\u201cTo the Feds, I\u2019ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn\u2019t working with anyone,\u201d the document said, according to the official.",
      "It also said, \u201cI do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming.\u201d",
      "Thompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday as he walked alone to a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. From surveillance video, New York investigators determined the shooter quickly fled the city, likely by bus.",
      "Mangione was born into a life of country clubs and privilege. His grandfather was a self-made real estate developer and philanthropist.",
      "Valedictorian at his elite Baltimore prep school, he went on to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer science in 2020 from the University of Pennsylvania, a spokesperson said.",
      "\u201cOur family is shocked and devastated by Luigi\u2019s arrest,\u201d Mangione\u2019s family said in a statement posted on social media late Monday by his cousin, Maryland Del. Nino Mangione. \u201cWe offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved.\u201d",
      "From January to June 2022, Luigi Mangione lived at Surfbreak, a \u201cco-living\u201d space at the edge of touristy Waikiki in Honolulu.",
      "Like other residents of the shared penthouse catering to remote workers, Mangione underwent a background check, said Josiah Ryan, a spokesperson for owner and founder R.J. Martin.",
      "\u201cLuigi was just widely considered to be a great guy. There were no complaints,\u201d Ryan said. \"There was no sign that might point to these alleged crimes they\u2019re saying he committed.\u201d",
      "At Surfbreak, Martin learned Mangione had severe back pain from childhood that interfered with many aspects of his life, from surfing to romance, Ryan said.",
      "Mangione left Surfbreak to get surgery on the mainland, Ryan said, then later returned to Honolulu and rented an apartment.",
      "Martin stopped hearing from Mangione six months to a year ago.",

    "summary": "Nigeria is the latest African country to give a new malaria vaccine to young childen",
    "story": [
      "Nigeria is the latest African country to give a new malaria vaccine to young childen",
      "BAYELSA, Nigeria -- Ominike Marvis has lost count of the number of times her 6-year-old son has had malaria. So when Nigeria started offering a malaria vaccine, she was eager to protect her youngest child.",
      "She took the 6-month-old baby to get his first shot at a health center in hard-hit Bayelsa state, where the country's vaccination campaign kicked off last week. The vaccine aims to prevent severe illnesses and deaths from the mosquito-borne disease.",
      "\u201cAt least I know he\u2019s safe from it now,\u201d Marvis, 31, said.",
      "Africa accounts for the vast majority of malaria in the world. Nigeria, the continent's most populous country, has the biggest burden with about a quarter of the cases.",
      "According to a World Health Organization report released Wednesday, there were an estimated 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths worldwide last year, mostly in children under 5. That is 11 million more malaria cases compared to 2022 with nearly the same number of deaths.",
      "\u201cNo one should die of malaria, yet the disease continues to disproportionately harm people living in the African region, especially young children and pregnant women,\u201d said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, calling for more support.",
      "There are now 17 countries giving new malaria vaccines to young children, the WHO report said. Nigeria began its campaign last week, offering a vaccine developed by Oxford University.",
      "Research suggests it is more than 75% effective at preventing severe disease and death in the first year and that protection is extended for at least another year with a booster.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s health minister, Muhammad Ali Pate, called the vaccination campaign a \u201cmonumental step\u201d in the country\u2019s efforts to eliminate malaria.",
      "The disease is caused by a parasite that is spread through mosquito bites. Experts say other measures like bed nets and insecticide spraying remain essential to curb the disease.",
      "Experts say Nigeria's population of more than 210 million people, as well as its climate, contribute to its high malaria burden, but so do other factors like poor sanitation and limited tools like treated bed nets.",
      "Besides the lack of funding, WHO report said countries with malaria still grapple with fragile health systems, weak surveillance and drug and insecticide resistance.",
      "But progress has also been made on several fronts, the report said, including in the African region where countries have achieved a 16% reduction in malaria deaths since 2015. And in 83 countries where malaria is present, 25 of them now report fewer than 10 cases a year, the report said.",
      "In the oil-rich but poor Bayelsa state, among the worst-hit in Nigeria, malaria is so common in riverside communities that mothers spoke of how no one in their family has been spared.",
      "\u201cHere, malaria is something we are used to,\u201d said Claris Okah, a community health worker.",
      "Among the challenges health workers like Okah face is hesitancy among parents, so they are educating families about the new vaccine and other steps to prevent malaria.",

    "story": [
      "The European Central Bank is releasing its its decision on interest rates and a rate cut is a foregone conclusion",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- With U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatening new tariffs and political chaos engulfing France, the European Union's second largest economy, the question ahead of the European Central Bank meeting Thursday is not whether it will cut interest rates, but by how much.",
      "Analysts see a quarter-point rate cut from the current ECB benchmark rate of 3.25% as the most likely option when the bank's rate-setting council meets at its skyscraper headquarters in Frankfurt.",
      "But the prospect of a half-point cut isn\u2019t out of the question for the bank and its President Christine Lagarde as new risks that emerged since the bank\u2019s last meeting on Oct. 17 cast a shadow over an already tepid recovery from a post-pandemic stagnation.",
      "Trump\u2019s election victory on Nov. 5 heightened the prospect of a more protectionist U.S. trade policy, such as new or higher tariffs on imported goods, after he takes office on Jan. 20. That sends a cold chill through the business world in Europe, where exports are an outsized contributor to growth and employment.",
      "Yet there are internal risks as well.",
      "French Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned Dec. 5 after losing a vote of confidence, leaving the France without a functioning government and no clear majority in parliament able or willing to tackle the country\u2019s excessive budget deficit. Elections cannot be held before June. While the end of the Barnier government hasn't triggered a financial crisis, it adds uncertainty about how long it will take for France to right its finances.",
      "A half-point cut \u201cwould be a security move to preempt any potential risks for the eurozone economy coming from the next U.S. administration\u2019s potential economic policy choices and political woes in France and Germany,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, chief eurozone economist at ING bank.",
      "Opting for a quarter-point move \u201cwould rather follow the cautious meeting-by-meeting approach\u201d that the bank has pursued since it started cutting rates in June, Brzeski said. One argument for a smaller rate cut might be a reluctance by the ECB to risk the perception that it is getting involved in French national politics: \u201cThis is speculation the ECB would clearly rather avoid,\u201d Brzeski said.",
      "Germany's governing coalition broke up in November, and a new national election is expected Feb. 23. Weeks of coalition negotiations are expected to follow before a new government is in place. That leaves the two biggest eurozone economies politically adrift for months.",
      "All that has dinged the confidence that businesses need to borrow, invest, expand production and take risks. The survey index of purchasing managers compiled by S&P Global came in at 48.3 in November, with levels below 50 suggesting the economy is slowing. The Sentix survey of investor confidence fell in its first update after the U.S. election, by 4.6 points to minus 17.5.",
      "Inflation has fallen steeply to 2.3% from its peak of 10.6% in late 2022, shifting attention from reigning in consumer price increases to worries about ongoing weak growth. The eurozone is expected to grow 0.8% this year and 1.3.% next year, according to forecasts from the European Union's executive commission.",
      "Higher ECB rates helped squelch Europe\u2019s outbreak of inflation in the wake of the pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Higher central bank benchmarks influence borrowing costs throughout the economy, making it more expensive to borrow and spend, and thus taking pressure off prices.",
      "Yet that also presents a danger in that those same high rates could stall the EU's goal of more vigorous economic growth.",
      "A drumbeat of announcements regarding job cuts in coming years at major firms in Germany has not improved the mood. They include auto technology and parts firm Bosch, which plans to drop 5,500 jobs, 3,800 of them in Germany; auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen, which plans to drop 14,000-15,000 jobs; and Ford Motor Co., which is to drop 4,000 jobs in Europe, 2,900 in Germany, and steelmaker ThyssenKrupp with 11,000 planned cuts. Volkswagen plans to shut as many as three German plants, according to its employee representatives who are negotiating with the company in an effort to block the closings.",
      "The ECB determines interest rate policy for the 20 of 27 EU member countries that have joined the euro currency."

      "\u201cMy experience in Lebanon is not good for me. I am really tired,\u201d Bah said. \u201cI want to go home.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of migrant workers in Lebanon are waiting to be repatriated after the ceasefire ending the 14-month war between the Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Israel went into effect last month.",
      "Lebanon has long drawn migrant workers dreaming of building better lives for their families. Enticed by promises of stable jobs and decent pay, they enter Lebanon via recruitment agencies under a sponsorship-based labor system known as Kafala \u2014 only to find themselves often trapped with confiscated passports, long hours, withheld wages and, for many, abuse.",
      "The Kafala system has long been criticized by human rights groups, but the government rarely if ever addresses the criticism. But Bah knew little of that when she came to Lebanon in 2022. She was promised a job at a supermarket with a $200 monthly salary, she said. Instead, she was sent to care for an older woman once she arrived.",
      "Within a month of her arrival, her 3-year-old son back home fell ill and died. She said she was not given the time to grieve and fled her employer\u2019s house. Since her employer held her passport and other documents, Bah said she had to leave them behind.",
      "Her experience in Lebanon then took a darker turn. One day she and five housemates were picked up by a taxi driver who said he would take them home. Instead, she said, the driver dropped them at the wrong spot. As they tried and failed to find another cab, a group of men chased them and raped them.",
      "\u201cMen were coming and they were cheering for us,\u201d said Bah, who gave her consent to be named. \u201cThey beat us and they had sex with us.\u201d She said it took her about two weeks to recover and resume work at two hotels. Without documents, migrants can hesitate to go to police.",
      "Two months later, she and another friend found out they were pregnant.",
      "Bah recounted the experience as she watched her baby\u2019s wobbly footsteps.",
      "With war, their lives became more precarious. When Israel intensified its bombardment of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in September, Bah fled the area with her baby and friends on foot.",
      "Not every migrant worker escaped the attacks. An estimated 37 have been killed and 150 wounded since October 2023, said Joelle Mhanna with the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration.",
      "There were few places to turn. Most government-run shelters refused to take in displaced people who were not Lebanese, said activist Dea Hajj Shaheen. After supporting migrant women during previous crises in Lebanon, she stepped in again along with other volunteers.",
      "To house over 200 women from Sierra Leone including Bah, they repurposed an abandoned space owned by her family \u2014 a former car dealership that was later a venue for pop-up events and named The Shelter.",
      "The kitchen was alive with activity as women cooked, some dancing to Nigerian music. In another area, rows of thin mattresses lay in the dim light from broken windows. Despite the modest conditions, the women set up a Christmas tree crafted from sticks.",
      "While some migrants have been accepted at government-run shelters, there were regular reports of others being evicted or denied access, the IOM said.",
      "Some migrants hesitate to approach the government shelters for fear of detention or deportation, Mhanna said. \u201cAs a result, most are being hosted by embassies, NGOs and community-based organizations including churches, monasteries and other religious groups.\u201d",
      "The Lebanese government has not directly addressed the issue of migrant workers being rejected from government-run shelters, despite repeated calls for action from rights organizations and the United Nations.",
      "Moving on from the shelters they found posed another challenge for migrants like Bah, as many had passports and other documents confiscated by former employers.",
      "\u201cWe had to secure exit permits, immigration clearances and even child travel documents for the five children in this group,\u201d said Shaheen, who coordinated the repatriation last month of 120 women and their children with the support of IOM, who chartered the flight.",
      "IOM said it has received requests from around 10,000 migrants seeking to be repatriated, a small fraction of the over 175,000 in Lebanon.",
      "As of Nov. 26, the IOM had supported over 400 migrants to return home. That included two charter flights for people from Bangladesh and Sierra Leone. It wasn't clear how many more flights are planned. or to where.",
      "Laughter and cheer filled Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport on Nov. 19. The women from Sierra Leone arrived in groups, dragging suitcases and sharing hugs. Some danced in celebration for their long-awaited flight.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy in Lebanon,\u201d said Amanata Thullah after four years. \u201cI am happy to be going back to my country.\"",
      "Mariam Sesay, who described herself as the head of Sierra Leone's community in Lebanon, said there had been \u201ca lot of distress and trauma\u201d in recent months.",
      "Bah was not among those leaving, but she said she and others at the shelter were happy to see friends return home.",
      "She now awaits her turn, along with over 50 others.",
      "At first she was told she needed official documents for her baby and the father\u2019s consent to travel. But a lawyer waived the requirement due to her circumstances, Shaheen said.",
      "\u201cI wish to go back home to continue my education,\u201d Bah said. \u201cSince I was little, I always wanted to be a computer science student, because I\u2019m good at that.\u201d",
      "She looked down at Blessing. \u201cNow I have something to take care of,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I watch her walk or laugh, that gives me joy.\u201d",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Mali\u2019s armed forces, supported by Russian mercenaries, committed abuses against civilians since the withdrawal of a U.N. peacekeeping mission late last year, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday.",
      "Malian armed forces and the Russia-backed Wagner Group deliberately killed at least 32 civilians, including seven in a drone strike, kidnapped four others, and burned at least 100 homes in towns and villages in central and northern Mali since May, the rights group said.",
      "Human Rights Watch also accused jihadi groups in the region of having summarily executed at least 47 civilians and displaced thousands of people since June. It said the groups burned thousands of houses and looted livestock, which is vital to the survival of the nomadic communities in the region.",
      "\u201cThe Malian army with the Wagner Group and Islamist armed groups have been targeting civilians and their property in violation of the laws of war,\u201d Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in the report.",
      "Mali, along with its neighbors Burkina Faso and Niger, has for over a decade battled an insurgency fought by jihadi groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Following military coups in all three nations in recent years, the ruling juntas have expelled French forces and turned to Russia\u2019s mercenary units for security assistance.",
      "Wagner has been present in Mali since late 2021 following a military coup, replacing French troops and international peacekeepers to help fight the militants. At the same time, the mercenary group has been accused of helping to carry out raids and drone strikes that have killed civilians.",
      "In December last year, the United Nations ended its decade long peacekeeping mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA following the government\u2019s request that alleged the force was inadequate to respond to the insurgency.",
      "\u201cSince MINUSMA left Mali a year ago, it has been extremely difficult to get comprehensive information on abuses, and we are deeply concerned that the situation is even worse than reported,\u201d Allegrozzi said.",

      "More than 600,000 people annually visit Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park in the small town of Rovaniemi in Finland",
      "ROVANIEMI, Finland -- Shuffling across icy ground on a cold December afternoon, lots of tourist groups poured into Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park perched on the edge of the Arctic Circle.",
      "They frolic in the snow, take a reindeer sleigh ride, sip a cocktail in an ice bar or even meet Saint Nick himself in the capital of Finnish Lapland, Rovaniemi, which happily calls itself the \u201cofficial hometown of Santa Claus.\"",
      "The Santa Claus Village theme park, which attracts more than 600,000 people annually, is especially popular during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cThis is like my dream came true,\u201d beamed Polish visitor Elzbieta Nazaruk. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to be here.\u201d",
      "Tourism is booming in Rovaniemi \u2014 which has hotel and restaurant owners, as well as city officials, excited as it brings lots of money to the town. However, not everyone is happy about the onslaught of visitors, 10 times the town's population, each year at Christmas time.",
      "\u201cWe are worried about the overgrowth of tourism. Tourism has grown so rapidly, it\u2019s not anymore in control,\u201d said 43-year-old Antti Pakkanen, a photographer and member of a housing network that in September organized a rally through the city\u2019s streets.",
      "It\u2019s a feeling that has been echoed in other popular European travel destinations, including Barcelona, Amsterdam, Malaga and Florence.",
      "Across the continent, locals have protested against \u201cover-tourism\u201d \u2014 which generally describes the tipping point at which visitors and their cash stop benefiting residents and instead cause harm by degrading historic sites, overwhelming infrastructure and making life markedly more difficult for those who live there.",
      "Now, it seems to have spread north, all the way to the edges of the Arctic Circle.",
      "Rovaniemi counted a record 1.2 million overnight visitors in 2023, almost 30 percent growth on 2022, after rebounding from pandemic travel disruptions.",
      "\u201cNordic is a trend,\u201d Visit Rovaniemi CEO Sanna Karkkainen, said as she stood in an ice restaurant, where snow carvers were working nearby.",
      "\u201cPeople want to travel to cool countries to see the snow, to see the Northern Lights, and, of course, to see Santa Claus,\" she added.",
      "Thirteen new flight routes to Rovaniemi Airport opened this year, bringing passengers from Geneva, Berlin, Bordeaux and more. Most tourists come from European countries like France, Germany and the UK, but Rovaniemi\u2019s appeal has also spread further.",
      "Hotel availability is scarce this winter, and Tiina M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4, general manager of the 159-room Original Sokos Hotel, expects 2024 to break more records.",
      "Local critics of mass tourism say many apartment buildings in Rovaniemi\u2019s city center are also used for accommodation services during peak season and are thus no longer available for residential use. They say the proliferation of short-term rentals has driven up prices, squeezed out long-term residents, and turned its city center into a \u201ctransient space for tourists.\"",
      "Finnish law prohibits professional accommodation services in buildings intended for residential use, so campaigners are calling on authorities to act.",
      "\u201cThe rules must be enforced better,\u201d said Pakkanen.",
      "Not everyone agrees. Mayor Ulla-Kirsikka Vainio notes some make \u201cgood money\u201d on short-term rentals.",
      "Either way, stricter regulations likely won\u2019t be in place to impact this winter season, and despite the unease expressed by locals, mass tourism to Rovaniemi is probably only going to grow in 2025 \u2014 as visitors want to experience the unique atmosphere up north, especially during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas time and we would love to see the Northern Lights,\u201d says Joy, a visitor from Bangkok. \u201cRovaniemi seems to be a good place.\u201d"

      "The Australian government says it will tax large digital platforms and search engines unless they agree to share revenue with Australian news media organizations",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government said Thursday it will tax large digital platforms and search engines unless they agree to share revenue with Australian news media organizations.",
      "The tax would apply from Jan. 1 to tech companies that earn more than 250 million Australian dollars ($160 million) a year in revenue from Australia, Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones and Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said.",
      "They include Meta, Google-owner Alphabet and ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok.",
      "The tax would be offset through money paid to Australian media organizations. The size of the tax is not clear. But the government aims to make sharing revenue with media organizations the cheaper option.",
      "\"The real objective ... is not to raise revenue -- we hope not to raise any revenue. The real objective is to incentivize agreement-making between platforms and news media businesses in Australia,\u201d Jones told reporters.",
      "The move comes after Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, announced that it would not renew three-year deals to pay Australian news publishers for their content.",
      "A previous government introduced in 2021 laws called the News Media Bargaining Code that forced tech giants to strike revenue-sharing deals with Australian media companies or face fines of 10% of their Australian revenue.",
      "Meta said in a statement the current law was flawed and the U.S. company continued to have \u201cconcerns about charging one industry to subsidise another.\u201d",
      "\"The proposal fails to account for the realities of how our platforms work, specifically that most people don\u2019t come to our platforms for news content and that news publishers voluntarily choose to post content on our platforms because they receive value from doing so,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Google has struck revenue-sharing agreements with more than 80 Australian news companies in the past three years and has committed to renewing those deals.",
      "But Google has raised doubts about the government's new approach.",
      "\u201cThe government\u2019s introduction of a targeted tax risks the ongoing viability of commercial deals with news publishers in Australia,\u201d a Google statement said.",
      "\u201cWe are reviewing today\u2019s announcement and will have more to say once we\u2019ve assessed the full impact,\u201d Google added.",
      "TikTok noted that its users didn't seek news.",
      "\u201cAs an entertainment platform, TikTok has never been the go to place for news. We will actively engage in the consultation process and look forward to hearing more details,\u201d a TikTok statement said.",
      "Jones said Australian officials had explained the government's intentions to their counterparts in the United States, where most of the digital giants are headquartered. President-elect Donald Trump's administration is planning to increase tariffs against some countries, which has the potential to trigger trade wars.",
      "\u201cWe want to ensure that they understand the reasoning, also understand that this is not a tax in the normal sense of the word,\u201d Jones said.",
      "\u201cThis is an incentive to bolster up a law that has existed in Australia since 2021,\u201d he added.",
      "Rowland said the revenue-sharing was needed to safeguard Australian democracy.",
      "\u201cThe rapid growth of digital platforms in recent years has disrupted Australia\u2019s media landscape and it is threatening the viability of public interest journalism,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "\u201cThe policy intent here is very clear. It is to incentivize deals between digital platforms, search engines, and Australian news publishers in order to support the health of our democracy,\u201d she added."

      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Argentina's government on Wednesday accused its Venezuelan counterpart of continually harassing six members of the political opposition who have been sheltering for months in the Argentine diplomatic compound in the capital, Caracas.",
      "It also urged the Organization of American States to pressure Venezuela to allow the safe departure of the six people to Argentina.",
      "Argentine Foreign Minister Gerardo Werhein said the Venezuelan government is subjecting them to a \u201cstrategy of physical exhaustion\u201d and \u201cpsychological terror\u201d through prolonged harassment. The four men and two women have lived at the ambassador\u2019s residence since March to avoid arrest.",
      "\u201cThe Venezuelan government has not only denied the safe passage that would allow their safe departure, but has adopted totally unacceptable harassment actions,\u201d Werhein said during a session of the OAS\u2019 permanent council. \u201cThe asylum seekers are subjected to water cuts, interruptions in electricity, restrictions on the entry of food and the constant presence of security forces in the vicinity of the diplomatic headquarters.\u201d",
      "The group living at the ambassador\u2019s home includes the campaign manager and communications director of opposition powerhouse Maria Corina Machado. The government of President Javier Milei allowed them into the compound after authorities loyal to the ruling party issued warrants for their arrest, accusing them of promoting alleged acts of violence to destabilize the country.",
      "Since late November, the group has denounced the constant presence outside the residence of Venezuelan intelligence service agents and police. It has also accused the government of cutting electricity and water services.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s Minister of Interior Diosdado Cabello last week called the group\u2019s allegations a \u201cfarce.\u201d",
      "Werhein, however, on Wednesday accused the Venezuelan government of violating international law that enshrines the right to asylum and the inviolability of diplomatic offices in any country. He urged the members of the regional organization to act firmly or risk being judged by their inaction.",
      "As time goes by, \u201cthe anguish and uncertainty for those seeking asylum increases,\u201d he said.",
      "In August, Brazil accepted Argentina\u2019s request to guard the diplomatic compound in Caracas after Maduro\u2019s government expelled its diplomats following Venezuela\u2019s July presidential election. The vote\u2019s disputed results, which Venezuelan electoral authorities claimed favor Maduro, prompted Milei to declare that he would not recognize \u201canother fraud.\u201d That drew the anger of Maduro and his allies.",
      "But a month later, Venezuela revoked Brazil\u2019s authorization to guard the facility, alleging it had evidence of the use of the premises \u201cfor the planning of terrorist activities and assassination attempts.\u201d",
      "Brazil and Argentina have rejected those accusations.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s protracted political crisis deepened after the July 28 presidential election. The country\u2019s National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared him the election winner hours after polls closed. But unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts.",
      "Meanwhile, the opposition, led by Machado, collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation\u2019s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said the voting records showed that the faction\u2019s candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, had won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro.",
      "On Wednesday, more than a dozen members of the Organization of American States joined Argentina\u2019s call on Maduro\u2019s government to allow the safe passage of those living at the ambassador\u2019s residence.",
      "\u201cThe continued harassment endangers the safety of the mission and individuals who may be seeking temporary refuge,\u201d U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement after the organization's session. \u201cWe call for Maduro and his representatives to stop issuing politically motivated arrest warrants for members of the democratic opposition and to guarantee safe conduct for those sheltered in the Argentine Embassy.\u201d",

      "He spoke hours before the main opposition Democratic Party submits a new impeachment motion against him for a floor vote this weekend. Parliament on Thursday afternoon passed motions to impeach national police chief Cho Ji Ho and Justice Minister Park Sung Jae, suspending them from official duties, over their enforcement of martial law.",
      "Yoon\u2019s Dec. 3 martial law declaration has generated political chaos and large protests calling for his ouster. The decree brought hundreds of armed troops attempting to encircle parliament and raid the election commission, though no major violence or injuries occurred. Martial law lasted only six hours as Yoon was forced to lift it after the National Assembly unanimously voted it down.",
      "Yoon, a conservative, said he enacted martial law as a warning to the liberal Democratic Party, which controls parliament. He called the party \u201ca monster\u201d and \u201canti-state forces\u201d that he said tried to use its legislative muscle to impeach top officials, undermined the government\u2019s budget bill for next year and sympathized with North Korea.",
      "\u201cI will fight to the end to prevent the forces and criminal groups that have been responsible for paralyzing the country\u2019s government and disrupting the nation\u2019s constitutional order from threatening the future of the Republic of Korea,\u201d Yoon said.",
      "\u201cThe opposition is now doing a sword dance of chaos, claiming that the declaration of martial law constitutes to an act of rebellion. But was it really?\u201d he said.",
      "Yoon said martial law was an act of governance that cannot be the subject of investigations and doesn\u2019t amount to rebellion. He said the deployment of nearly 300 soldiers to the National Assembly was designed to maintain order, not dissolve or paralyze it.",
      "The Democratic Party quickly dismissed Yoon\u2019s statement as \u201can expression of extreme delusion\u201d and \u201ca declaration of war against the people.\u201d Kim Min-seok, head of a party task force, accused the president of attempting to incite pro-Yoon riots by far-right forces. He said the Democratic Party will focus on getting the motion impeaching Yoon passed on Saturday.",
      "It's unclear how Yoon's comments will affect his fate. Opposition parties hold 192 seats combined, eight votes short of a two-thirds majority of the 300 members of the National Assembly. The earlier attempt to impeach Yoon failed with most lawmakers from Yoon\u2019s governing People Power Party boycotting the vote.",
      "Yoon's speech was expected to deepen a divide inside the PPP. When party chair Han Dong-hun, a critic of Yoon, called Yoon's statement \u201ca confession of rebellion\u201d during a party meeting, Yoon loyalists angrily jeered and called on Han to stop speaking. Han has urged party members to vote in favor of Yoon's impeachment.",
      "Opposition parties and even some PPP members say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. South Korean law allows the president to declare martial law during wartime or similar emergencies, and they said such a situation did not exist. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the constitution doesn\u2019t give a president such rights in any situation.",
      "The country's law enforcement authorities are investigating whether Yoon and others involved in imposing martial law committed rebellion, abuse of power and other crimes. A conviction for rebellion carries a maximum penalty of death.",
      "The National Assembly on Thursday passed a bill that could introduce an independent counsel to investigate Yoon on rebellion charges without his approval. A bill it endorsed earlier this week on appointing an independent counsel requires Yoon's approval. The Justice Ministry on Monday placed an oversea travel ban on Yoon.",
      "South Korean law gives a president immunity from prosecution while in office, except for allegations of rebellion or treason. This means that Yoon can be questioned and detained by investigative agencies over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.",
      "On Wednesday, Yoon\u2019s presidential security service didn't allow police to search the presidential office.",
      "Yoon's statement was seen as an about-face. Last Saturday, he apologized over declaring martial law and said he wouldn't avoid responsibility for it. He said he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the political turmoil, \u201cincluding matters related to my term in office.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, Yoon's former defense minister, Kim Yong Hyun, was arrested on allegations of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power. The national police chief, Cho, and the head of Seoul's metropolitan police have been detained while their actions of sending police forces to the National Assembly are investigated as a criminal matter.",
      "Park, the impeached justice minister, has faced suspicions raised by the opposition that he was involved in the planning and execution of Yoon\u2019s martial law decree. Park has denied the accusations.",
      "Kim, who resigned after martial law was lifted, is one of Yoon\u2019s close associates. He has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. He tried to kill himself in detention, but correctional officers stopped him and he was in stable condition, according to the Justice Ministry.",
      "In his speech Thursday, Yoon said he had discussed imposing martial law only with Kim before he informed other top officials about it at a Cabinet meeting just before its declaration.",
      "On the night of Dec. 3, besides the National Assembly, Yoon and Kim sent troops to the National Election Commission. That raised speculation that he might have tried to seize computer servers at the commission as he believed unfounded rumors that the results of April's parliamentary elections, in which his party suffered steep losses, were rigged.",
      "Yoon said he asked Kim to examine the supposed vulnerabilities of the commission's computer systems, which Yoon said was hampering the credibility of election results. He accused the commission of resisting a thorough inspection by Seoul\u2019s spy agency following a cyberattack attributed to North Korea-backed hackers last year.",
      "If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to remove him from office or restore his powers. If he is dismissed, a new presidential election would be required within 60 days.",

      "TOKYO -- Embattled Japanese automaker Nissan has tapped Jeremie Papin, who was overseeing its U.S. operations, as its chief financial officer in a major management reshuffle billed as key to a turnaround.",
      "The move as announced in the United States on Thursday. It means Papin, chairman of Nissan\u2019s Americas Management Committee, replaces Stephen Ma, who will oversee Nissan Motor Corp.\u2019s China operations.",
      "Ma\u2019s replacement had been speculated about for some time, given Nissan\u2019s problems in the key U.S. market, lately dominated by Tesla, Toyota and Ford.",
      "Last month, Nissan said it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "That was a reversal from the 190.7 billion yen profit recorded the same quarter a year ago. Sales for the quarter through September fell to 2.9 trillion yen ($19 billion) from 3.1 trillion yen.",
      "Chief Executive Makoto Uchida took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the results and acknowledged Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "\u201cThese executive changes reflect the experience and urgency needed to get the company back on track,\u201d Uchida said in a statement. \u201cNissan will continue to focus on future growth and steadily execute these turnaround efforts to ensure sustainable profitability.\u201d",
      "Papin will steer a recovery, given his experience in strategy, business development and investment banking, according to Nissan, which makes the Leaf electric car, Rogue SUV and Infiniti luxury models.",
      "A citizen of both the U.S. and France, Papin was initially with the French automaker Renault SA, with which Nissan formed an alliance since 1999. In 2023, he was named to Nissan\u2019s executive committee, helping shape its growth plans. Previously, Papin worked for more than a decade as a financial analyst at Deutsche Bank, Lehman Brothers and Nomura.",
      "As part of the moves, effective Jan. 1, Christian Meunier, the former chief executive of Jeep, returns to Nissan as chairman of the Americas Management Committee.",
      "Asako Hoshino will continue to oversee the customer experience, while Shohei Yamazaki, China Management Committee chairman, takes over a part of her role and will oversee the Japan-ASEAN region.",
      "Last month, Fitch lowered its outlook on Nissan from stable to negative, citing its performance in the North American market, noting it may lower its ratings if weakness continues.",
      "Nissan\u2019s stock price has declined steadily over the last half year from about 500 yen ($3.30) to about 360 yen ($2.40).",

      "The British government has indefinitely banned puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria after independent experts found there was an unacceptable safety risk in prescribing the medication",
      "LONDON -- The British government on Wednesday indefinitely banned puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria after independent experts found there was an unacceptable safety risk in prescribing the medication.",
      "The decision, which will be revisited in 2027, effectively bans a common approach to medical gender transitions for youths. It also goes against standards held by medical groups elsewhere, including the European and World Professional Associations for Transgender Health, as well as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "The ban will prevent prescribing medications that can suppress or pause puberty in children with gender dysphoria, providing more time to consider options that could include gender reassignment.",
      "The announcement comes after a judge this summer upheld an emergency ban in a ruling that said the treatment was potentially harmful. The emergency ban was put in place by the center-right Conservative government and has now been extended by the center-left Labour government.",
      "The ban does not apply to those already receiving puberty blockers for gender dysphoria, to their use in clinical studies or in treatment of children with precocious puberty, an uncommon medical condition that causes puberty to begin abnormally early.",
      "It applies across the United Kingdom after consultation with the Scottish and Welsh governments, and an agreement with Northern Ireland.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said a clinical trial will be set up next year to better evaluate use of the drugs.",
      "\u201cWe need to act with caution and care when it comes to this vulnerable group of young people, and follow the expert advice,\u201d Streeting said.",
      "The National Health Service in England stopped prescribing puberty blockers at gender identity clinics last year, saying there was not enough evidence about the benefits and harms.",
      "In July, Justice Beverley Lang said a review commissioned by the NHS found \u201cvery substantial risks and very narrow benefits\u201d to the treatment. She concluded that gender care is an area of \u201cremarkably weak evidence\u201d and young people have been caught up in a \u201cstormy social discourse.\u201d",
      "The British Medical Association, which noted that the NHS review was controversial and included patients, academics, scientists and legal experts among its critics, voted to carry out an evidence-led evaluation of that report.",
      "The court challenge was brought by the group TransActual and a youth who cannot be named, according to a court order.",
      "TransActual criticized Wednesday's decision, saying that evidence of danger from 40 years of puberty blockers remains elusive.",
      "\u201cBanning medicines with no evidence of serious harm, only for trans people \u2026 is discrimination plain and simple,\u201d said Keyne Walker, the group\u2019s strategy director. \u201cEvidence of the harm of the temporary ban continues to emerge, and will grow now that it has been made permanent.\u201d",

      "\u201cI saw him and said my goodbyes,\u201d he said. His gaze lingered on the blackened body of Sami Chaeeb, whose teeth were bared and whose eye sockets were empty. It looked as if he had died screaming. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look normal. He doesn\u2019t even have eyes.\u201d",
      "The dead man was jailed five months ago, disappearing into a dark prison system under the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. His body is just one of many found in Syrian detention centers and prisons since Assad's government fell last weekend.",
      "Some of the prisoners died just weeks ago. Others perished months earlier. Syrians across the world are now circulating images of the bodies in hope of seeing slain loved ones whose fate had been a mystery.",
      "At the morgue visited by The Associated Press on Wednesday in Damascus, families flocked to a wall where some of the pictures were pinned in a haunting gallery of the dead. Relatives desperately scanned the images for a recognizable face.",
      "Mohammad Chaeeb never knew why his brother had been imprisoned. \u201cWe heard stories \u2014 cannabis, organ trafficking, drugs, weapon trading. But he had nothing to do with any of that,\u201d he said.",
      "He rushed to the morgue after another brother living in Turkey sent him a photo of a body that looked familiar. He was able to identify his brother by a mole under his ear and a half-amputated finger, an injury from when he was 12.",
      "Standing over the body, he lifted the drape and gently pulled out his brother\u2019s left hand, examining it closely. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, pointing to the stump.",
      "Nearby, forensic workers worked rapidly to identify the bodies and hand them over to relatives.",
      "Yasser Qasser, a forensic assistant at the morgue, said they received 40 bodies that morning from the hospital that were being fingerprinted and having DNA samples taken. The staff had already identified about eight, he said. \u201cBut dozens of families are arriving, and the numbers don\u2019t match.\u201d",

      "Morgue officials who examined the corpses have seen bullet wounds and marks that appeared to be the result of torture, he added.",
      "An estimated 150,000 people have been detained or reported missing in Syria since 2011. Under Assad\u2019s rule, any whiff of dissent could send someone to prison immediately. For years, it was a sentence akin to death, as few ever emerged from the system.",
      "Citing testimony from freed prisoners and prison officials, Amnesty International has reported that thousands of Syrians were killed in frequent mass executions. Prisoners were subjected to constant torture, intense beatings and rape. Inmates frequently died from injuries, disease or starvation. Some fell into psychosis and starved themselves, the human rights group said.",
      "Among the bodies at the morgue Wednesday was Mazen al-Hamada, a Syrian activist who fled to Europe but returned to Syria in 2020 and was imprisoned upon arrival. His mangled corpse was found wrapped in a bloody sheet in Saydnaya.",
      "As they searched the morgue, some families moved among the bodies, weeping quietly and pausing to look for familiar features. The bodies lay covered in white shrouds, each marked with a number and some bearing the label \u201cunknown.\u201d",
      "Hilala Meryeh, a 64-year-old Palestinian mother of four, stood in the dingy identification room, bags of bodies all around her. She had just found one of her sons.",
      "She paused, screwed her eyes closed and turned her face toward the ceiling, murmuring a prayer. Her four boys were arrested by the former Syrian regime in 2013 during a crackdown on the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk. She still needed to find three.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know where they are,\u201d she said. \u201cGive me my children, search for my children!\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy did he do this to his people?\u201d Meryeh cried out. \u201cImprison them, we wouldn\u2019t have objected. Try them, but to slaughter them?\u201d",
      "Other Syrians, like Imad Habbal, stood motionless in the morgue, coming to grips with the reality and injustice of their loss.",
      "Habbal gazed at the body of his brother, Diaa Habbal.",
      "\u201cWe came yesterday, and we found him dead,\u201d he said. \u201cThey killed him. Why? What was his crime? What did he ever do to them? Just because he came back to his country?\u201d",
      "Diaa Habbal, a Syrian who had been living in Saudi Arabia since 2003, returned to Damascus in mid-2024 to visit his family, his brother said. He was arrested by the Syrian military police six months ago on charges of evading military service.",
      "With trembling hands, Imad Habbal lifted the covering, his voice breaking as he wept and spoke to his brother.",

      "Clashes have erupted in a southern town in Somalia between the country\u2019s federal government forces and regional troops of the state of Jubbaland amid escalating tensions over a disputed regional election there",
      "MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Clashes erupted on Wednesday morning in a southern town in Somalia between the country's federal government forces and regional troops of the state of Jubbaland amid escalating tensions over a disputed regional election there.",
      "The hourslong fighting in the town of Raskamboni calmed by midday, officials from both sides said, the latest violence in the restive Horn of Africa long plagued by deadly attacks by Islamic extremists. Both sides accused each other of instigating the clashes.",
      "Details of the fighting and the number of casualties remained unclear because of a telecommunications blackout imposed in the area.",
      "The clashes underscore a deepening rift between the federal government and Jubbaland\u2019s administration, raising fears of further instability in the strategically significant region near the Kenyan border.",
      "Somalia\u2019s federal forces are in the process of taking over the fight against al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab from an African Union peacekeeping mission that has been in place since 2007 and whose term ends at the end of the month.",
      "The federal government accused Jubbaland regional forces, led by Ahmed Madobe, of attacking positions on Wednesday previously held by federal troops. The positions are critical, the government said, in the fight against al-Shabab.",
      "\u201cThese troops were preparing for operations against al-Shabaab militants,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Madobe was reelected for a third term in Jubbaland\u2019s presidential election held on Nov. 25. His third term is said to be in violation of term limits set by the federal government. The opposition in Jubbaland has disputed the election results and formed a parallel government.",
      "A new African Union mission is expected to launch in January with troops from AU contributing countries, excluding Ethiopia, with which Somalia is involved in a dispute over its breakaway region of Somaliland.",
      "Meanwhile, Jubbaland officials accused federal forces of initiating the fighting Wednesday by targeting Jubbaland positions, alleging the federal troop deployment was part of a broader effort to undermine the regional government\u2019s authority.",
      "\u201cIt is unfortunate to see armies and vehicles meant to defend the country being used against its own people,\u201d Jubbaland state deputy security minister, Adan Ahmed Haji, told a news conference in the port city of Kismayo.",
      "Somalia's defense ministry alleged that Madobe had coordinated his actions with al-Shabab militants, allowing Jubbaland forces to operate in areas controlled by the group."

      "The jihadi rebels who toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad say they want to build a unified, inclusive country",
      "The jihadi rebels who toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad say they want to build a unified, inclusive country. But after nearly 14 years of civil war, putting that ideal into practice will not be easy.",
      "For Syria\u2019s Kurdish minority, America\u2019s closest ally in the country, the struggle for a new order is entering a potentially even more challenging phase.",
      "Over the course of Syria\u2019s civil war, Kurdish fighters have fended off an array of armed factions, partnered with the U.S. to rout the Islamic State group and carved out a largely autonomous region in the country\u2019s oil-rich east.",
      "But the gains of the non-Arab Kurds are now at risk. The ascendance of the Sunni Arab rebels who overthrew Assad \u2014 with vital help from Turkey, a longtime foe of the Kurds \u2014 will make it hard for the Kurds to find a place in the new Syria and could prolong the conflict.",
      "The jihadi rebels who rode into Damascus over the weekend have made peaceful overtures to the Kurds. But the rebels violently drove Kurdish fighters out of the eastern city of Deir al-Zour days after government forces abandoned it.",
      "To the north, a separate opposition faction backed by Turkey that has been battling the Kurds for years seized the town of Manbij. And Turkey carried out airstrikes on a Kurdish convoy it said was carrying heavy weapons looted from government arsenals.",
      "The Kurds have long counted on U.S. aid in the face of such challenges. Around 900 American troops are in eastern Syria, where they partner with Kurdish forces to prevent an Islamic State resurgence. But the future of that mission will be thrown into doubt under president-elect Donald Trump, who has long been skeptical about U.S. involvement in Syria.",
      "Here's a closer look at the predicament the Kurds find themselves in.",
      "The Kurds are among the largest stateless ethnic groups in the world, with some 30 million concentrated in a territory straddling Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. They are a minority in each country and have often suffered persecution, which has fueled armed Kurdish uprisings.",
      "In Syria, they carved out an autonomous enclave early in the civil war, never fully siding with the Assad government or the rebels seeking to topple him.",
      "When the Islamic State group seized a third of the country in 2014, Kurdish fighters \u2014 who are secular and include women in their ranks \u2014 proved their mettle in early battles against the extremists, earning support from the U.S.-led coalition.",
      "They formed a group known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, which also includes Arab fighters, and drove the Islamic State group out of large areas of Syria with help from U.S.-led airstrikes and American special forces. In 2017, these Kurdish-led forces captured Raqqa, the capital of the extremists' self-styled caliphate.",
      "Turkey has long viewed the SDF as an extension of the decades-old Kurdish insurgency within its own borders. It considers the main Kurdish faction a terrorist group on par with the Islamic State and has said it should have no presence in the new Syria.",
      "In recent years, Turkey has trained and funded fighters known as the Syrian National Army, helping them wrest control of territory from the Kurds in northern Syria along the border with Turkey. These Turkish-backed fighters have portrayed themselves as part of the opposition against Assad, but analysts say they are largely driven by opportunism and hatred of the Kurds.",
      "The Kurds have focused on battling the SNA in recent years. But the new leadership in Damascus, which also has longstanding ties to Turkey, could open another, much longer front.",
      "The main rebel faction is led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, a former al-Qaida militant who cut ties with the group eight years ago and says he wants to build a new Syria free of dictatorship that will serve all its religious and ethnic communities.",
      "Nawaf Khalil, head of the Germany-based Center for Kurdish Studies, said the early signs were positive. He said the rebels steered clear of two SDF-controlled enclaves of Aleppo when they stormed the city two weeks ago at the start of their rapid advance across the country.",
      "\u201cIt is also positive that they did not speak negatively about the Syrian Democratic Forces,\" he said.",
      "It remains to be seen if those sentiments will endure. After sweeping into Deir al-Zour this week, a fighter from al-Sharaa's group posted a video saying they would soon advance toward Raqqa and other areas of eastern Syria, raising the possibility of further clashes with the Kurds.",
      "The rebels could still seek some kind of agreement with the Kurds to incorporate them into the post-Assad political order, but that would likely require accepting a degree of Kurdish autonomy in the east. It would also risk angering Turkey, which now appears to be the chief power broker in Syria.",
      "The top U.S. military commander for the Middle East, Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, met with SDF forces in Syria on Tuesday, in a sign of the Biden administration's commitment to the alliance post-Assad.",
      "But things could change on Jan. 20.",
      "Trump has provided few details about his Middle East policy, aside from saying he wants to end the region's wars and keep the United States out of them.",
      "In a social media post shortly before Assad was overthrown, Trump wrote that \u201cSyria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT.\u201d",
      "During his previous term, in 2019, Trump abandoned the Kurds ahead of a Turkish incursion, casting it as the fulfillment of a campaign promise to end U.S. involvement in the region's \u201cendless wars.\u201d",
      "The move prompted heavy criticism, including from prominent Republicans who accused him of betraying an ally. Trump backtracked weeks later, approving a wider mission to secure oil fields in the east. The troops remained where they were and the alliance endured.",

      "\u201cOf the 12 samples taken, nine were positive for malaria but these samples were not of very good quality, so we are continuing to research to find out if this is an epidemic,\" Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director-general of the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Kinshasa, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"But it is very likely that it is malaria because most of the victims are children,\u201d he added.",
      "On Tuesday, the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said most of the samples tested positive for malaria, but noted it is possible that more than one disease was involved. He said further samples will be collected and tested.",
      "In recent weeks, there were 416 reported cases of the mystery disease and 31 deaths from it in hospitals, WHO director-general said. There were another 44 deaths in the community, Congo's health minister Roger Kamba said last week.",
      "Most of the cases and deaths are in children under 14 in the remote Panzi health zone in Congo's western Kwango province, according to the WHO.",

    "summary": "The European Central Bank is releasing its its decision on interest rates and a rate cut is a foregone conclusion",
    "story": [
      "The European Central Bank is releasing its its decision on interest rates and a rate cut is a foregone conclusion",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- With U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatening new tariffs and political chaos engulfing France, the European Union's second largest economy, the question ahead of the European Central Bank meeting Thursday is not whether it will cut interest rates, but by how much.",
      "Analysts see a quarter-point rate cut from the current ECB benchmark rate of 3.25% as the most likely option when the bank's rate-setting council meets at its skyscraper headquarters in Frankfurt.",
      "But the prospect of a half-point cut isn\u2019t out of the question for the bank and its President Christine Lagarde as new risks that emerged since the bank\u2019s last meeting on Oct. 17 cast a shadow over an already tepid recovery from a post-pandemic stagnation.",
      "Trump\u2019s election victory on Nov. 5 heightened the prospect of a more protectionist U.S. trade policy, such as new or higher tariffs on imported goods, after he takes office on Jan. 20. That sends a cold chill through the business world in Europe, where exports are an outsized contributor to growth and employment.",
      "Yet there are internal risks as well.",
      "French Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned Dec. 5 after losing a vote of confidence, leaving the France without a functioning government and no clear majority in parliament able or willing to tackle the country\u2019s excessive budget deficit. Elections cannot be held before June. While the end of the Barnier government hasn't triggered a financial crisis, it adds uncertainty about how long it will take for France to right its finances.",
      "A half-point cut \u201cwould be a security move to preempt any potential risks for the eurozone economy coming from the next U.S. administration\u2019s potential economic policy choices and political woes in France and Germany,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, chief eurozone economist at ING bank.",
      "Opting for a quarter-point move \u201cwould rather follow the cautious meeting-by-meeting approach\u201d that the bank has pursued since it started cutting rates in June, Brzeski said. One argument for a smaller rate cut might be a reluctance by the ECB to risk the perception that it is getting involved in French national politics: \u201cThis is speculation the ECB would clearly rather avoid,\u201d Brzeski said.",
      "Germany's governing coalition broke up in November, and a new national election is expected Feb. 23. Weeks of coalition negotiations are expected to follow before a new government is in place. That leaves the two biggest eurozone economies politically adrift for months.",
      "All that has dinged the confidence that businesses need to borrow, invest, expand production and take risks. The survey index of purchasing managers compiled by S&P Global came in at 48.3 in November, with levels below 50 suggesting the economy is slowing. The Sentix survey of investor confidence fell in its first update after the U.S. election, by 4.6 points to minus 17.5.",
      "Inflation has fallen steeply to 2.3% from its peak of 10.6% in late 2022, shifting attention from reigning in consumer price increases to worries about ongoing weak growth. The eurozone is expected to grow 0.8% this year and 1.3.% next year, according to forecasts from the European Union's executive commission.",
      "Higher ECB rates helped squelch Europe\u2019s outbreak of inflation in the wake of the pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Higher central bank benchmarks influence borrowing costs throughout the economy, making it more expensive to borrow and spend, and thus taking pressure off prices.",
      "Yet that also presents a danger in that those same high rates could stall the EU's goal of more vigorous economic growth.",
      "A drumbeat of announcements regarding job cuts in coming years at major firms in Germany has not improved the mood. They include auto technology and parts firm Bosch, which plans to drop 5,500 jobs, 3,800 of them in Germany; auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen, which plans to drop 14,000-15,000 jobs; and Ford Motor Co., which is to drop 4,000 jobs in Europe, 2,900 in Germany, and steelmaker ThyssenKrupp with 11,000 planned cuts. Volkswagen plans to shut as many as three German plants, according to its employee representatives who are negotiating with the company in an effort to block the closings.",

      "Fewer grandparents were taking care of grandchildren, there was a decline in the number of preschoolers and more people were staying put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared to the last part of the 2010s",
      "Fewer grandparents were living with and taking care of grandchildren, there was a decline in young children going to preschool and more people stayed put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared to the last part of the 2010s, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released Thursday, reflecting some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the most comprehensive survey of American life compares the years of 2014-2018 and 2019-2023, timeframes before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the virus' spread. The American Community Survey data show how lives were changed and family relationships altered by the pandemic and other occurrences like the opioid crisis.",
      "The survey of 3.5 million households covers more than 40 topics, including ancestry, fertility, marital status, commutes, veterans status, disability and housing.",
      "The decrease in grandparents' taking care of their grandchildren is most likely the result of a decline in opioid-related deaths during the more recent timeframe since substance abuse is a leading reason that grandparents find themselves raising grandchildren. A reduction in the number of incarcerated women also likely played a role, said Susan Kelley, a professor emerita of nursing at Georgia State University.",
      "\u201cIt's very rarely for positive reasons that grandparents find themselves in this situation. Usually, it's a tragic situation in an adult child's life, either a death, incarceration or mental health issues which correlate with substance abuse,\" Kelly said. \"Many grandparents thrive in that role, but there are still socioeconomic and emotional burdens on the grandparents.\"",
      "A stronger economy in the most recent period also may be a reason that the number of grandparents living with their grandchildren declined from 7.2 million to 6.8 million by making it less likely that adult children with their own children were seeking housing help from their parents, she said.",
      "The decline in the number of young children enrolled in preschool stemmed from an unwillingness to send young children to school and the closure of many schools at the height of the pandemic, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "\u201cThese data show how the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on patterns of early childhood education,\u201d the bureau said in a separate report. \"Future research will show if this was the start of a long-term trend or if enrollment will bounce back to prior levels.\"",
      "Americans continued to get older, with the median age rising to 38.7 from 37.9 and the nation's share of senior citizens up from 16.8% from 15.2%. The share of households with a computer jumped to almost 95% from almost 89%, as did the share of households with a broadband connection to almost 90% from 80%.",
      "Additionally, fewer people moved and more people stayed put in the most recent time period compared to the earlier one, in many cases because of rising home values and the limited availability of homes to buy.",
      "Home values increased by 21.7% and the percentage of vacant homes dropped from 12.2% to 10.4%. The median home value jumped from $249,400 to $303,400 nationwide.",
      "In some vacation communities popular with the wealthy, the bump was even more dramatic, such as in the county that is home to Aspen, Colorado, where it went from $758,800 to $1.1 million, and in the county which is home to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where it jumped from $812,400 to $1.1 million.",

      "The Fed began trimming rates in September  from a two-decade high to support a slowing job market  after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower rates would give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments, but they could also provide more fuel for inflation.",

      "TRENTON, N.J. -- New Jersey is aiming to drastically reduce the amount of packaging material \u2014 particularly plastic \u2014 that is thrown away after the package is opened.",
      "From bubble wrap to puffy air-filled plastic pockets to those foam peanuts that seem to immediately spill all over the floor, lots of what keeps items safe during shipping often ends up in landfills, or in the environment as pollution.",
      "A bill to be discussed Thursday in the state Legislature would require all such materials used in the state to be recyclable or compostable by 2034. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says containers and packaging materials from shopping account for about 28% of municipal waste sent to landfills in the U.S.",
      "The New Jersey bill seeks to move away from plastics and imposes fees on manufacturers and distributors for a $120 million fund to bolster recycling and reduce solid waste.",
      "California, Colorado, Oregon, Maine, and Minnesota have already passed similar bills, according to the environmental group Beyond Plastics.",
      "New Jersey's bill as proposed would be the strongest in the nation, according to Doug O'Malley, director of Environment New Jersey.",
      "\u201cOur waterways are literally swimming in plastics,\" he said. \u201cWe can't recycle our way out of this crisis.\u201d",
      "Peter Blair, policy and advocacy director at the environmental group Just Zero, said the bill aims to shift financial responsibility for dealing with the \u201cend-of-life\u201d of plastic packaging from taxpayers, who pay to have it sent to landfills, to the producers of the material.",
      "Business groups oppose the legislation.",
      "Ray Cantor, an official with the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said businesses are constantly working to reduce the amount of packing materials they use, and to increase the amount of recyclables they utilize. He called the bill \u201cunrealistic\u201d and \u201cnot workable.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt totally ignores the 40 years of work and systems that has made New Jersey one of the most successful recycling states in the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt bans a host of chemicals without any scientific basis. And it would ban the advanced recycling of plastics, the most promising new technology to recycle materials that currently are thrown away.\u201d",
      "His organization defined advanced recycling as \u201cusing high temperatures and pressure, breaking down the chemicals in plastics and turning them back into their base chemicals, thus allowing them to be reused to make new plastics as if they were virgin materials.\u201d",
      "Brooke Helmick, policy director for the New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance, said advanced recycling can be \u201cvery, very dangerous.\u201d It can lead to the release of toxic chemicals, cause fires, create the risk of chemical leaks, and create large volumes of hazardous materials including benzene that are then incinerated, she said.",
      "The bill would require the state Department of Environmental Protection to study the state's recycling market and calculate the cost of upgrading it to handle the increased recycling of packaging materials.",
      "It would require that by 2032, the amount of single-use packaging products used in the state be reduced by 25%, at least 10% of which would have to come from shifting to reusable products or eliminating plastic components.",
      "By 2034, all packaging products used in the state would have to be compostable or recyclable, and by 2036, the recycling rate of packaging products in New Jersey would have to be at least 65%.",

    "story": [
      "Kaja Veilleux has been hunting New England attic treasures for more than 50 years",
      "THOMASTON, Maine -- Kaja Veilleux has been hunting New England attic treasures for more than 50 years. He once found a copy of the Declaration of Independence sitting on a pile of trash, and he made headlines this year when he stumbled upon a million-dollar portrait gathering dust in an old farmhouse in Maine that may have been painted by the Dutch master Rembrandt.",
      "Then there was the time, Veilleux said, he was shown a $50,000 gold coin kicking around in a tool drawer \u2014 only to have the well-meaning owner destroy much of its value before he could auction it by using a scouring pad to clean it \u2014 and scratch it.",
      "\u201cIt's like a treasure hunt every day,\" Veilleux said with a chuckle.",
      "Many people dream of cashing in on some dusty, old heirloom. In October, three sisters from Ohio sold a rare dime for more than half-a-million dollars. Two years ago, a case of old hockey cards found in a Canadian home sold for more than $3.7 million.",
      "Veilleux, 73, helps people sort gems from junk when he appraises furniture, antiques and art by using his knowledge of what similar items have sold for in the past. But art auctions can be fickle. Who could have guessed a banana duct-taped to a wall could sell for more than $6 million?",
      "Veilleux started collecting coins at age 8 and soon found he had a good memory for visual objects. His training for a career in antique dealing has all been on the job, he said, including a lesson he learned early when he spent most of the money he had at the time on bidding for a beautiful miniature painting.",
      "When he got home from the auction and looked at the artwork under a magnifying glass, he realized it was a print, with dabs of paint added to make it look genuine.",
      "\u201cI paid $350 for a $35 object, which always taught me to look at things very carefully,\u201d Veilleux said.",
      "In the late 1990s, he was at a house call in South Freeport, Maine. It was a hoarder's house, he said, where piles of trash were awaiting their trip to an already-full dumpster. Atop one pile, Veilleux spotted what was later confirmed to be a 1776 copy of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "He auctioned it for $99,000 but the state of Maine sued to take possession of the document, and won. That meant both the buyer and seller ended up missing out.",
      "This year's artwork find was his most valuable yet. Veilleux said he and an assistant were on a house call in Camden, Maine.",
      "\u201cWe start going through the house and there were rare little things and big things everywhere,\u201d Veilleux said. \u201cFinally, we are on the third floor near the attic, and we find a stack of paintings, and in it is this beautiful portrait of a young woman by Rembrandt.\u201d",
      "The painting of a teenage girl in a black dress with a white ruffled collar was sold as \u201cafter Rembrandt,\u201d meaning it was in the style of the 17th Century master but wasn't proven to be by him. The artwork sold for $1.4 million, including auction fees, indicating the buyer was willing to take a significant gamble the painting was a Rembrandt \u2014 although it would have likely sold for many times that price with a proven provenance.",
      "Each Tuesday, people bring in their heirlooms and collector\u2019s items to Veilleux's office in Thomaston, Maine, to see what they might fetch at auction. The appraisal is free but Veilleux gets a commission if they end up selling the pieces at his Thomaston Place Auction Galleries.",
      "Erika Taylor stopped by on a recent Tuesday with two artworks her father had collected in China in the 1940s, when he was living there after escaping from Nazi Germany. One depicted a blooming peony and the other a grasshopper.",
      "She said Veilleux had given her an initial estimate of up to $30,000 for each of the artworks, based on the photographs she'd shown him. But she was in for bad news.",
      "When Veilleux inspected the artworks closely, he declared they were prints, because paint would have permeated the paper.",
      "\u201cIt's disappointing,\" Taylor said. \u201cBut he has a lot of experience.\u201d",
      "Still, Taylor wasn't totally convinced and said she might seek a second opinion.",
      "Another seller, Jean Koenig, got better news. She brought in a large aquamarine ring. She said her father found the gem in a Brazilian mine and her grandmother had fashioned it into a ring, adding rubies and diamonds.",
      "Koenig ended up agreeing to auction the ring, with an estimated sales price of between $10,000 and $15,000. She plans to split the proceeds with her seven siblings.",
      "\u201cIt's just been sitting in a box for years,\" she said. \u201cWe decided it was time.\u201d"

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government said Thursday it will tax large digital platforms and search engines unless they agree to share revenue with Australian news media organizations.",
      "The tax would apply from Jan. 1 to tech companies that earn more than 250 million Australian dollars ($160 million) a year in revenue from Australia, Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones and Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said.",
      "They include Meta, Google-owner Alphabet and ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok.",
      "The tax would be offset through money paid to Australian media organizations. The size of the tax is not clear. But the government aims to make sharing revenue with media organizations the cheaper option.",
      "\"The real objective ... is not to raise revenue -- we hope not to raise any revenue. The real objective is to incentivize agreement-making between platforms and news media businesses in Australia,\u201d Jones told reporters.",

      "A previous government introduced in 2021 laws called the News Media Bargaining Code that forced tech giants to strike revenue-sharing deals with Australian media companies or face fines of 10% of their Australian revenue.",
      "Meta said in a statement the current law was flawed and the U.S. company continued to have \u201cconcerns about charging one industry to subsidise another.\u201d",
      "\"The proposal fails to account for the realities of how our platforms work, specifically that most people don\u2019t come to our platforms for news content and that news publishers voluntarily choose to post content on our platforms because they receive value from doing so,\u201d the statement said.",

      "\u201cAs an entertainment platform, TikTok has never been the go to place for news. We will actively engage in the consultation process and look forward to hearing more details,\u201d a TikTok statement said.",
      "Jones said Australian officials had explained the government's intentions to their counterparts in the United States, where most of the digital giants are headquartered. President-elect Donald Trump's administration is planning to increase tariffs against some countries, which has the potential to trigger trade wars.",

      "BANGKOK -- The Biden administration plans to raise tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect U.S. clean energy businesses.",
      "The notice from the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office said tariffs on Chinese-made solar wafers and polysilicon will rise to 50% from 25% and duties on certain tungsten products will increase from zero to 25%, effective on Jan. 1, following a review of Chinese trade practices under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act.",
      "The decision followed a public comment period after the USTR said in September that it was considering such actions.",
      "\u201cThe tariff increases announced today will further blunt the harmful policies and practices by the People\u2019s Republic of China,\" USTR Katharine Tai said in a statement. \"These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains.\u201d",

      "Last week, Washington tightened restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology. Beijing responded by banning exports to the U.S. of certain critical minerals needed to make computer chips, such as gallium, germanium and antimony. It also stepped up its controls on graphite exports to the U.S.",
      "China provides a very large share of most of those materials and the United States has been working to secure alternative sources in Africa and other parts of the world.",
      "Tungsten is another strategically vital metal whose production is dominated by China. The U.S. does not produce it, but South Korea is a potential big supplier. It's used to make armaments and is also used in x-ray tubes and light bulb filaments, among other industrial applications. U.S. imports of the metal from China fell to $10.9 million in 2023 from $19.5 million the year before.",
      "After Beijing announced its ban on exporting gallium and the other materials to the United States, analysts said tungsten was another likely area where China might strike back.",
      "Trade frictions have been escalating ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods, among other threats. President Joe Biden has said Trump\u2019s promise of broad tariffs on foreign imports would be a mistake.",

      "The U.S. and other trading partners say China improperly subsidizes exports, giving exporters of solar panels and other products an unfair advantage in overseas markets, where its manufacturers charge lower prices thanks to government support. Washington also says China improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.",
      "China accounts for more than 80% of the market for solar panels at all stages of production, according to the International Energy Agency, more than double domestic demand for those products. Its huge economies of scale have made solar power more affordable, but also concentrated the supply chain inside China. The IEA has urged other countries to assess their solar panel supply chains and develop strategies to address any risks.",
      "In early 2018, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. Beijing filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization charging that the U.S. was unfairly supporting electric vehicle purchases.",
      "The investigation that led the USTR to raise the tariffs on solar panels concluded with a report in May that has prompted increases in tariffs on a range of products including electric vehicles, syringes and needles, medical gloves and facemasks, semiconductors and steel and aluminum products, among others.",
      "It has pushed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles up to 100% from 25%, raised tariffs on Chinese-made lithium batteries to 25% from 7.5%."

      "Hotard also said in court filings, under oath, that no correspondence existed between her and her mother-in-law about the grain terminal, even though her mother-in-law later turned over numerous text messages where they discussed the grain terminal and a nearby property owned by the mother-in-law's marine transport company, court records show.",
      "The text messages were disclosed as part of an ongoing lawsuit filed by Joy Banner, who along with her sister, Jo Banner, successfully led efforts to halt the $800 million grain terminal earlier this year. It would have been built within 300 feet (91 meters) of their property and close to historic sites in the predominantly Black community where they grew up.",
      "The legal dispute is part of a broader clash playing out in courts and public hearings, pitting officials eager to greenlight economic development against grassroots community groups challenging polluting industrial expansion in the heavily industrialized 85-mile industrial corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans often referred to by environmental activists as \u201cCancer Alley.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are residents that are just trying to protect our homes and just trying to live our lives as we have a right to do,\u201d Banner said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "The Banner sisters gained national attention after cofounding the Descendants Project, an organization dedicated to historic preservation and racial justice.",
      "In the text messages turned over as part of Joy Banner's lawsuit, Hotard, the parish president, says that she wished to \u201cchoke\u201d Joy Banner and used profanities to describe her. Hotard also said of the Banner sisters: \u201cI hate these people.\u201d",
      "Hotard and her attorney, Ike Spears, did not respond to requests for comment after Tuesday's filing. Richard John Tomeny, the lawyer representing Hotard's mother-in-law, Darla Gaudet, declined to comment.",
      "Banner initially sued the parish in federal court in December 2023 after Hotard and another parish councilman, Michael Wright, threatened her with arrest and barred her from speaking during a public comment period at a November 2023 council meeting.",
      "\u201cIn sum: a white man threatened a Black woman with prosecution and imprisonment for speaking during the public comment period of a public meeting,\u201d Banner's lawsuit says. It accuses the parish of violating Banner's First Amendment rights.",
      "Wright and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. Hotard and Wright have disputed Banner's version of events in court filings.",
      "At the November 2023 meeting, Banner attempted to highlight Hotard's alleged conflict of interest in approving a zoning change to enable the grain export facility's construction. Banner had also recently filed a complaint to the Louisiana Board of Ethics against Hotard pointing out that her mother-in-law allegedly would benefit financially because she owned and managed a marine transport company that had land \u201cnear and within\u201d the area being rezoned.",
      "In response to a discovery request, Hotard submitted a court filing saying \u201cno such documents exist\u201d between her and her mother-in-law discussing the property, the grain terminal or Joy Banner, according to the recent motion filed by Banner's attorneys. Hotard also said in her August deposition that she had \u201cno idea\u201d about her mother-in-law's company's land despite text messages showing Hotard and her mother-in-law had discussed this property less than three weeks before Hotard's deposition.",
      "Banner's lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial early next year.",

      "The Fulton County Sheriff's Office has promised to pay a private security company $1.4 million after some of its employees walked out of the jail in August",
      "ATLANTA -- The Fulton County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday it will send about $1.4 million in electronic payments to a private security company by the end of the week that pulled its staff from the local jail in Georgia.",
      "New York-based Strategic Security Corp. ended its contract with the county in August after it failed to pay money owed and let its officers walk out of the Fulton County Jail in the middle of the day. The company provided about 80 guards.",
      "The Sheriff's office did not pay the company what it owed in any billing cycle since the start of its contract in 2023, CEO Joseph Sordi told reporters in August. Natalie Ammons, a spokesperson for the sheriff's office, said the office did pay some bills in full.",
      "Fulton County Sheriff Patrick Labat has come under fire from county officials for failing to address dangerous conditions in the Fulton County Jail and for mismanaging funds, including the $146 million to his office allocated this year.",
      "Last year, the Fulton County Board of Commissioners dissolved the sheriff's inmate welfare fund after learning that money had been used for promotional events and consulting fees. The office said it took several remedial actions, including firing the fund administrator.",
      "In October 2023, the commission rescinded $2.1 million in funding for Georgia-based jail software company Talitrix, which was supposed to provide 1,000 wristbands and monitoring devices to the jail. Only 15 were in use. Talitrix then sued the sheriff's office over nonpayment.",
      "In Tuesday\u2019s statement, the sheriff\u2019s office said the department is underfunded by the county given its size and mandates. Underfunding has \u201cimpacted not only contractual obligations but also critical operational capacities that directly affect public safety and community trust.\"",
      "Board of Commissioners Chairman Robb Pitts released a statement in August saying that funding for the sheriff\u2019s office and jail increased 66% since 2019, but the sheriff \u201chas consistently failed to demonstrate basic budget management practices.\"",
      "Pitts said the sheriff's office signed the contract with Strategic Security Corp. to provide staffing for watchtowers in the jail without involving the county purchasing department. He said the commissioners allocated $1.3 million for 2024 based on the contract usage and with input from the sheriff's office.",
      "The office waited until August to tell county management that it had already spent more than $1 million over the budgeted amount, Pitts said.",
      "The commission passed an ordinance in July asking Labat and other constitutional officers to use the county purchasing department's procurement process when entering new contracts. Labat said he plans to sue the Board of Commissioners, which he says has gone overboard in managing how he spends money."

      "Senate Democrats failed in their bid to confirm a Democratic member of the National Labor Relations Board after the Senate rejected a razor-thin vote that hinged on the pivotal rejections of independent Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Si...",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats failed Wednesday to confirm a Democratic member of the National Labor Relations Board after independent Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema opposed the nomination, thwarting their hopes of locking in a majority at the federal agency for the first two years of President-elect Donald Trump's term.",
      "A vote to move ahead with the nomination of Lauren McFarren, who currently chairs the NLRB, failed 49-50. Had she been confirmed to another five-year term, it would have cemented a Democratic majority on the agency's board for the first two years of the incoming Trump administration. Now, Trump will likely be able to nominate McFarren's replacement.",
      "The NLRB oversees labor disputes, supervises union elections and has the power to investigate unfair labor practices. The partisan breakdown of the NLRB\u2019s leadership is fiercely contested by businesses and labor groups, as the majority on the board sets the agenda and determines how readily the agency uses its power to investigate and enforce labor laws.",
      "\u201cIt is deeply disappointing, a direct attack on working people, and incredibly troubling that this highly qualified nominee \u2014 with a proven track record of protecting worker rights \u2014 did not have the votes,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement.",
      "The rejection of McFarren was yet another blow to Senate Democrats and President Joe Biden from Manchin and Sinema, who served as major brakes \u2014 and at times outright obstacles \u2014 to much of their legislative agenda the first two years of Biden's term.",
      "Manchin left the Democratic Party in May, while Sinema withdrew from the party in 2022. Both chose not to run for another Senate term and will be leaving the Congress in January.",
      "Some congressional Republicans praised Manchin and Sinema for preventing the confirmation.",
      "\u201cThis NLRB seat should be filled by President Trump and the new incoming Senate. Not a historically unpopular president and a Senate Democrat Majority that has lost its mandate to govern,\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, said in a statement after the vote.",
      "\u201cBig Labor knows the days of having the federal government do its bidding are numbered,\u201d Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., wrote in a statement. Foxx, who chairs the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, said that the incoming Trump administration would focus on \u201cenacting a truly pro-worker agenda.\u201d",
      "Business groups also praised the rejection of McFarren. Kristen Swearingen, a vice president at Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group, called McFarren's policies \u201charmful\u201d and said the process to nominate her was \u201cflawed.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnder McFerran\u2019s leadership, the NLRB has issued decisions and expanded interpretations of the National Labor Relations Act that have been rejected by the business community, Congress and federal courts,\" argued Swearingen.",
      "Labor unions decried the vote. Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest consortium of labor unions, said the senators who rejected McFarren's nomination \u201cvoted against the working people of this country\u201d and warned that the incoming Trump administration would direct the NLRB to side with management over workers.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: This vote had nothing to do with stopping Chair McFerran\u2019s renomination and everything to do with reversing generations of progress workers have made toward building a fairer and more just economy,\" Shuler said.",
      "Democratic lawmakers, like Schumer, took a dim view of the vote. Some directed their anger directly at Manchin and Sinema.",

      "Research shows Americans are frustrated with what they perceive as aloofness and gridlock within civic institutions",
      "BEND, OREGON -- Eliza Wilson is a little nervous as she draws the microphone close, but she is determined to share her life story. \u201cMy father was a disabled veteran,\u201d she says. \u201cI first experienced homelessness when I was 5 years old.\u201d",
      "Wilson, who\u2019s 36, leads programs focused on unhoused youth. On a recent Saturday, she is addressing a citizen assembly, a grassroots gathering seeking solutions to tough local challenges.",
      "Her audience consists of 30 ordinary Oregonians. They are acupuncturists and elk hunters; house cleaners and retired riverboat pilots. None are public policy experts. All the same, these participants have been asked to recommend new strategies for combating youth homelessness \u2014 a major problem in this affluent Oregon city and the surrounding rural areas of Deschutes County.",
      "This unusual experiment in small-D democracy is underwritten by more than $250,000 in grants from backers such as the Rockefeller Foundation and Omidyar Network. As a key early presenter, Wilson wins rapt attention, clicking through data-rich slides and sharing her story of crisis and recovery.",
      "That\u2019s how citizen assemblies should work, says Kevin O\u2019Neil, an innovation specialist at the Rockefeller Foundation. His research shows Americans are frustrated with what they perceive as aloofness and gridlock within civic institutions. \u201cPeople want to be directly involved in decision-making,\u201d O\u2019Neil says. \u201cThey recognize the value of expertise, but they don\u2019t want to delegate decision-making to experts.\u201d",
      "Assemblies can help \u201covercome polarization and strengthen societal cohesion,\u201d says Claudia Chwalisz, founder of DemocracyNext. Her nonprofit, launched in Paris in 2022, champions such assemblies worldwide, hoping they can \u201ccreate the democratic spaces for everyday people to grapple with the complexity of policy issues, listen to one another, and find common ground.\u201d",
      "At least, that\u2019s the theory.",
      "To succeed, citizen assemblies can\u2019t settle for a few days of harmonious dialogue among well-intentioned strangers. They need to inspire policy changes or new programs from government and other civic institutions. In Europe, such wins abound. In the United States, results are spottier.",
      "The most fruitful U.S. effort to date was a 2021 people\u2019s assembly in Washington State that produced 148 ideas \u2014 including more solar canopies and food composting \u2014 to combat climate change. More often, progress is challenging.",
      "An assembly in 2022 in Petaluma, California, spun up ideas to repurpose a long-time county fairground site. Two years later, the fair still operates under short-term leases; its long-term destiny remains in limbo. In Colorado\u2019s Montrose County, enacting an assembly\u2019s bold ideas for improving rural day care has been \u201cmore of a marathon than a sprint,\u201d says organizer Morgan Lasher.",
      "Can central Oregon do better? It may take years to know, but evidence so far shows both the assembly system\u2019s opportunities and the challenges.",
      "Bend\u2019s local economy is strong, with a jobless rate of just 4.2% and median household income of more than $80,000. As housing costs have skyrocketed, though, the spectacle of people living in tent and trailer encampments has become more common. A January count found more than 1,800 people were homeless in Deschutes County, up from 913 in 2020.",
      "In 2023, DemocracyNext and Healthy Democracy, a Portland, Oregon, nonprofit, connected with Bend officials interested in bringing the assembly idea to central Oregon. Josh Burgess, an Air Force veteran, who moved to Bend and became the proverbial \u201cadvance man\u201d for DemocracyNext.",
      "Operating in a county evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, Burgess built rapport with both liberal and conservative members on the Deschutes County Board of Commissioners. \u201cIt took four or five meetings to get there,\u201d Burgess recalls. Organizers decided to focus on homelessness among ages 14 to 24, where opportunities for progress seemed greatest.",
      "To pick citizens for the assembly, organizers contacted 12,000 county residents before selecting just 30. Everything was balanced by age, race, gender, and geography \u2013 a slow, costly requirement.",
      "Even so, advocates such as Michelle Barsa of Omidyar Network says assemblies\u2019 big edge comes from using \u201can actual representative sample of the community, not just the people who always show up at town-hall meetings and yell into a microphone for three minutes.\u201d",
      "At the northern edge of Oregon State\u2019s Bend campus, a few hundred yards from the Deschutes River, is the McGrath Family atrium, a sunlight-drenched space with panoramic woodland views. It feels almost like a spa.",
      "As the Bend assembly gets started, black tablecloths at a huge, U-shaped table convey gravity. Name tags identify attendees as \u201cNoelle,\u201d \u201cDave,\u201d \u201cAlex.\u201d The first few hours go slowly, but everything perks up after lunch.",
      "Eliza Wilson takes command, introducing herself as director of runaway and homeless youth services at J Bar J, a social-services organization. Her voice is unfailingly steady, but emotions race fast across her face: hope, frustration, empathy, resolve, and more.",
      "\u201cTeens get really good at hiding their homelessness,\u201d Wilson explains. \u201cWe don\u2019t share family business outside of the family. I was really fortunate that a high-school counselor pointed me, at age 15, to the first youth shelter that had just opened in Bend. I stayed there for three years, until I graduated from high school. I finally got on my feet at age 21.\u201d",
      "As Wilson finishes, questions stream in. \u201cAre there any programs advocating for children to get back to their parents?\u201d one woman wants to know. \u201cIs there open communication between you guys and the school district?\u201d a man asks.",
      "Wilson and other presenters respond with a road map of what exists today. They point out how homeless youth are in a precarious but not hopeless situation, counting on allies for a couch to sleep on. Less than 20 percent live outside in encampments. Practically everyone in the audience takes notes.",
      "The next day, assembly members strike up conversations with young adults who were once homeless. Chronic problems \u2014 and glimmers of ideas about how to address them \u2014 tumble forth. Flaws in the foster parent system. The risk of sexual abuse. The unique challenges that LGBTQ youth face.",
      "Attendees \u2014 who shared their thoughts with the Chronicle on the condition they be identified only by their first name \u2014 regarded those conversations as eye-opening breakthroughs in their hunt for policy recommendations.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m coming away with a whole different point of view,\u201d Ken told me. He had arrived believing that poor parenting and drug abuse led to homelessness, and that affected families should personally address such challenges. Now, he said, he was interested in broader solutions.",
      "Several local officials stopped by to watch the assembly proceedings. Phil Chang, a Deschutes County commissioner, said the broad-based assembly creates \u201csocial license for us to do things that the community wants.\u201d",
      "Conservative county commissioner Tony DeBone worries that Oregon\u2019s rollback of drug-offense laws has worsened social problems; he also believes that an economic upturn would do the most good. Still, he says, he\u2019s willing to see what the assembly can offer.",
      "Ultimately, the assembly\u2019s effectiveness will depend on whether its recommendations can overcome bureaucratic inertia, says Tammy Baney, executive director of the Central Oregon Intergovernmental Council. Proposed changes in police interactions with homeless youth could be acted on within a month or two if local law enforcement is receptive, she says. Improving Oregon\u2019s gridlocked foster-care system might be much harder.",
      "\u201cIt all depends on how much political will there is,\u201d Baney says.",

      "Cyber officials are advising people to use encryption in their communications after a sprawling hacking campaign",
      "LONDON -- After a sprawling hacking campaign exposed the communications of an unknown number of Americans, U.S. cybersecurity officials are advising people to use encryption in their communications.",
      "To safeguard against the risks highlighted by the campaign, which originated in China, federal cybersecurity authorities released an extensive list of security recommendations for U.S. telecom companies \u2014 such as Verizon and AT&T \u2014 that were targeted. The advice includes one tip we can all put into practice with our phones: \u201cEnsure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible.\u201d",
      "End-to-end encryption, also known as E2EE, means that messages are scrambled so that only the sender and recipient can see them. If anyone else intercepts the message, all they will see is a garble that can't be unscrambled without the key.",
      "Law enforcement officials had until now resisted this type of encryption because it means the technology companies themselves won't be able to look at the messages, nor respond to law enforcement requests to turn the data over.",
      "Here's a look at various ways ordinary consumers can use end-to-end encryption:",
      "Officials said the hackers targeted the metadata of a large number of customers, including information on the dates, times and recipients of calls and texts. They also managed to see the content from texts from a much smaller number of victims.",
      "If you're an iPhone user, information in text messages that you send to someone else who also has an iPhone will be encrypted end-to-end. Just look for the blue text bubbles, which indicate that they are encrypted iMessages.",
      "The same goes for Android users sending texts through Google Messages. There will be a lock next to the timestamp on each message to indicate the encryption is on.",
      "But there's a weakness. When iPhone and Android users text each other, the messages are encrypted only using Rich Communication Services, an industry standard for instant messaging that replaces the older SMS and MMS standards.",
      "Apple has noted that RCS messages \u201caren\u2019t end-to-end encrypted, which means they\u2019re not protected from a third party reading them while they\u2019re sent between devices.\u201d",
      "Samsung, which sells Android smartphones, has also hinted at the issue in a footnote at the bottom of a press release last month on RCS, saying, \u201cEncryption only available for Android to Android communication.\u201d",
      "To avoid getting caught out when trading texts, experts recommend using encrypted messaging apps.",
      "Privacy advocates are big fans of Signal, which applies end-to-end encryption on all messages and voice calls. The independent nonprofit group behind the app promises never to sell, rent, or lease customer data and has made its source code publicly available so that it can be audited by anyone to examine it \u201cfor security and correctness.\u201d",
      "Signal's encryption protocol is so reputable that it has been integrated into rival WhatsApp, so users will enjoy the same level of security protection as Signal, which has a much smaller user base. End-to-end encryption is also the default mode for Facebook Messenger, which like WhatsApp is owned by Meta Platforms.",
      "Telegram is an app that can be used for one-on-one conversations, group chats and broadcast \u201cchannels\" but contrary to popular perception, it doesn't turn on end-to-end encryption by default. Users have to switch on the option. And it doesn\u2019t work with group chats.",
      "Cybersecurity experts have warned people against using Telegram for private communications and pointed out that only its opt-in \u2018secret chat\u2019 feature is encrypted from end-to-end. The app also has a reputation for being a haven for scammers and criminal activity, highlighted by founder and CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in France.",
      "Instead of using your phone to make calls through a wireless cellular network, you can make voice calls with Signal and WhatsApp. Both apps encrypt calls with the same technology that they use to encrypt messages.",
      "There are other options. If you have an iPhone you can use Facetime for calls, while Android owners can use the Google Fi service, which are both end-to-end encrypted.",
      "The only catch with all these options is that, as with using the chat services to send messages, the person on the other end will also have to have the app installed.",
      "WhatsApp and Signal users can customize their privacy preferences in the settings, including hiding IP address during calls to prevent your general location from being guessed.",

      "The lawsuit is the latest action by Arizona against foreign companies that use huge amounts of groundwater to grow thirsty forage crops for export because of climate challenges in other countries. Rural Arizona is especially attractive to international businesses because it has no groundwater pumping regulations.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that since 2014, Fondomonte has extracted huge amounts of water that accelerated depletion of the basin\u2019s aquifer. The company is a subsidiary of Saudi dairy giant Almarai Co.",
      "\u201cWe find the allegations of the Attorney General totally unfounded, and we will defend any potential action against Fondomonte and our rights vigorously before the competent authorities,\u201d Fondomonte said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe company has invested significantly to bring the latest conservation technology and applies environmentally sustainable practices on these long-established farms,\u201d it said. \u201cFondomonte has continued to develop responsibly during its time farming in the state and the company complies with all state regulations. \u201d",
      "Years of drought have increased pressure on water users across the West, particularly in states like Arizona, which relies heavily on the dwindling Colorado River. The drought has also made groundwater \u2014 long used by farmers and rural residents without restriction \u2014 even more important for users across the state.",
      "\u201cProtection of Arizona\u2019s precious groundwater is certainly important, but this lawsuit could open a can of worms,\u201d said Kathryn Sorensen, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. \u201cNearly every farm, city, mine, tribe, and power company in the state relies on groundwater.\u201d",
      "Water attorneys said they did not feel qualified to address the legal theory of public nuisance but emphasized the lack of regulation of groundwater pumping in rural Arizona.",
      "Kathleen Ferris, an attorney and Arizona water policy expert who directed the study that led to the current law overseeing the state\u2019s groundwater management, said rural groundwater use in the state \u201cis \u201cgoverned by the rule of reasonable use.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone may drill a well and pump groundwater as long as the use of the groundwater is reasonable,\u201d said Ferris, a senior research fellow at the Kyl Center. \u201cUnfortunately, no use of groundwater has been determined by the courts to be \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 It\u2019s basically a rule that benefits the biggest landowners with the deepest wells.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mayes told reporters Wednesday that the Arizona Legislature has done nothing to fix the groundwater problem despite knowing about the problem for years.",
      "\u201cWhile laws regulating groundwater pumping could have prevented this situation, the legislature\u2019s inaction has allowed the crisis to grow,\u201d Mayes said. \u201cWhen the legislature fails to protect our most basic resources, the attorney general must step in.\u201d",
      "La Paz County Supervisor Holly Irwin, a Republican, commended Mayes, a Democrat, for attempting to address what she described as her community\u2019s \u201cmost challenging\u201d concern.",
      "\u201cI know that my constituents will be thrilled over this, that somebody is actually paying attention to the real problems here,\u201d Irwin said during Wednesday\u2019s news briefing via a video conference call.",
      "Mayes' lawsuit alleges that Fondomonte's actions are a public nuisance under a state statute that prohibits activity that injures health, obstructs property use, or interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property by a community.",
      "Mayes called the company\u2019s groundwater pumping \u201cunsustainable\u201d and said it caused \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d for people in the area.",
      "\u201cArizona law is clear: no company has the right to endanger an entire community\u2019s health and safety for its own gain,\u201d she said.",
      "The lawsuit seeks to enjoin the company from further groundwater pumping it says is \u201cexcessive\u201d and require that an abatement fund be established to cover the costs of damages caused by the company.",
      "Mayes said the dollar figure hasn't been determined but it will be established through the course of litigation.",
      "Arizona officials have been targeting Fondomonte for more than a year over its use of groundwater to grow forage crops, by not renewing or canceling the company's leases in Butler Valley in western Arizona. Some residents there had complained that the company\u2019s pumping was threatening their wells.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 22:58:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria",
    "story": [
      "Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria",
      "NASARAWA, Nigeria -- Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria.",
      "But it\u2019s led to exploitation of children who are often poor and take work in small, illegal mines to support themselves and their families.",
      "The Associated Press recently traveled to the deep bush of Pasali, near the federal capital of Abuja in Nasarawa state, to follow and interview miners operating illegal mines, including some where children work. AP also witnessed negotiations and an agreement to purchase lithium by a Chinese company with no questions about the source of the lithium or how it was obtained.",
      "The International Labour Organization estimates more than 1 million children work in mines and quarries worldwide, a problem particularly acute in Africa, where poverty, limited access to education and weak regulations add to the problem. Children, working mostly in small-scale mines, work long hours at unsafe sites, crushing or sorting rocks, carrying heavy loads of ore, and exposing themselves to toxic dust that can cause respiratory problems and asthma.",
      "Some takeaways from AP's report:",
      "Lithium mining began in Pasali a decade ago, transforming a remote and slumbering community into a bustling site for small-scale illegal mining, said Shedrack Bala, a 25-year-old who began working in the mines at age 15 and now owns his own pit. Dozens of mines now dot the area, all unlicensed.",
      "The mining methods are primitive and dangerous. Miners use chisels and heavy hammers to break through rocks, descending several feet into dark pits. In some old but still viable mines, they crawl through narrow passages snaking between unstable mud walls before starting to dig. For new mines, the ground is blasted open with dynamite.",
      "Bashir Rabiu, now 19, started in the pits as an underage worker. AP journalists watched as he wriggled around at the bottom of a pit, where miners can be at risk if dynamite explodes prematurely. They also face danger of suffocating in narrow tunnels that connect pits, or burial from wall collapse.",
      "Rabiu hauled up raw lithium ore and passed it to six children, all younger than 10. Wearing rubber slippers and dust-stained shorts and shirts, the children hunched over rubble and chipped away with crude stone tools to extract valuable fragments.",
      "A team of six children can sort and bag up to 10 25-kilogram bags of lithium-rich rock a day. For working from early morning to late evening, the children typically share 4,000 naira (about $2.42), according to Bala and others who use them.",
      "None of the children in the group AP saw was attending school. Only two ever had. One, a 5-year-old boy, stopped when he was orphaned. The other was a 6-year-old girl who was pulled out of school by her family, who felt they couldn't afford to send two children to school and prioritized her 11-year-old brother.",
      "The illegal mining thrives on informal networks of buyers and sellers who operate without much fear of the government. Aliyu Ibrahim, a lithium merchant in Nasarawa, owns unlicensed mines and also buys lithium ore from other illegal sites. At his warehouse, he told AP that his business flourishes by paying officials to look the other way. Ibrahim said he then sells his lithium in bulk to Chinese companies.",
      "Ibrahim said he knows that children are working at his mines and others he buys from, but he said many of the children are orphans or poor. He said the work helps them survive.",
      "AP accompanied miners from Pasali illegal mines to Chinese-owned RSIN Nigeria Limited, where a sales agreement was reached without questions about the source of the minerals or the conditions under which they were extracted. Sellers were asked to leave samples to test for lithium content. A price list from the buyers offered 200,000 naira (about $119) for a metric ton of minerals containing up to 3% lithium.",
      "RSIN Nigeria Limited did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But in a statement to AP, the Chinese embassy in Abuja said Chinese mining companies in Nigeria \u201coperate in line with local laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Philip Jakpor, a Nigerian activist, said his nonprofit Renevlyn Development Initiative has documented widespread child labor practices across Nasarawa state.",
      "\u201cRevenue generation seems to have trumped the need to protect human rights,\u201d Jakpor said. \u201cWe expect those operating in the upper spheres of the supply chain to adopt responsible models that prevent abusive conditions in mineral extraction.\u201d",
      "Juliane Kippenberg, associate director of children\u2019s rights at Human Rights Watch, said global demand for lithium is expected to grow rapidly in coming years and it's imperative for governments to protect human rights and press corporations to do the same.",
      "Segun Tomori, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mining and Solid Minerals Development, said ongoing reforms such as amending the Minerals and Mining Act are aimed at minimizing the use of child labor. Tomori also said social safety programs such as school feeding initiatives are being revamped to keep children in school and combat child labor. He also cited a program to add mining marshals announced this year to clamp down on illegal mining.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple is pumping more artificial intelligence into the latest iPhones during the holiday shopping season with a free software update that includes a feature that enables users to create customized emojis within a matter of seconds.",
      "The Wednesday release of the iPhone's upgraded operating system, iOS 18.2, extends Apple's expansion into AI months after rivals such as Samsung and Google began implanting the revolutionary technology on their devices. The update builds upon another one that came out in late October to usher in the AI era for Apple and the iPhone, as well as for the iPad and Mac.",
      "The latest round of AI tricks includes \u201cGenmojis,\u201d Apple's description for emojis that iPhone users will be able to ask the technology to create and then share. Apple says it is placing some limits its AI's emoji artistry to prevent the distribution of violent or hateful imagery. Other features include an \u201cImage Playground\u201d for a variety of AI-styled illustrations, writing tools and options for summarizing emails.",
      "The technology won\u2019t work on iPhones that Apple made before 2023 because it requires a special processor that isn\u2019t in older models. The AI will work on the iPhone 16 line-up that came out in September and the premium iPhone 15 models released last year.",
      "That exclusivity is expected to propel a cycle of iPhone upgrades during the current holiday shopping season into next year, driving up Apple's profit even higher from the $94 billion that the Cupertino, California, company pocketed in its last fiscal year ending in September. That expectation is the main reason Apple's stock price has climbed by about 30% so far this year to push the company's market value closer to the $4 trillion threshold for the first time.",
      "Apple is broadening the AI suite's appeal by including English versions tailored for Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. that are included in the latest software update.",
      "Although the iPhone's AI is similar to many of the features that have already been available from other companies, Apple is taking a slightly different approach to the technology in an effort to stand out from the rest of pack. It is emphasizing its ongoing commitment to protecting iPhone users' privacy by processing most of its AI on the device itself or corralling it in a secured data center. Users seeking more AI wizardry than the device or the special data center can handle will have the option to reach out to the popular ChatGPT technology made by OpenAI, which has forged a partnership with Apple."

The landscape around her is dotted with active and abandoned mineshafts, farmland that may soon be cleared in search of more rich ore, and other mine workers \u2014 many of them children.",
      "Juliet should be in school, her mother, Abigail Samaniya, admits. Instead, she spends her day mining lithium, a mineral critical for batteries needed in the global transition to clean energy, to earn money that helps sustain her family.",
      "\u201cThat is the only option,\u201d Abigail Samaniya said.",
      "The International Labour Organization estimates more than 1 million children work in mines and quarries worldwide, a problem particularly acute in Africa, where poverty, limited access to education and weak regulations add to the problem.

      "The growing demand for lithium has created a new frontier for mining in mineral-rich Nigeria. But it has come with a steep cost, exploiting its poorest and most vulnerable: its children. Their work often provides material for Chinese businesses that dominate Nigeria\u2019s laxly regulated extractive industry and are often blamed for illegal mining and labor exploitation.",
      "The Associated Press recently traveled to the deep bush of Pasali, near the federal capital of Abuja in Nasarawa state, to follow and interview miners operating illegal mines, including the one where Juliet works.

      "\u201cBut it is God that protects,\u201d he said.",
      "Rabiu hauled up raw lithium ore and passed it to Juliet and five other children, all younger than 10. Wearing rubber slippers and dust-stained shorts and shirts, the children hunched over heaps of rubble and chipped away with crude stone tools to extract valuable fragments. Once sorted, the minerals were bagged to begin their journey from Pasali to the global supply chain.",
      "A team of six children can sort and bag up to 10 25-kilogram bags of lithium-rich rock a day. When the AP visited, they did 22 kilograms (about 48.5 pounds) in one hour.

Juliet was pulled out because her family couldn't afford to send both her and her 11-year-old brother, and his education took precedence, her mother said.",
      "Basic education is supposed to be free in Nigeria, at least in government schools like the one in Pasali. But hidden fees often put it out of reach of the poorest families. For example, in Pasali, a Parent-Teacher Association levy of 5,000 Naira (about $3) is charged per term, parents said. For Juliet\u2019s family and others, even this amount is too much. About 63% of Nigeria's population lives in poverty.",

The law, officially known as the Inflation Reduction Act, includes nearly $400 billion in spending and tax credits to accelerate the expansion of clean energy such as wind and solar power, speeding the nation\u2019s transition away from the oil, coal and natural gas that largely cause climate change.",
      "The funds, to be delivered in early 2025, \u201cwill reduce air pollution, improve health outcomes in nearby communities, and advance the campaign to tackle climate change,\u201d EPA Pacific Southwest Regional Administrator Martha Guzman said in a statement.",
      "California and local agencies will have the next two to three years to implement the grants for zero-emission trucks.",
      "Nationwide, the transportation sector contributes the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions annually, according to the EPA, with medium- and heavy-duty trucks contributing nearly a quarter of those emissions.",
      "Heavy-duty vehicles make up about 3% of vehicles on the road in California, but they generate more than half of nitrogen oxides and fine-particle diesel pollution, according to the California Air Resources Board. That\u2019s because these trucks have diesel engines that, while more powerful, produce more pollution than gasoline engines. They also travel many more miles than passenger vehicles.",
      "California is trying to rid itself of fossil fuels, passing new rules in recent years to phase out fossil fuel-powered cars, trucks, trains and lawn equipment in the nation\u2019s most populous state. But those rules still require waivers from the EPA, which typically sets standards for emissions from passenger cars, trucks and other vehicles.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom last month, in anticipation of the incoming presidency of Donald Trump, traveled to Washington urge the Biden administration to grant waivers to eight climate rules, including those on zero-emission vehicles and emission standards for pollutants. The issues have been targeted in the past by President-elect Trump.",
      "\u2014-",
      "This story and headline have been corrected to reflect that the EPA is awarding California $135 million, not $144 million, and that the money will buy 455 zero-emission vehicles, not more than 480 vehicles."

      "Two luxury real estate brokers and their brother have been charged in a federal indictment with sex trafficking",
      "NEW YORK -- Two luxury real estate brokers and their brother have been charged with luring, drugging and violently raping dozens of women over more than a decade, according to a federal indictment unsealed Wednesday in Manhattan.",
      "State charges were also filed Wednesday in Florida against two of the brothers and a third man stemming from three alleged sexual assaults.",
      "Federal prosecutors allege in the New York indictment that Oren and Tal Alexander, known for brokering deals on high-end properties in New York City and Miami, and sibling Alon Alexander used their wealth and influence to take advantage of women from at least 2010 to 2021.",
      "The brothers, who all reside in Miami, used \u201cdeception, fraud, and coercion\u201d to entice victims to travel with them or attend parties or events, often covering flights, hotels and other expenses, according to the indictment. They also at times used the promise of a romantic relationship, it said.",
      "The women were then drugged and raped by one or more of the brothers, as well as other men, before being sent away with concert tickets and other luxuries.",
      "\u201cThis conduct was heinous,\u201d U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said at a news conference in Manhattan.",
      "The brothers typically met their victims on dating apps, through social events and at bars and nightclubs, but they also used party promoters to \u201csource\u201d women, according to Williams.",
      "He added that the women were often provided drugs, including cocaine, psychedelic mushrooms and GHB. The brothers even surreptitiously drugged some of the women\u2019s drinks, leaving them physically impaired and unable to fight back or escape from the sexual assaults, prosecutors said in their indictment.",
      "\"In some instances, the defendants physically restrained and held down their victims during the rapes and sexual assaults and ignored screams and explicit requests to stop,'' the indictment said.",
      "In the Florida cases, state prosecutors described one incident in December 2016 as a \u201cgang rape\u201d of a woman who said she was invited to a barbecue at Alon Alexander\u2019s Miami Beach apartment only to discover no one there, save Alon, his brother Oren and another relative, Ohad Fisherman, who remains at large.",
      "The woman, who is not named, said she was led into a bedroom where Fisherman held her down and the brothers argued over who would rape her first as she pleaded with them not to assault her, according to Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle.",
      "The second incident, in October 2017, involved a woman who said she was sexually assaulted by Oren Alexander at his apartment after drinking a glass of wine that left her feeling weak and unable to control her body, according to prosecutors.",
      "They said the third incident happened in October 2021 and involved a woman who said she was assaulted by Oren Alexander after going back to his residence with friends following dinner.",
      "Williams, the U.S. Attorney in New York, said the three brothers were arrested in Florida on Wednesday and will appear in Miami federal court before being brought to New York.",
      "He declined to say if others also will be charged but urged any other possible victims to come forward.",
      "Meanwhile lawyers for the brothers denied the charges, which include one count of engaging in a sex trafficking conspiracy for each sibling.",
      "\u201cOren Alexander is innocent,\u201d attorney Susan Necheles wrote in an email. \u201cThe evidence will show that neither he nor his brothers ever committed a crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy client will be entering a not guilty plea and dealing with these charges in the appropriate forum .. .the courtroom,\u201d responded Isabelle Kirshner, a lawyer for Alon Alexander.",
      "Joel Denaro, a lawyer for Tal Alexander, declined to comment.",
      "The elder brother appeared in Miami federal court Wednesday and will have a detention hearing Friday as prosecutors argue he\u2019s a danger to the community and a flight risk. The two other brothers are in state custody and are expected to appear in court Thursday.",
      "Representatives for a number of women who filed lawsuits earlier this year claiming they were violently raped by the brothers welcomed the charges.",
      "\u201cWe are glad to hear that there will finally be some measure of accountability for the Alexander brothers and justice for their many victims,\u201d lawyer David Gottlieb wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cWe applaud all the survivors who have had the strength and courage to speak up about their unimaginable experiences after years of pain and suffering.\u201d",
      "Tal Alexander, 38, and Oren Alexander, 37, first worked as a team under real estate giant Douglas Elliman, listing properties for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, Liam Gallagher, and Lindsay Lohan. In 2022, they started a new company called Official.",
      "Alon Alexander, who is Oren's twin brother, attended law school and joined the family's private security business.",

      "Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs.",
      "\u201cWe're going to put our list together, and I'm sure the other provinces will as well. But we will go to the full extent, depending on how far this goes. We will go to the extent of cutting off their energy,\u201d Ontario Premier Doug Ford said after meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other provincial premiers.",
      "Ford said he didn't want this to happen but wasn't optimistic Canada could avoid tariffs.",
      "\u201cThis fight is 100% coming on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21,\u201d he said, referencing to the date of Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "\u201cWe will use every tool in our tool box to fight back. We can\u2019t sit back and roll over. We just won\u2019t as a country. And isn\u2019t this a shame, our closest friends and allies.\"",
      "About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear if Ford was talking about all Canadian provinces cutting off energy exports to the U.S. or just his province. But a spokeswoman for Ford, Grace Lee, said it was raised in the call between Trudeau and the provincial premiers.",
      "\u201cPremier Ford can only speak on behalf of Ontario, but its an area of provincial jurisdiction that we would certainly look at,\u201d Lee said in an email.",
      "Lee noted Ontario powered 1.5 million homes in the U.S. in 2023 and is a major exporter of electricity to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Trump\u2019s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the threat.",

      "\u201cCanada, of course, will respond to unjustified tariffs,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said after the meeting.",
      "Freeland said a number of provincial premiers voiced support for a robust response to the tariffs and said that included critical minerals that are exported to the U.S.",
      "She didn't specifically mention oil but said \u201cobviously other ideas were discussed as well\u201d when asked if Canada is considering cutting off oil exports to America.",
      "About a third of Canada's trade to the U.S. is energy.",
      "Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US $2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states.",
      "Canada has promised more border security spending to address Trump's concerns. Ford said that will include more border and police officers as well as drones and sniffer dogs.",
      "\u201cA priority will be to share details of this plan with the incoming Trump administration and with Canadians in the coming days,\u201d Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said.",
      "Trudeau said this week tariffs would be \u201cabsolutely devastating\u201d for the Canadian economy, but it would also mean real hardship for Americans.",
      "Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and other goods.",
      "The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington-based trade group, has said tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate.",
      "Canada imposed duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",

      "\u201cWe did underline that the threat of new tariffs on Canadian exports, particularly at the level suggested, that is a major source of new uncertainty,\u201d Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem said at a press conference. \u201cBut the reality is we don't know if those tariffs are going to be implemented.",
      "\"We don't know if exemptions are going to be agreed on some parts, we don't know at what level, we don't know if Canada will take retaliatory measures.\u201d",
      "Trudeau, meanwhile, got the attention of billionaire Elon Musk, a big supporter of Trump, with comments he made Tuesday lamenting that U.S. voters selected Trump over Kamala Harris as president.",
      "\u201cWe were supposed to be on a steady if difficult sometimes march toward progress. And yet, just a few weeks ago, the United States voted for a second time to not elect its first woman president,\u201d Trudeau said at a event sponsored by Equal Voice, an organization dedicated to improving gender representation in Canadian politics. \u201cEverywhere, women\u2019s rights and women\u2019s progress is under attack \u2014 overtly and subtly.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey are not helpful at all. It was brought up a couple of times in our meeting,\u201d Ford said. \u201cDonald Trump was elected democratically. If you like him or you don\u2019t like him that\u2019s not our issue. We elect Canadians and it was not helpful whatsoever. I\u2019m sure the prime minister got the message loud and clear.\u201d",

      "North Carolina and Bill Belichick have agreed to a five-year deal for the six-time Super Bowl-winning head coach to become the Tar Heels\u2019 next football coach",
      "Bill Belichick had seemingly been waiting for the right opportunity to return to an NFL sideline. Instead, the six-time Super Bowl-winning head coach is headed to the college ranks to take over at North Carolina.",
      "The school announced it had reached a five-year deal with Belichick on Wednesday night, roughly a week after Belichick\u2019s name surfaced as an unlikely candidate to replace the program\u2019s winningest coach in Mack Brown. The deal requires approval by UNC trustees as well as the UNC public system\u2019s governors; an introductory news conference has yet to be scheduled.",
      "Moving on from the 73-year-old Brown to hire the 72-year-old Belichick means UNC is turning to a coach who has never worked at the college level, yet had incredible success in the NFL alongside quarterback Tom Brady throughout most of his 24-year tenure with the Patriots, which ended last season.",
      "There\u2019s also at least a small family tie to the UNC program for Belichick; his late father, Steve, was an assistant coach for the Tar Heels from 1953-55.",
      "\u201cI am excited for the opportunity at UNC-Chapel Hill,\u201d Belichick said in a statement. \u201cI grew up around college football with my dad and treasured those times. I have always wanted to coach in college and now I look forward to building the football program in Chapel Hill.",
      "He's arriving on campus at a time of rapid changes in college athletics, from free player movement through the transfer portal and athletes' ability to cash in on endorsements to the looming arrival of revenue sharing. Consider the Belichick hiring a novel approach by the school to rethinking how it will approach those challenges, led by someone known for success at the highest level of the sport.",
      "\u201cWe know that college athletics is changing, and those changes require new and innovative thinking,\u201d UNC athletics director Bubba Cunningham said in a statement. \u201cBill Belichick is a football legend, and hiring him to lead our program represents a new approach that will ensure Carolina football can evolve, compete and win \u2014 today and in the future.\u201d",
      "Belichick holds 333 career regular-season and postseason wins in the NFL, trailing only Don Shula\u2019s 347 for the NFL record, while his 31 playoff wins are the most in league history.",
      "He's the second coach to win a Super Bowl and then later become a college head coach; Bill Walsh won three Super Bowls with the San Francisco 49ers and later went 17-17-1 at Stanford from 1992-94.",
      "He had been linked to NFL jobs in the time since his departure from the Patriots, notably the Atlanta Falcons in January. That\u2019s why word of Belichick\u2019s conversations with UNC \u2014 first reported by Inside Carolina and confirmed by the AP last week \u2014 stirred such surprise as an unexpected and unconventional candidate.",
      "But the two sides had been in discussions for several days working on terms before finally reaching an agreement to cap what once seemed an improbable outcome.",
      "Belichick said Monday on ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d that he\u2019d had \u201ca couple of good conversations\u201d with UNC chancellor Lee Roberts and that he\u2019d spent much of the past year taking a \u201clonger look\u201d at college football.",
      "\u201cIf I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,\u201d Belichick said Monday. \u201cIt would be a professional program: training, nutrition, scheme, coaching, techniques that would transfer to the NFL.",
      "\u201cIt would be an NFL program at a college level. And an education that would get the players ready for their career after football, whether that was the end of their college career or at the end of their pro career.\"",
      "Belichick began his NFL coaching career as an assistant with the Baltimore Colts in 1975 and later worked as defensive coordinator under Bill Parcells with the New York Giants, winning two Super Bowls during that stint. He also spent five seasons as head coach of the Cleveland Browns in the first half of the 1990s.",
      "He got his second shot as a head coach in 2000 with the Patriots. And in his second year, as Brady rose to stardom, Belichick won his first Super Bowl title as a head coach.",
      "The Belichick-Brady duo went on to win the Super Bowl for the 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016 and 2018 seasons, and Belichick was The Associated Press NFL coach of the year three times.",
      "Now he takes over a UNC program that is facing a familiar challenge of how to build a sustained winner. The program had reached elite levels in moments rather than eras, notably with Brown building UNC into top-10 national stats (1996, 1997) to end his first tenure in Chapel Hill before taking over at Texas or the Tar Heels cracking the top 10 of the AP Top 25 poll briefly in 2015 and 2020.",
      "The peak of Brown's second tenure came with a nine-win season and trip to the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game in 2022 behind eventual No. 3 overall NFL draft pick Drake Maye, who was coincidentally drafted by the Patriots for their first post-Belichick year.",
      "The school announced Nov. 26 that Brown wouldn\u2019t return for a seventh season in his second stint in Chapel Hill, a firing that became effective after the program\u2019s all-time wins leader coached his finale in the Nov. 30 loss to rival N.C. State.",
      "Freddie Kitchens, himself a former Browns head coach, has been working as the interim coach as the Tar Heels prepare to face UConn in the Fenway Bowl on Dec. 28.",

      "Lake Placid would play host to bobsled, luge and skeleton events for the 2026 Olympics if a track currently being rebuilt in Italy isn't finished in time for the Milan-Cortina Games, officials said Wednesday.",
      "There has been no indication from Italian officials that the track \u2014 a century-old facility that has been dormant for nearly 20 years \u2014 won't be ready in time. Lake Placid would be serving only as a backup site, just in case.",
      "The Olympic Regional Development Authority, which manages the sliding venue in Lake Placid, said it would engage in \u201ctargeted dialogue\u201d with Italian organizers to \u201cfurther develop the Plan B back up plan for the sliding events.\"",
      "\u201cNew York State is honored to be selected, and we will work closely with Fondazione Milano Cortina to discuss the planning in a detailed manner to stage the Plan B back up plan,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.",
      "Lake Placid has played host to the Winter Games twice before, in 1932 and 1980. It isn't completely unprecedented for Olympic events to not take place anywhere near the Olympic city; for example, surfing at this summer's Paris Games took place in Tahiti and equestrian events at the 1956 Melbourne Games took place in Sweden.",
      "\u201cIt would create a different environment, a different Olympic experience in not being with the rest of Team USA,\u201d USA Luge CEO Scott Riewald said. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing like competing at an Olympics on your home turf and on your home soil. And I think it presents some great opportunities for Team USA athletes and for USA Luge athletes to compete with the best in the world on a track where we\u2019ve had success.\u201d",
      "It would provide the U.S. luge, bobsled and skeleton teams with a massive advantage, since Lake Placid is their home track. American sliders tend to fare well in World Cup races in Lake Placid, and the track at Mount Van Hoevenberg will play host to the next world bobsled and skeleton championships in March.",
      "Italy\u2019s decision to rebuild the century-old track in Cortina at a cost of nearly $90 million has been met with fierce opposition by the International Olympic Committee. There were a number of other suggestions, such has holding sliding events at tracks in nearby Austria or Switzerland.",
      "The Italians insist the track will be ready. Plans are in place to have work continue throughout this winter with temporary covering at the facility to shield both the track and workers from the elements. The refrigeration system will be converted to a heating mechanism to further improve conditions for those working at the site over the winter months.",
      "But it remains unclear if sliders will be able to test the track in March as planned, and if that doesn't happen then Lake Placid could become an even more viable candidate.",
      "\u201cWe still have to go into this planning that the games are going to be in Cortina and have to take advantage of any opportunity that we have to gather information about what that will be like,\u201d Riewald said. \u201cBut yes, we will be thinking about how can we, if it does get to that point, take advantage of the fact that the games will be here in the U.S. and structure our preparations appropriately.\u201d",
      "The games will take place from Feb. 6-22, 2026.",

      "\u201cMe and Jalen are good,\u201d Brown said.",
      "Added Hurts, \u201cWe\u2019re good, we\u2019re good.\u201d",
      "So there will be no sit-ups in the driveway, no apologies on the front lawn, and certainly, it seems, no rift between Hurts and his No. 1 receiver.",
      "Hurts and Brown each downplayed any hint of a fissure Wednesday between the two after defensive end Brandon Graham appeared this week on a Philadelphia sports radio station and suggested there was friction between the Pro Bowl duo. The two were close friends long before they became teammates and Hurts is the godfather for Brown\u2019s daughter.",
      "Graham's comments \u2014 in which he noted \u201c things have changed,\u201d between the two, without offering specifics \u2014 exploded into tabloid and fan fodder this week in Philadelphia. His insinuations that the duo were not on the same page came on the heels of Brown's quote after a sluggish win over Carolina that the \u201c offense \u201d wasn\u2019t playing up to standard, even with the Eagles at 11-2.",
      "\u201cBG knows he spoke out of place,\u201d Hurts said.",
      "Graham, who is sidelined with a triceps injury, clarified his comments later to an ESPN reporter, saying he made the wrong assumption about the relationship between Hurts and Brown and planned to apologize to both players.",
      "Brown, with 109 yards receiving combined the last two games, said his beef with the offense wasn't directed at Hurts. It was everything from offensive coordinator Kellen Moore's play calling to execution to all the ingredients in a successful offense that make a team a Super Bowl contender.",
      "The usually pass-happy Eagles have leaned more on running back Saquon Barkley, who set the franchise season rushing record of 1,623 yards against the Panthers and is chasing Eric Dickerson for the NFL mark.",
      "\u201cObviously, it's not about running the ball,\u201d Brown told reporters. \u201cHe's about to win MVP. Clearly. What other things can we do on offense? We have to pass the ball. That can go into protection, that can go into picking up the block, that goes to us getting open quicker. Getting on the same page.\u201d",
      "Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said he never witnessed any issues between Hurts and Brown and only saw two players who worked hard together, even working on routes after practice and seemed to have a deep personal connection on and off the field.",
      "\u201cYou guys get to see three hours every Sunday where emotions can play as high as they\u2019re going to play,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cI get to see these guys every single day, how they go about their business and interact with each other.\u201d",
      "Brown, who was coming off consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons, wasn't necessarily wrong in his frustration with the recent stagnation of the passing game.",
      "Hurts, who signed a contract extension ahead of the 2023 season that was worth $179.3 million guaranteed, has thrown for fewer than 200 yards in three straight games. Wide receiver DeVonta Smith \u2014 who also complained Sunday about the offense \u2014 was also coming off consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons but has yet to break 100 yards in a game this season. Brown has four 100-yard games, well off last season\u2019s run when he topped 100 yards in six straight games and seven times overall.",
      "Hurts has been more efficient than explosive this season but has still thrown 12 touchdown passes to just one interception \u2014 and rushed for 11 more scores \u2014 during the Eagles' nine-game winning streak that has them on the brink of clinching the NFC East.",
      "Maybe playing the Steelers on Sunday at home can snap the Eagles out of their offensive malaise. Hurts threw three TD passes to Brown in a 35-13 win in 2022.",
      "\u201cDo we all have things to get better at in the passing game? Yeah, I think that\u2019s obvious,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been talking about. We all have things that we\u2019ve got to get better at, coaches, players. But this is why this is the greatest team sport there is. It takes everybody. It takes every single person being together, every single person for the success to happen. It\u2019s just not a one-person thing.\u201d",

      "Juan Soto gets free use of a luxury suite and up to four premium tickets behind home plate for regular-season and postseason New York Mets home games as part of his record $765 million, 15-year contract",
      "DALLAS -- Juan Soto gets free use of a luxury suite and up to four premium tickets behind home plate for regular-season and postseason New York Mets home games as part of his record $765 million, 15-year contract that was finalized Wednesday.",
      "The Mets also agreed to provide personal team security for the All-Star outfielder and his family at the team\u2019s expense for all spring training and regular-season home and road games, according to details of the agreement obtained by The Associated Press. Major League Baseball teams usually provide security for player families in seating areas at ballparks.",
      "New York also agreed to assist Soto's family for in-season travel arrangements, guaranteed Soto will have uniform No. 22 and included eight types of award bonuses.",
      "Soto wore No. 22 with all his previous major league teams: the Nationals, Padres and Yankees. Young third baseman Brett Baty wore No. 22 with the Mets the past three seasons.",
      "The Mets will formally introduce Soto in a news conference Thursday afternoon at Citi Field.",
      "\u201cThis is a seminal moment in franchise history,\u201d owners Steve and Alex Cohen said in a statement. \u201cJuan Soto is a generational talent. He is not only bringing staggering historical statistics with him but also a championship pedigree.\"",
      "Soto's suite will be valued at the Mets' prevailing prices, presumably for tax purposes, and after 2025 he can by each Jan. 15 modify or give up his suite selection for the upcoming season. He can request the premium tickets, to be used by family members, no later than 72 hours before the scheduled game time.",
      "The Yankees had refused to offer Soto a free suite.",
      "\u201cSome high-end players that make a lot of money for us, if they want suites they buy them ... whether it's CC (Sabathia), whether it\u2019s (Aaron) Judge, whether it\u2019s (Gerrit) Cole, whether it\u2019s any of these guys,\" general manager Brian Cashman said. \"We've gone through a process on previous negotiations where asks might have happened and this is what we did and we\u2019re going to honor those, so no regrets there.\"",
      "Cashman said the Yankees have a shared suite for player families and a family room with babysitting.",
      "Soto gets a $75 million signing bonus, payable within 60 days of the agreement\u2019s approval by the commissioner\u2019s office. The deal for the 26-year-old slugger, which tops Shohei Ohtani's $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers, was reached Sunday pending a physical that took place Tuesday.",
      "Soto receives salaries of $46,875,000 each in 2025 and 2026, $42.5 million in 2027, $46,875,000 apiece in 2028 and 2029 and $46 million in each of the final 10 seasons.",
      "Soto has a contingent right to opt out of the agreement after the 2029 World Series to become a free agent again. But the Mets have an option to negate that opt-out provision by increasing the yearly salaries for 2030-39 by $4 million annually to $50 million and raising the total value to $805 million. If the club does not exercise its option to negate the opt-out provision by the third day after the World Series, Soto can make his opt-out decision by the fifth day after the Series.",
      "He has a full no-trade provision and gets a hotel suite on road trips.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s signing further solidifies our organizational commitment to consistent championship competitiveness,\u201d Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said. \u201cNot only does Juan provide historic levels of on field production, but his joy, intensity, and passion for the game mirror our budding culture. We are thrilled to add him to our team and look forward to watching his excellence for years to come.\u201d",
      "Soto would receive a $500,000 bonus for winning his first Most Valuable Player award and $1 million for each MVP award. He would get $350,000 for finishing second in the voting and $150,000 for finishing third through fifth. Soto was third in AL voting this year.",
      "He would earn $100,000 for each All-Star selection and Gold Glove, $350,000 for World Series MVP and $150,000 for League Championship Series MVP.",
      "Soto would get $100,000 for selection to the All-MLB first or second team, $150,000 for a Silver Slugger award and $100,000 for the Hank Aaron Award.",

      "The NFL will consider expanding replay assist to include facemask penalties and other plays",
      "IRVING, Texas -- The NFL will consider expanding replay assist to include facemask penalties and other plays.",
      "Officials have missed several obvious facemask penalties this season, including two in a three-week span during Thursday night games.",
      "\u201cWhen we see it, because I see it like yourselves and the fans, I have an opportunity to see it from a different angle and see it from a slow-mo,\u201d NFL executive Troy Vincent said Wednesday at the league\u2019s winter meetings.",
      "\u201cWhen you think about the position of where the officials are, things are happening so fast. Sometimes the facemask can be the same color as the gloves. There\u2019s a lot happening. Concerning? Yes, because that\u2019s a big miss. That\u2019s a big foul. That\u2019s why we would like to consider putting that for the membership to consider putting that foul category that we can see, putting that (penalty flag) on the field to help. There is a frustration, and we believe that is one category we can potentially get right.\"",
      "Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold was grabbed by his facemask and brought down in the end zone to end Minnesota\u2019s comeback attempt against the Rams on Oct. 24. But there was no call.",
      "On Oct. 3, officials missed a facemask on Buccaneers running back Bucky Irving while he ran for 7 yards late in the fourth quarter. Tampa Bay instead was called for holding on the play, got forced out of field-goal range and Kirk Cousins rallied the Falcons to an overtime victory.",
      "\u201cThat is one this year, the facemask seems like it was the obvious one\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThat keeps showing up.\u201d",
      "Vincent also cited hits on a defenseless player, tripping, the fair catch, an illegal batted ball, an illegal double-team block, illegal formations on kickoffs and taunting as other areas that warrant consideration for replay assist.",
      "Current rules only allow replay assist to help officials pick up a flag incorrectly thrown on the field, or in assisting proper enforcement of a foul called on the field.",
      "The NFL\u2019s Competition Committee will review potential recommendations for owners to vote on for expanding replay assist.",
      "Vincent was emphatic about the league\u2019s desire to eliminate low blocks that could lead to serious injuries.",
      "\u201cThe low block below the knee needs to be removed from the game,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cYou look at high school, you look at college, too. Every block should be above the knee, but below the neck. All the work that we\u2019ve done for the head and neck area, all the things that we\u2019ve taken out of the game, this is the right time for us to remove the low block out of the game. Be consistent with high school. Be consistent with college. Every block should be above the knee and below the neck.\u201d",
      "The league will consider changes to the onside kick after dramatically overhauling the kickoff rule on a one-year basis.",
      "\u201cWe need to look at that. That\u2019s a dead play,\u201d Vincent said of the onside kick\u2019s low success rate. \u201cThat is a ceremonial play. Very low recovery rate. When we look at the kickoff and maybe where the touchback area should be during the offseason, we need to revisit the onside kick.\u201d",
      "Options include giving the team an opportunity to run one play to gain a certain number of yards to keep possession.",
      "The Washington Commanders\u2019 search for a new stadium site includes options in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, and work has escalated on one in particular.",
      "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and controlling owner Josh Harris met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill last week about the RFK Stadium site in Washington, which requires a bill getting through Congress to transfer the land to the District government before anything else can happen.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bipartisan support for this,\u201d Goodell said, adding he\u2019d like to see it get to a vote soon. \u201cWe hope that it will be addressed and approved so that it\u2019s at least an alternative for the Commanders if we go forward. I grew up in Washington, and I know would be exciting for a lot of fans.\u201d",
      "The NFL continues to discuss a potential 18-game season, but would need approval from the players\u2019 union.",
      "\u201cWe are doing analysis I would say, but we are not finalizing any plans at this point,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThey\u2019ll share that analysis with the players\u2019 union, which would need to agree to any change.\u201d",

      "Saudi Arabia scored a major win in its campaign to attract major sports events to the kingdom when it was formally appointed as the 2034 World Cup host on Wednesday",
      "ZURICH -- Saudi Arabia scored a major win in its campaign to attract major sports events to the kingdom when it was formally appointed as the 2034 World Cup host on Wednesday.",
      "Still, many questions remain about the tournament as well as the 2030 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by Spain, Portugal and Morocco, with three games in South America.",
      "Here are some of the key issues that need to be answered over the next decade:",
      "Saudi Arabia proposes 15 stadiums \u2014 eight still on paper \u2014 in five cities: Eight in the capital Riyadh, four in the Red Sea port city Jeddah, and one each in Abha, Al Khobar and Neom, the planned futuristic mega-project. Each would have at least 40,000 seats for World Cup games.",
      "The opening game and final are set for a 92,000-seat venue planned in Riyadh. Some designs are vivid. In Neom, the stadium is planned 350 meters (yards) above street level and one near Riyadh is designed to be atop a 200-meter cliff with a retractable wall of LED screens.",
      "Saudi Arabia aims to host all 104 games, though there has been speculation that some games could be played in neighboring or nearby countries.",
      "Surely not in the traditional World Cup period of June-July, when temperatures in Saudi Arabia routinely exceed 40 Celsius (104 degrees).",
      "FIFA moved the Qatar-hosted World Cup to November-December 2022, though those dates were not loved by most European clubs and leagues whose seasons were interrupted. Also, that slot is complicated in 2034 by the holy month of Ramadan through mid-December and Riyadh hosting the multi-sport Asian Games.",
      "January 2034 could be a possibility even though that would be just before the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. The International Olympic Committee has signaled it won\u2019t be opposed to back-to-back major events.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Saudi World Cup bid official Hammad Albalawi said the precise dates of the tournament are up the world soccer body.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a decision by FIFA. We stand ready to be part of this conversation. But ultimately it\u2019s a FIFA decision together with the confederations,\u201d Albalawi said.",
      "Giving more rights and freedoms to women in a traditionally conservative society is fundamental to Saudi messaging around the modernization program known as Vision 2030.",
      "The kingdom decided in 2017 to let women attend sports events, initially in major cities and in family zones separate from men-only sections.",
      "By 2034, at the promised pace of social reforms, female fans should not be restricted.",
      "Saudi Arabia launched a women\u2019s professional soccer league in 2022 with players joining from clubs in Europe. They face no restrictions playing in shorts and with hair uncovered.",
      "The Saudi prohibition of alcohol is clear and understood before FIFA signs any sponsor deals for 2034. But will there be any exceptions?",
      "The alcohol issue was problematic for the World Cup in Qatar because the expectation was created that beer sales would be allowed at stadiums even before Qatar won its bid in 2010. One year later, FIFA extended a long-time deal to have Budweiser as the official World Cup beer through 2022.",
      "Qatar then backtracked on that promise three days before the first game, causing confusion and the sense of a promise broken.",
      "In Qatar, alcohol was served only at luxury suites at the stadiums. Visitors could also have a drink in some hotel bars.",
      "But Saudi Arabia has even stricter rules on alcohol \u2014 and there is no indication that will change.",
      "Albalawi noted that Saudi Arabia has successfully hosted dozens of sports events where alcohol wasn't served.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re creating a safe and secure family environment for fans to bring their families into our stadiums,\u201d he said.",
      "Saudi promises to reform and enforce labor laws, and fully respect migrant workers, have been accepted by FIFA but face broad skepticism from rights groups and trade unions. A formal complaint is being investigated by the U.N.-backed International Labor Organization.",
      "Protecting the migrant workers needed to build stadiums and other tournament projects \u2014 a decade after it was a defining issue for Qatar \u2014 looms as a signature challenge for Saudi Arabia.",
      "Saudi-Israeli relations had been improving when FIFA all but gave the 2034 World Cup to the kingdom on Oct. 4 last year. Three days later Hamas attacked Israel and diplomacy got more complicated.",
      "Any soccer federation bidding to host a FIFA tournament accepts a basic principle that whichever team qualifies is welcome.",
      "That did not stop Indonesia putting up barriers last year to Israel coming for the men\u2019s Under-20 World Cup. Indonesia does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel which had qualified through a European tournament nine months before the issue flared.",
      "FIFA moved the entire tournament to Argentina and the Israeli team reached the semifinals.",
      "Israel played at the 1970 World Cup but has never advanced through qualifying in Europe, where it has been a member of UEFA for 30 years. Europe should have 16 places in the 48-team World Cup in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Most of the attention at the FIFA Congress on Wednesday was on the Saudi decision, but the soccer body and its members also formally approved the hosts of the 2030 World Cup \u2014 the most spread out and longest ever.",
      "One game each in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, the original host in 1930, will be played from June 8-9. The tournament resumes four days later for the other 101 games shared between Spain, Portugal and Morocco.",
      "Six countries, three continents, multiple languages and currencies. Fans traveling on planes, trains, automobiles and boats across about 14 kilometers (10 miles) of water between Spain and Morocco.",

      "BEAVER CREEK, Colo. -- Lindsey Vonn tries to take her comeback step-by-step even if there's plenty of reason \u2014 and temptation \u2014 to look down the road.",
      "On Wednesday, the 40-year-old American ski racer was concentrating solely on testing out the Birds of Prey course as a forerunner. Soon, it's setting up to be a World Cup race. Possibly later, the 2026 Winter Games at one of her favorite venues in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy.",
      "\u201cIn a perfect world, yeah, that would be amazing,\u201d Vonn said of the thought of competing at a fifth Winter Olympics. \u201cBut I\u2019m trying to stay in the present. It\u2019s a long ways to Cortina. So, again, just put the brakes on my expectations and try to stay focused on today and see where I can take it, because no one\u2019s done it before.\u201d",
      "What she's trying to accomplish is a comeback after nearly six years away and after undergoing a partial knee replacement last April.",
      "Vonn was one of three forerunners Wednesday to test out the demanding course before the racers in the field went through a training run. She's scheduled to serve as a forerunner over the next two training days, and then both races \u2014 a downhill on Saturday and a super-G on Sunday.",
      "She earned enough points last weekend at a series of lower-level FIS races to compete on the World Cup circuit, but not in time to earn a spot at Beaver Creek.",
      "After finishing her forerunning trip through the course, Vonn called in a report to her American teammates. She offered advice on how to tackle the hill.",
      "\u201cIt felt so normal to be standing in the start gate,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cEverything felt as it should.\u201d",
      "Strange being a forerunner again, which is typically reserved for racers just breaking into the circuit?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it feels strange,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cIt feels normal in the progression that I\u2019m making. I mean, I would prefer to be racing here, but beggars can\u2019t be choosers.\u201d",
      "She looked in fast form, too. At least, teammate Bella Wright thought so after watching her from a ski lift.",
      "\u201cI heard some skis and looked over and it was Lindsey tucking,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, she looks as good as ever.\u2019\u201d",
      "Vonn wasn't quite ready to commit to a racing schedule. The next speed events are a pair of super-G competitions on Dec. 21-22 in St. Moritz, Switzerland.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Vonn said of her plans. \u201cI felt really good physically out there today. I definitely skied conservatively. Very soon I\u2019ll make a decision, but not today.\u201d",
      "When Vonn left the tour, she had 82 World Cup wins \u2014 the record for a woman at the time and within reach of the all-time Alpine mark of 86 held by Swedish standout Ingemar Stenmark. The women\u2019s record held by Vonn was eclipsed in January 2023 by Mikaela Shiffrin, whose 99 wins are more than any Alpine ski racer in the history of the sport.",
      "Vonn is trying to temper expectations.",
      "\u201cI have to be patient. It is definitely not my strong suit. But I\u2019m trying,\" Vonn said. \"I have a partial knee replacement. I know I\u2019m not going to be winning World Cups right off the bat, but I know what I\u2019m capable of. ... I\u2019m really close to being in a really good spot.",
      "\u201cI just hope everyone\u2019s as patient as I am. Just keep everything in perspective and not come after me and my kneecaps when I don\u2019t win my first World Cup.\u201d",
      "Looming on the horizon is the 2026 Winter Games at a place Vonn thrives \u2014 Cortina. She has 12 World Cup downhill and super-G wins at the venue. Vonn also recorded the first podium result of her career in Cortina, back in 2004. It's also the site of where, in 2015, she broke Austrian great Annemarie Moser-Proell\u2019s women's mark of 62 World Cup wins across all disciplines.",
      "\u201cWhen I retired, I think the number one thing that I was sad about was that I couldn\u2019t race Cortina for the Olympics,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cCortina is a very special place to me.\u201d",
      "Notes: Federica Brignone of Italy had the fastest time at 1 minute, 34.13 seconds on a Birds of Prey course that's new to quite a few racers. Swiss racer Lara Gut-Behrami was 0.39 seconds behind in second. \u201cIt's really nice,\u201d Gut-Behrami said of the course. \u201cToday, with the sunshine, the first run, the slope was on the soft side \u2014 easy, skiable side. For the race ... it's going to going to be way harder, way faster and way more challenging.\u201d",

      "The Paris Olympics says it was far less polluting than recent Games but is not claiming to have been \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d despite funding projects to compensate for its emissions",
      "PARIS -- The Paris Olympics says it was far less polluting than recent Games but is not claiming to have been \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d despite funding projects to compensate for its emissions.",
      "Organizers said Wednesday that this summer's Olympics and Paralympics generated 1.59 million tons of climate-warming carbon dioxide, from the food athletes ate and construction of their rooms to flights that spectators took and energy that powered events.",
      "According to a French government carbon-impact calculator, 1.59 million tons of CO2 is equivalent to driving a car 182,675 times around the globe or 898,305 return flights between Paris and New York.",
      "Still, Paris Games organizers said they more than met their goal of slashing the Olympics' pollution footprint by half \u2014 announcing a 54.6% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the London Olympics in 2012 and the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016.",
      "Here's a look at how they did it and tips they offered to future hosts, starting with the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics and the next Summer Games in Los Angeles in 2028.",
      "Paris organizers said thinking about carbon emissions far in advance of the Games and setting a reduction target were key. Those who led the task of planning and organizing the mega-event were given carbon budgets. Measures to slash emissions were built into plans from the start.",
      "\u201cTo change things, we had to reinvent,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Games' director of environmental excellence.",
      "Just as athletes seek ways to shave milliseconds off their times, Paris organizers sought not just big carbon savings \u2014 by building just one competition venue specifically for the Games \u2014 but smaller ones, too.",
      "The Olympic cauldron used electricity and LED spotlights to give the impression of being ablaze. That made it 300 times less polluting than if it had burned gas, Grenon said. Even Olympic medals included recycled materials, with each embedded with a reused chunk of the Eiffel Tower.",
      "Electricity powered 98.4% of the Games' energy needs and organizers said a purchasing agreement they signed with power supplier EDF ensured it was all solar- or wind-generated.",
      "Plant-based hot dogs and other vegetarian offerings less carbon-intensive than meat dishes accounted for 40% of the food that spectators ate, and the carbon footprint of meals served to Games workers and volunteers was half that of the typical French meal, organizers said.",
      "In selling 12.1 million tickets, Paris set attendance records. But transporting spectators to the French capital and to events came at an unexpectedly large carbon cost. Transport had been expected to account for about one-third of Paris' carbon footprint, but organizers said it ended up accounting for 53%.",
      "\u201cWe were a bit victims of our success, because we sold many more tickets than initially estimated,\u201d Grenon said.",
      "Just over 66% of spectators came from France. More than 21% came from elsewhere in Europe and another 12% came from further afield, led by ticket-holders from the United States, Brazil and Canada. For spectators who took long-haul flights, the carbon impact was about 1,000 times greater than transporting those from the Paris region, organizers said.",
      "Organizers said they are spending just over 12 million euros ($12.6 million) on projects in Africa, Asia, Central America and France that aim to compensate for the Games' 1.59 million tons of carbon emissions.",
      "The money is funding tens of thousands of less-polluting cooking stoves and access to water in Nigeria, Congo, Kenya and Rwanda, solar power in Senegal and Vietnam and forestation in Guatemala, Kenya, Senegal and France, organizers said.",
      "But Grenon said that while the projects aim to compensate for emissions, Paris won't label its Games \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d because that can be misleading.",
      "\u201cIt can give the impression that there is no impact when there is an impact,\" she added. \u201cThere was an impact but we treated it and, most of all, we reduced it.\u201d",

    "summary": "All-Star left-hander Garrett Crochet has been acquired by the Boston Red Sox from the Chicago White Sox for four prospects",
    "story": [
      "All-Star left-hander Garrett Crochet has been acquired by the Boston Red Sox from the Chicago White Sox for four prospects",
      "DALLAS -- Garrett Crochet was acquired by the Boston Red Sox from the White Sox on Wednesday for four prospects, giving Chicago a better deal for the All-Star left-hander than available at the trade deadline in July.",
      "For the Red Sox, who are still seeking more pitching, it was a quick pivot after losing out on free agent lefty Max Fried to the rival New York Yankees.",
      "\u201cFeel like we got a legitimate No. 1 starter in Garrett, left-handed, ton of swing and miss, you know, massive strikeouts and feel like the best is still in front of him,\u201d Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow said. \u201cAdding him to the rotation, it adds depth, it adds quality.\"",
      "Chicago got back catcher Kyle Teel, infielder Chase Meidroth. right-hander Wikelman Gonzalez and outfielder Braden Montgomery in the trade announced during the winter meetings.",
      "Crochet was 6-12 with a 3.58 ERA in 32 starts for a White Sox team that went 41-121, the most losses for any club since 1900. The 25-year-old was picked for the AL All-Star team in his first season as a starter.",
      "\u201cWhat he did this past season was nothing short of excellent,\u201d White Sox general manager Chris Getz said. \u201cBut you look at, you know, the long-term health of the organization and to inject the type of talent that we just did in in this trade is really exciting for us.\u201d",
      "Getz said plenty of teams were interested in Crochet and there were about five he thought could get a deal done. Many, including Boston, had inquired about the hard-throwing lefty over the summer.",
      "\u201cDiscussions really heated up last night with the Red Sox and we took that into the morning, and, you know, it was very clear that they were motivated,\" Getz said. \u201cWe wanted to get something done. And, you know, we made a match. ... Both clubs should feel really good about the return.\u201d",
      "The trade came a day after Fried agreed to join the Yankees for a $218 million, eight-year contract, the largest ever for a left-hander.",
      "\u201cWe came here a few days ago thinking we needed to improve our rotation,\u201d Breslow said. \u201cIf we exclusively looked down one path, we would be closed off from other options. I think that\u2019s still the case. There\u2019s still really good players, really good starting pitchers, left on the free agent market, and there are still conversations we\u2019re having with teams as trade targets.\u201d",
      "Before the trade, Boston\u2019s projected rotation had five starters: Tanner Houck, Kutter Crawford, Brayan Bello, Garrett Whitlock and Lucas Giolito.",
      "Among the free agents still on the market is four-time All-Star Corbin Burnes. The right-hander went 15-9 with a 2.92 ERA in 32 starts for the Orioles this year, his only season in Baltimore.",
      "As for Crochet, he had an $800,000 salary this year. He is eligible for arbitration this offseason and next, and he can become a free agent after the 2027 World Series.",
      "Selected 11th overall by Chicago in the 2020 amateur draft, Crochet made his big league debut that September. He had a 2.82 ERA in 2021 while striking out 65 in 54 1/3 innings, then had Tommy John surgery on April 5, 2022. He didn't return to the major leagues until May 18, 2023.",
      "Crochet's sinker averaged 97.9 mph this season and his four-seam fastball 97.2. He also throws a cutter, sweeper and changeup.",
      "Teel is rated Boston's No. 4 prospect by MLB.com, Meidroth No. 11, Gonzalez 14th and Montgomery 54th.",
      "\u201cTalk about accelerating a rebuild,\u201d Getz said. \u201cThis was a deal that we feel like can do that.\"",
      "This was similar to a deal struck between the two clubs during the 2016 winter meetings, when the White Sox traded then 27-year-old Chris Sale to the Red Sox for a hefty package of four prospects.",
      "Atlanta acquired Sale in a trade last December after he made only 31 starts for the Red Sox from 2021-23. He missed the 2020 season and most of 2021 after Tommy John surgery. He made only two starts in 2022 after he fractured a rib and then broke his left pinkie. He broke his right wrist riding a bicycle in August 2023, ending his final season with Boston.",
      "Sale was the National League Cy Young Award winner this season when he went 18-3, topped the NL with 225 strikeouts and had a 2.38 ERA over 29 starts that was the best among all major league qualifiers. The eight-time All-Star was also selected NL Comeback Player of the Year.",
      "Boston rospects in that deal included current Los Angeles Dodgers reliever Michael Kopech and along with infielder Yo\u00e1n Moncada, now a free agent after eight seasons with the White Sox.",

      "Jimmy Butler knows there are tons of questions about his future with the Miami Heat. He might get traded, he might leave as a free agent next summer, he might exercise a $52.4 million option to return to the Heat or he might get a new contract.",
      "\u201cWho knows?\u201d Butler asked.",
      "Evidently, even he doesn't have answers.",
      "The Heat forward \u2014 who has led the team to a pair of NBA Finals trips in his Miami tenure \u2014 spoke out about trade speculation Wednesday, telling reporters after practice that he doesn't mind his name being in the rumor mill. ESPN reported earlier in the week that the Heat are open to receiving trade offers; that wouldn't be surprising, given Butler's contract status and the possibility that he might leave with the Heat getting nothing in return next summer.",
      "\u201cI actually like it,\u201d said Butler, who is averaging 19 points per game this season. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be talked about. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s such a thing as bad publicity \u2014 to a point.\u201d",
      "Butler's future in Miami has been a talking point for some time now.",
      "The Heat could have offered an extension last summer and chose not to, presumably for a variety of reasons including Butler's age \u2014 he's 35 \u2014 and the fact that he missed 26% of Miami's games over his first five seasons with the team.",
      "He still clearly impacts winning: Miami is 8-2 this season when he scores at least 18 points. And the Heat aren't new to trade speculation; Tyler Herro has been the centerpiece of rumors in each of the last three summers. He is still in Miami, playing at an All-Star level and is the reigning Eastern Conference player of the week.",
      "\u201cAny other narrative, I don't care. Nobody should because most of this stuff has just been all a bunch of gibberish,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said this week.",
      "Butler said Wednesday that money doesn't really matter to him at this point. He stopped short of saying that he wants to absolutely remain in Miami \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure y\u2019all are going to get a report that\u2019s going to say otherwise anyways, so there\u2019s no sense in me answering that question,\u201d he said \u2014 and that he's not fixated on extensions or trades.",
      "\u201cMy kids matter, my happiness matters, my well-being matters and my family matters,\u201d Butler said. \"Right now, it\u2019s all about competing, staying healthy, playing some great basketball. I think I\u2019ve done that so far, so we\u2019ll see what we got.\u201d",
      "It has been social media fodder for a few days, with some even suggesting that Butler's hair dye in recent weeks \u2014 sometimes yellow, sometimes blue, sometimes red \u2014 has matched the teams some of the trade speculation links him to like Golden State, Dallas and Houston.",
      "That said, he has insisted since arriving in Miami that he wants to bring the team another championship. That stance has not changed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to win and I\u2019m proud of the guys,\u201d Butler said. \u201cYou see everybody out here working and we know what we\u2019re capable of.\u201d",

      "Rory McIlroy says golf fans might realize what they're missing when PGA Tour and LIV Golf stars clash next week in Las Vegas",
      "Two of the best players each from LIV Golf versus the PGA Tour in a televised match might remind golf fans what they're missing outside of the four majors. Rory McIlroy believes it shows they're at least trying to repair a divided sport.",

      "\u201cDoes it remind people we're not playing together all the time? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at least we're making the effort to try to bring the best together more often. If we can start by doing something like this, that's only a good thing.\u201d",
      "He said he was approached in January in Dubai by producer Bryan Zuriff, about the time McIlroy began to soften his stance on PGA Tour players defecting to the Saudi-funded breakaway league and getting suspended by the PGA Tour.",

But with the holiday falling on Wednesday, when the NFL has rarely played, those four also will have to play the prior Saturday to give them at least some rest. And the result is two short weeks following their games on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt's not a good feeling,\u201d Mahomes acknowledged Wednesday. \u201cYou never want to play this amount of games in this short of time. It's not great for your body. But at the end of the day it's your job, your profession, you have to come to work and do it.\"",

      "\u201cAll you can do is focus on the game. The practice you have that day,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cI try to prepare my body all year long for this stretch. That's tailoring my workouts, tailoring how you practice and prepare, and the coaches do a great job of taking care of us on the practice field. We practice as hard as anybody, but they know how to dial it back when needed.\u201d",
      "The NFL has played on Wednesday in the past, the previous time in 2020, when the Steelers and Ravens had their game pushed back because of a COVID-19 outbreak.",

      "It's not as if the games involved in the Christmas stretch are throwaways, either. Each has significant playoff ramifications.",
      "The Chiefs have already clinched the AFC West, but they are trying to fend off Buffalo and Pittsburgh for the No. 1 seed and first-round playoff bye. The Steelers are two games ahead of the Ravens in the AFC North heading into this weekend, and could clinch a playoff berth if things fall their way, while the Texans are two games up on the Colts in the AFC South.",
      "So, how are the Chiefs approaching such an important stretch of high-profile games?",
      "\u201cThe main thing is you get guys ready for the game. Give them a chance to get ready for the game,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThey're going to do whatever you present to them. You try to help them out with that. Right now we have a normal week right here. We have to take care of business here.\u201d",
      "NOTES: LT D.J. Humphries (hamstring) did not practice Wednesday, though he has not been ruled out for Cleveland. \u201cEvery day he's gotten a little better,\u201d Reid said. ... WR Hollywood Brown (shoulder) could begin practicing soon, Reid said, while declining to put a timetable on it. \u201cHe's chomping at the bit to get out there. But he's got to visit the with doctors and make sure he gets clearance there,\u201d Reid said. ... CB Steven Nelson came out of retirement to join the Kansas City practice squad this week. He will not play this weekend but could be ready soon. ... K Harrison Butker (knee) will try kicking this week, though Reid was noncommittal on whether he would come off injured reserve. If he's not ready, Matthew Wright would kick against the Browns.",

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration has announced it is raising tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect U.S. clean energy businesses",
      "BANGKOK -- The Biden administration plans to raise tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect U.S. clean energy businesses.",
      "The notice from the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office said tariffs on Chinese-made solar wafers and polysilicon will rise to 50% from 25% and duties on certain tungsten products will increase from zero to 25%, effective on Jan. 1, following a review of Chinese trade practices under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act.",
      "The decision followed a public comment period after the USTR said in September that it was considering such actions.",
      "\u201cThe tariff increases announced today will further blunt the harmful policies and practices by the People\u2019s Republic of China,\" USTR Katharine Tai said in a statement. \"These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains.\u201d",
      "Reports Thursday said U.S. and Chinese officials were meeting this week and next for trade talks ahead of the year's end.",
      "Last week, Washington tightened restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology. Beijing responded by banning exports to the U.S. of certain critical minerals needed to make computer chips, such as gallium, germanium and antimony. It also stepped up its controls on graphite exports to the U.S.",
      "China provides a very large share of most of those materials and the United States has been working to secure alternative sources in Africa and other parts of the world.",
      "Tungsten is another strategically vital metal whose production is dominated by China. The U.S. does not produce it, but South Korea is a potential big supplier. It's used to make armaments and is also used in x-ray tubes and light bulb filaments, among other industrial applications. U.S. imports of the metal from China fell to $10.9 million in 2023 from $19.5 million the year before.",
      "After Beijing announced its ban on exporting gallium and the other materials to the United States, analysts said tungsten was another likely area where China might strike back.",
      "Trade frictions have been escalating ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods, among other threats. President Joe Biden has said Trump\u2019s promise of broad tariffs on foreign imports would be a mistake.",
      "His administration has kept in place tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term in office, but says it has a more targeted approach.",
      "China has sharply ramped up production of cheap electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries at a time when the Biden administration has championed moves to support those industries in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. and other trading partners say China improperly subsidizes exports, giving exporters of solar panels and other products an unfair advantage in overseas markets, where its manufacturers charge lower prices thanks to government support. Washington also says China improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.",
      "China accounts for more than 80% of the market for solar panels at all stages of production, according to the International Energy Agency, more than double domestic demand for those products. Its huge economies of scale have made solar power more affordable, but also concentrated the supply chain inside China. The IEA has urged other countries to assess their solar panel supply chains and develop strategies to address any risks.",
      "In early 2018, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. Beijing filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization charging that the U.S. was unfairly supporting electric vehicle purchases.",
      "The investigation that led the USTR to raise the tariffs on solar panels concluded with a report in May that has prompted increases in tariffs on a range of products including electric vehicles, syringes and needles, medical gloves and facemasks, semiconductors and steel and aluminum products, among others.",
      "It has pushed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles up to 100% from 25%, raised tariffs on Chinese-made lithium batteries to 25% from 7.5%."

      "Cyber officials are advising people to use encryption in their communications after a sprawling hacking campaign",
      "LONDON -- After a sprawling hacking campaign exposed the communications of an unknown number of Americans, U.S. cybersecurity officials are advising people to use encryption in their communications.",
      "To safeguard against the risks highlighted by the campaign, which originated in China, federal cybersecurity authorities released an extensive list of security recommendations for U.S. telecom companies \u2014 such as Verizon and AT&T \u2014 that were targeted. The advice includes one tip we can all put into practice with our phones: \u201cEnsure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible.\u201d",
      "End-to-end encryption, also known as E2EE, means that messages are scrambled so that only the sender and recipient can see them. If anyone else intercepts the message, all they will see is a garble that can't be unscrambled without the key.",
      "Law enforcement officials had until now resisted this type of encryption because it means the technology companies themselves won't be able to look at the messages, nor respond to law enforcement requests to turn the data over.",
      "Here's a look at various ways ordinary consumers can use end-to-end encryption:",
      "Officials said the hackers targeted the metadata of a large number of customers, including information on the dates, times and recipients of calls and texts. They also managed to see the content from texts from a much smaller number of victims.",
      "If you're an iPhone user, information in text messages that you send to someone else who also has an iPhone will be encrypted end-to-end. Just look for the blue text bubbles, which indicate that they are encrypted iMessages.",
      "The same goes for Android users sending texts through Google Messages. There will be a lock next to the timestamp on each message to indicate the encryption is on.",
      "But there's a weakness. When iPhone and Android users text each other, the messages are encrypted only using Rich Communication Services, an industry standard for instant messaging that replaces the older SMS and MMS standards.",
      "Apple has noted that RCS messages \u201caren\u2019t end-to-end encrypted, which means they\u2019re not protected from a third party reading them while they\u2019re sent between devices.\u201d",
      "Samsung, which sells Android smartphones, has also hinted at the issue in a footnote at the bottom of a press release last month on RCS, saying, \u201cEncryption only available for Android to Android communication.\u201d",
      "To avoid getting caught out when trading texts, experts recommend using encrypted messaging apps.",
      "Privacy advocates are big fans of Signal, which applies end-to-end encryption on all messages and voice calls. The independent nonprofit group behind the app promises never to sell, rent, or lease customer data and has made its source code publicly available so that it can be audited by anyone to examine it \u201cfor security and correctness.\u201d",
      "Signal's encryption protocol is so reputable that it has been integrated into rival WhatsApp, so users will enjoy the same level of security protection as Signal, which has a much smaller user base. End-to-end encryption is also the default mode for Facebook Messenger, which like WhatsApp is owned by Meta Platforms.",
      "Telegram is an app that can be used for one-on-one conversations, group chats and broadcast \u201cchannels\" but contrary to popular perception, it doesn't turn on end-to-end encryption by default. Users have to switch on the option. And it doesn\u2019t work with group chats.",
      "Cybersecurity experts have warned people against using Telegram for private communications and pointed out that only its opt-in \u2018secret chat\u2019 feature is encrypted from end-to-end. The app also has a reputation for being a haven for scammers and criminal activity, highlighted by founder and CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in France.",
      "Instead of using your phone to make calls through a wireless cellular network, you can make voice calls with Signal and WhatsApp. Both apps encrypt calls with the same technology that they use to encrypt messages.",
      "There are other options. If you have an iPhone you can use Facetime for calls, while Android owners can use the Google Fi service, which are both end-to-end encrypted.",
      "The only catch with all these options is that, as with using the chat services to send messages, the person on the other end will also have to have the app installed.",
      "WhatsApp and Signal users can customize their privacy preferences in the settings, including hiding IP address during calls to prevent your general location from being guessed.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple is pumping more artificial intelligence into the latest iPhones during the holiday shopping season with a free software update that includes a feature that enables users to create customized emojis within a matter of seconds.",
      "The Wednesday release of the iPhone's upgraded operating system, iOS 18.2, extends Apple's expansion into AI months after rivals such as Samsung and Google began implanting the revolutionary technology on their devices. The update builds upon another one that came out in late October to usher in the AI era for Apple and the iPhone, as well as for the iPad and Mac.",
      "The latest round of AI tricks includes \u201cGenmojis,\u201d Apple's description for emojis that iPhone users will be able to ask the technology to create and then share. Apple says it is placing some limits its AI's emoji artistry to prevent the distribution of violent or hateful imagery. Other features include an \u201cImage Playground\u201d for a variety of AI-styled illustrations, writing tools and options for summarizing emails.",
      "The technology won\u2019t work on iPhones that Apple made before 2023 because it requires a special processor that isn\u2019t in older models. The AI will work on the iPhone 16 line-up that came out in September and the premium iPhone 15 models released last year.",
      "That exclusivity is expected to propel a cycle of iPhone upgrades during the current holiday shopping season into next year, driving up Apple's profit even higher from the $94 billion that the Cupertino, California, company pocketed in its last fiscal year ending in September. That expectation is the main reason Apple's stock price has climbed by about 30% so far this year to push the company's market value closer to the $4 trillion threshold for the first time.",
      "Apple is broadening the AI suite's appeal by including English versions tailored for Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. that are included in the latest software update.",
      "Although the iPhone's AI is similar to many of the features that have already been available from other companies, Apple is taking a slightly different approach to the technology in an effort to stand out from the rest of pack. It is emphasizing its ongoing commitment to protecting iPhone users' privacy by processing most of its AI on the device itself or corralling it in a secured data center. Users seeking more AI wizardry than the device or the special data center can handle will have the option to reach out to the popular ChatGPT technology made by OpenAI, which has forged a partnership with Apple."

      "Google has unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google on Wednesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence designed to tackle more of the work and thinking done by humans as it tries to stay on the technology's cutting edge while also trying to fend off regulatory threats to its empire.",
      "The next generation of Google's AI is being packaged under the Gemini umbrella, which was unveiled a year ago. Google is framing its release of Gemini 2.0 as a springboard for AI agents built to interpret images shown through a smartphone, perform a variety of tedious chores, remember the conversations consumers have with people, help video game players plot strategy and even tackle the task of doing online searches.",
      "In a blog post, Google CEO Sundar Pichai predicted the technology contained in Gemini 2.0 will \u201cunderstand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead and take action on your behalf, with your supervision.\u201d It's a similar goal being pursued by hard-charging rivals such as OpenAI, with its chatGPT technology, and industry powerhouse such as Microsoft with a variety of similar tools on its Windows software.",
      "A lot of Google's latest AI technology will initially be confined to test groups and subscribers who pay $20 per month for Gemini Advanced, but some features will be made available through its search engine and mobile apps. Google is planning wider releases next year that will include the technology popping up in its smorgasbord of free products, including its Chrome browser, digital maps and YouTube.",
      "Besides trying to outshine OpenAI and other ambitious startups, Google is also trying to stay a step ahead of Apple as that trendsetting company begins to blend AI into its latest iPhones and other devices. After releasing a software update enabling the first bundle of the iPhone's \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d features that spruced up the device's Siri assistant, another batch of the AI technology came out with a free software update that was also released Wednesday.",
      "Google is pushing forward with its latest AI advances even as the U.S. Justice Department is trying to break up the Mountain View, California, company to prevent further abusive practices by its dominant search engine, which was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal judge earlier this year as part of a landmark antitrust case.",
      "Among other things, Gemini 2.0 is supposed to improve the AI overviews that Google began highlighting in its search results over its traditional listing of the most pertinent links to websites earlier this year in response to AI-powered \u201canswer engines\u201d such as Perplexity.",
      "After the AI overviews initially produced some goofy suggestions, including putting glue on pizza, Google refined the technology to minimize such missteps. Now, company executives are promising things are going to get even better with Gemini 2.0, which Pichai said will be able to engage in more human-like reasoning while solving more advanced math problems and even churn out some computer code. The improvements to AI Overviews will initially only appear to a test audience before a wider release next year.",
      "The technological upgrade is also supposed to infuse a still-experimental universal AI agent dubbed \u201cProject Astra,\u201d with even more smarts and versatility, enabling people to have more meaningful and helpful conversations with the technology. In a show of confidence, Google said it will expand the number of people testing Project Astra without providing any specifics of the group's size.",
      "As part of Gemini 2.0, Google is also going to begin testing an extension to Chrome called \u201cProject Mariner,\u201d which can be turned on to do online searches and sift through the results so people don't won't have to bother.",
      "If the U.S. Department of Justice gets its way, Google will be forced to sell or spin off Chrome as part of its punishment for deploying its search engine in ways that stifled competition and potential innovation. Google has ridiculed the Justice Department's proposal as \u201coverly broad\u201d and vowed to resist any attempt to break up the company during federal court hearings scheduled to begin in Washington D.C. next spring.",
      "Even if those proceedings culminate in a court order mandating a breakup, Google could still appeal in a process that could take years to resolve while it continues its AI expansion.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what this next era brings,\u201d Pichai wrote in his blog post, signaling the company doesn't believe it will be deterred by regulators."

      "The shower often produces meteors with a distinctly more yellow glow, likely due to the unusual origin material, said Sally Brummel, planetarium manager at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Bell Museum.",
      "Under ideal viewing conditions, the Geminids typically put on one of the best and brightest shows of the year because of the high volume of meteors visible each hour. However, an almost full moon this year means up to 15 meteors per hour are expected at peak time, according to the American Meteor Society.",

      "Viewing lasts until Dec. 21. Here\u2019s what to know about the Geminids and other meteor showers.",
      "Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you don\u2019t need special equipment to see them.",
      "Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets, but a few \u2014 including the Geminids \u2014 result from the debris of asteroids. The Geminids come from the sun-orbiting asteroid 3200 Phaethon.",
      "When rocks from space enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the resistance from the air makes them very hot. This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d",
      "The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky.",

      "Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours.",
      "It\u2019s easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest.",

      "Lawyers in the Alex Jones bankruptcy case are now in discussions on what could happen next after a federal judge in Texas rejected the auction sale of Jones\u2019 Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet",
      "The Onion's rejected purchase of Infowars in an auction bid supported by families of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting dealt them a new setback Wednesday and clouded the future of Alex Jones' conspiracy theory platform, which will remain in his control for at least the near future.",
      "What's next for Infowars and the Sandy Hook families' long-sought efforts to hold Jones accountable over calling one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history a hoax was unclear, after a federal judge in Houston late Tuesday rejected The Onion's winning bid for the site. The only other bidder was a company aligned with Jones.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston said he did not want another auction but offered no roadmap over how to proceed. One possibility includes ultimately allowing Sandy Hook families \u2014 who comprise most of Jones' creditors \u2014 to return to state courts in Connecticut and Texas to collect on the nearly $1.5 billion in defamation and emotional distress lawsuit judgments that Jones was ordered to pay them.",
      "\u201cOur hope is that when this process ends, and it will end, and it will end sooner rather than later, is that all assets that Alex Jones has available are paid to the families, and that includes Infowars, and that as a result of that process Alex Jones is deprived of the ownership and control of the platform that he\u2019s used to hurt so many people,\u201d Christopher Mattei, an attorney for the Sandy Hook families, said Wednesday.",
      "The families, meanwhile, were preparing to mark the 12th anniversary of the Dec. 14 shooting.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay the $1.5 billion. Jones was sued for repeatedly saying on his show that the 2012 massacre of 20 first graders and six educators was staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "He has since conceded that the shooting did happen.",
      "Lopez said there was a lack of transparency in the bidding process and too much confusion about The Onion's bid, and he expressed concern that the amount of money offered was too low.",
      "The Onion's parent company, Global Tetrahedron, submitted a $1.75 million cash offer with plans to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody. The bid also included a deal with many of the Sandy Hook families for them to forgo $750,000 of their auction proceeds and give it to other creditors.",
      "The other bidder was First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements and planned to let Jones stay on the Infowars platforms. It offered $3.5 million in cash and later, with Jones, alleged fraud and collusion in the bidding process. Lopez rejected those allegations.",
      "Christopher Murray, the trustee who oversaw the auction, said he picked The Onion and its deal with the Sandy Hook families because it would have provided more money to Jones' other creditors.",
      "Lopez directed Murray to come up with a new plan to move forward. Murray and representatives of The Onion did not immediately return messages seeking comment.",
      "The judge said there was a possibility there could be a trial in 2025 to settle Jones' bankruptcy and that Murray could try to sell the equity in Infowars' parent company.",
      "The judge said he wanted to hear back from Murray and others involved in the bankruptcy within 30 days on a plan.",
      "On the social media platform X, Jones called the judge's ruling a \u201cMajor Victory For Freedom Of The Press & Due Process.\"",
      "Jeff Anapolsky, an adjunct professor at the University of Houston Law Center and the managing director and founder of Anapolsky Advisors, a financial consulting firm, said he was not surprised Lopez rejected the sale. He was not involved in the case but said he has appeared before Lopez and described him as a fair judge.",
      "Anapolsky believes the sale of the Infowars assets will ultimately take place and be approved.",
      "\u201cSo that\u2019s up to Mr. Murray now, the trustee, to go do something to make everybody feel like everybody had their say and understand the transparency of the process,\u201d Anapolsky said.",
      "The decision came during a solemn week for relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. The 12th anniversary is Saturday, and some of the victims' relatives were traveling to Washington, D.C., to attend an annual vigil for victims of gun violence. The families usually mark the anniversary out of the public eye.",
      "Many of the families have said their lawsuits against Jones bought back the unbearable pain of losing their loved ones, as well as the trauma of being harassed and threatened by believers of Jones' hoax conspiracy. Relatives said they have been confronted in public by hoax believers and received death and rape threats.",
      "The families have not received any money from Jones since winning the trials.",

      "Regional supermarket chain Stop & Shop is installing kiosks in all of its stores in the Northeast U.S. to make digital-only coupons more accessible",
      "Regional supermarket chain Stop & Shop said Wednesday that it would install kiosks in all of its U.S. stores to make digital-only coupons more accessible to customers.",
      "Stop & Shop, which operates in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island, said the kiosks will let customers scan a loyalty card or enter a phone number and quickly get access to any digital coupons or personalized offers.",
      "The kiosks, known as Savings Stations, are expected to be installed in all 365 Stop & Shop locations by early January, the company said.",
      "Digital-only deals are advertised online or on store shelves. They can offer significant savings but generally require customers to electronically clip a coupon located in a grocer\u2019s app or on its website.",
      "In 2022, a coalition of consumer groups sent letters to a dozen supermarket chains, including Kroger and Stop & Shop, urging them to make sure deals are available in both digital and non-digital formats.",
      "The groups, which included Consumer Reports, Consumer Action, the Public Interest Research Group and the National Consumers League, said many shoppers may lack smartphones, internet access or the technical savvy to figure out how digital-only coupons work.",
      "Smartphone access varies widely by age group in the U.S., according to a 2021 study by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. The study found that 96% of people ages 18 to 29 own a smartphone, compared to 61% of those 65 and older. The same study found that 25% of people 65 or older don\u2019t use the internet.",
      "Consumer World founder Edgar Dworsky said Wednesday that Stop & Shop was the first chain to respond to the group\u2019s request. Dworsky said the kiosks would help customers who have been shut out of deals previously. But he also thinks they will help regular app users, since they give shoppers access to all of a store\u2019s deals at once.",
      "Stop & Shop said it started piloting the Savings Station late last year. The kiosk give shoppers a printout of the digital coupons loaded onto their loyalty cards if they want to reference them while shopping.",
      "Stop & Shop President Roger Wheeler said the chain was hearing from customers who felt they were missing out on deals.",
      "\u201cIt ensures that our customers can easily access all of our great deals, especially during the holiday season when savings are top of mind,\u201d Wheeler said in a statement."

      "General Motors says it will retreat from the robotaxi business and stop funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle unit",
      "DETROIT -- General Motors said Tuesday it will retreat from the robotaxi business and stop funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle unit.",
      "Instead the Detroit automaker will focus on development of partially automated driver-assist systems for personal vehicles like its Super Cruise, which allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel.",
      "GM said it would get out of robotaxis \u201cgiven the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.\u201d",
      "The company said it will combine Cruise's technical team with its own to work on advanced systems to assist drivers.",
      "GM bought control of San Francisco-based Cruise automation in 2016 with high hopes of developing a profitable fleet of robotaxis.",
      "Over the years GM invested billions in the subsidiary and eventually bought 90% of the company from investors, all while racking up millions in losses.",
      "GM\u2019s brushoff of Cruise represents a dramatic about-face from years of full-blown support that left a huge financial dent in the automaker. The company invested $2.4 billion in Cruise only to sustain years of uninterrupted losses, with little in return. Since GM bought a controlling stake in Cruise for $581 million in 2016, the robotaxi service piled up more than $10 billion in operating losses while bringing in less than $500 million in revenue, according to GM shareholder reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The automaker even announced plans for Cruise to generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but it scaled back spending on the company after one of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts dragged a San Francisco pedestrian who was hit by another vehicle in 2023.",
      "The California Public Utilities Commission alleged Cruise then covered up details of the crash for more than two weeks.",
      "The embarrassing incident resulted in Cruise\u2019s license to operate its driverless fleet in California being suspended by regulators and triggered a purge of its leadership \u2014 in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "GM CEO Mary Barra told analysts on a conference call Tuesday the the new unit will focus on personal vehicles and developing systems that can drive by themselves in certain circumstances.",
      "The company has agreements to buy another 7% of Cruise and intends to buy the remaining shares so it owns the whole company.",
      "The move is another step back from autonomous vehicles, which have proved far harder to develop than companies once anticipated. Two years ago, crosstown rival Ford Motor Co. disbanded its Argo AI autonomous vehicle venture in Pittsburgh that it co-owned with Volkswagen.",
      "At the time the company said it didn\u2019t see a path to profitability for a number of years.",
      "Yet other companies are pressing forward with plans to deploy autonomous vehicles and expanding their services.",
      "Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo is accelerating plans to broaden its robotaxi service beyond areas of metropolitan Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Last week the company said it would begin testing its driverless Jaguars in Miami next year, with plans to start charging for rides in 2026.",
      "The move comes less than a month after Waymo opened up its robotaxi service to anyone looking for a ride in an 80-square-mile (129 square kilometer) area of Los Angeles. Waymo also has plans to launch fleets in Atlanta and Austin next year in partership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "In April, a company called Aurora Innovation plans to start hauling freight on Texas freeways using fully driverless semis.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said his company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels using Tesla's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.",
      "But an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into Full Self-Driving's ability to see in low visibility conditions cast doubt on whether Teslas are ready to be deployed without humans behind the wheel.",
      "The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.",
      "GM said it will work with Cruise\u2019s leadership to restructure the company and refocus Cruise\u2019s operations on driver assist systems. The company expects the restructuring to reduce spending by more than $1 billion annually.",
      "Cruise has about 2,300 employees and will retain a presence in San Francisco, GM said. It\u2019s too early to talk about employment levels until the restructuring is completed next year, a spokesman said.",
      "Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, said Cruise will bring its software, artificial intelligence and sensor development to GM to team up on improving GM\u2019s driver-assist systems.",
      "\u201cWe want to leverage what already has been done as we go forward, and we think we can do that very effectively,\u201d Barra said.",

      "Back in 2022, Epic agreed to pay a total of $520 million to settle complaints revolving around children\u2019s privacy and payment methods on its popular Fortnite game. The FTC alleged the video game giant used deceptive online design tactics to trick Fortnite players, including children, into making unintended purchases \u201cbased on the press of a single button.\"",
      "Consumers could be charged while doing something as simple as attempting the wake the game from sleep mode, for example, or by pressing a nearby button when trying to preview an item, the agency said. The FTC also accused Epic of blocking some users who disputed the charges from accessing the content they purchased.",
      "Beyond a $275 million fine related to collecting personal information on players under the age of 13, the settlement included $245 million in customer refunds. Now, the first batch of those refunds are being sent out.",
      "On Monday, the FTC announced it was sending over 629,00 payments to eligible customers who submitted claims. About half of those refunds are PayPal payments, which should be redeemed within 30 days, and the rest are checks, which should be cashed within 90 days.",
      "The average refund is about $114, the FTC noted. This first round of payments amounts to a total of more than $72 million, according to the agency \u2014 leaving about $173 million left to be distributed.",
      "Impacted consumers can still apply for a refund online. People who are eligible for these payouts include Fortnite players who were charged in-game currency for items they didn\u2019t want or saw their account locked after complaining to a credit card company about wrongful charges between January 2017 and September 2022 \u2014 as well as parents whose child made charges on their credit cards without their knowledge from January 2018 through November 2018.",
      "You can learn more about applying for a refund on the FTC's website. The deadline for submitting a claim is January 10, 2025.",
      "At the time the settlement was announced in December 2022, Epic said it accepted the agreement because it wanted \"to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players.\u201d The Cary, North Carolina-based added that it was already rolling out changes \u201cto ensure our ecosystem meets the expectations of our players and regulators, which we hope will be a helpful guide for others in our industry.\u201d"

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Bolstering Cyprus ' defense capacity is critical for the east Mediterranean island nation so close to the war-wrecked Middle East, the country's defense minister said Tuesday.",
      "The priority for Cyprus is to procure better defense systems, said Defense Minister Vasilis Palmas. The minister, who spoke to The Associated Press in the nation's capital of Nicosia, outlined some defense plans though he would not go into specifics about arms procurement programs.",
      "\u201cThe situation in the eastern Mediterranean, with its continuous shifting geostrategic balances and competing interests makes it even more pressing for the island to bolster its defensive capabilities,\u201d Palmas said.",

      "Cyprus in recent years pivoted away from Russian weapons systems as part of a broader, pro-Western strategy to bring the small nation's armed forces up to EU and NATO standards.

      "The Onion had been named the winning bidder on Nov. 14 over a company affiliated with Jones, whose conspiracy theory platform was put up for sale as part of his bankruptcy case stemming from the nearly $1.5 billion that courts have ordered him to pay over falsely calling one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history a hoax.",
      "The decision by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez of Houston to not approve the sale means Jones can stay at his Infowars headquarters in Austin, Texas. The Onion had planned to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody.",

      "The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash and other incentives for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction. First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements, bid $3.5 million.",
      "The bids were a fraction of the money that Jones has been ordered to pay in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting. Lopez said the auction outcome \u201cleft a lot of money on the table\u201d for families.",
      "\u201cYou got to scratch and claw and get everything you can for them,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families who sued Jones in Connecticut, said they were disappointed in the judge's ruling.",
      "\u201cThese families, who have already persevered through countless delays and roadblocks, remain resilient and determined as ever to hold Alex Jones and his corrupt businesses accountable for the harm he has caused,\u201d Mattei said in a statement. \u201cThis decision doesn\u2019t change the fact that, soon, Alex Jones will begin to pay his debt to these families and he will continue doing so for as long as it takes.\u201d",
      "Jones, who did not attend the proceedings, quickly went back on the air to applaud the judge's decision.",
      "\u201cWe can celebrate the judge doing the right thing with the most ridiculous, fraudulent auction known in human history,\u201d he said.",
      "Although The Onion\u2019s cash offer was lower than that of First United American, it also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo $750,000 of the auction proceeds due to them and give it to other creditors, providing the other creditors more money than they would receive under First United American\u2019s bid.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting.",
      "Jones repeatedly called the shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified in court that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats from his followers.",
      "Jones has since acknowledged that the Connecticut school shooting happened.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "Trustee Christopher Murray had defended The Onion\u2019s bid during a lengthy two-day hearing in Houston, testifying that he did not favor either bidder over the other and was not biased.",
      "He also revealed that First United American submitted a revised bid in recent days, but he said he could not accept it because the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuit objected.",
      "The Onion valued its bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "In a court filing last month, Murray's lawyers called First United American's request to disqualify The Onion's bid a \u201cdisappointed bidder's improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open election process.\u201d",
      "Jones' attorney, Ben Broocks, noted that the Sandy Hook lawsuit judgments could be overturned in pending appeals and got Murray to acknowledge that the Sandy Hook families' offer in The Onion bid could fall apart if that happens. That's because the percentage of the auction proceeds they would be entitled to could drop sharply and they wouldn't get the $750,000 from the sale to give to other creditors.",

Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations. Many of Jones' personal assets also are being sold.",

      "More than 6,000 have moved to evacuation centers aside from those who have temporarily transferred to the homes of relatives in La Castellana by Tuesday morning, the town\u2019s mayor, Rhumyla Mangilimutan, told The Associated Press by telephone.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said authorities were ready to provide support to large numbers of displaced villagers and that his social welfare secretary flew early Tuesday to the affected region.",
      "\"We are ready to support the families who have been evacuated outside the 6-kilometer danger zone,\u201d Marcos told reporters.",
      "Government scientists were monitoring the air quality due to the risk of contamination from toxic volcanic gases that may require more people to be evacuated from areas affected by Monday\u2019s eruption.",
      "Disaster-response contingents were rapidly establishing evacuation centers and seeking supplies of face masks, food and hygiene packs ahead of the Christmas season, traditionally a peak time for holiday travel and family celebrations in the largely Roman Catholic nation.",
      "Authorities also shut schools and imposed a nighttime curfew in the most vulnerable areas.",
      "The Philippines\u2019 Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the nearly four-minute eruption of Kanlaon volcano on Monday afternoon had caused a pyroclastic density current \u2014 a superhot stream of gas, ash, debris and rocks that can incinerate anything in its path.",
      "\u201cIt's a one-time but major eruption,\u201d Bacolcol told the AP, adding that volcanologists were assessing if Monday's eruption spewed old volcanic debris and rocks clogged in and near the summit crater or was caused by rising magma from underneath.",
      "Few volcanic earthquakes were detected ahead of Monday's explosion, Bacolcol said.",
      "The alert level around Kanlaon was placed on Monday to the third-highest of a five-step warning system, indicating \u201cmagmatic eruption\" may have begun and may progress to further explosive eruptions.",
      "The 2,435-meter (7,988-foot) volcano, one of the country\u2019s 24 most-active volcanoes, last erupted in June sending hundreds of villagers to emergency shelters.",
      "In 1996, three hikers were killed near the peak and several others were later rescued when Kanlaon erupted without warning, officials said.",
      "Located in the so-called Pacific \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, the Philippines is also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms a year and is among the countries most prone to natural disasters."

    "summary": "California lawmakers will consider a bill to require labels on social media platforms warning of their effects on young people&rsquo;s lives",
    "story": [
      "California lawmakers will consider a bill to require labels on social media platforms warning of their effects on young people\u2019s lives",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California, home to some of the largest technology companies in the world, would be the first U.S. state to require mental health warning labels on social media sites if lawmakers pass a bill introduced Monday.",
      "The legislation sponsored by state Attorney General Rob Bonta is necessary to bolster safety for children online, supporters say, but industry officials vow to fight the measure and others like it under the First Amendment. Warning labels for social media gained swift bipartisan support from dozens of attorneys general, including Bonta, after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to establish the requirements earlier this year, saying social media is a contributing factor in the mental health crisis among young people.",
      "\u201cThese companies know the harmful impact their products can have on our children, and they refuse to take meaningful steps to make them safer,\u201d Bonta said at a news conference Monday. \u201cTime is up. It\u2019s time we stepped in and demanded change.\u201d",
      "State officials haven't provided details on the bill, but Bonta said the warning labels could pop up once weekly.",
      "Up to 95% of youth ages 13 to 17 say they use a social media platform, and more than a third say that they use social media \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to 2022 data from the Pew Research Center. Parents\u2019 concerns prompted Australia to pass the world\u2019s first law banning social media for children under 16 in November.",
      "\u201cThe promise of social media, although real, has turned into a situation where they\u2019re turning our children\u2019s attention into a commodity,\u201d Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who authored the California bill, said Monday. \u201cThe attention economy is using our children and their well-being to make money for these California companies.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers instead should focus on online safety education and mental health resources, not warning label bills that are \u201cconstitutionally unsound,\u201d said Todd O\u2019Boyle, a vice president of the tech industry policy group Chamber of Progress.",
      "\u201cWe strongly suspect that the courts will set them aside as compelled speech,\u201d O\u2019Boyle told The Associated Press.",
      "Victoria Hinks' 16-year-old daughter, Alexandra, died by suicide four months ago after being \u201cled down dark rabbit holes\u201d on social media that glamorized eating disorders and self-harm. Hinks said the labels would help protect children from companies that turn a blind eye to the harm caused to children\u2019s mental health when they become addicted to social media platforms.",
      "\u201cThere's not a bone in my body that doubts social media played a role in leading her to that final, irreversible decision,\u201d Hinks said. \u201cThis could be your story.\"",
      "Common Sense Media, a sponsor of the bill, said it plans to lobby for similar proposals in other states.",
      "California in the past decade has positioned itself as a leader in regulating and fighting the tech industry to bolster online safety for children.",
      "The state was the first in 2022 to bar online platforms from using users\u2019 personal information in ways that could harm children. It was one of the states that sued Meta in 2023 and TikTok in October for deliberately designing addictive features that keep kids hooked on their platforms.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, also signed several bills in September to help curb the effects of social media on children, including one to prohibit social media platforms from knowingly providing addictive feeds to children without parental consent and one to limit or ban students from using smartphones on school campus.",
      "Federal lawmakers have held hearings on child online safety and legislation is in the works to force companies to take reasonable steps to prevent harm. The legislation has the support of X owner Elon Musk and the President-elect\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding."

      "Attorneys for Meta shareholders are asking a Delaware judge to sanction former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and fellow Facebook board member and current White House chief of staff Jeff Zients for deleting emails related to the Cambridge Anal...",
      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Attorneys for Meta shareholders asked a Delaware judge Monday to sanction the company's former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and fellow Facebook board member and current White House chief of staff Jeff Zients for deleting emails related to the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, despite being told to preserve such records.",
      "The plaintiff attorneys contend that Sandberg and Zients used personal email accounts to communicate about key issues relating to their 2018 shareholder lawsuit that alleged Facebook officers and directors violated both the law and their fiduciary duties in failing for years to protect the privacy of user data.",
      "\u201cAlthough Sandberg and Zients received a litigation hold requiring them to preserve documents from these accounts, they both knowingly and permanently destroyed electronically stored information from such sources,\u201d attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "The plaintiffs say the former board members were either \u201creckless or intentional\u201d in destroying documents, noting that Sandberg deleted communications to and from her Gmail account after only 30 days, even after being notified of the \u201clitigation hold\u201d to preserve documents. Zients never disabled an auto-delete function on his email account, even though he, too, received a litigation hold and consulted with lawyers, they said.",
      "The plaintiffs argue that Sandberg and Zients should be prohibited from testifying about information they sent or received using their personal email accounts. They also say the burden of proof for any affirmative defense they present should be raised to a standard of \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d instead of the lower standard of a \u201cpreponderance\u201d of the evidence.",
      "Sandberg was deposed last week. Plaintiff attorney Max Huffman said Zients is \u201cbusy\u201d and will be deposed in February \u201cafter there\u2019s an effective transition in Washington.\u201d",
      "Defense attorney Berton Ashman described the email deletions as \u201cunfortunate\u201d but argued that the plaintiffs have not shown that they were prejudiced in any way.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no intent here to destroy relevant or responsive information,\u201d Ashman told Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster, adding that there no \u201ctrove of missing emails.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no grand scheme or suggestion of bad behavior,\u201d he added.",
      "Ashman said the vast majority of emails that Sandberg and Zients sent or received using their personal accounts were also received by other individuals at Facebook. He suggested that any emails that may have been deleted have been made available to the plaintiffs from other sources at Facebook.",
      "Huffman, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, said Sandberg does not deserve the benefit of the doubt.",
      "\u201cShe unilaterally controlled what was kept and what was destroyed,\u201d he told the judge.",
      "Laster, who is scheduled to preside over a non-jury trial in April, said he wanted to see a transcript of Sandberg\u2019s deposition before ruling on the motion for sanctions.",
      "Last year, the judge rejected a defense motion arguing that the lawsuit should be dismissed because the plaintiffs did not first demand that Facebook\u2019s board take legal action before filing litigation themselves. He agreed with the plaintiffs that such a demand would have been futile because of doubts that a majority of the relevant Facebook board members, many with close personal and business ties to Mark Zuckerberg, would be willing to confront the CEO and founder of the company over its privacy failures.",
      "Laster noted that, in deciding on a motion to dismiss, he was required to accept the allegations in the complaint as true.",
      "The complaint alleges that Facebook officials repeatedly and continually violated a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission under which Facebook agreed to stop collecting and sharing personal data on platform users and friends without their consent.",
      "Facebook later sold user data to commercial partners in direct violation of the consent order and removed disclosures from privacy settings that were required under consent order, the lawsuit alleges. The company\u2019s conduct resulted in significant fines from regulators in Europe and culminated in  the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018.  That case involved a British political consulting firm hired by Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign that paid a Facebook app developer for the personal information of tens of millions Facebook users.",
      "The fallout led to Facebook agreeing to pay unprecedented $5 billion penalty to settle FTC charges that the company violated the 2012 consent order by deceiving users about their ability to protect their personal information."

      "Nvidia shares fell 2.6% Monday. They are still up 180% so far this year.",
      "Considered a bellwether for artificial intelligence demand, Nvidia has led the AI sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.",
      "Nvidia's shares have surged this year along with the California company's revenue and profit due to AI demand. According to data firm FactSet, about 16% of Nvidia's revenue comes from China, second only to its U.S.-generated revenue.",
      "A spokesperson for the company based in Santa Clara, California, said in an emailed statement that Nvidia is \u201chappy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.\u201d",
      "In its most recent earnings release, Nvidia posted revenue of $35.08 billion, up 94% from $18.12 billion a year ago. Nvidia earned $19.31 billion in the quarter, more than double the $9.24 billion it posted in last year\u2019s third quarter. The earnings release did not break out revenue from China.",
      "The company's market value rocketed to $3.5 trillion recently, passing Microsoft and briefly overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company.",
      "China\u2019s antitrust investigation follows a report this summer by technology news site The Information that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating complaints from rivals that Nvidia was abusing its market dominance in the chip sector. The allegations reported include Nvidia threatening to punish those who buy products from both itself and its competitors at the same time.",
      "David Bieri, an international finance expert at Virginia Tech, said that China\u2019s investigation is \u201cnot about what Nvidia is doing in China, per se\u201d but rather a signal to the incoming Trump administration. China, Bieri said, is looking to set the tone of future relations.",
      "The Chinese government, he said, is telling the U.S. \u201cdon\u2019t mess with us, because all of your darling corporations that your version of capitalism needs to prosper have entanglements\u201d with China.",
      "Nvidia will have to revise its strategy in China or come up with provisions in their budgets for the type of uncertainty business with China will bring, Bieri said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think this is something that they can shake off,\u201d he said. \u201cI also have a tremendous amount of faith in the brilliance of the management strategy of a corporation like Nvidia to not only pay attention to credit risk, market risk and operational risk, but also to political risk.\u201d",
      "Nvidia\u2019s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics.",
      "Last month, it replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, ending the pioneering semiconductor company's 25-year run on the index.",
      "Unlike Intel, Nvidia designs but doesn\u2019t manufacture its own chips, relying heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., an Intel rival.",

      "The legal filing was made after a panel of three judges on the same court sided with the government last week and ruled that the law, which requires TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance to divest its stakes in the social media company or face a ban, was constitutional.",
      "If the law is not overturned, both TikTok and its parent ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, have claimed that the popular app will shut down by Jan. 19, 2025. TikTok has more than 170 million American users who would be affected, the companies have said.",
      "In their legal filing on Monday, attorneys for the two companies wrote that even if a shutdown lasted one month, it would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "The company would also lose 29% of its total \u201ctargeted global\u201d advertising revenue for next year as well as talent since current and prospective employees would look elsewhere for jobs, they wrote.",
      "\u201cBefore that happens, the Supreme Court should have an opportunity, as the only court with appellate jurisdiction over this action, to decide whether to review this exceptionally important case,\u201d the filing said.",
      "It's not clear if the Supreme Court will take up the case. But some legal experts have said the justices are likely to weigh in on the case since it raises novel issues about social media platforms and how far the government could go in its stated aims of protecting national security.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok the last time he was in the White House, has said he is now against such action.",
      "In their legal filing, the two companies pointed to the political realities, saying that an injunction would provide a \u201cmodest delay\u201d that would give \u201cthe incoming Administration time to determine its position \u2014 which could moot both the impending harms and the need for Supreme Court review.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for the two companies are asking the appeals court to decide on the request for an enforcement pause by Dec. 16. The Department of Justice said in a court filing on Monday that it will oppose the request. Justice officials also suggested that an expedited decision denying TikTok's request would give the Supreme Court more time to consider the case."

    "story": [
      "The Onion's bid to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars returned to a Texas courtroom",
      "An auction company executive involved in the liquidation of Alex Jones\u2019 conspiracy theory platform Infowars testified for nearly five hours Monday, as a bankruptcy judge in Texas began a hearing into whether The Onion satirical news outlet was properly named the winning bidder over a company affiliated with Jones.",
      "Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, was grilled by lawyers for Jones and the company in a Houston courtroom over how The Onion\u2019s bid came to be valued at $7 million and why a live auction was not held. He defended both the value of the bid and its selection after the two sealed offers were opened.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez continued the hearing to Tuesday afternoon, when the trustee overseeing the sale of Jones\u2019 assets is expected to take the stand. Lopez could ultimately decide whether to void The Onion\u2019s bid, name the Jones-affiliated company the winner or hold another auction, among other possibilities.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements and submitted the other bid, are alleging fraud and collusion in the auction that concluded on Nov. 14. The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations, accusing Jones and the company of sour grapes.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut. Jones repeatedly called the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families to help satisfy judgments issued by juries and judges in state courts in Connecticut and Texas. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "The Onion, which wants to turn Infowars\u2019 website and social media accounts into parodies, offered $1.75 million for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction, while First United American Companies bid $3.5 million.",
      "But The Onion\u2019s bid also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, chose The Onion, saying its proposal was better for creditors because they would receive more money. The Onion valued the bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million, because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "Tanenbaum testified that he agreed with the $7 million valuation and believed The Onion\u2019s bid conformed to the auction rules.",
      "A lawyer for Jones, Ben Broocks, asked Tanenbaum how it was possible that the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer boosted The Onion\u2019s offer to such a high amount.",
      "\u201cIt means the purchase price value has gone up because another purchase price would have to be higher than that value in order to provide the same net benefit to that group of creditors,\u201d Tanenbaum said.",
      "During his opening argument, Broocks said there was no way The Onion should have been chosen over First United American.",
      "\u201cHow does a $1.75 million bid beat a $3.5 million bid?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow is that $1.75 million greater? Well, it\u2019s voodoo economics to use a phrase.\u201d",
      "Broocks and a lawyer for First United American, Walter Cicack, also questioned why a live bidding round wasn\u2019t held after the sealed offers weren\u2019t submitted, as they said they expected, but the judge\u2019s order made live bidding optional.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Joshua Wolfshohl, an attorney for Murray, told the judge Monday that no wrongdoing occurred during the auction. He called the complaints by Jones and First United American Companies unfounded.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of their complaints are just fantastic, imagined conspiracy theories that have no basis in reality,\u201d he said.",
      "Murray, The Onion and the Sandy families deny allegations of wrongdoing. In his own court filing, Murray called the allegations \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Up for sale at the auction were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, Texas, as well as its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "On Friday, a Connecticut appeals court reduced by $150 million the original $1.44 billion judgment against Jones in the lawsuit against him in that state, but upheld the rest of the award. Jones\u2019 lawyer said he will ask Connecticut\u2019s highest court to review the appellate ruling. Jones is also appealing a $50 million judgment in a similar Texas defamation lawsuit."

      "TikTok\u2019s future in the U.S. appeared uncertain on Friday after a federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge the company brought against a law that requires it to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned by mid-January",
      "TikTok's future in the U.S. appeared uncertain on Friday after a federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge to a law that requires the social media platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned by mid-January.",
      "A panel of three judges on The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously that the law withstood constitutional scrutiny, rebuffing arguments from the two companies that the statute violated their rights and the rights of TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "The government has said it wants ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its stakes. But if it doesn't and the platform goes away, it would have a seismic impact on the lives of content creators who rely on the platform for income as well as users who use it for entertainment and connection.",
      "Here are some details on the ruling and what could happen next:",
      "In their lawsuit, TikTok and ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, had challenged the law on various fronts, arguing in part that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment and was an unconstitutional bill of attainder that unfairly targeted the two companies.",
      "But the court sided with attorneys for the Justice Department who said that the government was attempting to address national security concerns and the way in which it chose to do so did not violate the constitution.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say that Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread, or suppress, information. However, the U.S. hasn't publicly provided examples of that happening.",
      "The appeals court ruling, written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, said the law was \u201ccarefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary.\" The judges also rejected the claim that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, Ginsburg wrote the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \u201csuppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance are expected to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, but it's unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "TikTok indicated in a statement on Friday the two companies are preparing to take their case to high court, saying the Supreme Court has \u201can established historical record of protecting Americans\u2019 right to free speech.\"",
      "\"We expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\u201d a company spokesperson said.",
      "Alan Morrison, a professor at The George Washington University Law School, said he expects the Supreme Court to take up the case because of the novelty of the issues raised in the lawsuit. If that happens, attorneys for the two companies still have to convince the court to grant them an emergency stay that will prevent the government from enforcing the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline stipulated in the law, Morrison said.",
      "Such a move could drag out the process until the Justices make a ruling.",
      "Tiffany Cianci, a TikTok content creator who has supported the platform, said she was not shocked about the outcome of the court's ruling on Friday because lower courts typically defer to the executive branch on these types of cases. She believes the company will have a stronger case at the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI believe that the next stages are more likely to produce a victory for TikTokers and for TikTok as a whole,\u201d Cianci said.",
      "Another wild card is President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the recent presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "The Trump transition team has not offered details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok.\" But spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last month that he plans to \u201cdeliver\u201d on his campaign promises.",
      "After Trump takes office on Jan. 20th, it would fall on his Justice Department to enforce the law and punish any potential violators. Penalties would apply to any app stores that would violate a prohibition on TikTok and to internet hosting services which would be barred from supporting it.",
      "Some have speculated that Trump could ask his Justice Department to abstain from enforcing the law. But tech companies like Apple and Google, which offer TikTok's app on their app stores, would then have to trust that the administration would not come after them for any violations.",
      "Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said enforcement discretion \u2014 or executive orders \u2014 can not override existing law, leaving Trump with \u201climited room for unilateral action.\"",
      "There are other things Trump could potentially do. It's possible he could invoke provisions of the law that allow the president to determine whether a sale or a similar transaction frees TikTok from \u201cforeign adversary\u201d control. Another option is to urge Congress to repeal the law. But that too would require support from congressional Republicans who have overwhelmingly supported the prospect of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said he was \u201coptimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok\u201d and allow its continued use in the United States.",
      "ByteDance has said it won't sell TikTok. And even if it wanted to, a sale of the proprietary algorithm that powers TikTok is likely to get blocked under Chinese export controls that the country issued in 2020.",
      "That means if TikTok is sold without the algorithm, its likely that the buyer would only purchase a shell of the platform that doesn't contain the technology that made the app a cultural powerhouse.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in buying it.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital. The spokesperson did not disclose the identity of the participants."

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 14:34:23 -0500",

      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat",
      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat. Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50.",
      "For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, such as the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (around 30 degrees Celsius) and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older.",
      "The study in Friday's journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: People between 18 and 35. That age group alone had nine times as many temperature-related deaths as those older than 50.",
      "Study authors and outside experts are scrambling to figure out why. Demographics alone don't explain why more young adult Mexicans are dying in high heat than their elders. Two theories: Outdoor workers who can't escape the heat, and young people who don't know their limits.",
      "The trend is likely to widen as the world warms from human-caused climate change, according to computer simulations run by the study team.",
      "\u201cWe found that younger people are especially vulnerable to humid heat,\u201d study co-author Jeffrey Shrader, a climate economist at Columbia University, said. \u201cAs the climate warms, we're really going to be shifting the burden of temperature-related mortality towards younger individuals and away from older individuals who tend to be more vulnerable to cold temperatures.\u201d",
      "Data from cold weather shows more than 300 deaths of Mexican residents 50 and older for every young person dying from cold temperatures, according to the study.",
      "\u201cPeople of all ages are increasingly at risk from the rising temperatures, and this study shows that those that we might have considered relatively safe from heat-related adverse health outcomes might not be so much so,\u201d said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown that monitors health effects of climate change. She was not part of the study team.",
      "\u201cHeat is a much more dangerous silent killer than most people acknowledge it to be, and that heat is increasingly putting our health and survival at risk,\" Romanello said in an email.",
      "Study authors decided to examine weather-related deaths in Mexico because that country not only has detailed mortality data, but it has a variety of different climates making it an ideal place to study in depth, Shrader said.",
      "Researchers also want to figure out whether this is just a situation in Mexico or other warmer sections of the globe have similar spikes in young adult deaths in high heat and humidity.",
      "Initially the team just wanted to look at deaths and what scientists call wet-bulb globe temperatures, but when they looked at age differences, they were surprised and looked in more detail, Shrader said. Wet-bulb temperature, which is intended to mirror how the body cools itself, is derived using a complicated measurement system that factors in humidity and solar radiation. A wet-bulb globe temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is thought to be the limit for human survivability. Most places don\u2019t reach that level.",
      "Researchers determined temperature-related mortality by complex statistical analysis that compares numerous factors in the number of deaths and removes everything they can except temperature fluctuations, said study co-author Andrew Wilson, a Columbia climate economics researcher.",
      "Researchers also calculated the ideal temperature for when there are the fewest excess deaths at each age group. Younger adults' sweet temperature spot is about nine degrees Fahrenheit (five degrees Celsius) cooler than it is for older people, Shrader and Wilson said.",
      "Some outside health and climate experts were initially puzzled at the higher youth mortality seen in the study. Co-author Patrick Kinney, a professor of urban health and sustainability at Boston University, said it was likely the study included a higher proportion of outdoor workers exposed to heat than prior studies did.",
      "Study co-author Tereza Cavazos, a climate scientist at the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Mexico, said she remembers her father's generations taking siestas in the high heat of the day and that was healthy. That doesn't happen so much now, she said.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of population that is vulnerable in the future. Not even in the future, right now,\u201d Cavazos said. She mentioned three Mexican heat waves this year that hit in the middle of the country and kept the deadly heat going overnight so people had little relief. Usually cool nights allow a body to recover.",
      "Younger people often have a sense of invulnerability to weather extremes and do things that increase their risk, such as play sports in high heat, Cavazos said.",
      "\u201cHigh humidity makes it a lot harder for the body to cool itself through sweating \u2013 which is how our body primarily stays cool,\" said Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and climate change expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. She was not part of the study team. \"So someone young and healthy working outside in heat and high humidity can reach a point where the body can no longer cool itself safely \u2013 causing a deadly form of heat injury called heat stroke.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Luigi Mangione is accused of killing Brian Thompson in Manhattan on Dec. 4.",
      "In his first comments since Luigi Mangione was charged with second-degree murder on Monday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he was confident that the 26-year-old would quickly be extradited to New York where he will be held accountable for brazenly gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "\"We will get the defendant here and bring him to justice through our court proceeding,\" Bragg told ABC News on Wednesday, saying that Mangione could face additional charges beyond the second-degree murder charges he currently faces.",
      "\"As we learn more about motives and other things like that ... there may be additional charges,\" Bragg said.",
      "Mangione is also charged in New York with criminal possession of a forged instrument and several counts of criminal possession of a weapon.",
      "\"We intend to learn more, and we have a lot of things to do,\" Bragg said. \"As things go forward, there may be additional charges to bring,\" Bragg said.",
      "Mangione's attorney, Thomas Dickey, said his client intends to plead not guilty to the charges, claiming there is no evidence linking his client to the crime. Bragg said he was confident Mangione is the person who fired three rounds into the torso of Thompson last week, killing the health care executive and setting off a firestorm of vitriol online.",
      "\"We would not charge the person if we didn't think it was the person, and we're prepared to go forward and we're on the path to accountability and justice,\" Bragg said.",
      "Once the former Ivy Leaguer is extradited to New York, Bragg said Mangione will face a team of Manhattan's most seasoned homicide prosecutors. The DA acknowledged that the nature of the alleged crime is \"extraordinarily scary.\"",
      "\"It is very scary, and it is something that has the attention of so many who live here, so many who come to work here, and rightfully so,\" Bragg said.",
      "Bragg's comments come the same day that the New York Police Department offered the first forensic evidence linking Mangione to the alleged crime. According to Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, fingerprints from the crime scene have been matched to Mangione, and three shell casings recovered following the midtown shooting were matched to Mangione's 3D-printed handgun. Bragg's office said his office has focused on combating so-called ghost guns since the beginning of his tenure as district attorney.",
      "\"It's something we're seeing more and more in use, speaking generally. It's something also we've seen people who are younger and younger working on,\" Bragg said.",
      "Asked why Mangione was charged with second-degree murder, Bragg told ABC News that prosecutors wanted to bring charges quickly and first-degree murder \"has a number of delineated circumstances.\"",
      "\"Murder 2 is the intentional killing of a person, punishable by 25 years to life under New York law,\" Bragg said. \"Murder 1 has a number of delineated circumstances, including, for example, a serial murder, murder of a witness, murder of a police officer.\"",
      "Bragg has found himself at the center of multiple high-profile cases -- including his conviction of former President Donald Trump and recent acquittal of Marine veteran Daniel Penny. With the Mangione case, Bragg is expected to face not only a high-profile prosecution but also a groundswell of public support for the accused murderer,.",
      "\"I ... have spent time with families of homicide victims with survivors of violent crime,\" Bragg said. \"That's the centerpiece of our work, and to think that there are others celebrating this conduct is beyond comprehension to me.\"",
      "Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate, is accused of shooting Thompson outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel on Dec. 4 while the CEO was heading to an investors conference.",
      "Thompson's murder ignited online anger at the health insurance industry and some people online have celebrated the suspect.",
      "\"Celebrating murder is abhorrent,\" Bragg said. \"I sit across the table from families who've had a loved one killed. And to think of people celebrating that ... is beyond comprehension to me.\"",
      "\"What I would say to members of the public ... [who are] celebrating this and maybe contemplating other action: We will be vigilant and we will hold people accountable,\" Bragg said.",
      "The ghost gun allegedly in Mangione's possession when he was arrested has been matched to three shell casings recovered at the murder scene, according to the NYPD.",
      "Fingerprints recovered from a water bottle and a Kind bar near the crime scene have also been matched to Mangione, police said.",
      "Mangione was apprehended in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday after nearly one week on the run. He's also facing charges in Pennsylvania, including allegedly possessing an untraceable ghost gun.",
      "Mangione plans to challenge his extradition to New York.",
      "The Manhattan District Attorney's Office said it will seek a governor's warrant to try to force Mangione's extradition. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement that she'll sign a request for the governor's warrant \"to ensure this individual is tried and held accountable.\"",

In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work,\" he said in his remarks.",
      "\"It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway -- this is not easy for me. I love this place, I love our mission, and I love our people -- but my focus is, and always has been, on us and doing what's right for the FBI,\" he said.",

Our adherence to our core values, our dedication to independence and objectivity, and our defense of the rule of law -- those fundamental aspects of who we are must never change,\" he said.",
      "\"That's the real strength of the FBI\u202f--\u202fthe importance of our mission, the quality of our people, and their dedication to service over self. It's an unshakeable foundation that's stood the test of time, and cannot be easily moved. And it -- you, the men and women of the FBI -- are why the bureau will endure and remain successful long into the future,\" Wray continued.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has picked Kash Patel to replace Wray at the FBI, pending Senate confirmation.",
      "Trump reacted to the news shortly after in a statement railing against Wray and praising Patel, who was on Capitol Hill Wednesday to shore up support among Republican senators.",
      "\"The resignation of Christopher Wray is a great day for America as it will end the Weaponization of what has become known as the United States Department of Injustice,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform. \"I just don't know what happened to him. We will now restore the Rule of Law for all Americans.\"",
      "Trump specifically took aim at the Justice Department's investigations against him by special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "\"Under the leadership of Christopher Wray, the FBI illegally raided my home, without cause, worked diligently on illegally impeaching and indicting me, and has done everything else to interfere with the success and future of America,\" Trump wrote. \"They have used their vast powers to threaten and destroy many innocent Americans, some of which will never be able to recover from what has been done to them.\"",
      "Patel told ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce just after Wray's announcement he'll be ready on \"Day 1.\"",
      "\"We look forward to a very smooth transition and I'll be ready to go on day one,\" he said.",
      "Patel declined to answer any additional questions about retribution, his message to Trump or whether he's spoken to the president-elect.",
      "Wray, who was appointed by then-President Trump to a 10-year term and confirmed in August 2017, oversaw the agency in a \"heightened threat environment\" and number of high-profile cases, including the investigation of the man who appointed him.",
      "Congress changed the FBI director's tenure to 10 years to years to address concerns about political interference.",
      "As FBI director, Wray oversaw the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, hundreds of Chinese espionage cases, the probes into Trump's and President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents as well as thousands more criminal investigations.",
      "Wray was nominated by Trump after Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey.",

      "Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, the incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Wray on Dec. 9, expressing a \"vote of no confidence\" in Wray and his deputy director.",
      "\"For the good of the country, it's time for you and your deputy to move on to the next chapter of your life,\" Grassley wrote.",
      "Grassley quickly responded to Wray's resignation announcement.",
      "\"Wray's departure is an opportunity for a new era of transparency and accountability at the FBI. Future FBI Directors ought to learn a lesson from Wray's mistakes. Stonewalling Congress, breaking promises, applying double standards and turning your back on whistleblowers is no longer going to cut it,\" the senator said."

      "Food",
      "Food",
      "The two grocery store chains first proposed the $24.6B deal in 2022.",
      "Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.",
      "Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.",
      "Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.",
      "\"Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,\" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. \"We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.\"",
      "Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.",
      "\"Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,\" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise \"best efforts\" and failed to take \"'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.\"",
      "The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.",
      "In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit \"baseless.\"",
      "\"Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,\" the company claimed. \"This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.\"",
      "Kroger said the company \"looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.\"",
      "Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger \"would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,\" as well as both companies' employees.",
      "\"Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,\" Moriarty claimed in a statement. \"Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.\"",
      "The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.",
      "Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.",
      "That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.",
      "Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.",
      "Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.",
      "In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.",
      "Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.",
      "\"The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger\u2019s acquisition of Albertsons,\" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. \"This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.\"",
      "White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, \"The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.\""

      "She was a vocal backer of Trump's \"big lie\" about election fraud in 2021 -- and she used that narrative to fuel her own campaign for governor in 2022. She also refused to concede the loss of her own gubernatorial race and attempted, unsuccessfully, to overturn the results.",
      "Trump also said he will nominate Michael Rigas to the State Department as deputy secretary of state for management and resources.",

Dan demonstrated exceptional investigative skills, successfully taking hundreds of violent offenders off the streets, including those involved in armed robbery, gang violence, human trafficking, and illegal gun and narcotics trafficking.\"",
      "He also lauded Newlin for founding an injury law practice and went on to say, \"With his Law Enforcement expertise enabling him to navigate complex international issues, and his business insights fostering economic partnerships, Newlin stands as a powerful advocate for U.S. interests, and a Champion for strengthening ties, and making a difference in the World.\"",
      "He also announced Lamelas as his pick for ambassador to Argentina, posting, \"Peter is a physician, philanthropist, and an incredible businessman, best known for founding the largest Urgent Care healthcare company in Florida.\"",
      "The post continued, \"As a child, Peter and his family fled communist Cuba, and LEGALLY immigrated to the USA, starting with nothing, and achieving the American Dream.\"",
      "Trump then announced Rizzuto as his pick for U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States, citing his professional achievements and saying the Conair co-founder would be \"fantastic.\"",

      "Trump himself has been more vocal recently about Hegseth, saying on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" over the weekend that \"we'll be working on his nomination\" and \"I've had a lot of senators calling me up saying he's fantastic.\" Trump's transition also released what essentially amounted to a hype video Tuesday, touting some senators' glowing remarks about Hegseth.",
      "A conservative group with ties to Elon Musk, the world's richest man who has carved out a powerful role inside Trump's orbit, is also spending $500,000 on a new ad pushing the Senate to confirm Hegseth. The ads push viewers to \"call your senator today and urge them to confirm Pete Hegseth\" and are airing nationally -- but also targeting digital platforms in Ernst's home state of Iowa.",
      "Those moves, compounded by electoral threats from Trump online media allies like Steve Bannon and Dan Bongino, seem to have moved the needle, even as Hegseth continues to bat away allegations of excessive drinking and sexual misconduct from former colleagues and one woman who claims he raped her.",
      "After predicting there would be \"a very thorough vetting before [Hegseth] moves forward,\" Ernst said after an \"encouraging\" meeting Monday, \"As I support Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources.\"",
      "Graham, who had cast the claims against Hegseth as serious, also said Monday that he had \"a very positive, thorough and candid meeting\u201d with Hegseth and echoed that accusations should be \"supported by testimony before Congress -- not anonymous sources.\"",
      "The movement indicates the immense power Trump and his allies hold, and how influential they could be with the party's base. And the political graveyard is packed with the careers of Republican lawmakers who defied Trump, only to lose office in a primary.",
      "\"We will use every resource at our disposal to make sure that every one of Trump's nominees and Cabinet picks are confirmed. And if that does not happen, the ultimate recourse will be at the ballot box for those elected officials who choose to not vote for them,\" said a second source close to the transition. \"That includes Pete, that includes Bobby, that includes Kash, includes everybody.\"",
      "\"We've been very clear. And the president has made calls to various U.S. senators for some of his nominees. The president's been very clear of what he wants. Elon Musk has been very clear,\" the person added. \"When you're the world's richest man, and you have $350 billion, that makes politicians quake.\"",
      "To be sure, Hegseth himself has also been putting in the work to get confirmed. He's continued to deny the allegations against him, held a blitz of meetings with senators, and Ernst said he committed to appointing a senior official who would tackle the issue of sexual assault within the military.",
      "But the role of Trump's allies can't be dismissed.",
      "The pressure campaign is coming ahead of a new Congress in which Republicans will hold a 53-47 Senate majority, meaning any Cabinet pick cannot afford to lose more than three GOP votes if Democrats vote unanimously in opposition.",
      "Members of Congress are historically fervent in their defense of their role as an equal branch of government -- a role manifested in their \"advice and consent\" function regarding a president's Cabinet picks. Already, Senate opposition sunk the fortunes of former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Trump's pick for attorney general who had been accused of sexual misconduct that he denied.",
      "Yet Trump has a unique hold on his base, and threats of primaries in cases of disloyalty may be a permanent fixture for lawmakers to prevent opposition to Cabinet picks to mushroom over the next several weeks -- and to enforce support over next four years.",
      "\"I think that these senators are very susceptible to pressure because they've witnessed what's happened to members who are now former members who opposed the president. So, we're seeing a lot of members change their tune because they're worried and they don't ever be primaried out of office, and they don't want to have the president having some cross words for them,\" said Brian Darling, a GOP strategist and former Senate aide.",
      "\"Republicans may not appreciate it in the Senate, but it's a fact of life,\" he added.",
      "Already, damage may have been done for Senate GOP critics, some Republicans warned.",
      "Even if every Republican senator comes around on all of Trump's picks, the president-elect's supporters have long memories -- and the strain of populism that is one of the country's dominant political drivers has piqued anti-incumbent fervor.",
      "\"Even her pushback has been noticed in Iowa,\" Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Christian conservative leader in Iowa, said of Ernst. \"You've seen a lot of people push back on her because of it, and there's been some calls from primarily those outside of Iowa going, 'she probably should be primaried.' I haven't seen anything real of that measure in Iowa yet. But it's a primary rich environment today.\"",

    "summary": "As Democratic governors prepare to navigate and resist parts of Trump's second-term agenda, one told ABC News she is most alarmed by Trump's tariff plan.",
    "story": [
      "They say Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs is their biggest concern.",
      "As Democratic governors prepare to navigate and resist parts of President-elect Donald Trump's next administration, one told ABC News she is most alarmed by Trump's tariff plan.",
      "\"Tariffs would be devastating to our economy, especially with the amount of trade we do with Canada,\" Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey told ABC News.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose a 25% across the board tariff on Mexico and Canada, in addition to a 10% tariff on goods imported from China. These are the U.S.'s top three trading partners. Economists warn this would raise prices on everyday goods and wreak havoc on the economy.",
      "\"I'm a governor who's come in, cut taxes, worked to lower housing costs, grow the economy. If he were to impose tariffs -- it would first of all -- I think it's not smart to do -- and it would be devastating to consumers,\" Healey said, \"Think about all the housing we're trying to build here right now -- what will that do to housing costs?\"",
      "In an interview with NBC News that aired on Sunday, Trump said he couldn't guarantee that his tariff plan would not raise prices for American consumers.",
      "Other Democratic governors, who gathered last weekend for the first time since the election for a winter meeting in Beverly Hills, California, said Trump's tariff proposals were a chief concern among a number of others: threats to entitlements, his immigration proposals, and repeals of climate and reproductive protections. Several high-profile governors told ABC News they're deep into preparations to use legislative, executive or legal actions to combat Trump's moves.",
      "At the Beverly Hilton over the weekend, the tight-knit group of Democratic talent -- many of whom will be some of the strongest detractors of Trump's policies and also some of the best-positioned to be at the top of the party's presidential ticket in 2028 -- gathered for private, closed-door meetings with one another, donors and other stakeholders. The group of about 18 governors and governors-elect, hosted by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, focused on how to navigate through Trump's leadership, according to several who spoke with ABC News, rather than any significant post-election analysis following the Democrats' losses last month.",
      "The group of governors in Beverly Hills included many of the likely 2028 contenders, including blue state leaders like Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who have been actively on offense against Republican leadership since Nov. 6, and red state ones like Democratic Governors Association Vice Chair and Chair-elect Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.",
      "Healey, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz were also on the guest list -- many of whom have questions looming about their own political futures.",
      "\"I would expect that we'll put up quite a fight to take the House back. And I think that we'll have an incredible bench in the primary '28,\" New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told ABC News about the plans of many of the governors.",
      "The governors are striking different tones as they prepare for Trump's presidency.",
      "The strongest, most combative voices of course have been from leaders like Newsom, who initiated a recently convened a special legislative session in California to increase funding for its Department of Justice and other agencies so they'll be able to quickly file litigation to challenge actions taken by a second Trump administration. Pritzker, too, has made not-so-veiled threats about how he'd approach the administration should it \"come for\" his people, and recently announced his position as co-chair, along with Jared Polis of Colorado, of a new nonpartisan coalition of governors committed to protecting the \"state-level institutions of democracy\" ahead of Trump's presidency.",
      "Other governors encouraged their peers to meet this moment offensively through their agendas.",
      "\"Democratic governors should approach this with strength and resolution and an activist agenda. Because this is the place where we can make progress too,\" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee told ABC News.",
      "\"You can't stop some 85% of the things I would like to do in that state, so I think the order of the day is defend where we can in fighting with an advance every day with our own ambitions and unaffected by him, so that shadow doesn't fall in our state,\" said Inslee, who is leaving his seat this winter to make way for incoming Gov. Bob Ferguson.",
      "But a different group of governors are acting much more lukewarm in their approaches, emphasizing their desire to \"work\" with the Trump administration and some citing past collaborations with the president-elect's team, like during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Beshear said last weekend that Democrats needed to lean into \"reason\" while Trump is in office and that he's willing to work with the incoming administration.",
      "\"The middle ground, middle of the road, common ground, common sense, is open. It's open,\" Beshear told a group of reporters on Saturday.",
      "Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, the DGA's chair, said this weekend that she wasn't yet anticipating Trump or his agencies' actions, but \"We will always look for ways to work together\" with the caveat that she'll \"draw the line\" on things \"that they push us to do that we think are wrong, illegal, anything like that.\"",
      "The varying approaches from governors to Trump's agenda could be a coordinated strategy as the group wrestles with how best to support each other within a party attempting to rebuild -- a complicated task as they also eye each other as potential presidential primary competition.",
      "\"We know how to create space to protect people and protect the priorities,\" Lujan Grisham told ABC, noting that she and many other governors aren't officially part of Pritzker and Polis' new coalition, for example. \"We did it on climate. We still do it on climate. We did it on reproductive premiums, we're gonna have to still do it on reproductive premiums, and we'll do some test cases in states that allow us to frame and direct these coalitions.\"",
      "\"We want to be strategic about what it is that we are announcing. And here's why: We've got a president-elect and a team that, before this and every day, said 'We're going to punish anyone in our way, and we're going to particularly punish states,'\" she went on. \"And the difference in California versus New Mexico -- California is definitely on the radar. I don't minimize what the Trump administration can negatively do to my state, but we're also very effective at watching and understanding what's occurring, and then we can deploy our joint efforts pretty damn fast.\"",
      "While governors can mount legal fights against parts of Trump's plan, the president can use executive power to impose sweeping tariffs.",
      "But for immigration, on the other hand, governors can resist Trump's proposals in clearer ways.",
      "Border state Gov. Lujan Grisham told ABC News she'd block Trump's ability to use detention centers, deploy the National Guard or even request data in her state if he attempted mass deportations.",
      "\"I take him at his word. He says he's going to do, try to do mass deportations,\" she said, adding that she wouldn't be a partner in those moves: \"There's a lot that he can't do by himself.\" .\"I mean, I've made it very clear over a number of years on this issue is that I will not use our National Guard to perform that kind of service,\" Kelly told reporters.",
      "\"I will not send them to the border. We have had Guard members go to the border, but they have been federalized when they've been down there. I don't see that as the role of the National Guard -- they are there to serve Kansas, Kansas issues, so I don't see that changing... The State Police are mine, and it's not their job, either. So we will take the same approach as we have with the Guard,\" Kelly added.",
      "On immigration, most Democratic governors agree that violent criminals need to be deported, noting that it's always been the case that local and state law enforcement work with federal authorities on investigating crimes. But where many governors draw the line is on deporting undocumented immigrants who have been living and working in America for a long time, arguing it's inhumane and damages the economy.",
      "\"We don't know what President Trump's immigration plan is going to look like at the end of the day. He is a master of saying something, creating a great deal of noise, and then the reality may be different. So I'm going to wait to see exactly what it is he ultimately proposes,\" incoming North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein told reporters about his plans to respond to Trump's immigration moves.",
      "\"The people of North Carolina have every right to be safe in their communities, and anybody who commits a violent crime must be held accountable, fully, and that's whether they're in this country as American citizens or they're here as undocumented people, and if they're here undocumented, they should be deported,\" Stein said.",
      "They also question how Trump will execute his plan. Trump could direct the National Guard to help with transport and logistics, but one Democratic governor told ABC News these are precious resources, and they need their National Guard for emergencies like storms, fires and severe flooding.",
      "Trump's team has discussed in the past how to strip federal resources from Democratic-run cities if they refuse to work with the administration on deporting undocumented immigrants, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "Blue state governors say they're concerned about the Trump administration weaponizing federal funding and \"picking winners and losers.\" One governor told ABC News their state is focused on locking down every federal dollar the state is entitled to, and securing all of the funding made available through the Biden administration's infrastructure law and CHIPS and Science Act.",
      "In California, Newsom has also started to \"Trump-proof\" his budget, which is one of the aims of his move to convene the legislature last week.",

    "title": "America's swing to the right in 2024 was wide, if not always deep",
    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 16:58:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump gained ground in every state and most counties in the 2024 election compared to 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Trump gained ground in every state and most counties compared to 2020.",
      "Despite what you may have heard, the 2024 election was pretty close. President-elect Donald Trump won a clear victory in the Electoral College, but he leads outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris in the national popular vote by only 1.5 percentage points, 49.8 percent to 48.3 percent* \u2014 one of the smallest margins ever in a presidential race.",
      "Nonetheless, the magnitude of Trump's triumph may appear much larger because it featured a major swing to the right from where the nation voted in 2020. As President Joe Biden defeated Trump by about 4.5 points nationally four years ago, Trump's 2024 advantage represents about a 6-point shift to the right, which is the largest swing toward either party since 2008. Back then, Barack Obama's 7.3-point edge represented a nearly 10-point swing to the left from George W. Bush's 2.5-point win in 2004.",
      "Yet the national swing only tells part of the story. What particularly stands out this year is the breadth of the swing in Trump's direction across not only the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but also an overwhelming majority of the more than 3,000 counties or their equivalents in the United States. Compared with his showing in 2020, Trump didn't pick up a huge amount of ground in many places, but he did gain at least a little bit nearly everywhere. We can see this by drilling into the state-level and county-level data below.",
      "Every state swung to the right in 2024",
      "From one presidential election to the next, more states usually swing toward the party that gains ground compared with how it performed four years earlier. However, it's rare for every state to move in the same direction, even in elections where one candidate wins decisively. After all, changes in the makeup of the party coalitions and the varying appeal of individual candidates can lead different states to move in opposite directions. Plus, at least in a few historical cases, a third-party candidate may have won a meaningful share of the vote that cut more into one party's coalition than another.",
      "But in 2024, all 50 states and D.C. swung to the right to varying degrees based on their margins versus the 2020 race. This marked the first presidential election since 1976 in which all 51 components of the Electoral College moved in the same direction relative to how they voted four years earlier.",
      "Unlike 1976, though, all 50 states and D.C. moved to the right in 2024 even though the previous election was also highly competitive. That wasn't the case in the closely fought 1976 race won by Jimmy Carter: His victory came four years after a landslide result in 1972, when Richard Nixon carried 49 states and won by 23 points nationally \u2014 the largest popular vote edge a candidate has earned in the post-World War II era \u2014 making 1976's leftward swing more of a return to a highly competitive baseline.",
      "Although six other elections since 1976 featured larger swings than in 2024, at least one state in each of those contests still moved toward the party that lost ground. In 1980, Vermont was the only state where Carter's margin improved even as he lost reelection badly to Ronald Reagan. In 1984, Reagan built significantly on his 1980 margins while winning the only definite landslide since Nixon's 1972 victory, but seven states and D.C. still voted more Democratic than they had four years earlier. Republicans lost ground in 49 states while winning again in 1988, but George H.W. Bush's margin grew very slightly over Reagan's in Tennessee and D.C. When the elder Bush lost reelection in 1992, he did worse in nearly every state, but still managed to improve his margin slightly in Iowa. And when Obama won by the largest margin in recent years in 2008, five now-dark red states trended right (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia).",
      "While every state swung to the right in 2024, the extent of that swing did vary quite a bit. Weighted by each state's share of the national popular vote, the average state shifted 5.6 points to the right by margin from its 2020 result. Leading the way was New York, which Harris only won by about 13 points after Biden carried it by 23 points \u2014 a swing of more than 10 points. Other populous blue states like New Jersey (10 points) and California (9 points) also swung notably to the right, as did large red states like Florida (10 points) and Texas (8 points).",
      "Conversely, 36 states and D.C. shifted to the right by less than the weighted average. Those states tended to be less populous and therefore more rural, but also include most of the seven principal swing states in the 2024 race, which had the most concentrated campaign attention and spending during the election. Of those, only Arizona had a larger-than-average shift to the right of 5.8 points, while Nevada's 5.5-point rightward shift was about the same as the weighted average. Beyond that, Michigan swung just 4.2 points to the right, and the other four swing states \u2014 Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 all swung right by fewer than 3 points.",
      "Of all the states, Washington state had the smallest swing to the right, going from Biden +19 to Harris +18. The Washington outcome serves as yet another reminder that you should never rely on one data point as an indicator of things to come. After all, Washington's blanket and top-two primary results have often served as a decent predictor for the national political environment in the ensuing November election. But in 2024, Democrats running for the U.S. House of Representatives did better in the state's top-two primaries than they performed in 2020 or 2022, yet the November results saw Republicans nationally do much better than in 2020 and similar to their 2022 result in the national popular vote for the House.",
      "Most counties swung right to a small or medium degree",
      "Naturally, as one party gains more compared to the last election, it tends to gain a larger share of voters across the nation's counties, and county-level data can help us understand the depth and breadth of the swing behind an election's outcome. But a simple count of the number of counties that moved in one direction isn't especially helpful in painting this picture. After all, most counties are rural (and consistently conservative-leaning), but rocks and trees can't vote. Carter's 1976 victory was the last time a Democratic presidential nominee won more counties than the Republican did, yet Democrats have won five of the 12 White House contests since then.",
      "To get a read on the scope of county-level swings, it's more useful to consider the share of the nation's overall vote found in counties that moved toward one party or the other. That way, we better account for the vast differences in population across counties. By this measure, the rightward swing of Trump's 2024 victory featured substantial breadth. Compared with the 2020 election, 92 percent of voters lived in counties (or their equivalents) that swung toward Trump, while only 8 percent lived in places that moved toward Harris. The only recent election to rival that span is Obama's 2008 win, when 92 percent of voters lived in counties that swung to the left from the 2004 election.",
      "Now, the depth of Trump's swing was somewhat shallower than Obama's 2008 win, which isn't necessarily surprising considering 2008 saw a bigger overall swing nationally (9.7 points to the left). More than half of all votes in 2008 came from places that swung at least 10 points to the left by margin. By comparison, only 11 percent of 2024 votes hailed from counties that swung more than 10 points to the right, while 81 percent overall came from counties that shifted between zero and 10 points to the right.",
      "Compared to recent contests besides 2008, though, the broad scope of Trump's gains across much of the country seem striking. The third-biggest swing in the past quarter century after 2008 and 2024 came in 2012, when Obama won reelection but the country as a whole swung 3.4 points to the right. Yet even as much of the country swung slightly to the right that year, about 1 in 4 votes still came from counties that moved at least somewhat to the left. In 2020, we saw a similar story: Biden swung the country about 2.4 points to the left from 2016, but a tad more than 1 in 4 votes came from counties that swung right toward Trump.",
      "Another data point further suggests that the shift from 2020 to 2024 was not just broad, but especially consistent in its impacts across the country. Overall, the correlation between each county's margin in 2020 compared with 2024 was .995 on a scale of -1 to 1 \u2014 a near-perfect positive association between the two elections, and the strongest between the results in any two consecutive presidential elections dating back to 2000. To be clear, this does not mean that the results were the same in each county in 2020 and 2024. Rather, it broadly means that the more Republican a county voted in 2020, the more Republican it tended to vote in 2024.",
      "Although results in other recent pairs of elections have been highly correlated as well, the 2020-24 comparison is particularly notable because such an incredibly strong association happened even while the country swung 6 points to the right. This suggests that, broadly speaking, this ample national swing did not vary massively across the country. By contrast, the sizable 10-point swing to the left in 2008 from 2004 had a county-level correlation of .933, meaning that while the margins across counties were relatively similar, more places still saw some substantial movement that didn't correspond as closely. And in 2016, which saw particularly large county-level swings from 2012 because of the shifting nature of the Democratic and Republican coalitions at the start of the Trump era, the correlation between the two contests was .945.",
      "***",
      "The breadth of the nation's rightward swing could suggest a couple of larger possibilities. Considering 2008 saw the only similarly large national shift in recent times amid financial and global turmoil, the broad swing in 2024 seems to be another point in favor of larger fundamentals-based reasons for the shifts in this election. Dissatisfaction with the economic status quo and immigration, along with high disapproval of the incumbent president, were all clear boons for Trump's candidacy.",
      "At the same time, Trump's gains may have greater resonance moving forward. The relative consistency of the county-level shifts suggests that there weren't major coalition shifts this year, but even minor swings could be a harbinger. Notably, Trump improved most in more urban and more racially diverse places. Odds are that the 2028 election results will be highly correlated with the 2024 results, so even small coalition changes in this election could have a long-term impact on the makeup of the parties and the preferences of voters as we look ahead to future elections.",

    "story": [
      "New Education and the Workforce Committee chair will be elected Thursday.",
      "Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx has reached her final hours as the conference's leader on education policy.",
      "For 20 years, Foxx has served on the House Education and the Workforce Committee. For the last two terms while Republicans were in the majority in the House, she's held the coveted position of chairwoman and was ranking member when Democrats were in control from 2019 until 2021. In fact, the 81-year-old congresswoman was granted a waiver to lead the committee for the 118th Congress because Republicans limit their top committee position to six years.",
      "The Republican Steering Committee will elect the next chair on Thursday.",
      "Foxx told ABC News that her top priority this session was reducing college costs through reauthorizing the Higher Education Act.",
      "Many of the K-12 topics on the former college instructor and community college president's legislative agenda became winning issues for Republicans. Parents' rights, protecting women and girls in sports, and school choice policies -- issues that reached the national stage on the campaign trail this year -- were widely supported by Republicans under Foxx's leadership.",
      "Foxx is known for foiling the Biden administration's signature higher education policies, including his student loan forgiveness program. She's been called a \"hero\" by staffers and a \"force of nature\" by House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "\"She has been a very faithful friend to me and a good model for all of us,\" Johnson recalled in an interview with ABC News. \"Her work ethic is incredible. She is so passionate about what she does. She is a force of nature, but she also has a way to balance it with humility,\" Johnson said.",
      "Foxx's dedication to education was exhibited by her committee's crackdown on alleged antisemitism engulfing college campuses over the last year. She spearheaded the collecting of more than 400,000 pages of documents, historic subpoenas for documents and internal communications, and hearings that led to the resignations of Ivy League presidents who failed to protect Jewish students at U.S. universities, according to the committee's wide-reaching report.",
      "\"Our goal was and is to make sure that Jewish students are safe on campus,\" Foxx told ABC News, adding, \"All students should be safe on campus, but it was the Jewish students who were being threatened and harassed and, at times, assaulted.\"",
      "House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik has worked alongside Foxx for the last decade on the committee. Stefanik credits Foxx with being the driving force pushing education to the top of the House's agenda as Johnson took up the antisemitism issue earlier this spring.",
      "\"The great thing about Virginia is she's not going to slow down, and I think she will have other great chapters in Congress, but it's been great to be on the committee with her, and I'm very proud of her, and she is someone that so many people look up to,\" Stefanik told ABC News.",
      "Foxx's work ethic can be traced back to her humble beginning in Avery County, North Carolina, in Appalachia. She told ABC News that she grew up very poor.",
      "\"I just never imagined, in my wildest dreams, being in Congress or having a portrait,\" Foxx said when asked this fall about the painting of her that now hangs in the Education Committee's hearing room on Capitol Hill. \"I grew up in a town with no electricity and no running water.\"",
      "Foxx is now a mentor to her colleagues, including Stefanik and Utah's Burgess Owens.",
      "\"She's a bulldog when it comes down to what she wants to get accomplished and that's what we've needed to actually bring education to the forefront,\" Rep. Owens told ABC News.",
      "A former NFL player, Owens said he admires Foxx's ability to build a team and compared the chairwoman to his legendary head coach Al Davis.",
      "\"I see what Dr. Foxx is doing with education in the same way,\" Owens said. \"I think for the first time, education is becoming a priority, not only for those of us who have a passion for it, but for Americans across the country who just took it for granted,\" he said.",
      "A relative newcomer to the committee, Owens wants to follow in Foxx's footsteps. He is challenging Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Michigan, to succeed Foxx as chair.",
      "Owens told ABC News he's feeling anxious about winning over his colleagues on the committee. Meanwhile, Walberg and Rep. G.T. Thompson of Pennsylvania are the second-longest serving Republicans on the committee behind Foxx. After 16 years, Walberg said he believes he deserves the top position.",
      "Foxx said she has loved chairing the committee, but it's just one of many highlights during her time on the Hill.",
      "\"My greatest achievement comes every day when we help another constituent, so my life isn't just tied up in the committee,\" she said."

      "He named a total of seven appointments on Tuesday night via Truth Social.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump posted a flurry of announcements to his Truth Social account on Tuesday night, including the appointment of Kimberly Guilfoyle as the ambassador to Greece and Tom Barrack as the ambassador to Turkey.",
      "Guilfoyle, a former fundraiser for Trump and a former host on Fox News, is currently in an established relationship with Donald Trump Jr.",
      "In announcing her position, Trump wrote, \"For many years, Kimberly has been a close friend and ally. Her extensive experience and leadership in law, media, and politics along with her sharp intellect make her supremely qualified to represent the United States, and safeguard its interests abroad.\"",
      "The post also stated, \"Kimberly is perfectly suited to foster strong bilateral relations with Greece, advancing our interests on issues ranging from defense cooperation to trade and economic innovation.\"",
      "Tom Barrack is Trump's longtime friend who chaired his first inaugural committee \u2014 and he was notably acquitted of federal charges accusing him of illegal foreign lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Barrack was charged during the first Trump administration and campaign, in 2021. During his trial, he was accused by federal prosecutors of acting as a foreign agent but failing to register between 2016 and 2018 while allegedly trying to \"leverage his access\" to Trump with his contacts in the UAE.",
      "A jury found him not guilty on all charges -- which also included conspiracy, obstruction and lying to the FBI -- in November 2022.",
      "Trump praised Barrack's acquittal at the time, saying in a statement: \"Great news for our Country, Freedom, and Democracy in that businessman Tom Barrack, who should have never been charged or tried, was just acquitted of all charges.\"",
      "Barrack's testimony during the trial was at times critical of Trump. He said on the witness stand that his support for Trump politically was \"disastrous\" for him professionally, at one point mocking Trump's understanding of the Middle East.",
      "\"This amazingly good businessman became the president of the United States who could not spell the Middle East,\" Barrack said.",
      "Asked about his criticism of Trump at the time of the acquittal, Barrack told ABC News: \"I'm just done with politics.\"",
      "In announcing his ambassadorship to Turkey on Tuesday, Trump said that Barrack is \"a well respected and experienced voice of reason.\"",
      "The president-elect also announced roles at the Federal Trade Commission. He named Andrew Ferguson as chairman and Mark Meador as commissioner.",
      "\"Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country. Sworn in as a Commissioner on April 2, 2024, he will be able to fight on behalf of the American People on Day One of my Administration,\" Trump wrote in his announcement.",
      "The post continued, \"Andrew will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country\u2019s History.\"",
      "For Meador, Trump listed a series of degrees and accomplishments in the announcement post.",
      "At the Office of Management and Budget, Trump announced Congressman Dan Bishop as deputy director and Ed Martin as the chief of staff.",
      "For Bishop, he posted, \"Dan has been a tireless fighter for our MAGA Movement in the House of Representatives on the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees. Dan will implement my cost-cutting and deregulatory agenda across all Agencies, and root out the Weaponized Deep State.\"",
      "\"Ed is a winner who will help Make America Great Again!\" he wrote for Martin.",
      "Lastly, Trump announced that Jacob Helberg will serve as undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment at the State Department.",
      "In his post on Truth Social, Trump said, \"In this role Jacob will be a champion of our America First Foreign Policy. He will guide State Department policy on Economic statecraft, promoting America\u2019s Economic security and growth, and American technological dominance abroad. Jacob is a successful technology executive, has the knowledge, expertise, and pragmatism to defend America\u2019s Economic interests abroad, and always puts AMERICA FIRST!\"",
      "Helberg is a former Democrat who went from being a little-known tech adviser to a rising star in Trump's circles, known largely as a China hawk and as a major proponent of the bill that may lead to banning TikTok in the U.S.",
      "He\u2019s a commissioner for the U.S.-China Economic Security Review Commission, and he helped shore support on Capitol Hill for the bill that would ban TikTok if it\u2019s not sold from its Chinese parent company by Jan. 19, 2025.",
      "After Biden signed the TikTok bill into law earlier this year, Helberg posted photos of himself with several powerful members of Congress, including Speaker Mike Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, thanking them for being \u201ctruly outstanding people who can come together when our security is at stake.\u201d",
      "Helberg called TikTok a \u201cChinese weapon of war\u201d in August, and he previously published a book titled, \u201cThe Wires of War.\u201d The 2021 book is about tech-fueled wars shaping the world\u2019s balance of power in the coming century, arguing that \u201cwithout a firm partnership with the government, Silicon Valley is unable to protect democracy from the autocrats looking to sabotage it from Beijing to Moscow and Tehran.\u201d",
      "Helberg\u2019s harsh criticism of TikTok could clash with Trump\u2019s vow to \u201csave\u201d TikTok, even though Trump tried to ban the app during his first administration.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance \u201chave laid out an aggressive agenda to face the twin convulsions of technological and geopolitical change, and ensure America wins the economic contests that define this century,\u201d Helberg wrote on X after Trump announced his appointment on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe State Department will play a critical role in acting on this vision,\" his post continued. \"I look forward to earning the support of the U.S. Senate and working with @MarcoRubio to implement President Trump's agenda.\u201d",
      "In previous years, Helberg and his husband were \"significant supporters\" of Ron DeSantis and then reportedly shifted fundraising support to Nikki Haley in 2023.",
      "By midway through the following year, however, Helberg had personally contributed $844,600 to the Trump 47 Committee, Inc. and another $1 million to the Make America Great Again, Inc. super PACs, according to filing data made available by the FEC."

      "President-elect Donald Trump doesn\u2019t think much of Joe Biden\u2019s foreign policy record",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump doesn't think much of Joe Biden's foreign policy record. The Republican president-elect frequently casts the outgoing Democratic president as a feckless leader who shredded American credibility around the world during his four-year term.",
      "But a funny thing happened on Trump's way back to the White House: The Biden and Trump national security teams have come to an understanding that they have no choice but to work together as conflicts in Gaza, Syria and Ukraine have left a significant swath of the world on a knife's edge.",
      "It's not clear how much common ground those teams have found as they navigate crises that threaten to cause more global upheaval as Trump prepares to settle back into the White House on Jan. 20, 2025.",
      "\u201cThere is a deep conviction on the part of the incoming national security team that we are dealing with ... and on our part, directed from President Biden, that it is our job, on behalf of the American people, to make sure this is a smooth transition,\u201d Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said during a weekend appearance at a forum in California. \u201cAnd we are committed to discharging that duty as relentlessly and faithfully as we possibly can.\u201d",
      "To be certain, Trump and his allies haven't let up on their criticism of Biden, putting the blame squarely on the shoulders of Biden and Democrats for the series of crises around the globe.",
      "The president-elect says Biden is responsible for the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, arguing that policies under his watch led to Hamas and Russia becoming emboldened. And shortly before Syria's Bashar al-Assad's government collapsed last week, Trump blamed Biden's old boss, former President Barack Obama, for failing to enforce his own \u201cred line\u201d in 2013 after Assad deployed chemical weapons that killed hundreds of civilians, and laying the groundwork for Islamic militants to establish a beachhead in the country.",
      "But amid the hectoring of Biden, Trump team officials acknowledge that the Biden White House has worked diligently to keep Trump's circle apprised and help ensure there is a smooth handoff on national security matters.",
      "\u201cFor our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity that they can play one administration off the other, they\u2019re wrong, and we are \u2014 we are hand in glove,\" Mike Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said in a Fox News interview last month. \u201cWe are one team with the United States in this transition.\u201d",
      "While Trump rarely has a good word for the Democratic administration, there's an appreciation in Trump world of how the Biden White House has gone about sharing critical national security information, according to a Trump transition official who was not authorized to comment publicly.",
      "The coordination is precisely how lawmakers intended for incoming and outgoing administrations to conduct themselves during a handover when they bolstered federal support for transitions. It's already the most substantive handoff process since 2009, aides to Biden and Trump acknowledged, surpassing Trump's chaotic first takeover in 2017 and his wide refusal to cooperate with the incoming Biden team in 2021.",
      "Trump's pick to serve as special envoy to the Middle East, Florida real estate developer Steve Witkoff, consulted with Biden administration officials as he recently traveled to Mideast to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar\u2019s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive talks and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Sullivan, who was to travel to Israel on Wednesday for talks with Netanyahu, has in turn kept Waltz in the loop about the Biden administration's efforts at getting a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza before Trump's inauguration.",
      "Biden administration officials say that the two national security teams have also closely coordinated on Ukraine and Syria, though they have provided scant detail on what that coordination has looked like.",
      "\u201cLet me put it this way: Nothing that we\u2019re doing and nothing that we\u2019re saying are coming as a surprise to the incoming team,\u201d White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. \"They will decide for themselves what policies they might want to keep in place, what approaches they might want to continue and which ones they won\u2019t.\"",
      "Trump made clear during his campaign that he would move to end the war in Ukraine quickly once he came to office. He called on Russian leader Vladimir Putin earlier this week to act to reach an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine.",
      "But the Biden White House has begun gently \u2014 and publicly \u2014 making the case for how continued support for Ukraine lines up with Trump's priorities.",
      "On Saturday, Sullivan pointed to comments made by Trump on social media to buttress the case that Biden\u2019s push for continued support of Ukraine falls in line with the incoming president\u2019s thinking.",
      "Trump earlier that day had noted that Assad\u2019s rule was collapsing because Russia \u201clost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine, where close to 600,000 Russian soldiers lay wounded or dead, in a war that should never have started, and could go on forever.\u201d",
      "\u201cRussia and Iran are in a weakened state right now, one because of Ukraine and a bad economy, the other because of Israel and its fighting success,\u201d Trump said in the posting on Truth Social.",
      "Sullivan underscored that Biden and Trump are in agreement that there should be no American boots on the ground in Syria and that the war in Ukraine was a major factor in Assad\u2019s fall.",
      "\u201cI was a little bit struck by it \u2014 earlier in the post, he said part of the reason this is happening is because of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine,\u201d Sullivan said of Trump. \u201cAnd I think he even referenced the sheer scale of the casualties that Russia has suffered in Ukraine, and for that reason, they\u2019re not in a position to defend their client, Assad. And on that point, we\u2019re in vigorous agreement.\u201d",
      "Two days later in Washington, Sullivan made the case that Trump should bolster the little-known U.S. International Development Finance Corporation that was created during the Republican\u2019s first term.",
      "The push for reauthorizing the foreign aid agency comes as Trump has promised to make massive cuts to the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Trump signed into law the agency's authority -- tucked into a five-year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 to provide $60 billion in loans, loan guarantees and insurance to companies in developing nations.",
      "Sullivan called the agency an effective tool for private-public partnerships, before allowing that \u201cmaybe I shouldn\u2019t be the one\u201d making the case \u201csince I\u2019m leaving, but I will give my advice anyway.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was created as we\u2019ve all noted, under the Trump administration,\u201d Sullivan said in remarks at the agency\u2019s annual conference. \u201cIt has been strengthened under the Biden administration. And as we look to DFC reauthorization next year, it has to remain a bipartisan priority.\u201d",
      "After Assad's government fell, the Biden administration issued a warning to Iran not to speed up its nuclear program after one of its closest allies was toppled, declaring \u201cthat\u2019ll never happen on our watch.\u201d The U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, hinted at coordination on the matter with the Trump team.",
      "The official said there had been \u201cgood discussions\u201d with the incoming administration on the matter and there was an expectation the same policy would carry over.",
      "Biden has also approved a new national security memorandum that is meant to serve as a road map for the incoming Trump administration as it looks to counter growing cooperation between China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, the White House announced Wednesday.",
      "Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this summer. It was shaped to be a document that could help the next administration build its approach from Day 1 on how it will go about dealing with the tightening relationships between the United States\u2019 most prominent adversaries and competitors, according to two other senior administration officials.",
      "One of those officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, sought to assure the incoming Trump team that the Biden White House effort \u201cisn't trying to box them in or tilt them toward one policy option or another.\u201d",
      "Instead, the official said, it's about helping the next administration build \u201ccapacity\u201d as it shapes its policies on some the most difficult foreign policies it will face.",

      "More than 600,000 people annually visit Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park in the small town of Rovaniemi in Finland",
      "ROVANIEMI, Finland -- Shuffling across icy ground on a cold December afternoon, lots of tourist groups poured into Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park perched on the edge of the Arctic Circle.",
      "They frolic in the snow, take a reindeer sleigh ride, sip a cocktail in an ice bar or even meet Saint Nick himself in the capital of Finnish Lapland, Rovaniemi, which happily calls itself the \u201cofficial hometown of Santa Claus.\"",
      "The Santa Claus Village theme park, which attracts more than 600,000 people annually, is especially popular during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cThis is like my dream came true,\u201d beamed Polish visitor Elzbieta Nazaruk. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to be here.\u201d",
      "Tourism is booming in Rovaniemi \u2014 which has hotel and restaurant owners, as well as city officials, excited as it brings lots of money to the town. However, not everyone is happy about the onslaught of visitors, 10 times the town's population, each year at Christmas time.",
      "\u201cWe are worried about the overgrowth of tourism. Tourism has grown so rapidly, it\u2019s not anymore in control,\u201d said 43-year-old Antti Pakkanen, a photographer and member of a housing network that in September organized a rally through the city\u2019s streets.",
      "It\u2019s a feeling that has been echoed in other popular European travel destinations, including Barcelona, Amsterdam, Malaga and Florence.",
      "Across the continent, locals have protested against \u201cover-tourism\u201d \u2014 which generally describes the tipping point at which visitors and their cash stop benefiting residents and instead cause harm by degrading historic sites, overwhelming infrastructure and making life markedly more difficult for those who live there.",
      "Now, it seems to have spread north, all the way to the edges of the Arctic Circle.",
      "Rovaniemi counted a record 1.2 million overnight visitors in 2023, almost 30 percent growth on 2022, after rebounding from pandemic travel disruptions.",
      "\u201cNordic is a trend,\u201d Visit Rovaniemi CEO Sanna Karkkainen, said as she stood in an ice restaurant, where snow carvers were working nearby.",
      "\u201cPeople want to travel to cool countries to see the snow, to see the Northern Lights, and, of course, to see Santa Claus,\" she added.",
      "Thirteen new flight routes to Rovaniemi Airport opened this year, bringing passengers from Geneva, Berlin, Bordeaux and more. Most tourists come from European countries like France, Germany and the UK, but Rovaniemi\u2019s appeal has also spread further.",
      "Hotel availability is scarce this winter, and Tiina M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4, general manager of the 159-room Original Sokos Hotel, expects 2024 to break more records.",
      "Local critics of mass tourism say many apartment buildings in Rovaniemi\u2019s city center are also used for accommodation services during peak season and are thus no longer available for residential use. They say the proliferation of short-term rentals has driven up prices, squeezed out long-term residents, and turned its city center into a \u201ctransient space for tourists.\"",
      "Finnish law prohibits professional accommodation services in buildings intended for residential use, so campaigners are calling on authorities to act.",
      "\u201cThe rules must be enforced better,\u201d said Pakkanen.",
      "Not everyone agrees. Mayor Ulla-Kirsikka Vainio notes some make \u201cgood money\u201d on short-term rentals.",
      "Either way, stricter regulations likely won\u2019t be in place to impact this winter season, and despite the unease expressed by locals, mass tourism to Rovaniemi is probably only going to grow in 2025 \u2014 as visitors want to experience the unique atmosphere up north, especially during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas time and we would love to see the Northern Lights,\u201d says Joy, a visitor from Bangkok. \u201cRovaniemi seems to be a good place.\u201d"

My job, honestly, over this period isn\u2019t so much about managing the chaos, it's managing really all the challenges, and we'll call it the headwinds that come our way. And I would say the vast majority of those are the uncontrollable.",
      "A: What\u2019s going on the (air-traffic control) system around us. If there weren't weather that we have to deal with and other complications that sometimes arise, running an airline would be pretty easy.",
      "A: Before the pandemic, we would have a big storm in the DFW (Dallas-Fort Worth) area or the Charlotte (North Carolina) area, and it would take us a couple of days (to recover). We set about coming through the pandemic and coming out that we are going to recover better than any carrier out there.",

Now, to your other question about competitors. I\u2019m not inside the other competitors' operations centers and looking at how they do that. Their networks are set up differently than ours. We do ask ourselves, \u2018OK, if something similar were to happen to us, what would we do?\u2019",
      "A: Weather is always a tough thing to predict. That\u2019s really going to be one of the largest things because it has the potential for having the most impact. Controller-wise, we stay in touch with (the Federal Aviation Administration). We have a team out here that is in constant communication with the FAA, looking at what\u2019s happening in the system, and we\u2019re building contingency plans if they think there are going to be some challenges.",
      "A: The only difference between summer and now is we have to deal with winter weather in some locations. So, deicing. But we\u2019re ready for that. The technology we have right now with the deicing vehicles ... we\u2019ve been able to reduce our throughput time on deicing by half and still meeting all the requirements that we need to in terms of adequately deicing the aircraft, but having one person do it.",
      "A: No. Boeing needs to be successful, they need to be able to deliver quality aircraft, but we haven't built our schedule for the holiday period that is dependent on getting any deliveries. We have enough buffer built in.",
      "A: Our frequent and premium travelers look at (the technology to catch line-jumpers) as a benefit of being loyal to American Airlines. It's a huge plus for our gate agents because they do like order.",
      "A: No. We just want a steady stream (of passengers) going in. The ability to get overhead bin space ... has gotten a lot better with some of the upgrades that we\u2019ve done with larger overhead bins on the vast majority of our aircraft. We're going to finish up the rest of the fleet in the next couple years with the large overhead bins. So that won\u2019t be the issue, but that used to be a bit of that driver there."

      "Neville Bissember, a law professor at the University of Guyana, questioned the proposed tour, calling it a \u201cghoulish and bizarre\u201d idea in a recently published letter.",
      "\u201cWhat part of Guyana\u2019s nature and culture is represented in a place where death by mass suicide and other atrocities and human rights violations were perpetuated against a submissive group of American citizens, which had nothing to do with Guyana nor Guyanese?\u201d he wrote.",
      "Despite ongoing criticism, the tour has strong support from the government's Tourism Authority and Guyana\u2019s Tourism and Hospitality Association.",
      "Tourism Minister Oneidge Walrond told the AP the government is backing the effort at Jonestown but is aware \u201cof some level of push back\u201d from certain sectors of society.",
      "She said the government already has helped clear the area \u201cto ensure a better product can be marketed,\u201d adding that the tour might need Cabinet approval.",
      "\u201cIt certainly has my support,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is possible. After all, we have seen what Rwanda has done with that awful tragedy as an example.\u201d",
      "Rose Sewcharran, director of Wonderlust Adventures, the private tour operator who plans to take visitors to Jonestown, said she was buoyed by the support.",
      "\u201cWe think it is about time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis happens all over the world. We have multiple examples of dark, morbid tourism around the world, including Auschwitz and the Holocaust museum.\u201d",
      "The November 1978 mass suicide-murder was synonymous with Guyana for decades until huge amounts of oil and gas were discovered off the country\u2019s coast nearly a decade ago, making it one of the world\u2019s largest offshore oil producers.",
      "New roads, schools and hotels are being built across the capital, Georgetown, and beyond, and a country that rarely saw tourists is now hoping to attract more of them.",
      "An obvious attraction is Jonestown, argued Astill Paul, the co-pilot of a twin-engine plane that flew U.S. Rep. Leo J. Ryan of California and a U.S. news crew to a village near the commune a day before hundreds died on Nov. 18, 1978. He witnessed gunmen fatally shoot Ryan and four others as they tried to board the plane on Nov. 18 and fly back to the capital.",
      "Paul told the AP he believes the former commune should be developed as a heritage site.",
      "\u201cI sat on the tourism board years ago and did suggest we do this, but the minister at the time lashed the idea down because the government wanted nothing to do with morbid tourism,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Until recently, successive governments shunned Jonestown, arguing that the country\u2019s image was badly damaged by the mass murder-suicide, even though only a handful of Indigenous people died. The overwhelming majority of victims were Americans like Vilchez who flew to Guyana to follow Jones. Many endured beatings, forced labor, imprisonment and rehearsals for a mass suicide.",
      "Those in favor of a tour include Gerry Gouveia, a pilot who also flew when Jonestown was active.",
      "\u201cThe area should be reconstructed purely for tourists to get a first-hand understanding of its layout and what had happened,\" he said. \u201cWe should reconstruct the home of Jim Jones, the main pavilion and other buildings that were there.\u201d",
      "Today, all that is left is bits of a cassava mill, pieces of the main pavilion and a rusted tractor that once hauled a flatbed trailer to take temple members to the Port Kaituma airfield.",
      "Until now, most visitors to Jonestown have been reporters and family members of those who died.",
      "Organizing an expedition on one\u2019s own is daunting: the area is far from the capital and hard to access, and some consider the closest populated settlement dangerous.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a very, very, very rough area,\u201d said Fielding McGehee, co-director of The Jonestown Institute, a nonprofit group. \u201cI don\u2019t see how this is going to be an economically feasible kind of project because of the vast amounts of money it would take to turn it into a viable place to visit.\u201d",
      "McGehee warned about relying on supposed witnesses who will be part of the tour. He said the memories and stories that have trickled down through generations might not be accurate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a game of telephone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not help anyone understand what happened in Jonestown.\u201d",
      "He recalled how one survivor had proposed a personal project to develop the abandoned site, but those from the temple community said, \u2018Why do you want to do that?\u2019",
      "McGehee noted that dark tourism is popular, and that going to Jonestown means tourists could say they visited a place where more than 900 people died on the same day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the prurient interest in tragedy,\u201d he said.",
      "If the tour eventually starts operating, not everything will be visible to tourists.",
      "When Vilchez returned to Guyana in 2018 for the first time since the mass suicide-murder, she made an offering to the land when she arrived in Jonestown.",
      "Among the things she buried in the abandoned commune where her sisters and nephews died were snippets of hair from her mother and father, who did not go to Jonestown.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like a gesture that honored the people that died,\u201d she said.",

      "MALIBU, Calif. -- Cooler temperatures, calmer winds and a chance of rainfall in Southern California this week are forecast to help firefighters as they battle a wind-driven blaze in steep, rugged terrain that's driven thousands, including celebrities, from their homes in Malibu.",
      "The weather improved so much Wednesday that meteorologists said all red flag warnings, which indicate conditions for high fire danger and the notorious Santa Ana winds, were discontinued. The conditions allowed firefighters to have \u201ca lot of success\u201d despite the nearly inaccessible terrain, CalFire Assistant Chief Dusty Martin said.",
      "Still, some 20,000 residents remained under evacuation orders and warnings Wednesday evening from the blaze, dubbed the Franklin Fire, which was only 7% contained over 6 square miles (16 square kilometers).",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the blaze started. Officials said nine structures had been destroyed and at least six others had been damaged, though crews had only surveyed about 25% of the affected area, said Deputy Chief Albert Yanagisawa of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.",
      "Much of the devastation occurred in Malibu, a community of about 10,000 people on the western edge of Los Angeles known for its stunning bluffs and Zuma Beach, which features in many Hollywood films.",
      "Flames burned near horse farms, celebrities\u2019 seaside mansions, and Pepperdine University, where students were forced to shelter in place on campus for a second night Tuesday.",
      "Faculty members are determining how best to complete the semester, which ends at Pepperdine this week. Final exams were postponed or canceled, depending on the class, university spokesperson Michael Friel said. An early analysis showed little to no damage to structures on campus, the university said.",
      "Lonnie Vidaurri\u2019s four-bedroom home in the Malibu Knolls neighborhood is one of those destroyed. After evacuating to a hotel in Santa Monica with his wife and two young daughters, a neighbor called to tell Vidaurri that firefighters would need to break into his house.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty torched all around,\u201d Vidaurri said. He expects that the family\u2019s pet bunnies did not survive the fire, and that they lost most of their things. \u201cMy girls cried, obviously, but it could have been worse.\u201d",
      "Mimi Teller, a Red Cross spokesperson who worked in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, said many people arrived in their pajamas and were \u201cdefinitely in shock.\u201d",
      "\u201cNobody even had a backpack, it was, \u2018Get out now,\u2019\u201d Teller said. \u201cOne lady didn\u2019t even have a leash for her dog, she just scooped them up.\u201d",
      "Shawn Smith said he was asleep early Tuesday when someone knocked on his RV at 3 a.m. to wake him up to evacuate the Malibu RV Park.",
      "\u201cYou could see the fires rolling in, in over the canyon,\" he said. \u201cIt was like \u2018Holy crap, this is real.'\u201d",
      "He returned Wednesday to find that the RV park had been saved \u2014 firefighters stopped the flames just before they entered the area.",
      "\u201cWe got lucky,\u201d he said.",
      "Dick Van Dyke, one of many celebrities with homes in Malibu, said in a Facebook post that he and his wife, Arlene Silver, evacuated as the fire swept in. And Cher evacuated from her Malibu home when ordered and is staying at a hotel, her publicist, Liz Rosenberg, said Tuesday.",
      "The fire erupted shortly before 11 p.m. Monday and swiftly moved south, jumping over the famous Pacific Coast Highway and extending all the way to the ocean. It was propelled by Santa Ana winds, with gusts that reached 40 mph (64 kph). Santa Anas are notorious seasonal winds that blow dry air from the interior toward the coast, pushing back moist ocean breezes.",
      "Alec Gellis stayed behind Monday night to save his home in Malibu\u2019s Serra Retreat neighborhood from the flames. He used pumps in the home\u2019s swimming pool to help spray water over the house and surrounding vegetation, turning the lush area \u201cinto a rainforest.\u201d",
      "Gellis said there were flames within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the home on all sides. \u201cThe whole canyon was completely lit up.\u201d",
      "Utilities preemptively shut off power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses, starting Monday night, to mitigate the impacts of the Santa Ana winds, whose strong gusts can damage electrical equipment and spark wildfires.",
      "As of Wednesday afternoon, electricity was still out for roughly 600 Southern California Edison customers, and the majority of those were in Los Angeles County, said utility spokesperson Gabriela Ornelas.",
      "\u201cWe have been making significant progress,\u201d she said.",
      "Outages in Malibu were not included in that figure, Ornelas said. Some 3,300 customers in the Malibu area remained without power, due to safety shutoffs and for firefighter safety. Power was first shut off to most customers in Malibu on Monday evening.",
      "The Woolsey Fire that roared through the area in 2018, killing three people and destroying 1,600 homes, was sparked by Edison equipment. Asked Wednesday if Edison equipment was involved in the Franklin Fire, Ornelas referred all questions regarding the cause to fire officials.",

    "story": [
      "Oregon lawmakers are convening for a special session to discuss emergency wildfire funding after a record wildfire season in the state",
      "SALEM, Ore. -- Oregon lawmakers are convening Thursday for a special session to discuss emergency funding to pay out millions in unpaid bills stemming from the state\u2019s 2024 record wildfire season.",
      "As wildfires still rage in California, Oregon is among several states grappling with steep costs related to fighting wildfires this year. New Mexico lawmakers in a July special session approved millions in emergency aid for wildfire victims, and states including North Dakota and Wyoming have requested federal disaster declarations to help with recovery costs.",
      "Fighting the blazes that scorched a record 1.9 million acres (769,000 hectares), or nearly 2,970 square miles (7,692 square kilometers), largely in eastern Oregon, cost the state over $350 million, according to Gov. Tina Kotek. The sum has made it the most expensive wildfire season in state history, her office said.",
      "While over half of the costs will eventually be covered by the federal government, the state still needs to pay the bills while waiting to be reimbursed.",
      "\u201cThe unprecedented 2024 wildfire season required all of us to work together to protect life, land, and property, and that spirit of cooperation must continue in order to meet our fiscal responsibilities,\u201d Kotek said in a late November news release announcing the special session.",
      "Oregon wildfires this year destroyed at least 42 homes and burned large swaths of range and grazing land in the state\u2019s rural east. At one point, the Durkee Fire, which scorched roughly 460 square miles (1,200 square kilometers) near the Oregon-Idaho border, was the largest in the nation.",
      "Kotek declared a state of emergency in July in response to the threat of wildfire, and invoked the state\u2019s Emergency Conflagration Act a record 17 times during the season.",
      "For the special session, Kotek has asked lawmakers to approve $218 million for the Oregon Department of Forestry and the Oregon Department of the State Fire Marshal. The money would help the agencies continue operations and pay the contractors that helped to fight the blazes and provide resources.",
      "The special session comes ahead of the start of the next legislative session in January, when lawmakers will be tasked with finding more permanent revenue streams for wildfire costs that have ballooned with climate change worsening drought conditions across the U.S. West.",
      "In the upcoming legislative session, Kotek wants lawmakers to increase wildfire readiness and mitigation funding by $130 million in the state\u2019s two-year budget cycle going forward. She has also requested that $150 million be redirected from being deposited in the state\u2019s rainy day fund, on a one-time basis, to fire agencies to help them pay for wildfire suppression efforts.",
      "While Oregon\u2019s 2024 wildfire season was a record in terms of cost and acreage burned, that of 2020 remains historic for being among the worst natural disasters in Oregon\u2019s history. The 2020 Labor Day weekend fires killed nine people and destroyed upward of 5,000 homes and other structures."

      "Fewer grandparents were taking care of grandchildren, there was a decline in the number of preschoolers and more people were staying put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared to the last part of the 2010s",
      "Fewer grandparents were living with and taking care of grandchildren, there was a decline in young children going to preschool and more people stayed put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared to the last part of the 2010s, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released Thursday, reflecting some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the most comprehensive survey of American life compares the years of 2014-2018 and 2019-2023, timeframes before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the virus' spread. The American Community Survey data show how lives were changed and family relationships altered by the pandemic and other occurrences like the opioid crisis.",
      "The survey of 3.5 million households covers more than 40 topics, including ancestry, fertility, marital status, commutes, veterans status, disability and housing.",
      "The decrease in grandparents' taking care of their grandchildren is most likely the result of a decline in opioid-related deaths during the more recent timeframe since substance abuse is a leading reason that grandparents find themselves raising grandchildren. A reduction in the number of incarcerated women also likely played a role, said Susan Kelley, a professor emerita of nursing at Georgia State University.",
      "\u201cIt's very rarely for positive reasons that grandparents find themselves in this situation. Usually, it's a tragic situation in an adult child's life, either a death, incarceration or mental health issues which correlate with substance abuse,\" Kelly said. \"Many grandparents thrive in that role, but there are still socioeconomic and emotional burdens on the grandparents.\"",
      "A stronger economy in the most recent period also may be a reason that the number of grandparents living with their grandchildren declined from 7.2 million to 6.8 million by making it less likely that adult children with their own children were seeking housing help from their parents, she said.",
      "The decline in the number of young children enrolled in preschool stemmed from an unwillingness to send young children to school and the closure of many schools at the height of the pandemic, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "\u201cThese data show how the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on patterns of early childhood education,\u201d the bureau said in a separate report. \"Future research will show if this was the start of a long-term trend or if enrollment will bounce back to prior levels.\"",
      "Americans continued to get older, with the median age rising to 38.7 from 37.9 and the nation's share of senior citizens up from 16.8% from 15.2%. The share of households with a computer jumped to almost 95% from almost 89%, as did the share of households with a broadband connection to almost 90% from 80%.",
      "Additionally, fewer people moved and more people stayed put in the most recent time period compared to the earlier one, in many cases because of rising home values and the limited availability of homes to buy.",
      "Home values increased by 21.7% and the percentage of vacant homes dropped from 12.2% to 10.4%. The median home value jumped from $249,400 to $303,400 nationwide.",
      "In some vacation communities popular with the wealthy, the bump was even more dramatic, such as in the county that is home to Aspen, Colorado, where it went from $758,800 to $1.1 million, and in the county which is home to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where it jumped from $812,400 to $1.1 million.",

    "story": [
      "New Jersey is seeking to drastically reduce the amount of plastics and other packaging material that's tossed out once a package is opened",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- New Jersey is aiming to drastically reduce the amount of packaging material \u2014 particularly plastic \u2014 that is thrown away after the package is opened.",
      "From bubble wrap to puffy air-filled plastic pockets to those foam peanuts that seem to immediately spill all over the floor, lots of what keeps items safe during shipping often ends up in landfills, or in the environment as pollution.",
      "A bill to be discussed Thursday in the state Legislature would require all such materials used in the state to be recyclable or compostable by 2034. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says containers and packaging materials from shopping account for about 28% of municipal waste sent to landfills in the U.S.",
      "The New Jersey bill seeks to move away from plastics and imposes fees on manufacturers and distributors for a $120 million fund to bolster recycling and reduce solid waste.",
      "California, Colorado, Oregon, Maine, and Minnesota have already passed similar bills, according to the environmental group Beyond Plastics.",
      "New Jersey's bill as proposed would be the strongest in the nation, according to Doug O'Malley, director of Environment New Jersey.",
      "\u201cOur waterways are literally swimming in plastics,\" he said. \u201cWe can't recycle our way out of this crisis.\u201d",
      "Peter Blair, policy and advocacy director at the environmental group Just Zero, said the bill aims to shift financial responsibility for dealing with the \u201cend-of-life\u201d of plastic packaging from taxpayers, who pay to have it sent to landfills, to the producers of the material.",
      "Business groups oppose the legislation.",
      "Ray Cantor, an official with the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said businesses are constantly working to reduce the amount of packing materials they use, and to increase the amount of recyclables they utilize. He called the bill \u201cunrealistic\u201d and \u201cnot workable.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt totally ignores the 40 years of work and systems that has made New Jersey one of the most successful recycling states in the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt bans a host of chemicals without any scientific basis. And it would ban the advanced recycling of plastics, the most promising new technology to recycle materials that currently are thrown away.\u201d",
      "His organization defined advanced recycling as \u201cusing high temperatures and pressure, breaking down the chemicals in plastics and turning them back into their base chemicals, thus allowing them to be reused to make new plastics as if they were virgin materials.\u201d",
      "Brooke Helmick, policy director for the New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance, said advanced recycling can be \u201cvery, very dangerous.\u201d It can lead to the release of toxic chemicals, cause fires, create the risk of chemical leaks, and create large volumes of hazardous materials including benzene that are then incinerated, she said.",
      "The bill would require the state Department of Environmental Protection to study the state's recycling market and calculate the cost of upgrading it to handle the increased recycling of packaging materials.",
      "It would require that by 2032, the amount of single-use packaging products used in the state be reduced by 25%, at least 10% of which would have to come from shifting to reusable products or eliminating plastic components.",
      "By 2034, all packaging products used in the state would have to be compostable or recyclable, and by 2036, the recycling rate of packaging products in New Jersey would have to be at least 65%.",

    "story": [
      "A North Dakota panel will consider whether to approve permits for underground storage of carbon dioxide that a proposed pipeline would carry from ethanol plants throughout the Midwest",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- A North Dakota panel will consider Thursday whether to approve permits for underground storage of hundreds of millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide that a proposed pipeline would carry from ethanol plants throughout the Midwest.",
      "Approval from the governor-led, three-member Industrial Commission would be another victory for Summit Carbon Solutions' controversial project, though further court challenges are likely. Last month, the company gained approval for its North Dakota route, and Iowa regulators also have given conditional approval.",
      "Also on Thursday, Minnesota utility regulators were scheduled to consider approval for a 28-mile leg of the project of the project.",
      "Summit's 2,500-mile, $8 billion pipeline would transport planet-warming CO2 emissions from 57 ethanol plants in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota and Nebraska for underground storage in central North Dakota.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Doug Burgum chairs the Industrial Commission, which includes the state attorney general and agriculture commissioner and oversees a variety of energy topics and state-owned enterprises.",
      "Burgum is President-elect Donald Trump's choice for Interior Secretary and to lead a new National Energy Council. Burgum supports Summit's project and has frequently touted North Dakota's underground carbon dioxide storage as a \u201cgeologic jackpot.\u201d In 2021, he set a goal for the No. 3 oil-producing state to be carbon-neutral by 2030. His term ends Saturday.",
      "Summit applied for permits for three storage facilities, which would hold a combined, estimated maximum of 352 million metric tons of CO2 over 20 years. The pipeline would carry up to 18 million metric tons of CO2 per year to be injected about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) underground, according to an application fact sheet.",
      "Summit's documents detail a well site layout encompassing a pump/meter building, gas detection stations, inlet valves and emergency shutoff valve.",
      "Carbon dioxide would move through the pipeline in a pressurized form to be injected deep underground into a rock formation.",
      "Jessie Stolark, who leads a group that includes Summit and supports the project, said the oil industry has long used similar technology.",
      "\u201cWe know that this can be done safely in a manner that is protective of human health and underground sources of drinking water,\u201d said Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition.",
      "Summit's project has drawn the ire of landowners around the region. They oppose the potential taking of their property for the pipeline and fear a pipe rupture releasing a cloud of heavy, hazardous gas over the land.",
      "A North Dakota landowners group is challenging a property rights law related to the underground storage, and attorney Derrick Braaten said they likely would challenge the granting of permits for the storage plans.",
      "\u201cThe landowners that I'm working with aren't necessarily opposed to carbon sequestration itself,\u201d Braaten said. \u201cThey're opposed to the idea that a private company can come in and use their property without having to negotiate with them or pay them just compensation for taking their private property and using it.\u201d",
      "Carbon capture projects such as Summit's are eligible for lucrative federal tax credits intended to encourage cleaner-burning ethanol and potentially result in corn-based ethanol being refined into jet fuel.",
      "Some opponents argue the amount of greenhouse gases sequestered through the process would make little difference and could lead farmers to grow more corn despite environmental concerns about the crop.",
      "In Minnesota, utility regulators were expected to decide Thursday whether to grant a route permit for a small part of the overall project, a 28-mile (45-kilometer) segment that would connect an ethanol plant in Fergus Falls to Summit\u2019s broader network.",
      "An administrative law judge who conducted hearings recommended in November that the Public Utilities Commission grant the permit, saying the panel lacks the legal authority to reject it. The judge concluded that the environmental impacts from the Minnesota segment would be minimal, that the environmental review met the legal requirements, and noted that Summit has secured agreements from landowners along most of the recommended route. Commission staff, the state Department of Commerce and Summit largely concurred with those findings.",
      "Environmental groups that oppose the project dispute the judge\u2019s finding that the project would have a net benefit for the environment.",
      "In addition to North Dakota, Summit has a permit from Iowa for its route, but regulators for that state required the company to obtain approvals for routes in the Dakotas and underground storage in North Dakota before it can begin construction. The Iowa Utilities Commission's approval sparked lawsuits related to the project.",
      "Last year, South Dakota regulators rejected Summit's application. The company submitted another permit application last month.",
      "In Nebraska, where there is no state regulatory process for CO2 pipelines, Summit is working with individual counties to advance its project. At least one county has denied a permit.",

It will do nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or impact climate change.\"",

      "The burning of fossil fuels including oil, gas and coal is a major contributor to climate change.",
      "The proposal would impose as yet unspecified charges on fossil fuel producers that would go to the state Department of Environmental Protection, which would distribute the money as grants to pay for programs to adapt to climate change and make the state more resilient to severe weather.",
      "The state would take two years to assess damages to New Jersey that have resulted from greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels since 1995, and would establish \u201cthat each responsible party is strictly liable\u201d for those damages.",

      "Kaja Veilleux has been hunting New England attic treasures for more than 50 years",
      "THOMASTON, Maine -- Kaja Veilleux has been hunting New England attic treasures for more than 50 years. He once found a copy of the Declaration of Independence sitting on a pile of trash, and he made headlines this year when he stumbled upon a million-dollar portrait gathering dust in an old farmhouse in Maine that may have been painted by the Dutch master Rembrandt.",
      "Then there was the time, Veilleux said, he was shown a $50,000 gold coin kicking around in a tool drawer \u2014 only to have the well-meaning owner destroy much of its value before he could auction it by using a scouring pad to clean it \u2014 and scratch it.",
      "\u201cIt's like a treasure hunt every day,\" Veilleux said with a chuckle.",
      "Many people dream of cashing in on some dusty, old heirloom. In October, three sisters from Ohio sold a rare dime for more than half-a-million dollars. Two years ago, a case of old hockey cards found in a Canadian home sold for more than $3.7 million.",
      "Veilleux, 73, helps people sort gems from junk when he appraises furniture, antiques and art by using his knowledge of what similar items have sold for in the past. But art auctions can be fickle. Who could have guessed a banana duct-taped to a wall could sell for more than $6 million?",
      "Veilleux started collecting coins at age 8 and soon found he had a good memory for visual objects. His training for a career in antique dealing has all been on the job, he said, including a lesson he learned early when he spent most of the money he had at the time on bidding for a beautiful miniature painting.",
      "When he got home from the auction and looked at the artwork under a magnifying glass, he realized it was a print, with dabs of paint added to make it look genuine.",
      "\u201cI paid $350 for a $35 object, which always taught me to look at things very carefully,\u201d Veilleux said.",
      "In the late 1990s, he was at a house call in South Freeport, Maine. It was a hoarder's house, he said, where piles of trash were awaiting their trip to an already-full dumpster. Atop one pile, Veilleux spotted what was later confirmed to be a 1776 copy of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "He auctioned it for $99,000 but the state of Maine sued to take possession of the document, and won. That meant both the buyer and seller ended up missing out.",
      "This year's artwork find was his most valuable yet. Veilleux said he and an assistant were on a house call in Camden, Maine.",
      "\u201cWe start going through the house and there were rare little things and big things everywhere,\u201d Veilleux said. \u201cFinally, we are on the third floor near the attic, and we find a stack of paintings, and in it is this beautiful portrait of a young woman by Rembrandt.\u201d",
      "The painting of a teenage girl in a black dress with a white ruffled collar was sold as \u201cafter Rembrandt,\u201d meaning it was in the style of the 17th Century master but wasn't proven to be by him. The artwork sold for $1.4 million, including auction fees, indicating the buyer was willing to take a significant gamble the painting was a Rembrandt \u2014 although it would have likely sold for many times that price with a proven provenance.",
      "Each Tuesday, people bring in their heirlooms and collector\u2019s items to Veilleux's office in Thomaston, Maine, to see what they might fetch at auction. The appraisal is free but Veilleux gets a commission if they end up selling the pieces at his Thomaston Place Auction Galleries.",
      "Erika Taylor stopped by on a recent Tuesday with two artworks her father had collected in China in the 1940s, when he was living there after escaping from Nazi Germany. One depicted a blooming peony and the other a grasshopper.",
      "She said Veilleux had given her an initial estimate of up to $30,000 for each of the artworks, based on the photographs she'd shown him. But she was in for bad news.",
      "When Veilleux inspected the artworks closely, he declared they were prints, because paint would have permeated the paper.",
      "\u201cIt's disappointing,\" Taylor said. \u201cBut he has a lot of experience.\u201d",
      "Still, Taylor wasn't totally convinced and said she might seek a second opinion.",
      "Another seller, Jean Koenig, got better news. She brought in a large aquamarine ring. She said her father found the gem in a Brazilian mine and her grandmother had fashioned it into a ring, adding rubies and diamonds.",
      "Koenig ended up agreeing to auction the ring, with an estimated sales price of between $10,000 and $15,000. She plans to split the proceeds with her seven siblings.",
      "\u201cIt's just been sitting in a box for years,\" she said. \u201cWe decided it was time.\u201d"

      "The Biden administration has announced it is raising tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect U.S. clean energy businesses",
      "BANGKOK -- The Biden administration plans to raise tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect U.S. clean energy businesses.",
      "The notice from the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office said tariffs on Chinese-made solar wafers and polysilicon will rise to 50% from 25% and duties on certain tungsten products will increase from zero to 25%, effective on Jan. 1, following a review of Chinese trade practices under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act.",
      "The decision followed a public comment period after the USTR said in September that it was considering such actions.",
      "\u201cThe tariff increases announced today will further blunt the harmful policies and practices by the People\u2019s Republic of China,\" USTR Katharine Tai said in a statement. \"These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains.\u201d",
      "Reports Thursday said U.S. and Chinese officials were meeting this week and next for trade talks ahead of the year's end.",
      "Last week, Washington tightened restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology. Beijing responded by banning exports to the U.S. of certain critical minerals needed to make computer chips, such as gallium, germanium and antimony. It also stepped up its controls on graphite exports to the U.S.",
      "China provides a very large share of most of those materials and the United States has been working to secure alternative sources in Africa and other parts of the world.",
      "Tungsten is another strategically vital metal whose production is dominated by China. The U.S. does not produce it, but South Korea is a potential big supplier. It's used to make armaments and is also used in x-ray tubes and light bulb filaments, among other industrial applications. U.S. imports of the metal from China fell to $10.9 million in 2023 from $19.5 million the year before.",
      "After Beijing announced its ban on exporting gallium and the other materials to the United States, analysts said tungsten was another likely area where China might strike back.",
      "Trade frictions have been escalating ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods, among other threats. President Joe Biden has said Trump\u2019s promise of broad tariffs on foreign imports would be a mistake.",
      "His administration has kept in place tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term in office, but says it has a more targeted approach.",
      "China has sharply ramped up production of cheap electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries at a time when the Biden administration has championed moves to support those industries in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. and other trading partners say China improperly subsidizes exports, giving exporters of solar panels and other products an unfair advantage in overseas markets, where its manufacturers charge lower prices thanks to government support. Washington also says China improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.",
      "China accounts for more than 80% of the market for solar panels at all stages of production, according to the International Energy Agency, more than double domestic demand for those products. Its huge economies of scale have made solar power more affordable, but also concentrated the supply chain inside China. The IEA has urged other countries to assess their solar panel supply chains and develop strategies to address any risks.",
      "In early 2018, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. Beijing filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization charging that the U.S. was unfairly supporting electric vehicle purchases.",
      "The investigation that led the USTR to raise the tariffs on solar panels concluded with a report in May that has prompted increases in tariffs on a range of products including electric vehicles, syringes and needles, medical gloves and facemasks, semiconductors and steel and aluminum products, among others.",
      "It has pushed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles up to 100% from 25%, raised tariffs on Chinese-made lithium batteries to 25% from 7.5%."

      "He said Lake will \u201censure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.\u201d",
      "The president-elect has in the past been a fierce critic of Voice of America, including saying in 2020 that \u201cthings they say are disgusting toward our country.\u201d",
      "The broadcaster drew additional criticism during Trump\u2019s first term for its coverage of the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, with a White House publication, the \"1600 Daily\u201d email summary of news and events, accusing it of using taxpayer money \u201cto speak for authoritarian regimes.\u201d That was after VOA covered the lifting of lockdowns in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus first emerged.",
      "VOA was founded during World War II, and its congressional charter requires it to present independent news and information to international audiences. It responded to Trump\u2019s criticism by defending its coverage.",
      "Upon taking office in January 2021, President Joe Biden\u2019s administration swiftly removed a number of senior officials aligned with Trump from VOA and positions affiliated with it.",
      "Lake endeared herself to Trump through her dogmatic commitment to the falsehood that both she and Trump were the victims of election fraud. She has never acknowledged losing the gubernatorial race and called herself the \u201clawful governor\u201d in her 2023 book, \u201cUnafraid: Just Getting Started.\u201d",

      "Trump nonetheless considered her for his vice presidential running mate before deciding on JD Vance.",
      "Also Wednesday, Trump announced Leandro Rizzuto as his choice to be the U.S. ambassador to the Washington-based Organization of American States, and said he wanted Florida personal injury attorney Dan Newlin to be his administration's ambassador to Colombia.",

      "Allen and Soon-Yi Previn \u201csimply decided that a military professional who wanted to be paid fairly was not a good fit to work in the Allen home,\u201d private chef Hermie Fajardo said in a civil complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "Allen and Previn knew Fajardo would need time off for military training exercises when they and their home manager hired him as their full-time chef in June 2024 at an annual salary of $85,000, the complaint said. But he was fired the following month, soon after returning from a training that lasted a day longer than expected, it said.",
      "When Fajardo returned to work, \u201che was immediately met with instant hostility and obvious resentment by defendants,\u201d according to the lengthy complaint.",
      "At the time, Fajardo had been raising concerns about his pay \u2014 first that his employers weren't properly withholding taxes or providing a paystub, then that they shortchanged him by $300, according to the complaint.",
      "Allen, Previn and manager Pamela Steigmeyer are accused in the lawsuit of violating the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act and New York labor law, as well as causing Fajardo humiliation, stress and a loss of earnings.",
      "Representatives for Allen did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Fajardo said he was hired after being showered with compliments following a meal of roasted chicken, pasta, chocolate cake and apple pie he prepared for the defendants and two guests. According to the complaint, it was only after Previn fired him and he hired a lawyer that he was told his cooking was not up to par, a claim Fajardo said was untrue."

      "Two men have been freed after their convictions were overturned in a 2009 double homicide whose investigation was overseen by a discredited Kansas City, Kansas, police detective",
      "KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- Two men were freed Wednesday after their convictions were overturned in a 2009 double homicide whose investigation was overseen by a discredited white Kansas City, Kansas, police detective.",
      "Forty-year-old Dominique Moore said he was \u201cthankful and blessed\u201d after his release from a state prison in El Dorado. And cheers from a crowd of relatives greeted Cedric Warren, 34, as he walked out of jail in the county where he was convicted nearly 15 years ago in the drug house shooting that killed Charles Ford and Larry Ledoux.",
      "The men's life sentences had carried no chance of parole for 25 years.",
      "\u201cI really want to cry, but I can\u2019t. That\u2019s how overwhelmed I am,\" Warren's father, Cedric Toney, said after a vehicle carrying his son pulled away from the jail. Warren himself was too overcome to talk to a throng of reporters who awaited his release.",
      "Toney alleged misconduct from Roger Golubski, who died last week in an apparent suicide just before the start of his criminal trial over allegations that he sexually assaulted Black women.",
      "But that had nothing to do with Wyandotte County Judge Aaron Roberts\u2019 decision to toss Warren\u2019s convictions on Monday and Moore\u2019s on Wednesday. Roberts found that prosecutors failed to turn over information about the severe mental health issues of a key witness. The witness had schizophrenia, and offered a shifting account of what happened, the defense wrote in court filings.",
      "Not aired in court was Toney's claim that before Golubski supervised the investigation that led to his son\u2019s arrest, the former detective stalked Toney's daughter and his son\u2019s mother. He said he suspected his son\u2019s first stop would be their graves; both died while he was incarcerated.",
      "The allegation of misconduct is similar to one raised in the case of Lamonte McIntyre, who served 23 years behind bars for a double homicide before he was freed. McIntyre\u2019s mother has said Golubski pressured her for sexual favors.",
      "Wyandotte County District Attorney Mark Dupree could have retried Warren and Moore but announced Wednesday that he wouldn't, paving the way for their release.",
      "He said Golubski\u2019s involvement had nothing to do with the decision and said it wasn't an exoneration. Instead, he said another trial wouldn't be \u201cjust or fair\u201d because a wrong was done by his predecessors who withheld the key evidence.",
      "Since taking office in 2017, Dupree said his office has increased training on fairness and is nearly done digitizing thousands of old cases. That is a key step in a $1.7 million effort to look for potential misconduct in the cases involving Golubski and others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about getting the conviction. It\u2019s about getting a just outcome and doing what is right,\u201d Dupree said.",
      "Brittany Robinson, Warren\u2019s cousin, said the family always maintained hope, convinced he was innocent.",
      "\u201cOn his momma\u2019s death bed she said, \u2018Don\u2019t quit fighting until my baby come home,'\" Robinson said, calling Golubski corrupt. She added: \u201cI feel sorry for all the families that fell victim to him. Hopefully they will get their day to celebrate just like us.\u201d",
      "Moore, too, said he was innocent as he drove home from prison with his attorneys, eagerly awaiting barbecue after 15 years of prison food.",
      "\u201cI am just thankful that the court has seen the wrong that has happened in my case,\" he said.",
      "Prosecutors say that, for years, Golubski preyed on female residents in poor neighborhoods, demanding sexual favors and sometimes threatening to harm or jail their relatives if they refused.",
      "In addition to two sets of federal charges, one lawsuit involving McIntyre and his mother has been settled, and two other lawsuits are pending.",
      "One of Warren's attorneys, Cheryl Pilate, said she and other attorneys continue looking into cases Golubski worked.",
      "\u201cIt is absolutely not the last one,\" she said of Warren and Moore's case. \"Roger Golubski was a very powerful figure who was involved in more cases than I can even court.\u201d"

      "Leach, whose death was confirmed by an Iowa City funeral home, represented Iowa as a moderate Republican until 2006, when he was defeated by Democrat Dave Loebsack in a midterm cycle that gave Democrats control of the U.S. House.",
      "He was chair of the banking and foreign relations committees, and in 2002 he was among six Republicans, who then held the House majority, to vote against a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq. The measure paved the way for the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, which Leach also opposed.",
      "After leaving Congress, Leach endorsed then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, for president in 2008 over his party\u2019s nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain, in part for Obama\u2019s opposition to the 2003 invasion \u2014 a decision he said wasn\u2019t easy.",
      "\u201cPart of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment,\u201d Leach told The Associated Press in an interview at the time.",
      "Earlier this year, Leach joined with Loebsack to pen a Jan. 6 op-ed in The Des Moines Register, three years after former President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden\u2019s victory.",
      "\u201cThis anniversary of the violent insurrection on our nation\u2019s Capitol is a solemn reminder of how fragile the foundations of democracy are when extremists like Donald Trump are willing to undermine millions of voters and encourage a deadly mob all in the name of wielding power,\u201d Leach and Loebsack wrote.",
      "Loebsack told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he even voted for Leach before running against him, despite their difference in political party.",
      "\u201cJim served our district and state honorably for 30 years. He was a man of principle and integrity and honor,\u201d Loebsack said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna miss him. There\u2019s no question.\u201d",
      "Leach worked as a professor for Princeton, his alma mater, and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard before Obama tapped him to lead the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2009. He resigned from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2013 and he joined the University of Iowa faculty.",
      "University Vice President Peter Matthes said in a statement Wednesday that Leach was a \u201crelentless advocate\u201d for Iowa. The university's statement also said Leach donated his public and private papers to their libraries.",

      "The text messages were disclosed as part of an ongoing lawsuit filed by Joy Banner, who along with her sister, Jo Banner, successfully led efforts to halt the $800 million grain terminal earlier this year. It would have been built within 300 feet (91 meters) of their property and close to historic sites in the predominantly Black community where they grew up.",
      "The legal dispute is part of a broader clash playing out in courts and public hearings, pitting officials eager to greenlight economic development against grassroots community groups challenging polluting industrial expansion in the heavily industrialized 85-mile industrial corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans often referred to by environmental activists as \u201cCancer Alley.\u201d",

      "At the November 2023 meeting, Banner attempted to highlight Hotard's alleged conflict of interest in approving a zoning change to enable the grain export facility's construction. Banner had also recently filed a complaint to the Louisiana Board of Ethics against Hotard pointing out that her mother-in-law allegedly would benefit financially because she owned and managed a marine transport company that had land \u201cnear and within\u201d the area being rezoned.",

Hotard also said in her August deposition that she had \u201cno idea\u201d about her mother-in-law's company's land despite text messages showing Hotard and her mother-in-law had discussed this property less than three weeks before Hotard's deposition.",

    "story": [
      "North Carolina House Republicans have enacted legislation that erodes some powers of several statewide offices newly-elected Democrats are slated to hold next month",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina lawmakers on Wednesday enacted a law over the governor's veto that would diminish the powers afforded to his successor and other other Democratic statewide winners in the Nov. 5 elections.",
      "In a 72-46 vote, the Republican-dominated House overrode Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's veto a week after the GOP-controlled Senate voted to do the same.",
      "Like during the Senate vote, opponents to the power-shifting bill sat in the gallery and disrupted the chambers' floor proceedings. More than 150 people gathered on the third floor \u2014 more than the House gallery could seat. They chanted \u201cshame\u201d as the override vote completed and continued to yell as they were escorted out.",
      "After warning disruptors they would face arrest if they didn't quiet down and leave the building, General Assembly police arrested one woman who refused to leave, said police Chief Martin Brock, adding that she would face charges of trespassing, resisting arrest and violating building rules.",
      "Many provisions within the 132-page law seek to diminish powers afforded to Gov.-elect Josh Stein, incoming attorney general Jeff Jackson, the next Democratic lieutenant governor and the schools superintendent. They all take office early next month. One of the most significant changes shifts the power to appoint State Board of Elections members from the governor to the state auditor, who will be a Republican next year.",
      "For decades, the governor has selected its five members, with the governor\u2019s party usually taking three seats. The enacted law transfers that power to the state auditor starting in spring. This, in turn, means Republicans will likely hold majorities on the state board and the county election boards.",
      "The legislation also weakens the governor\u2019s authority to fill vacancies on the state Court of Appeals and Supreme Court and prevents the attorney general from taking legal positions contrary to the General Assembly in litigation challenging a law\u2019s validity. Several post-election deadlines will move up under the law after Republican complaints that counties took too long to count provisional and absentee ballots, especially in light of an extremely close Supreme Court race.",
      "The veto override took place in the final days of a lame-duck General Assembly session where Republicans hold exactly the number of seats necessary to override vetoes without help from Democrats.",
      "That won\u2019t be the case much longer \u2014 barring a successful election protest that would flip a race\u2019s result \u2014 after Democrats picked up one more House seat in the general elections.",
      "Despite ultimately succeeding in their override, House Republicans had some difficulty staying unified. Some GOP lawmakers from western North Carolina \u2014 where Hurricane Helene caused historic flooding \u2014 initially voted against the measure last month. But all three \u2014 Reps. Mike Clampitt, Karl Gillespie and Mark Pless \u2014 ended up voting to override the veto.",
      "Part of the criticism levied against the bill centered on the $252 million of Helene recovery funds attached to it, most of which can\u2019t be spent until the General Assembly acts again.",
      "In his veto message, Cooper called the bill a sham in which Republicans used Helene and \u201cdisaster relief\u201d in its title to mask unconstitutional political power grabs \u2014 a message repeated by House Democrats and Stein.",
      "\u201cIt is despicable for the Republicans in the General Assembly to use folks\u2019 incredible need for aid to cloak their political pettiness,\u201d Stein said in a statement after Wednesday's vote.",
      "Other opponents to the bill said at a Wednesday news conference that GOP lawmakers weren\u2019t serving western North Carolinians and instead were undermining democracy.",
      "\u201cWestern North Carolina is not a toy to be played with. It is not an opportunity to exploit. It is not a place to be so violently disrespected,\u201d said Sam Stites, a Transylvania County staff member from advocacy group Just Economics of Western North Carolina.",
      "Republicans point out they had already allocated more than $900 million to Helene relief since October, with plans for more funding next session. Caldwell County Republican Rep. Destin Hall, who is expected to be the House speaker next year, further defended the bill's executive power shifts as the legislature's constitutional right.",
      "\u201cThis body is entirely committed to helping folks in this state with storm relief,\u201d Hall said. \u201cSo, in my opinion, what's happened is political football has been made out of this bill.\u201d",
      "It's likely the new law will soon be mired in litigation \u2014 just like eight years ago, after Republicans passed laws weakening Cooper\u2019s powers just before he took office.",
      "\u201cOf course it's going to go to court,\u201d outgoing House Speaker Tim Moore, a congressman-elect, told reporters after the vote. \u201cThat's just the way it is.\u201d",
      "The House also secured for the November 2026 statewide ballot a proposed constitutional amendment to require all North Carolina voters show photo identification before voting. The constitution currently only specifies that it\u2019s required for in-person voting. ID exceptions are afforded now and would continue with the amendment, and laws separate from the state constitution already direct voters to provide a photo ID copy when voting by mail."

Underfunding has \u201cimpacted not only contractual obligations but also critical operational capacities that directly affect public safety and community trust.\"",
      "Board of Commissioners Chairman Robb Pitts released a statement in August saying that funding for the sheriff\u2019s office and jail increased 66% since 2019, but the sheriff \u201chas consistently failed to demonstrate basic budget management practices.\"",
      "Pitts said the sheriff's office signed the contract with Strategic Security Corp. to provide staffing for watchtowers in the jail without involving the county purchasing department. He said the commissioners allocated $1.3 million for 2024 based on the contract usage and with input from the sheriff's office.",
      "The office waited until August to tell county management that it had already spent more than $1 million over the budgeted amount, Pitts said.",
      "The commission passed an ordinance in July asking Labat and other constitutional officers to use the county purchasing department's procurement process when entering new contracts. Labat said he plans to sue the Board of Commissioners, which he says has gone overboard in managing how he spends money."

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 07:41:28 GMT",
    "summary": "Energy firms will be forced to offer the new tariffs under a proposed shake-up of bills by the regulator.",
    "story": [
      "Energy firms will be forced to offer customers tariffs with no standing charges, under a proposed shake-up of bills by regulator Ofgem.",
      "All households pay the fixed daily charges covering the costs of connecting to a supply, but there have been widespread calls for these fees to be scrapped.",
      "Ofgem is proposing suppliers offer one price-capped tariff that includes the standing charge, and another that loads these costs on energy usage charges instead. Customers could choose which suits them best.",
      "The planned overhaul, for next winter, also raises the possibility of some unpaid bills that built up during a recent high-price crisis to be written off.",
      "Standing charge anger",
      "When Ofgem asked for the public's views on standing charges it received an unprecedented response of 30,000 submissions.",
      "The majority were against standing charges - fixed fees, typically totalling more than \u00a3300 a year, that are paid irrespective of how much energy households use.",
      "Under Ofgem's price cap, standing charges have risen by 43% since 2019.",
      "Those with low energy usage, such as people who live alone, argued that even if they further reduced how much gas and electricity they used, they saw little difference in their bills. They wanted more control over their bills.",
      "However, those with high energy needs could see a big rise in bills were these charges to instead be included in the price of each unit of energy used. It would mean higher bills for people with disabilities who have to charge up specialist equipment.",
      "\"We hear from people who've turned off their heating, ration their hot water, and avoid charging essential mobility devices, yet still feel like they're fighting a losing battle with their energy bills,\" said Alex Belsham-Harris, from Citizens Advice.",
      "Ofgem's proposed solution is to tell energy firms to make a dual pricing offer - one with, and one without, a standing charge. Both would fall under the existing price cap system.",
      "Such tariffs already exist, but only from a handful of suppliers and are not available to everyone.",
      "Customers would need to make a choice, but some campaigners want those with low energy use to automatically move onto a standing charge-free deal.",
      "\"The problem with presenting a choice of price caps is many vulnerable people won't make that choice,\" said Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert.",
      "One of those who could benefit would be Joanne Wilkinson.",
      "\"I try not to look [at the standing charges] because it's depressing,\" she said.",
      "She said she had enough to worry about dealing with baby daughter Adeline, but noticed how quickly the meter goes through the money that was loaded onto it.",
      "Lower wages in the north of England made it even harder for parents like her to afford energy bills, she said, especially as she was still on maternity leave.",
      "But Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said that such a fundamental proposed change needed careful consideration.",
      "\"It would be a major undertaking to make all customers aware of this change and to ensure they then choose the best option for their circumstances,\" said the trade body's chief executive, Dhara Vyas.",
      "She told the BBC the addition of a zero standing charge price cap option would \"quite significantly change the nature of the price cap\".",
      "\"It would go from being one single regulated price that gives customers protection whether or not they switch, to a situation where I think customers might be expected to make an active choice about which cap they are on.\"",
      "\"That changes what the price cap is there to do - it's there to protect people who chose not to engage in the market.\"",
      "Tim Jarvis, director general of markets at Ofgem, said the regulator's proposals would ensure customers \"have a choice\".",
      "Asked whether standing charges should be scrapped altogether, he told the BBC the option had been looked at, but added the costs \"need to appear in bills somewhere\".",
      "\"We have looked at a default of just moving the costs of the standing charge into unit rates, the reason we are not going down that route is that we think that can have some quite bad effects on people in some of the most vulnerable situations.\"",
      "The regulator's proposals do not deal with the variation of standing charges in different parts of the UK, with billpayers in some areas paying considerably more. Ofgem intends to make that part of a wider, separate inquiry.",
      "Debt repayment plan",
      "The amount of money owed to suppliers by customers has nearly doubled in two years, now totalling about \u00a33.8bn.",
      "The regulator is also setting out a plan for next winter that would deal with some of this debt, built up during a period of high prices, that has little chance of being repaid.",
      "It is planning a \"debt guarantee\" to improve the standard of service offered by suppliers supporting customers in debt, which it said would give households \"consistent, compassionate and tailored support\".",
      "Suppliers could also be required to accept debt repayment offers from reputable third parties such as debt advice agencies or consumer organisations.",
      "One option for energy crisis arrears could be debt-matching - that would see customers repay some of the debt, with energy firms writing off an equal amount.",
      "Some of these costs are already covered in an allowance, but could fall on all customers to finance through higher bills."

    "story": [
      "Australia's government says it will create new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news.",
      "The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms.",
      "Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers.",
      "The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; \u00a3125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes.",
      "The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok.",
      "In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was \"charging one industry to subsidise another\".",
      "Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers.",
      "\"Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,\" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday.",
      "The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content.",
      "That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms.",
      "As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers.",
      "Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere.",
      "\"We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content\u2026 news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,\" it said in a statement in February.",
      "The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as \"a fundamental dereliction\" of Meta's \"responsibility to its Australian users\".",
      "\"The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,\" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time.",
      "The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.",
      "The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue."

      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",

      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",

      "However, the rate at which rents are rising is now the slowest for three years, the property portal has said, as potential tenants face limits on what they can afford.",
      "But average earnings in the past three years have not kept pace with the steep rise in rents.",
      "Renters have faced a \"red-hot\" market in recent years, with a host of prospective tenants chasing each available property, and rents surging on the back of the high demand. Demand is nearly a third higher than before the pandemic.",

      "In towns and cities, average rents are rising fastest in Rochdale (up 11.9% in a year) and Blackburn (up 10%), and Birkenhead (up 9%). Zoopla said renters were seeking areas in and around major cities.",

      "The property portal has forecast rents rising at an average rate of 4% next year, with demand still outstripping supply.",
      "The increase would come, in part, as a result of fewer properties being made available by landlords.",

      "Businesses - including charities - currently pay a rate of 13.8% National Insurance on employees' earnings above \u00a39,100 a year. But that will increase to 15% in April 2025, instead starting when wages reach \u00a35,000.",
      "Mencap says the rise will cost it \u00a35.3m every year.",
      "The government also announced an increase to the national minimum wage during the Budget - with hourly rates for over-21s set to go up to \u00a312.21 an hour. That will cost the charity a further \u00a36.7m, it says.",
      "Combined with having to increase wages for other workers as a result of the minimum wage rise, the charity estimates the changes will cost up to \u00a318m a year.",

      "October's Budget increased the national minimum wage (NMW) - a move that was expected and welcomed by those running care services in a sector where it is hard to recruit.",
      "However, care organisations say the changes to National Insurance contributions (NICs) will have a big impact - particularly on social care, where many people work part-time and were previously below the threshold to pay the tax.",

      "Similar worries are widespread across adult social care services. A new report, commissioned by care associations and written by health and care analysts LaingBuisson, says 80-85% of social care in England is provided by small, local organisations, which have little financial resilience.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 17:00:17 GMT",
    "summary": "A substantial Severn Trent Water investment is based on IOU notes - BBC Panorama finds.",
    "story": [
      "One of England's top-rated water companies is using an accounting trick to artificially inflate its balance sheet by more than a billion pounds, BBC Panorama has discovered.",
      "Severn Trent Water claims that an investment is worth \u00a31.68bn in its accounts, when in reality it has no value to the overall business.",
      "The made-up money makes the company appear more financially robust and helps to support its bumper payouts to shareholders.",
      "Severn Trent denies the accounts are misleading and says Panorama's allegations are \"completely inaccurate\".",
      "The water company - which is regulated by Ofwat - is part of a complex web of companies in the wider Severn Trent plc group.",
      "It serves more than eight million people across central England and mid-Wales and has been awarded the Environment Agency's top four-star rating for environmental performance for a record five consecutive years. Its ultimate parent company, Severn Trent plc, is popular with investors, as it has consistently paid large dividends to shareholders.",
      "But some of Severn Trent's customers are unhappy. The Shrewsbury-based campaign group Up Sewage Creek wants more of the company's earnings to be used to combat pollution in local rivers. \"They've not updated the infrastructure, they've used our money to enrich themselves and enrich their shareholders,\" one of the campaigners told us.",
      "The complex accounting trick started in March 2017 when a shell company, with no money or assets, called Severn Trent Trimpley was set up as part of the group. Another Severn Trent company called Severn Trent Draycote - which owns the water company - agreed to buy Trimpley for \u00a32.",
      "Trimpley then issued additional shares and Draycote bought them for a staggering \u00a33bn.",
      "No money actually changed hands, however, as Draycote paid Trimpley with a \u00a33bn loan note - effectively an IOU. But, on paper, Trimpley immediately appeared to be worth \u00a33bn because it had the IOU.",
      "Severn Trent Water then acquired 49% of Trimpley - and that investment was valued in the water company's accounts at \u00a31.47bn. A hugely valuable asset appears to have been created for Severn Trent Water out of thin air.",
      "Panorama discovered the Trimpley investment through the work of retired auditor Stanley Root.",
      "He told the programme: \"This is as near to an unreal transaction as you can get - that has just been made up and put into the accounts to make the accounts look better.",
      "\"I think it misleads the reader to think that the net assets of Severn Trent Water Limited are higher than they are and that the company is in a much healthier position than it really is. So I think the balance sheet, the financial statements, are misleading.\"",
      "Since 2017, the made-up money on Severn Trent Water's books has grown in value because of interest payments.",
      "Draycote has agreed to pay Trimpley interest on the \u00a33bn IOU, which means the IOU gets bigger each year.",
      "As the value of the IOU goes up, so does the paper value of Trimpley. And that means Severn Trent Water's investment in Trimpley rises every year too.",
      "The Trimpley investment is now valued at \u00a31.68bn in the regulated water company's 2023/24 accounts.",
      "Those accounts were audited and signed off by Severn Trent Water's directors. When referring to the Trimpley investment, the accounts say: \"In the opinion of the directors the fair value of the company's investments are not less than the amount at which they are stated in the balance sheet.\"",
      "While that may be technically correct, the \u00a31.68bn value is based on an IOU that is ultimately backed up by Severn Trent Water itself.",
      "In the wider group accounts the made-up money is cancelled out by the IOU that Draycote issued, so it is only the balance sheet of the regulated water company, Severn Trent Water, that is inflated.",
      "So why do it? Severn Trent told the BBC that Trimpley was set up to allow the water company to legitimately account for future earnings, but that it has never been used for that purpose.",
      "Another possible explanation is that Trimpley helps support increased dividends.",
      "As well as bolstering the balance sheet, the made-up \u00a31.68bn has also been added to Severn Trent Water's retained earnings - that is the pot of money from which cash can be paid out to shareholders. The more money there is in that pot, the easier it is to justify large dividends.",
      "Since Trimpley was added to the accounts in 2017, Severn Trent Water Ltd has paid out \u00a31.615bn in dividends.",
      "Profits over the same period were \u00a31.246bn, so Severn Trent Water has paid out \u00a3369m more than it made in profit during that period. It looks like cash is being drained from the regulated water company.",
      "Auditor Stanley Root says water companies are under great pressure to pay substantial dividends and the Trimpley scheme helps Severn Trent Water deliver.",
      "\"It makes the company's balance sheet look more stable than it really is. It gives them the appearance of financial resilience. It helps to support the dividend payments they're making.\"",
      "Severn Trent denies that Trimpley has supported shareholder payouts: \"All dividends paid by Severn Trent are justified by earnings and any assertion otherwise is unjustified and wrong.\"",
      "However, it is clear that Trimpley is having a dramatic effect on the pot of money from which shareholders can be paid.",
      "Severn Trent Water's 2023/24 accounts - which include the \u00a31.68bn investment - report the company has very healthy retained earnings of \u00a31.84bn.",
      "But the accounts for the wider Severn Trent Group, where all the creative accounting is cancelled out, show retained earnings of just \u00a37.9m.",
      "Severn Trent says: \"Trimpley is an entirely legitimate, legal and transparent structure.\"",
      "Its accounts are independently audited and \"any suggestion that we have misled our investors, regulators and customers on the company's finances is false\".",
      "It says the IOU is \"very much a real asset\" as it is backed up by other group companies.",

    "summary": "The court says Murdoch acted in \"bad faith\" by trying to give control of his empire to his eldest son.",
    "story": [
      "A real-life \"Succession\" battle for Rupert Murdoch's media empire has ended with a Nevada court commissioner denying the billionaire's bid to change a family trust and give control to his eldest son.",
      "The case pitted the 93-year-old against three of his children over who would gain the power to control News Corp and Fox News when he dies.",
      "It has been reported that Mr Murdoch wanted to amend a family trust created in 1999 to allow his son Lachlan to take control without \"interference\" from his siblings Prudence, Elisabeth and James.",
      "A Nevada commissioner ruled Mr Murdoch and Lachlan had acted in \"bad faith\" and called the efforts a \"carefully crafted charade\", according to the New York Times.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for Prudence, Elisabeth and James said: \"We welcome Commissioner Gorman's decision and hope that we can move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members.\"",
      "Adam Streisand, a lawyer for Mr Murdoch, told the New York Times they were disappointed and planned to appeal.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr Murdoch declined to comment to the BBC. Mr Streisand did not immediately respond to inquiries.",
      "The famous family was one of the inspirations behind the hugely popular TV series Succession - something the Murdochs have always refused to comment on.",
      "But according to the New York Times report, which is based on a copy of the sealed court ruling, the billionaire's children had started discussing their father's death and how they would handle it after an episode of the HBO series where \"the patriarch of the family dies, leaving his family and business in chaos\".",
      "The episode led to Elisabeth's representative to the trust writing a \"'Succession' memo\" that sought to prevent this from happening in real life, said reports.",
      "The case has played out behind closed doors in Nevada, a state that offers one of the most confidential legal settings for matters including family trust disputes.",
      "It has a \"close on demand\" statute that allows parties involved in certain sensitive cases to request that court proceedings be sealed from public access, ensuring complete privacy.",
      "Mr Murdoch, who has been married five times, also has two younger children, Grace and Chloe, who do not have any voting rights under the trust agreement.",
      "The case was launched after Mr Murdoch decided to change the trust over worries about a \"lack of consensus\" among the children, the Times reported.",
      "Lachlan is thought to be more conservative than his siblings and would preserve the legacy of his media brands.",
      "From the 1960s, Mr Murdoch built a global media giant with major political and public influence.",
      "His two companies are News Corporation, which owns newspapers including the Times and the Sun in the UK and the Wall Street Journal in the US, and Fox, which broadcasts Fox News.",
      "Mr Murdoch had been preparing his two sons to follow in his footsteps, beginning when they were teenagers, journalist Andrew Neil told the 2020 BBC documentary The Rise of the Murdoch Dynasty.",
      "\"Family has always been very important to Rupert Murdoch, particularly from the point of view of forming a dynasty,\" the former Sunday Times editor said.",
      "In 1999, the Murdoch Family Trust, which owns the media companies, was supposed to largely settle the succession plans.",
      "It led to Mr Murdoch giving his eldest children various jobs within his companies.",
      "The trust gives the family eight votes, which it can use to have a say on the board of News Corp and Fox News. Mr Murdoch currently controls four of those votes, with his eldest children being in charge of one each.",
      "The trust agreement said that once Mr Murdoch died, his votes would be passed on to his four eldest children equally.",
      "However, differences in opinions and political views were said to lead to a family rift.",
      "The battle over changes to the trust was not about money, but rather power and control over the future of the Murdoch empire.",
      "The commissioner's ruling is not final. The court filing acts as a recommended resolution but a district judge will still weigh in and could choose to rule differently.",
      "The judge could take weeks or months to make a decision, which will not be available to the public.",

      "The approach is still in the preliminary stages and it is not certain that talks will lead to a deal, according to Bloomberg.",

      "In prior cases when the US has imposed export controls, it has only delayed not stopped the other country's ability to gain access to the technology, Mr Lewis said, adding that he was skeptical that the AI at the heart of the dispute was as game-changing as the two sides contend.",

      "With winter nights drawing in across North America, Canadian \u201csnowbirds\u201d \u2013 citizens who flee their freezing temperatures for sunnier climes every year \u2013 are planning their annual trips to Florida or the Caribbean.",
      "Traditionally, Cuba has been hugely popular among Canadians, drawn to the pristine white sands of beach resorts like Varadero.",
      "They fill the void left by Americans wary of the travel restrictions imposed on them under the continuing US economic embargo of the largest island in the Caribbean.",
      "Figures show that almost one million Canadian tourists visited Cuba last year, the top country of origin for visitors by some margin.",
      "As such, a recent decision by the Canadian tour operator, Sunwing Vacations Group \u2013 one of Cuba\u2019s leading travel partners \u2013 to remove 26 hotels from its Cuba portfolio is a blow to the island\u2019s struggling tourism industry.",
      "Sunwing took the decision after Cuba endured a four-day nationwide blackout at the end of October, caused by failures with the country's aging energy infrastructure.",
      "This was followed by another national power cut last month, when Hurricane Rafael barrelled its way across the island, worsening an already-acute electricity crisis.",
      "A third countrywide blackout then happened on Wednesday, 4 Dec, after Cuba's largest power plant broke down.",
      "\u201cCuba has had some volatility in the last few weeks and that may shake consumer confidence,\u201d Sunwing\u2019s chief marketing officer, Samantha Taylor told the Pax News travel website last month.",
      "\u201cThere are incredible places to go in Cuba,\u201d she stressed, keen to emphasise that the company isn\u2019t pulling out of Cuba altogether. \u201cBut we also recognise that if clients are a little uncomfortable, we need to give them options.\u201d",
      "Specifically, that involved drawing up a list of what they called \u201chidden gems\u201d \u2013 alternative holiday destinations in the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and Colombia.",
      "The implications for Cuba are clear.",
      "With tourism now the island\u2019s principal economic motor, and the main source of foreign currency earnings after remittances, that an important tour operator is pointing its customers towards other countries\u2019 beaches over crumbling energy infrastructure is a real concern.",
      "\u201cOur message to Canadians is that tourism is one of the economy\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Lessner G\u00f3mez, director of the Cuban Tourism Board in Toronto in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Tourism has been preparing for the winter season to deliver better services, uninterrupted supplies, a better airport experience, and more and new car rentals.\u201d",
      "While Cuba\u2019s tourism agency tries to ease fears about the extent of the electricity blackouts, few can deny that these have been extremely difficult months on the island. Hurricane Rafael was only the latest storm to hit Cuba in a frenetic Atlantic hurricane season in which more powerful and more frequent storms are the new normal.",
      "Of course, severe weather is a problem across the Caribbean. But for Cuba, there are other complications in play.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election to the White House and his choice for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stand to make life even more complicated for Cubans than it already is.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the Cuban Revolution\u2019s hardest moment,\u201d says former Cuban diplomat, Jes\u00fas Arboleya. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I see nothing on the horizon whatsoever which allows for an optimistic view of the future of US-Cuba relations.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has handed US policy towards Cuba to those sectors of the Cuban American right who have essentially lived off anti-Castro policies since their origins.\u201d",
      "Mr Arboleya adds that Marco Rubio, currently a US Senator for Florida, is the leading voice among them. He is a Cuban American long opposed to the communist government in Havana.",
      "His parents were Cubans who moved to the US in 1956, three years before Fidel Castro seized power, but his grandfather fled the Castro-led turn to communism on the island.",
      "\u201cPeople are horrified by the idea of another Donald Trump presidency. It spells real trouble,\u201d echoes Cuban political commentator and editor of Temas magazine, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Current US policy towards Cuba is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d, he argues.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, the State Department facilitates support to the private sector, and [pushes for] economic changes in Cuba. But on the other hand, Congress and Senate seem to freeze any advances on those reforms.\u201d",
      "The expectation is, however, that a future Secretary of State Rubio will coalesce the US\u2019s Cuba policy around a single idea - maximum pressure on the island by tightening the already-harsh sanctions.",
      "Cubans fear that could mean the suspension of commercial flights to Cuba, or even the closure of the US Embassy in Havana, which was officially reopened in 2015 after decades of frosty relations.",
      "If implemented, such steps would be deliberately designed to further harm Cuba\u2019s floundering tourism trade, the aim to hit the communist-run nation when it\u2019s down. Tourist numbers to Cuba have almost halved since the high point of nearly five million visitors during the Obama-era d\u00e9tente with Cuba.",
      "Between 2015-2017 US visitors flocked to the island under more relaxed travel restrictions, keen to experience a country that had long been denied them. Around the same time, the Cuban government embarked on a major hotel-building spree, confident that demand would remain strong over the next decade.",
      "However, there followed a double blow to Cuban tourism from which it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. First, the Trump Administration rolled back President Obama\u2019s engagement policies, and then the Covid-19 pandemic sent the industry into freefall.",
      "With many of those hotels now registering much lower occupancy rates than originally predicted, and real difficulties in providing the five-star customer experience as advertised amid the blackouts and shortages, some question the strategy of putting so many eggs in the tourism basket in the first place.",
      "\u201cWhy has Cuba invested 38% [of government funds] on average over the past decade in hotels and infrastructure connected to international tourism, but only 8 to 9% on energy infrastructure?\u201d asks economist Ricardo Torres at the American University in Washington DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. The hotels run on electricity.\u201d",
      "Even with all the current challenges, most visitors agree that Cuba remains a unique travel experience. The cliches \u2013 classic cars, cigars and mojitos \u2013 still appeal to many, while others prefer to travel the island absorbing its history, culture and music.",
      "Yet as tour operator Sunwings\u2019 decision to step back shows, some tourists are finding it hard to appreciate Cuba during its energy crisis, especially if it\u2019s about to be exacerbated by a hostile administration \u2013 and Secretary of State \u2013 in Washington."

      "That includes a 45% uplift in the Early Years Pupil Premium funding for the most disadvantaged children, to up to \u00a3570 per year.",
      "But nursery leaders warn the increases will not be enough to cover rising National Insurance contributions and minimum wage staffing costs.",

    "title": "Puberty blockers: Can a drug trial solve one of medicine's most controversial debates?",
    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to determine the evidence - and establish whether the benefits outweigh any potential harms of prescribing puberty blockers to children questioning their gender",
    "story": [
      "It is among the most delicate and controversial challenges in modern medicine - how to determine whether the benefits of puberty blockers (or drugs that delay puberty) outweigh the potential harms.",
      "This question came to the fore in June 2023 when NHS England proposed that in the future, these drugs would only be prescribed to children questioning their gender as part of clinical research.",
      "Since then, a new government has arrived in Westminster and Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he is committed to \"setting up a clinical trial\" to establish the evidence on puberty blockers. The National Institute for Health and Care Research is expected to confirm soon that funding is in place for a trial.",
      "The dilemma that remains is, how will such a trial work?",
      "Eighteen months since the announcement there is still a lack of consensus around how the trial should be conducted. It will also need to be approved by a committee of experts who have to decide, among other things, whether what's being tested might cause undue physical or psychological harm.",
      "But there is a second unanswered question that some, but by no means all, scientists have that is more pressing than the first: is it right to perform this particular trial on children and young people at all?",
      "A rapid rise in referrals",
      "When the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS) was established at London's Tavistock Clinic in 1989, it was the only NHS specialist gender clinic for children in England, and those referred there were typically offered psychological and social support.",
      "Over the last 10 years, however, there has been a rapid increase in referrals - with the greatest increase being people registered female at birth. In a separate development, around the same time the approach of typically offering psychological and social support moved to one of onward referrals to services that prescribed hormone drugs, such as puberty blockers.",
      "Known scientifically as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, puberty blockers work on the brain to stop the rise in sex hormones - oestrogen and testosterone - that accompany puberty. For years, they were prescribed to young patients with gender dysphoria (those who feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex). But in March 2024, NHS England stopped the routine prescribing of puberty blockers to under 18s, as part of an overhaul of children's gender identity services.",
      "NHS England said in a policy statement: \"There is not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of PSH [puberty suppressing hormones] to make the treatment routinely available at this time.\"",
      "The ban was later tightened to apply to private clinics as well.",
      "In April 2024, a review of gender identity services for children and young people, led by Dr Hilary Cass, a past president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, published its final report, which called out the \"field of gender care\" for not taking a cautious and careful approach.",
      "She also reported that the change in practice at GIDS away from one primarily relying on psychological and social support was largely based on a single study that looked at the effect of medical interventions such as puberty blockers on a very narrowly defined group of children and there was a lack of follow up in the longer term.",
      "Elsewhere, some other countries were re-examining puberty blockers too. Scotland paused the use of them while Finland, Sweden, France, Norway, and Denmark have all re-evaluated their positions on medical intervention for under 18s - including puberty blockers - to differing degrees. In other places there is still support for the use of puberty blockers.",
      "In medicine, when there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the benefits of a treatment outweigh the harms - called equipoise - some ethicists argue there's a moral obligation to scientifically study such treatments. But there are some from across the debate who don't think there is equipoise in this case.",
      "The ethical dilemma at the heart of the trial",
      "The BBC has learned details about the arguments going on around the concept of a trial and how it could look. Some argue that there is already evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health, and that in light of this it would be unethical to perform a trial at all because this would mean some young people experiencing gender distress would not be given them.",
      "The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has expressed their concern about the trial for this reason. They support the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery. WPATH, who have faced increasing criticism of their guidelines from some clinicians, say that it is ethically problematic to make participation in a trial the only way to access a type of care that is \"evidence based, widely recognised as medically necessary, and often reported as lifesaving.\"",
      "Meanwhile other clinicians believe there is no good evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health at all. They also point to research that questions the negative impact that the drugs might have on brain development among teenagers, as well as evidence around the negative impact on bone density.",
      "Dr Louise Irvine is a GP and co-chair of the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender which says it is cautious about using medical pathways in gender dysphoric children. She says: \"Given that puberty blockers by definition disrupt a crucial natural phase of human development, the anticipated benefits must be tangible and significant to justify the risk to children.",
      "\"In pushing ahead with a puberty blockers trial, we are concerned that political interests are being prioritised over clinical, ethical and scientific concerns, and over the health and wellbeing of children.\"",
      "The NHS adult gender services holds data that tracks 9,000 young people from the youth service. Some argue that this should be scrutinised before any trial goes ahead as it could provide evidence on, among other things, the potential risks of taking puberty blockers.",
      "But there is a third view held by some others, including Gordon Guyatt, a professor at McMaster University in Canada, who points out that randomised trials are done in \"life-threatening stuff all the time\" where no-one can be sure of the long-term effects of a treatment. In his view it would be \"unethical not to do it\".",
      "\"With only low quality evidence, people's philosophies, their attitudes or their politics, will continue to dominate the discussion,\" he argues. \"If we do not generate better evidence, the destructive, polarised debate will continue.\"",
      "- Dr Cass found the existing research in the field was poor quality and that there was not a reliable enough evidence base to base clinical decisions on. Young people involved in many of the existing studies may have also had interventions including psychological support and other medical treatments and so it was not always possible to disentangle the effect of each different treatment.",
      "- When it comes to suppressing puberty by using drugs, the rationale for doing so \"remains unclear\", Dr Cass said.  One of the original reasons given was to allow time to think by delaying the onset of puberty. But the evidence suggests the vast majority who start on puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones - oestrogen or testosterone. It is not clear why but one theory, the Cass report suggests, is that puberty blockers may, in their own right, change the \"trajectory\" of gender identity development.",
      "- Clinicians \"are unable to determine with any certainty\" which young people \"will go on to have an enduring trans identity\", Dr Cass wrote. In other words, there's a lack of clarity about which young people might benefit in the long term and which may be harmed overall by the process.",
      "How the trial could look",
      "Recruitment for the trial is due to start in 2025, months later than originally anticipated. Young people will likely be referred after a full assessment by specialist clinicians. A lot is still to be determined, including how many participants there will be.",
      "Ultimately the scientists running the trials will need to establish whether people who get an intervention are better off than those who do not. In this case, do the puberty blocking drugs and their effect make the young people better off?",
      "\"Better off\" in this instance includes the extent to which a young person's mental health may be improved if they are happy with their body. Quality of life is determined by various factors including self-confidence and self-esteem. As well as getting the personal views from the young people and parents, the trial could measure actual real life changes, such as time spent in education and time spent with family and friends.",
      "But there are potential harms to study too, such as the possibility of reduced bone density. Some scientists suggest examining the impact on learning using a form of IQ test.",
      "Normal brain development is influenced by both puberty and chronological age, which usually act in tandem during adolescence. It's not clear how this is affected when puberty is suppressed. Brain scans are one way of understanding any effect.",
      "Some scientists believe it may be possible to simply randomly assign trial participants into two groups where one gets puberty blockers, the other gets a placebo and nobody is aware which group they're in.",
      "But others believe a placebo group is impossible. They say the placebo group would go through puberty, realise they weren't on puberty blockers and potentially drop out of the trial or even find other ways to obtain puberty blockers. Either scenario would reduce the validity of the results.",
      "Professor Gordon Guyatt and others have outlined a potential trial where the group of patients not receiving drugs would be made up entirely of children who are keen to socially transition, such as by changing how they dress and altering their name and pronouns. Researchers could then monitor the difference between the groups.",
      "A second possibility is that both trial groups are given puberty blockers but one group gets them after a delay, during which time they receive psychological and emotional support. This would help researchers determine, among other things, whether their gender-related distress subsides during that delay while receiving the support.",
      "Alongside this there would be a \"matched\" control group that doesn't take a placebo or puberty blockers, whether for health reasons or because they don't want to, that get similar tests and scans.",
      "Puberty occurs in stages when different bodily changes occur. A third proposal could involve a second group being given drugs at a later stage in puberty than the first.",
      "This would allow researchers to explore when the right time to give puberty blockers might be. For example, it would enable the researchers to see if starting the drugs early improves wellbeing by reducing gender-specific body changes. They would also be able to see whether starting the drugs earlier has a greater negative impact on bone density and brain development.",
      "Children referred to GIDS also experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and autism compared to the general child population. Trial participants would continue to receive treatment related to these conditions but - so we know any differences in the results from the groups are down to the drug - they will need to be balanced for the above conditions.",
      "All these considerations demonstrate the complexity of trying to obtain evidence in this area that is reliable and definitive.",
      "What parents say",
      "Many parents are watching closely to see how it will play out. Annabel (not her real name) is one of them. She is part of the Bayswater Group, a collection of parents with children who are questioning their gender who say they are \"wary of medical solutions to gender dysphoria\". She began looking into puberty blockers when her own daughter began questioning her gender in her early teens, an option put on the table by GIDS.",
      "Ultimately her daughter decided not to take them. Annabel was not convinced there was enough evidence to show they were beneficial and she was unsure what it would mean for her daughter's long-term physical and psychological health.",
      "Today, she still has unanswered questions - including some further ones around the trial. \"A big concern for me is will this new trial, if it gets approval, give us the evidence that we want? Or will we end up with more weak data that Dr Cass said undermined decision making in this area?\"",
      "Natacha Kennedy, a lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London who researches transgender issues, has examined the results of a survey of 97 parents of young people with gender-related distress that took place following the puberty blockers ban. She believes that puberty blockers should be an option available for young people questioning their gender and that many will not accept being part of a placebo group in a trial.",
      "\"These parents are desperate and if [they] get to a trial and it turns out their child is not being given the actual puberty blockers, then there is no point in them being there,\" she says.",
      "\"There may be some parents who would\u2026 find another way [to obtain the drugs].\"",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Whatever trial format is settled on, more scrutiny will follow. And there will no doubt be fierce debate about the merits of the trial and what it can tell us, as many scientists around the world are watching to see what happens in the UK.",
      "But inevitably, there will be a long wait to fully understand the longer term effects on physical and mental health of those who take puberty blockers - and the long-term effects on those with gender-related distress who don't. Nor do we know how many people detransition, though the Cass report says, \"there is suggestion that numbers are increasing\".",
      "\"We really need to have long-term follow up,\" argues Annabel. \"Can a child possibly understand what that means to their fertility and a loss of sexual function and what that will mean for their future life?\"",
      "For now, she and the scores of parents, carers and young people, can only watch and wait for the trial to begin and for its verdict - and what that means for whether puberty blockers will be prescribed to children once again in the future.",

    "summary": "The Colombian singer is the world's most-watched artist when it comes to streamed videos.",
    "story": [
      "We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G?",
      "While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos have been the most watched online in recent years.",
      "That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for three years in a row \u2013 2021, 2022, and 2023.",
      "Last year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 4.7 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 3.2 billion, and Swift on three million. It is expected to be a similar picture when Vevo releases its figures for 2024 this month.",
      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",
      "Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.",

      "Other actors and technicians on the set told Mediapart of the unhealthy atmosphere.",

    "summary": "The actor plays Dylan in A Complete Unknown, which focuses on the singer's rise to fame in the 1960s.",
    "story": [
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has been praised by critics for his portrayal of Bob Dylan, in a new film biopic of the US singer-songwriter.",
      "A Complete Unknown has already scored three Golden Globe nominations and is likely to be in the Oscars race in the new year.",
      "The Guardian said Chalamet showed \"amazing bravado\" in his performance, while Empire said the actor is \"superb\" and his \"musical talent is unimpeachable\".",
      "But the Independent said the biopic itself \"plays too safe\" and Screen Rant described the \"serviceable\" film as a \"fascinating yet frustrating\" portrait.",
      "A Complete Unknown is released on Christmas Day in the US, and 17 January in the UK.",
      "Dylan himself has endorsed the film, although he had not actually seen it at the time he posted about it last week on X.",
      "\"Timmy's a brilliant actor so I'm sure he's going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me,\" Dylan said.",
      "In her three-star review, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey said the film \"takes a reverent stance to Dylan's artistry, populated by technically accomplished musical performances\".",
      "She said Chalamet's voice \"isn't perfect, but it's undoubtedly impressive\", adding the film is \"shot with a real sensitivity to the emotional landscape of each track\".",
      "The film is based on Elijah Wald's 2015 book, Dylan Goes Electric!",
      "Set in the early 1960s, it tells the story of Dylan's rise to fame, and the conflict between his folk roots and his desire to expand his repertoire to include rock 'n' roll.",
      "The friction is represented by the choice between his use of an acoustic and electric guitar, and Dylan's lyrics gradually become bolder and more reflective of the world he sees around him.",
      "The film climaxes with a famously chaotic performance at at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, where Dylan was booed by some members of the audience for playing an electric set with an amplified band.",
      "Deadline's Pete Hammond praised the film's production design, costumes and cinematography, as well as its lead performance.",
      "\"At the centre of this all is a remarkable performance by Chalamet, who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lip-syncing or blending of voices between actor and subject,\" he noted.",
      "\"The music of course is worth the price of admission, but in Mangold's hands fortunately there is so much more to add, thus making Bob Dylan a little less than complete unknown by the time the credits roll.\"",
      "The film also follows Dylan's romantic relationships with two women in particular - civil rights activist Sylvie Russo (played by Elle Fanning) and folk musician Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro).",
      "Screen Rant's Mae Abdulbaki reflected: \"I could understand both women more clearly than Chalamet's Dylan. Behind his sunglasses and tight body language, Dylan remains elusive.",
      "\"The film is very much about an artist who doesn't explain himself, and I have immense respect for that, but it also creates an emotional disconnect in narrative form. It was as though I was watching a series of events that I couldn't bring myself to care about. That's what Mangold risks by keeping Dylan out of reach.\"",
      "There was a rave review from the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, who awarded the film five stars and praised Chalamet's \"hilarious and seductive portrayal\".",
      "\"Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format,\" he said. It's all rise, but troubled and unclear.\"",
      "The Times Kevin Maher was far less enthusiastic, awarding just two stars",
      "\"There will be audiences who will regard the recreation of Newport '65 as a monumental cinematic event. But for many it will land with a giant shrug of indifference,\" he noted.",
      "\"[Chalamet's] performance is an unhelpful study in blank-eyed lockjaw minimalism, while his singing voice is fine if, occasionally, close to parody (but all Dylan imitators sound like parody).\"",
      "With an acclaimed back catalogue built up over seven decades, Dylan is best known for hits such as Blowin in the Wind, Mr. Tambourine Man, It Ain't Me Babe, Girl From The North Country and The Times They Are a Changin'.",
      "\"Perhaps Dylan himself is too mercurial a figure for a biopic to ever capture him completely,\" wrote the Telegraph's Robbie Collin in a four-star review. \"A Complete Unknown comes about as close as one could reasonably hope.",
      "\"For the most part, the film plays like a juicy rise-to-power drama rather than a scenic tour of an artist's Wikipedia page.\"",
      "Elsewhere, the Evening Standard's Nick Curtis joked the film made him \"really, really want to learn to play harmonica\".",
      "\"It's a defiantly unlikeable performance, miles away from Chalamet's romantic leads,\" Curtis noted.",
      "\"He captures Dylan's craning stance and the way he used hair and sunglasses as a mask, the insistent buzz and keen of his speaking and singing voice and the odd, touchy, insularity.\"",
      "A Complete Unknown also stars Edward Norton and is directed by James Mangold, the filmmaker behind Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line and films in the X-Men and Indiana Jones franchises.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney added: \"Commendably, neither the movie nor the actor sugarcoat the abrasiveness of a creative genius whose insensitivity toward people close to him often stands in stark contrast to the humanity in his songs.\"",
      "\"That detachment leaves something of a hole where the emotional centre should be in the screenplay by Mangold and Jay Cocks. Making a film about an enigmatic subject is inherently challenging and the writers deserve credit for declining to try to solve the mystery of Bob Dylan, even if that also risks making them seem incurious.\"",
      "Empire's John Nugent concluded: \"Frustratingly, for a story about a poetic genius, it struggles to find something fresh to say.",
      "\"There is some interesting stuff about the burden of talent... But by 1965 he is almost always behind sunglasses, his enigma calcified.",
      "\"The film doesn't claim to understand Dylan, and suggests Dylan might not understand himself, either. That title, it seems, is literal.\"",

    "story": [
      "Australia's government says it will create new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news.",
      "The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms.",
      "Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers.",
      "The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; \u00a3125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes.",
      "The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok.",
      "In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was \"charging one industry to subsidise another\".",
      "Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers.",
      "\"Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,\" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday.",
      "The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content.",
      "That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms.",
      "As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers.",
      "Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere.",
      "\"We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content\u2026 news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,\" it said in a statement in February.",
      "The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as \"a fundamental dereliction\" of Meta's \"responsibility to its Australian users\".",
      "\"The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,\" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time.",
      "The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.",
      "The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue."

      "People at the event said they helped the alleged victim get home in a taxi.",
      "But several former members of staff who said they witnessed the incident told us they were too scared to complain. One person said: \"It\u2019s the CEO\u2019s husband, what are you going to do? Lose your job?\"",
      "A complaint about the incident was made later by a staff member, and was shared with several members of the senior leadership team at PinkNews. The BBC has been shown multiple copies of the complaint but has been unable to establish whether any action was taken as a result.",
      "Many of the former employees said staff socials or awaydays often involved drinking until the early hours of the morning and that \"Prosecco Friday\" - where staff would be given free wine and crisps - was introduced in the office in an effort to boost staff morale.",
      "Another former staff member we are calling Damian said he personally experienced inappropriate behaviour from Mr Cohen during an evening at the pub after work.",
      "\"Ben was extremely drunk to the point he fell off his chair, and then asked me out of earshot of my other colleagues whether I wanted to go back to his [\u2026] because Anthony his husband wasn\u2019t there,\" Damian said.",
      "\"He said something along the lines of 'Anthony is always getting with other men' and the suggestion was we would do something sexually. I was extremely uncomfortable.\"",
      "Damian said after that night, he avoided being alone with Mr Cohen for the rest of his time at PinkNews.",
      "\"I never heard about it again, no apology,\" he said. \"It put me on alert because it made me realise it was a boundary he thought he could cross.\"",
      "Stephan Kyriacou, who worked at PinkNews between 2019 and 2021, said the job had started as a \"dream come true\" where he did not have to \"hide who I was or pretend\", but the dream was soon \"shattered\".",

      "'Creepy and sleazy'",
      "Staff have told us they were shouted at and belittled by Mr Cohen, and that there was a \"toxic\" culture at the company.",
      "\"He can be quite brutal in the way he speaks to you,\" said Damian. \"When things go wrong he\u2019d come down on you like a tonne of bricks and so you were just in this constant state of emotional flux.",
      "\"He put extreme pressures on me to the point I would go home and cry. It caused issues in my own personal relationship with my partner, and then [Benjamin] would love-bomb me and I would think everything was alright.\"",

      "A spokesperson for the National Union of Journalists said it has reached out to its members following the \"deeply disturbing\" allegations, which they say \"paint a picture of a dysfunctional and wholly unacceptable workplace environment\".",
      "Many of the staff who spoke to the BBC said they hope the culture at PinkNews can change so it can continue to tell stories relevant to the LGBT community.",

      "The case pitted the 93-year-old against three of his children over who would gain the power to control News Corp and Fox News when he dies.",
      "It has been reported that Mr Murdoch wanted to amend a family trust created in 1999 to allow his son Lachlan to take control without \"interference\" from his siblings Prudence, Elisabeth and James.",

      "The episode led to Elisabeth's representative to the trust writing a \"'Succession' memo\" that sought to prevent this from happening in real life, said reports.",
      "The case has played out behind closed doors in Nevada, a state that offers one of the most confidential legal settings for matters including family trust disputes.",
      "It has a \"close on demand\" statute that allows parties involved in certain sensitive cases to request that court proceedings be sealed from public access, ensuring complete privacy.",
      "Mr Murdoch, who has been married five times, also has two younger children, Grace and Chloe, who do not have any voting rights under the trust agreement.",

      "Lachlan is thought to be more conservative than his siblings and would preserve the legacy of his media brands.",
      "From the 1960s, Mr Murdoch built a global media giant with major political and public influence.",
      "His two companies are News Corporation, which owns newspapers including the Times and the Sun in the UK and the Wall Street Journal in the US, and Fox, which broadcasts Fox News.",
      "Mr Murdoch had been preparing his two sons to follow in his footsteps, beginning when they were teenagers, journalist Andrew Neil told the 2020 BBC documentary The Rise of the Murdoch Dynasty.",
      "\"Family has always been very important to Rupert Murdoch, particularly from the point of view of forming a dynasty,\" the former Sunday Times editor said.",
      "In 1999, the Murdoch Family Trust, which owns the media companies, was supposed to largely settle the succession plans.",
      "It led to Mr Murdoch giving his eldest children various jobs within his companies.",
      "The trust gives the family eight votes, which it can use to have a say on the board of News Corp and Fox News. Mr Murdoch currently controls four of those votes, with his eldest children being in charge of one each.",

      "The battle over changes to the trust was not about money, but rather power and control over the future of the Murdoch empire.",

      "Two years ago, rap musician and mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs threw a lavish 53rd birthday party at his $61m mansion in Beverly Hills.",
      "A host of stars lined up to toast his career, with a guest list that included Jay-Z, Travis Scott, Mary J Blige, Kehlani, Tinashe, Chris Brown and Machine Gun Kelly.",
      "The party coincided with his 30th year in the music industry - three decades in which he formed his own entertainment empire and changed the sound of hip-hop, both as an artist and a producer for the likes of Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez and The Notorious B.I.G.",

      "BBC Sounds: Get the latest updates on the Diddy allegations in the weekly podcast, Diddy On Trial",
      "Fast-forward to 2024, and his career is on the ropes.",
      "In a case filed in New York, the star has been accused of kidnapping, drugging and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes through the use of firearms and threats of violence.",
      "The same Los Angeles mansion that hosted his birthday party was raided by police in March. There, officers seized supplies that they say were intended for use in orgies known as \"freak offs\", including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.",
      "Mr Combs has denied all the charges, entering a not guilty plea on Tuesday, 17 September.",
      "The court case comes after a year in which the musician has faced lawsuits from a number of women.",
      "Here is how the allegations against Mr Combs have stacked up.",
      "16 November 2023: Cassie's lawsuit",
      "Casandra Ventura, a singer and model known as Cassie, was signed to Mr Combs' record label and dated him for more than a decade.",
      "But in a civil lawsuit, she said the mogul had used his position of power to \"set the groundwork\" for a \"manipulative and coercive romantic and sexual relationship\".",
      "Her lawsuit included graphic descriptions of violent abuse, alleging that Mr Combs \"regularly beat and kicked Ms Ventura, leaving black eyes, bruises, and blood\".",
      "She described parties known as \"freak offs\" - drug-fuelled, days-long sexual performances - which Mr Combs allegedly coerced women into, and filmed for his own pleasure.",
      "Ms Ventura also accused the musician of sexual abuse and rape, and claimed that many of these incidents were witnessed by his \"tremendously loyal network\" who \"were not willing to do anything meaningful\" to stop the violence.",
      "The lawsuit also alleged that Mr Combs destroyed a car belonging to US rapper Kid Cudi, to dissuade him from dating her.",
      "Mr Combs strenuously denied the allegations and accused Ms Ventura of extortion.",
      "They settled the case for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed in New York, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.",
      "November to December 2023: More lawsuits allege sexual assault",
      "In the weeks after settling Cassie's lawsuit, Mr Combs was accused of sexual assault dating back to 1991 by multiple women.",
      "One lawsuit was filed anonymously by a woman who claimed Mr Combs and another man had coerced her into sex.",
      "In a second, Joi Dickerson-Neal accused the star of drugging and sexually assaulting her when she was a college student in 1991. She also claimed he filmed the attack and showed it to other people without her consent.",
      "A third woman, Liza Gardner, filed court papers accusing Mr Combs and another man of raping her and her friend more than 30 years ago, when she was 16.",
      "Ms Gardner also alleged that Mr Combs had turned violent days after the attack, choking her so hard that she passed out.",
      "In the lawsuit, she said Mr Combs had become irate while trying to track down her friend, because he was worried she would inform \"the girl he was with at the time\".",
      "The lawsuits all came shortly before the expiration of the New York Adult Survivors Act, which temporarily allowed people who said they had been sexually abused to file claims, even after the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "Mr Combs denied all the allegations, and his spokesperson called the lawsuits a \"money grab\".",
      "December 2023: Underage sex claim",
      "Another woman sued in December, claiming she was \"sex trafficked\" and \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs, former Bad Boy Records president Harve Pierre and another man in 2003, when she was 17.",
      "In court papers, the woman, known only as Jane Doe, alleged she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack and was left in so much pain that she could barely stand or remember how she got home.",
      "In response, Mr Combs said he \"did not do any of the awful things being alleged\", while Mr Pierre said the \"disgusting allegations\" were \"false and a desperate attempt for financial gain\".",
      "Diddy's denial",
      "On 6 December, Mr Combs responded to the flurry of lawsuits with a statement on his Instagram page.",
      "\"ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,\" he wrote. \"For the last couple of weeks, I have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and my legacy.",
      "\"Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.\"",

      "In court papers filed in New York, Mr Jones also claimed that Mr Combs tried to \"groom\" him into having sex with another man, telling him it was \"a normal practice in the music industry\".",
      "Mr Combs' lawyer, Shawn Holley, called Mr Jones \"nothing more than a liar\" and described his claims as \"pure fiction\" that could be discredited by \"overwhelming, indisputable proof\".",

      "But, as Troy Baker will tell you, no-one's immune.",
      "His most famous role is Joel Miller, the main character of post-apocalyptic adventure The Last of Us - a game regularly praised for its storytelling and performances.",
      "He's also appeared in celebrated series including Bioshock, Uncharted and Batman: Arkham.",
      "But stepping into the lead role of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was a different matter.",
      "Troy says taking on the character made famous by Oscar nominee Harrison Ford was daunting, even for him.",
      "\"I turned it down,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat, thinking back to when he was first offered the job.",
      "\"I was scared. I felt the weight of what this character meant.\"",
      "Troy says the performance capture team at developer MachineGames convinced him to change his mind, but there was one more person he had to win over.",
      "Todd Howard, the boss of publisher Bethesda, had long dreamed of making an Indiana Jones game and oversaw the project.",
      "But, Troy says, he \"rolled his eyes\" when the actor was first put forward.",
      "Howard felt it would ruin the experience for players so used to hearing him.",
      "\"I never thought that my success would actually work against me,\" says Troy.",
      "Rather than walk into the role, Troy says, he had to audition with dozens of others.",

      "\"Lil picked up on a social media post that somebody said, 'I'm having a Dave Day, so instead of having a good day, just say have a Dave Day, because Dave was always positive, even right to the very end.\"",
      "There are no superlatives in the English language that can describe the event, says Si. He was overwhelmed by the sense of fellowship and community, but \"there's a frustration in it as well that I just wish he'd been there\", he says.",
      "Si and Dave started their TV careers behind the camera - Si as an assistant director and Dave as a makeup artist. They turned their love of cooking, eating and riding their bikes into a successful cooking travelogue.",
      "\"We were very lucky that the BBC let two\u2026 hippies out on the Great British public,\" says Si.",
      "\"It was a wonderful opportunity for two relatively ordinary blokes to be in extraordinary circumstances, being a conduit of other people's stories from around the world,\" he adds.",
      "But typically with the hairy bikers, not everything always went to plan -  like the time they filmed the pilot episode of their show and were meant to fly off together in a glider - but couldn't get off the ground because they were too heavy. Or the time Si put chips on blue tissue paper to dry and it dyed them blue.",
      "Throughout their travels they wanted to shine a light on different cultures and the foods of that region. In Japan, the duo even tried their hand at sumo wrestling and Si remembers Dave had gone the extra mile to make sure he looked good in his loincloth.",
      "\"This is what he was like, right,\" says Si, \"He'd done his bikini line, I remember, and I went, 'You've done your\u2026 What! A born makeup artist.",
      "\"'No, it's got to look aesthetically pleasing,' Si remembers Dave saying.",
      "Growing up in the north \u2013 Dave in the north-west and Si in the north-east \u2013 they both came from working class backgrounds. Dave's mum was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) when he was young and Dave became a carer for her early on. He was just eight years old when he cooked his first meal for the family of cheese and potato pie.",
      "\"On top of all of that, during his adolescence, he had alopecia and I think the way that Dave approached his life was indicative of his childhood really,\" says Si. \"He wore those scars a little bit, of course he did, as everybody would, but it never stopped his enthusiasm for life though.\"",
      "The bikers' strong bond was even apparent on Dave's wedding day to his wife Lili.",
      "\"I mean [Lili] finds it funny, but I'm sure at the time she found it pretty irritating. Dave would always go, 'Kingy, come on man, get in man, we're having a photograph'. I'm going, 'Dude, it's your wedding day, I'm in every photograph. Lil's going to go mad when she sees them.' He was like, 'No, no, no, come in.'\"",
      "Si says he even spent Valentine's Day with the couple. Right from the very beginning, they were like \"two old slippers\" says Si, albeit that they were very different people. Dave was comedic and Si says he fell into the role of playing off Dave's daftness.",
      "One egg is never an oeuf - was just one of the jokes Si heard Dave repeat - over and over again. The similes were also never-ending, says Si.",
      "\"Oh, look at that, Kingy,\" Dave would say, \"It's lighter than a hummingbird's toenail clippings.\"",
      "Or \"the onion is now more transparent than a bank manager's smile\".",
      "But the Hairy Bikers' main mission was to empower people to get back into the kitchen and cook, says Si, as food is the glue that binds us together - something that has been made even harder today with the stress and time pressures facing working families trying to earn a living.",
      "\"I understood, as did Dave, the importance of actually sitting round a table when we were little, because that's what formed us as adults,\" says Si. \"And it was important, because you could see if your mum wasn't very well, or dad was a bit grumpy.\"",
      "A second Dave Day event has been planned for June 2025. But as for what the future holds for Si, he says if he worked on another cookery programme, it would have to be \"a marked change\" from the shows he created with Dave.",
      "Si says he knows his best mate would want him to continue to work on new projects, however.",
      "\"I think in the spirit of the bikers, Dave would want me to continue to have fun and to educate, to inform, to enlighten, to be slightly edgy,\" he says.",
      "\"In fact, I don't think, I know that he'd want that for me - and I miss him.\"",

      "When she plays the final notes of Karma in Vancouver on Sunday night, the Eras Tour will be over, forever.",
      "First announced in November 2022, it's been even bigger than Swift could have wildest-dreamed - with 149 shows in 53 cities seen by 10.1 million fans.",
      "Along the way, it hoovered up $2bn in ticket sales, stimulated local economies and triggered seismic events.",

      "End of an era as 'proud' Taylor Swift finishes tour",
      "End of an era as 'proud' Taylor Swift finishes tour",
      "Writing in her recently-published tour book, Swift said the 45-song, career-spanning setlist was inspired by the decision to re-record her first six albums, which made her fall \"back in love\" with her past work.",
      "She went on to play concerts in \"the pouring rain, in the blazing heat, in the thickest of humidity, in the wildest of winds and in the bitter cold,\" she wrote, even when she was \"sick or exhausted or injured,\" or working through a \"broken heart\".",
      "But the concerts were about more than the music. Fans swapped friendship bracelets and made lifelong friends with strangers. Outside the stadiums, ticketless Swifties gathered in car parks to sing along.",
      "At one show in Munich, 40,000 people congregated on a nearby hill just to catch a glimpse of the show, almost outnumbering the fans inside the city's former Olympic Stadium.",
      "For many, the chance to hear these songs live for the first time was overwhelming.",
      "\"I did a lot more weeping than I expected,\" says Chvrches singer Lauren Mayberry, who first saw the tour in Santa Clara last year.",
      "\"I wept at the start, just because it was exciting. Obviously I wept during [epic break-up ballad] All Too Well. Then I cried in The Archer. Don't know why.\"",
      "Online, the faithful watched nightly livestreams and downloaded a free, fan-run app - SwiftAlert - that allowed them to speculate on the outfits Swift might wear, and the surprise songs she might play in her nightly acoustic set. Those at the top of the leaderboard would win prizes.",
      "There's an unparalleled sense of community around the gigs. When I took my daughter to one of the Wembley Stadium gigs in June, taller people moved back to give her a better view - something I've rarely seen in years of concert-going.",

      "Female Rage: The Musical",
      "The conclusion of the tour leaves Swift at a crossroads. This Eras Tour will be the yardstick against which the rest of her career will be measured - and her next move will be watched closely by fans and critics alike.",
      "So what options does she have?",
      "\"Taylor is a very future-minded thinker, so I imagine she has the next few years already completely planned out.\" says Bryan West, a dedicated Taylor Swift reporter for USA Today and The Tennessean, who has seen the Eras tour 89 times.",
      "Noting Swift's tendency to dovetail her projects, he thinks there will be some sort of \"news-making\" announcement at her final show.",
      "Most likely, this will be the reveal of Reputation (Taylor's Version) - the latest instalment of her re-recorded album series, complete with bonus tracks from the vault.",
      "That said, fans have been anticipating that announcement all year and the album is yet to materialise, despite numerous, tantalising hints it's on its way.",
      "West has some other theories, too.",
      "\"We've seen film crews at many of the gigs, so I'd not be shocked if she's been shooting a documentary this entire time.",
      "\"And in her new book, she said, 'See you next era', so there have been reports that she's working on new music.\"",
      "A longer term prospect is that Swift will pivot to film. In December 2022, she signed a deal to direct a film for Searchlight Pictures, based on her own original script.",
      "Making the announcement, Searchlight presidents David Greenbaum and Matthew Greenfield called her \"a once in a generation artist and storyteller\", but the trail has gone cold since then. Perhaps she'll return to the director's chair in 2025?",

      "Pushin' strollers",
      "\"She needs to take some time off, first and foremost,\" says Jack Saunders, host of Radio 1's New Music Show, \"because it's completely unrealistic to expect a human being to operate at the performance level that she has been doing for the last couple of years and dive straight back in.",
      "\"We've heard a lot from Taylor - so it's healthy for us and it's healthy for her to step back and take some time away, so that she can fuel herself for whatever's next.\"",
      "Indeed, Swift has hinted she's tiring of the music industry grind.",
      "Clara Bow, a track from her latest album The Tortured Poets Department, is a barbed commentary on the industry's lust for new blood.",
      "Other songs find her daydreaming about wedding rings and \"pushin' strollers\" - so there's every possibility Swift will take a year off to focus on her romance with American football star Travis Kelce.",
      "\"She probably will take a break,\" says West, \"but she's not one that necessarily sits still. She's always creating. She's always coming up with new projects.\"",
      "If Swift does head back to the studio, singer-songwriter Self Esteem hopes she'll spend the cultural (and financial) capital she's built up over the last two years to do something unexpected.",
      "\"If I was her, I'd indulge myself in making music in all the different genres and styles I hadn't been able to explore because of branding and expectations,\" she says.",
      "\"And it sounds really worthy, but I can't wait until I have enough money to fund working class people who can't get access to music - so if I was her, I'd do that.\"",
      "(It's worth noting that Swift has a history of charitable giving, including donations to local foodbanks on every stop of the Eras tour).",
      "Whatever happens, a left-hand swerve makes sense; in her Eras Tour book, the star says she \"hates to do the same thing twice\".",
      "But for this weekend, Michelle just wants to savour the final moments of a one-off phenomenon.",
      "\"We love concerts in my family. I love the buzz of being in a whole crowd of people excited about the same thing,\" she says, \"but this feels different.",
      "\"I love how the tour has brought people all over the world together.",
      "\"It will certainly be interesting to see what her next move is,\" she adds, \"but I can't bring myself to speculate.",
      "\"I'll just wait and see - because, whatever she does next, Taylor and her team should be very proud of the joy that was brought to so many during the Eras Tour run.\""

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 03:08:22 GMT",
    "summary": "For the first time, the annual report delved into race and ethnic data of those who underwent assisted dying.",
    "story": [
      "The rate of medical assistance in dying - also known as euthanasia - has grown in Canada for the fifth straight year, albeit at a slower pace.",
      "The country released its fifth annual report since legalising assisted dying in 2016, which for the first time included data on the ethnicity of those seeking euthanasia.",
      "Around 15,300 people underwent assisted dying last year, accounting for 4.7% of deaths in the country. Canada lawmakers are currently seeking to expand access to euthanasia to cover people with mental illnesses by 2027.",
      "Canada is among a few countries that have introduced assisted dying laws in the past decade. Others include Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Austria.",
      "The figures released on Wednesday by Health Canada show that the rate of assisted dying in Canada increased by nearly 16% in 2023. This number is a sharp drop from the average increase of 31% in previous years.",
      "The report cautioned that it is too early to determine what caused the rate to slacken.",
      "Nearly all of those who requested assisted dying - around 96% - had a foreseeable natural death. The remaining 4% were granted euthanasia due to having a long-term chronic illness and where a natural death was not imminent.",
      "The average age of those seeking assisted dying was around 77 years old, with cancer being the most frequent underlying medical condition.",
      "For the first time, the report delved into race and ethnic data of those who died by euthanasia.",
      "Around 96% of recipients identified as white people, who account for about 70% of Canada's population. It is unclear what caused this disparity.",
      "The second most reported ethnic group was east Asians (1.8%), who account for about 5.7% of Canadians.",
      "Assisted dying continued to have the highest usage rate in Quebec, which accounted for nearly 37% of all euthanasia deaths, despite the province holding just 22% of Canada's population.",
      "Quebec's government launched a study earlier this year to examine why its euthanasia rate was so high.",
      "While the number of assisted deaths in Canada is growing, the country still falls behind the Netherlands, where euthanasia accounted for around 5% of total deaths last year.",
      "UK MPs voted late last month to pass a similar bill that gives terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death, though it will face months of further scrutiny before it could become law.",
      "As British MPs debated the legislation, Canada was cited by some as a cautionary tale due to its perceived lack of safeguards.",
      "Like the UK, Canada initially only legalised assisted dying for those whose death was \"reasonably foreseeable\".",
      "However, Canada expanded access in 2021 to people who may not have a terminal diagnosis, but want to end their life because of a chronic, debilitating condition.",
      "It was set to broaden access once again to people with mental illnesses earlier this year.",
      "But that was delayed for the second time after concerns were raised by Canadian provinces, which oversee healthcare delivery, about whether the system could cope with such an expansion.",
      "On Wednesday, Health Canada defended the procedure, saying that the criminal code sets out \"strict eligibility\" criteria.",
      "But Cardus, a Christian think tank, said the latest figures were \"alarming\" and showed Canada has one of the fastest growing euthanasia programmes in the world.",
      "A report released in October by Ontario - Canada's most populous province - has since shed some light on controversial cases where people were granted assisted dying when they were not nearing their natural death.",
      "One example included a woman in her 50s with a history of depression and suicidal thoughts who had a severe sensitivity to chemicals.",
      "Her request for euthanasia was granted after she failed to secure housing that could have met her medical needs.",
      "Another case made headlines in recent months of a Nova Scotia cancer patient who said she was asked if she was aware of assisted dying as an option twice as she underwent mastectomy surgeries.",
      "The question \"came up in completely inappropriate places\", she told the National Post.",

      "Mencap is one of a growing number of care organisations warning they will have to axe vital services because of the impact of the Budget.",
      "Businesses - including charities - currently pay a rate of 13.8% National Insurance on employees' earnings above \u00a39,100 a year. But that will increase to 15% in April 2025, instead starting when wages reach \u00a35,000.",
      "Mencap says the rise will cost it \u00a35.3m every year.",
      "The government also announced an increase to the national minimum wage during the Budget - with hourly rates for over-21s set to go up to \u00a312.21 an hour. That will cost the charity a further \u00a36.7m, it says.",
      "Combined with having to increase wages for other workers as a result of the minimum wage rise, the charity estimates the changes will cost up to \u00a318m a year.",

      "While Churchfields is not under threat, contracts to provide other similar services could be ended, Mencap says.",
      "Among the residents at Churchfields are Barry and Betty. Both use wheelchairs and need round-the-clock support. Betty can speak a few words, but Barry is non-verbal. He often relies on sign language and answering yes/no questions written for him on a white board to communicate.",

      "\"The quality of life you give to these people is the experience they have in their life,\" he says.",

      "October's Budget increased the national minimum wage (NMW) - a move that was expected and welcomed by those running care services in a sector where it is hard to recruit.",
      "However, care organisations say the changes to National Insurance contributions (NICs) will have a big impact - particularly on social care, where many people work part-time and were previously below the threshold to pay the tax.",
      "Mencap says the NICs increase will add at least \u00a3615 to the annual costs of employing each of its staff members.",
      "When that is combined with the rise in the minimum wage, the charity will have to find an extra \u00a312m each year.",

      "Similar worries are widespread across adult social care services. A new report, commissioned by care associations and written by health and care analysts LaingBuisson, says 80-85% of social care in England is provided by small, local organisations, which have little financial resilience.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to determine the evidence - and establish whether the benefits outweigh any potential harms of prescribing puberty blockers to children questioning their gender",
    "story": [
      "It is among the most delicate and controversial challenges in modern medicine - how to determine whether the benefits of puberty blockers (or drugs that delay puberty) outweigh the potential harms.",
      "This question came to the fore in June 2023 when NHS England proposed that in the future, these drugs would only be prescribed to children questioning their gender as part of clinical research.",
      "Since then, a new government has arrived in Westminster and Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he is committed to \"setting up a clinical trial\" to establish the evidence on puberty blockers. The National Institute for Health and Care Research is expected to confirm soon that funding is in place for a trial.",
      "The dilemma that remains is, how will such a trial work?",
      "Eighteen months since the announcement there is still a lack of consensus around how the trial should be conducted. It will also need to be approved by a committee of experts who have to decide, among other things, whether what's being tested might cause undue physical or psychological harm.",
      "But there is a second unanswered question that some, but by no means all, scientists have that is more pressing than the first: is it right to perform this particular trial on children and young people at all?",
      "A rapid rise in referrals",
      "When the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS) was established at London's Tavistock Clinic in 1989, it was the only NHS specialist gender clinic for children in England, and those referred there were typically offered psychological and social support.",
      "Over the last 10 years, however, there has been a rapid increase in referrals - with the greatest increase being people registered female at birth. In a separate development, around the same time the approach of typically offering psychological and social support moved to one of onward referrals to services that prescribed hormone drugs, such as puberty blockers.",
      "Known scientifically as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, puberty blockers work on the brain to stop the rise in sex hormones - oestrogen and testosterone - that accompany puberty. For years, they were prescribed to young patients with gender dysphoria (those who feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex). But in March 2024, NHS England stopped the routine prescribing of puberty blockers to under 18s, as part of an overhaul of children's gender identity services.",
      "NHS England said in a policy statement: \"There is not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of PSH [puberty suppressing hormones] to make the treatment routinely available at this time.\"",
      "The ban was later tightened to apply to private clinics as well.",
      "In April 2024, a review of gender identity services for children and young people, led by Dr Hilary Cass, a past president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, published its final report, which called out the \"field of gender care\" for not taking a cautious and careful approach.",
      "She also reported that the change in practice at GIDS away from one primarily relying on psychological and social support was largely based on a single study that looked at the effect of medical interventions such as puberty blockers on a very narrowly defined group of children and there was a lack of follow up in the longer term.",
      "Elsewhere, some other countries were re-examining puberty blockers too. Scotland paused the use of them while Finland, Sweden, France, Norway, and Denmark have all re-evaluated their positions on medical intervention for under 18s - including puberty blockers - to differing degrees. In other places there is still support for the use of puberty blockers.",
      "In medicine, when there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the benefits of a treatment outweigh the harms - called equipoise - some ethicists argue there's a moral obligation to scientifically study such treatments. But there are some from across the debate who don't think there is equipoise in this case.",
      "The ethical dilemma at the heart of the trial",
      "The BBC has learned details about the arguments going on around the concept of a trial and how it could look. Some argue that there is already evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health, and that in light of this it would be unethical to perform a trial at all because this would mean some young people experiencing gender distress would not be given them.",
      "The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has expressed their concern about the trial for this reason. They support the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery. WPATH, who have faced increasing criticism of their guidelines from some clinicians, say that it is ethically problematic to make participation in a trial the only way to access a type of care that is \"evidence based, widely recognised as medically necessary, and often reported as lifesaving.\"",
      "Meanwhile other clinicians believe there is no good evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health at all. They also point to research that questions the negative impact that the drugs might have on brain development among teenagers, as well as evidence around the negative impact on bone density.",
      "Dr Louise Irvine is a GP and co-chair of the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender which says it is cautious about using medical pathways in gender dysphoric children. She says: \"Given that puberty blockers by definition disrupt a crucial natural phase of human development, the anticipated benefits must be tangible and significant to justify the risk to children.",
      "\"In pushing ahead with a puberty blockers trial, we are concerned that political interests are being prioritised over clinical, ethical and scientific concerns, and over the health and wellbeing of children.\"",
      "The NHS adult gender services holds data that tracks 9,000 young people from the youth service. Some argue that this should be scrutinised before any trial goes ahead as it could provide evidence on, among other things, the potential risks of taking puberty blockers.",
      "But there is a third view held by some others, including Gordon Guyatt, a professor at McMaster University in Canada, who points out that randomised trials are done in \"life-threatening stuff all the time\" where no-one can be sure of the long-term effects of a treatment. In his view it would be \"unethical not to do it\".",
      "\"With only low quality evidence, people's philosophies, their attitudes or their politics, will continue to dominate the discussion,\" he argues. \"If we do not generate better evidence, the destructive, polarised debate will continue.\"",
      "- Dr Cass found the existing research in the field was poor quality and that there was not a reliable enough evidence base to base clinical decisions on. Young people involved in many of the existing studies may have also had interventions including psychological support and other medical treatments and so it was not always possible to disentangle the effect of each different treatment.",
      "- When it comes to suppressing puberty by using drugs, the rationale for doing so \"remains unclear\", Dr Cass said.  One of the original reasons given was to allow time to think by delaying the onset of puberty. But the evidence suggests the vast majority who start on puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones - oestrogen or testosterone. It is not clear why but one theory, the Cass report suggests, is that puberty blockers may, in their own right, change the \"trajectory\" of gender identity development.",
      "- Clinicians \"are unable to determine with any certainty\" which young people \"will go on to have an enduring trans identity\", Dr Cass wrote. In other words, there's a lack of clarity about which young people might benefit in the long term and which may be harmed overall by the process.",
      "How the trial could look",
      "Recruitment for the trial is due to start in 2025, months later than originally anticipated. Young people will likely be referred after a full assessment by specialist clinicians. A lot is still to be determined, including how many participants there will be.",
      "Ultimately the scientists running the trials will need to establish whether people who get an intervention are better off than those who do not. In this case, do the puberty blocking drugs and their effect make the young people better off?",
      "\"Better off\" in this instance includes the extent to which a young person's mental health may be improved if they are happy with their body. Quality of life is determined by various factors including self-confidence and self-esteem. As well as getting the personal views from the young people and parents, the trial could measure actual real life changes, such as time spent in education and time spent with family and friends.",
      "But there are potential harms to study too, such as the possibility of reduced bone density. Some scientists suggest examining the impact on learning using a form of IQ test.",
      "Normal brain development is influenced by both puberty and chronological age, which usually act in tandem during adolescence. It's not clear how this is affected when puberty is suppressed. Brain scans are one way of understanding any effect.",
      "Some scientists believe it may be possible to simply randomly assign trial participants into two groups where one gets puberty blockers, the other gets a placebo and nobody is aware which group they're in.",
      "But others believe a placebo group is impossible. They say the placebo group would go through puberty, realise they weren't on puberty blockers and potentially drop out of the trial or even find other ways to obtain puberty blockers. Either scenario would reduce the validity of the results.",
      "Professor Gordon Guyatt and others have outlined a potential trial where the group of patients not receiving drugs would be made up entirely of children who are keen to socially transition, such as by changing how they dress and altering their name and pronouns. Researchers could then monitor the difference between the groups.",
      "A second possibility is that both trial groups are given puberty blockers but one group gets them after a delay, during which time they receive psychological and emotional support. This would help researchers determine, among other things, whether their gender-related distress subsides during that delay while receiving the support.",
      "Alongside this there would be a \"matched\" control group that doesn't take a placebo or puberty blockers, whether for health reasons or because they don't want to, that get similar tests and scans.",
      "Puberty occurs in stages when different bodily changes occur. A third proposal could involve a second group being given drugs at a later stage in puberty than the first.",
      "This would allow researchers to explore when the right time to give puberty blockers might be. For example, it would enable the researchers to see if starting the drugs early improves wellbeing by reducing gender-specific body changes. They would also be able to see whether starting the drugs earlier has a greater negative impact on bone density and brain development.",
      "Children referred to GIDS also experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and autism compared to the general child population. Trial participants would continue to receive treatment related to these conditions but - so we know any differences in the results from the groups are down to the drug - they will need to be balanced for the above conditions.",
      "All these considerations demonstrate the complexity of trying to obtain evidence in this area that is reliable and definitive.",
      "What parents say",
      "Many parents are watching closely to see how it will play out. Annabel (not her real name) is one of them. She is part of the Bayswater Group, a collection of parents with children who are questioning their gender who say they are \"wary of medical solutions to gender dysphoria\". She began looking into puberty blockers when her own daughter began questioning her gender in her early teens, an option put on the table by GIDS.",
      "Ultimately her daughter decided not to take them. Annabel was not convinced there was enough evidence to show they were beneficial and she was unsure what it would mean for her daughter's long-term physical and psychological health.",
      "Today, she still has unanswered questions - including some further ones around the trial. \"A big concern for me is will this new trial, if it gets approval, give us the evidence that we want? Or will we end up with more weak data that Dr Cass said undermined decision making in this area?\"",
      "Natacha Kennedy, a lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London who researches transgender issues, has examined the results of a survey of 97 parents of young people with gender-related distress that took place following the puberty blockers ban. She believes that puberty blockers should be an option available for young people questioning their gender and that many will not accept being part of a placebo group in a trial.",
      "\"These parents are desperate and if [they] get to a trial and it turns out their child is not being given the actual puberty blockers, then there is no point in them being there,\" she says.",
      "\"There may be some parents who would\u2026 find another way [to obtain the drugs].\"",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Whatever trial format is settled on, more scrutiny will follow. And there will no doubt be fierce debate about the merits of the trial and what it can tell us, as many scientists around the world are watching to see what happens in the UK.",
      "But inevitably, there will be a long wait to fully understand the longer term effects on physical and mental health of those who take puberty blockers - and the long-term effects on those with gender-related distress who don't. Nor do we know how many people detransition, though the Cass report says, \"there is suggestion that numbers are increasing\".",
      "\"We really need to have long-term follow up,\" argues Annabel. \"Can a child possibly understand what that means to their fertility and a loss of sexual function and what that will mean for their future life?\"",
      "For now, she and the scores of parents, carers and young people, can only watch and wait for the trial to begin and for its verdict - and what that means for whether puberty blockers will be prescribed to children once again in the future.",

      "Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the government should not be reaching for the \"easy lever\" of early release, urging the government to instead pursue alternative measures, such as longer sitting hours in the courts.",
      "It comes after prisons were just 100 spaces away from reaching full capacity over the summer.",

      "But Mahmood admitted there could still be another overcrowding crisis despite the extra places, and that building more jails was not the only solution.",
      "\"We will run out,\" she said. \"Demand is still rising faster than any supply could possibly catch up with.\"",
      "\"We're very honest and transparent in the strategy itself that building alone is not enough because the demand is rising more quickly,\" she added.",
      "Jenrick told the Today programme that \"dangerous people\" should not be released early. He added that the government should be \"straining every sinew to get foreign offenders out of our country\".",
      "He added that he would support \"any measure that enables us to build prisons faster,\" even if that meant ignoring local MPs' objections.",

      "The DWP seeks to recover all benefit overpayments where it has a legal basis to do so, unless it would cause financial hardship or would not be cost effective.",
      "The department can also refer a case for prosecution if it considers an overpayment was fraudulent, which happened in 54 cases last year.",
      "As an alternative, it can offer an \"administrative penalty\" of \u00a3350 or 50% of the overpayment, whichever figure is greater, up to a maximum of \u00a35,000.",

      "Combined with having to increase wages for other workers as a result of the minimum wage rise, the charity estimates the changes will cost up to \u00a318m a year.",

      "While Churchfields is not under threat, contracts to provide other similar services could be ended, Mencap says.",
      "Among the residents at Churchfields are Barry and Betty. Both use wheelchairs and need round-the-clock support. Betty can speak a few words, but Barry is non-verbal. He often relies on sign language and answering yes/no questions written for him on a white board to communicate.",

      "\"The quality of life you give to these people is the experience they have in their life,\" he says.",
      "It takes 50 staff to support the people at Churchfields to live full lives. Mencap employs about 7,500 staff across all its services. Many care workers are on low pay.",
      "October's Budget increased the national minimum wage (NMW) - a move that was expected and welcomed by those running care services in a sector where it is hard to recruit.",
      "However, care organisations say the changes to National Insurance contributions (NICs) will have a big impact - particularly on social care, where many people work part-time and were previously below the threshold to pay the tax.",
      "Mencap says the NICs increase will add at least \u00a3615 to the annual costs of employing each of its staff members.",
      "When that is combined with the rise in the minimum wage, the charity will have to find an extra \u00a312m each year.",

      "Similar worries are widespread across adult social care services. A new report, commissioned by care associations and written by health and care analysts LaingBuisson, says 80-85% of social care in England is provided by small, local organisations, which have little financial resilience.",

      "\"We are at a tipping point and need immediate government intervention,\" she says.",
      "Most social care in England is funded by councils. Care providers estimate that just to cover the increased costs of the national minimum wage and NICs fees for their services would need to increase by 9-10% next year.",

      "After a debate lasting six hours in the assembly, the motion passed by 48 to 36 votes.",
      "The arrangement, the Windsor Framework, was agreed between the UK and EU in 2023 and effectively keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods.",
      "The three unionist parties opposed extending the arrangements while Sinn F\u00e9in, Alliance and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) were among those who voted in favour.",
      "Controversially, unlike other votes at Stormont, there was no requirement for cross-community support for the motion. A simple majority was enough.",
      "The motion was tabled jointly by Sinn F\u00e9in, Alliance and the SDLP.",
      "The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and other unionist parties argued the vote created a democratic deficit as the concerns of unionists, who are in the minority at Stormont, could be ignored.",

      "\"This democratic safeguard has provided the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland with a say over the trading arrangements that will apply over the next four years.",
      "\"I will now proceed as required by the law, including to commission an independent review.",

      "She said the Windsor Framework was \"causing serious issues\" which were \"ideological, constitutional and in relation to the practical trade implications\".",
      "\"What we are dealing with today leads directly from Boris's botched Brexit deal - and it isn't working,\" she added.",
      "Criticising the lack of a cross-community vote, she said: \"This is the first and only key decision that this house will be voting on that absolutely tears asunder the key values and principles that other parties in this chamber championed around the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.\"",
      "She added: \"It's only consensus and inclusion if it is a matter that is important to you, but not if it's a matter that's important to unionism. It is absolutely appalling.",
      "\"This quite frankly is a rigged vote.\"",

      "\"A rigged vote, which the European Union already know the outcome of,\" he told the assembly.",
      "Buckley said the NI Protocol had \"destabilised Northern Ireland's political landscape, fuelled division and shattered trust\" and the \"rigged nature of today's vote is evidence of that\".",
      "\"Never has there been a more clear example of a zombie assembly than today,\" he added.",
      "\"Members will vote on giving the authority for the EU parliament to take control of over 300 areas of law, allow them to decide the regulations by which our businesses and consumers will operate by.\"",
      "Assembly member Kellie Armstrong of the Alliance Party, which does not designate as either nationalist or unionist in the assembly, welcomed the vote, which will be decided by a simple majority.",
      "Her party leader Naomi Long said the Windsor Framework was \"the only game in town\".",
      "She told the assembly it was \"simply not possible to entirely square the circle of the challenges and contradictions posed by Brexit\".",
      "But she said that \"if we rebuild trust and apply creativity, I believe we can and must lessen the impact\".",
      "\"While the Windsor Framework is far from perfect, it clearly provides for that softer landing that we need,\" she said.",
      "Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) assembly member Steve Aiken said Northern Ireland's post-Brexit arrangements were not the \"best of both worlds\" which some had argued.",
      "\"We delude ourselves by pretending that we somehow are in a uniquely positive position,\" he said.",
      "Aiken added: \"An accumulation of changes are making us increasingly diverge from our largest market - our own nation.\"",
      "He said Northern Ireland was being \"increasingly sucked into a morass of excessive legislation and rules\".",
      "The former UUP leader said all assembly members should be voting to reject the articles of the Windsor Framework to \"categorically say that we want to be heard, and have a say on the laws that affect us\".",
      "SDLP assembly member Matthew O'Toole, leader of the opposition in the assembly, said Northern Ireland's trade arrangements had offered some protection from the \"disaster\" of Brexit.",
      "He said leaving the European Union had \"fundamentally damaged the UK economy\" but that \"Northern Ireland has had some protections from Brexit\".",
      "O'Toole told the assembly there were \"challenges\" from the Northern Ireland Protocol which \"need to be worked on\".",
      "But he said the deal between the UK government and European Union was \"necessary because of Brexit, because of a hard Brexit chosen by people who did not have the interests of this place at heart\".",

      "What is the Windsor Framework?",
      "In 2023 the Northern Ireland Protocol became the Windsor Framework.",
      "It means that goods traded across the border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU country, has remained undisturbed by Brexit.",
      "The flipside is that goods arriving from elsewhere in the UK are subject to controls and checks\u2014what is known as the Irish Sea border.",
      "For the EU, the new framework left the basic architecture of 2019's protocol intact, creating a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland to prevent a hard land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.",

      "The SDF is holding around 10,000 fighters in 26 detention facilities, and is also holding almost 46,000 people linked to IS, most of them women and children, at the al-Hol and Roj camps.",
      "The primary risk of jihadists breaking out of prisons in north-east Syria comes from Turkey putting so much pressure on the Syrian Kurds who are guarding them that they have to abandon them. However, there is no indication that is the case at the moment, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said.",
      "Given the rapidly changing situation in Syria, there is an underlying risk that IS and al-Qaeda could try and profit from the confusion and expand their area of operations in northern Syria, he added.",

So far, they have pushed the SDF out of Tal Rifaat and Manbij, and Syrian Kurds fear that more of the areas they control will now come under attack.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 12:40:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Pat McFadden says the civil service needs more \"disrupters\" to come up with new ideas to problems.",
    "story": [
      "A cabinet minister has urged \"disrupters\" to join the civil service in a bid to make government \"think a little bit more like a start-up\".",
      "Pat McFadden, who oversees the Cabinet Office, said officials needed a greater \"appetite for risk\" to deliver public services more effectively.",
      "In a speech, he said he wanted Whitehall to follow the \"test and learn culture\" at leading tech companies.",
      "He insisted he was not criticising civil servants themselves, after a row over remarks by Sir Keir Starmer last week.",
      "The prime minister was accused by a civil service union boss of using \"Trumpian language\" after saying too many officials were \"comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline\".",
      "Many civil servants want change, Starmer insists",
      "Starmer and Dominic Cummings now agree on one thing - the civil service is a problem",
      "Sir Keir's speech reflected frustration that some in government have privately expressed about the civil service's effectiveness.",
      "But in a speech in east London, McFadden struck a more conciliatory tone, noting that civil servants themselves were \"frustrated\" by the way government works.",
      "\"The people are good, but the systems and structures that they work in are too often outdated,\" he added.",
      "Nevertheless, he added that he did want to see a shake-up to civil service recruitment processes to encourage outsiders to apply.",
      "Referencing a high-profile call from Boris Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings for \"weirdos and misfits\" to enter government, he said he wanted to see more \"creative thinkers\" take on policy problems.",
      "\"Whatever term you want to use, we do want innovators and disrupters and original thinkers,\" he added.",
      "This included shaking up a recruitment process that can seem \"mind-bogglingly bureaucratic and off-putting\" to outsiders, he added.",
      "Pay 'challenge'",
      "His department has confirmed a third wave of recruitment for a scheme under which tech workers are encouraged to join the civil service for secondments lasting between six months to a year.",
      "Under the Innovation Fellowship Programme, set up by the previous Conservative government, recruits are paid a salary up to \u00a385,000 to help find technology-based solutions to problems in delivering public services.",
      "However, he admitted that public service pay constraints would likely prove a \"challenge\" when it came to enticing new recruits from tech companies.",
      "\"Many of the people probably could earn more working in the private sector, so we are appealing to their sense of public service,\" he conceded.",
      "The cabinet minister also said he wanted to see increased take-up of new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) to improve public services - something also promised by the previous government.",
      "Whereas the Conservatives framed technology as a way to cut the size of the civil service, however, McFadden said he did not have a \"target for headcount\" and his \"focus\" was on making officials more productive.",
      "'Glib platitudes'",
      "He also confirmed details of two projects to test out a new model of using \"test and learn teams\" to find \"innovative ways to fix problems\".",
      "Two early pilots, to begin in January, will see officials asked to improve the delivery of temporary accommodation to homeless families in Essex and Liverpool, and family support in Manchester and South Yorkshire.",
      "The model will then be deployed to help the government hit new \"milestones\" set out by the prime minister last week, including ending hospital backlogs and improving neighbourhood policing.",
      "Shadow Cabinet Office minister Richard Holden said Labour would \"swell the size and cost of the state\", adding that it had opposed Tory plans before the election to shrink the civil service to pre-Brexit levels.",
      "\"Labour ministers talk tough, but from bitter experience we know that's all it is - glib platitudes and broken promises with British taxpayers picking up the bill,\" he added.",

      "The speed of the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria is giving us a real-time insight into the dilemmas of foreign policy.",
      "The solid becoming fluid in the blink of an eye, and a whole array of awkward questions being posed.",
      "A dictator flees, his regime collapses and Foreign Secretary David Lammy addresses the Commons, telling MPs that Assad is a \"monster,\" a \"butcher\" a \"drug dealer\" and a \"rat\".",
      "But things are moving quickly.",
      "Asylum applications suspended",
      "When asked whether the UK would be suspending asylum applications from Syria, Lammy indicated that he didn't know.",
      "He didn't know that his cabinet colleague, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, was saying, at pretty much exactly that moment, that they were being suspended.",
      "In the year to September, the fifth largest number of asylum claims by nationality came from Syrians and nearly every claim - 99% - were granted.",
      "But the government is now pausing applications, alongside France, Germany and others.",
      "Why?",
      "The main reason is that the vast majority of people applying for asylum from Syria were doing so, they said, because they were fleeing the Assad regime.",
      "That regime has now gone and therefore so has, on the face of it, the central case being made in most applications.",
      "The other reason, described as much less significant in numerical terms but still a potential cause for concern on security grounds, is Syrians associated with the failed regime themselves now trying to claim asylum.",
      "Figures in government are now also contemplating the prospect that some Syrians in the UK may now want to return to their home country.",

      "That is one thing, when it is an organisation it doesn't want to have anything to do with, quite another if it ends up being the recognised government of a country.",
      "So how soon could HTS be de-proscribed?",
      "Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden, one of the most senior figures in the government, told the BBC there could be a \"relatively swift decision\" on whether to talk to HTS.",
      "But fast forward a few hours and both the foreign secretary and the prime minister were emphasising a much slower pace, saying \u2013 in line with the message from the White House \u2013 that HTS would be judged on its actions, with the implication this could take time and would not be rushed.",

      "No, they are not talking about Cummings\u2019s views on Brexit or Elon Musk. They are talking about \u2018Whitehall\u2019 - the shorthand by which the political class refers to the tangle of institutions and civil servants whose job it is to implement the government\u2019s agenda.",
      "In Whitehall, Cummings has long argued, \u201cfailure is normal\u201d while \u201cconfident public school bluffers\u201d - rather than people with real policy expertise - reign supreme.",
      "Generations of politicians have made similar critiques but rarely with such freewheeling intensity.",

      "Another added: \u201cThe Cummings analysis is where we are in lots of ways.\"",
      "One senior government source said: \u201cDominic Cummings was right about Whitehall. But I blame him and the Conservative Party for 14 years of low pay, bad leadership and demoralisation which means we don\u2019t have the right people in the right places.\u201d",
      "Wherever the blame is ascribed for Whitehall\u2019s deficiencies, the frustration is beginning to spill into public view.",
      "Peter Hyman, the Labour adviser who came up with Sir Keir's \u2018missions\u2019 but did not follow him into government, wrote in the New Statesman last week that there were \u201cbarriers within the state\u201d to delivering Starmer\u2019s agenda.",
      "He said it was \u201castonishing\u201d how many senior civil servants still relied on \u201cclunky cabinet committees\u201d and old-fashioned processes.",

      "Yet vague aspirations to move the prime minister and his team into the Cabinet Office next door and turn Downing Street into state rooms to entertain dignitaries \u2014 yes, also previously discussed by Cummings  - are likely to remain just that.",
      "\u201cCan you imagine how long it would take the civil service to make that happen?\u201d an official sighed.",
      "Plenty would think this unfair on the civil service, which has often found itself a scapegoat for failings of politicians but cannot publicly answer back.",
      "After all, Labour figures acknowledge they were nowhere near as ready for government as they needed to be. That was in part the reason for the rapid departure of Sue Gray, Sir Keir\u2019s initial chief of staff, after just three months in post.",
      "Certainly even among those civil servants who are alive to Whitehall\u2019s systemic flaws there is a view that the prime minister himself needs to be much more active in driving the machine if he wants to achieve results.",
      "\u201cStarmer appears to confuse process with outcomes,\u201d one said.",
      "\u201cYou can set up a child poverty taskforce, OK. But what do you want to do about the two-child benefit cap? You still have to make political choices and officials can\u2019t do that for you.\u201d",
      "As well as setting up a child poverty taskforce, Sir Keir has formed a series of \u2018mission boards\u2019 designed to drive through his agenda in each of those five core areas.",
      "Each is chaired by the relevant minister - for example, the health mission board is chaired by Wes Streeting, the health secretary.",
      "Alex Thomas, a former senior civil servant who is now at the Institute for Government think tank, suggested that Sir Keir himself would be a better chair for those boards if he wants \u201caction and dynamism across the system.\u201d",
      "Thomas said: \u201cThe British system of government responds to ministerial and particularly prime ministerial involvement and leadership \u2026 If you leave it to the civil service, however much talent there is, it will end up missing the mark because it lacks that political direction and that authority.\u201d",
      "Those around Starmer acknowledge that the mission boards are not yet quite at full strength. They will soon become more public-facing entities, holding meetings outside of London and doing more to bring in expertise from outside government.",
      "Stocktaking",
      "But the principal way in which the prime minister will seek to drive his agenda is via \u201cstock takes\u201d. These are meetings where Sir Keir brings those responsible for each mission into Downing Street to hold them accountable for what the data is showing in their area and asking them how they propose to improve. It\u2019s an idea which was pioneered by Sir Tony Blair on the advice of Michael Barber, his delivery adviser, who recently returned to government.",
      "The frequency of these stocktakes will soon increase, a senior government source said, adding: \u201cIf we are saying that this is the mission of the government and this is how people should judge its success and failure then it is clearly something you need the PM driving through.\u201d",
      "In the next few weeks Pat McFadden, the cabinet minister helping the prime minister to coordinate policy across Whitehall, will give a speech with more detail on the government\u2019s plans for civil service reform.",
      "Both he and Sir Keir are said to be seized of the need to bring more outside expertise into government and to make better use of data and artificial intelligence.",
      "The government\u2019s stated aims here are bold. Announcing the appointment of Sir Chris Wormald this week as the new cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, Sir Keir charged him with \u201cnothing less than the complete re-wiring of the British state\u201d.",
      "There was no shortage of people in Whitehall questioning whether the longest-serving head of a government department  - Sir Chris has run the health department for eight years and education for four before that  - is the right person to transform Whitehall. Sir Chris's supporters say that within the current system he is one of those most open to reform.",
      "The appointment was received with open contempt by Cummings, who sarcastically described it as a \u201ctruly beautiful, artistic\u201d decision which should serve as a \u201cwake up call\u201d that \u201cthe Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change\u201d.",
      "And on that, at the very least, the success of this government depends on Dominic Cummings being wrong."

      "The light from Firefly Sparkle is from not long after the creation of the Universe and so has taken more than 13 billion years to reach us. It is so small and so far away that not even JWST would have been able to see it, were it not for an extremely lucky cosmic coincidence.",

    "summary": "The long-awaited decision follows a standoff with Meta, and succeeds a world-first law from 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's government says it will create new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news.",
      "The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms.",
      "Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers.",
      "The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; \u00a3125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes.",
      "The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok.",
      "In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was \"charging one industry to subsidise another\".",
      "Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers.",
      "\"Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,\" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday.",
      "The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content.",
      "That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms.",
      "As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers.",
      "Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere.",
      "\"We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content\u2026 news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,\" it said in a statement in February.",
      "The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as \"a fundamental dereliction\" of Meta's \"responsibility to its Australian users\".",
      "\"The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,\" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time.",
      "The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.",
      "The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue."

      "However experts say Willow is, for now, a largely experimental device, meaning a quantum computer powerful enough to solve a wide range of real-world problems is still years - and billions of dollars - away.",
      "The quantum quandary",

      "They harness quantum mechanics - the strange behaviour of ultra-tiny particles - to crack problems far faster than traditional computers.",
      "It's hoped quantum computers might eventually be able to use that ability to vastly speed up complex processes, such as creating new medicines.",
      "There are also fears it could be used for ill -  for example to break some types of encryption used to protect sensitive data.",
      "In February Apple announced that the encryption that protects iMessage chats is being made \"quantum proof\" to stop them being read by powerful future quantum computers.",
      "Hartmut Neven leads Google's Quantum AI lab that created Willow and describes himself as the project's \"chief optimist.\"",
      "He told the BBC that Willow would be used in some practical applications - but declined, for now, to provide more detail.",
      "But a chip able to perform commercial applications would not appear before the end of the decade, he said.",
      "Initially these applications would be the simulation of systems where quantum effects are important",

      "What is quantum computing?",
      "Apples and oranges",
      "Mr Neven told the BBC Willow's performance meant it was the \"best quantum processor built to date\".",
      "But Professor Alan Woodward, a computing expert at Surrey University, says quantum computers will be better at a range of tasks than current \"classical\" computers, but they will not replace them.",
      "He warns against overstating the importance of Willow's achievement in a single test.",
      "\"One has to be careful not to compare apples and oranges\" he told the BBC.",
      "Google had chosen a problem to use as a benchmark of performance that was, \"tailor-made for a quantum computer\" and this didn't demonstrate \"a universal speeding up when compared to classical computers\".",
      "Nonetheless, he said Willow represented significant progress, in particular in what's known as error correction.",
      "In very simple terms the more useful a quantum computer is, the more qubits it has.",
      "However a major problem with the technology is that it is prone to errors - a tendency that has previously increased the more qubits a chip has.",
      "But Google researchers say they have reversed this and managed to engineer and program the new chip so the error rate fell across the whole system as the number of qubits increased.",
      "It was a major \"breakthrough\" that cracked a key challenge that the field had pursued \"for almost 30 years\", Mr Neven believes.",

    "story": [
      "Embattled South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has defended his shock decision to declare martial law last week, saying he did it to protect the country's democracy.",
      "In a surprise televised address on Thursday, he said the attempt was a legal decision to \"prevent the collapse\" of democracy and counter the opposition's \"parliamentary dictatorship\".",
      "Yoon has suggested that he would not step down ahead of a second vote to impeach him in parliament on Saturday.",
      "\"I will stand firm whether I'm impeached or investigated,\" he said. \"I will fight to the end\".",
      "The president and his allies are facing investigations on insurrection charges, and he and several of them have been banned from leaving South Korea.",
      "On Thursday, the opposition-led parliament voted to impeach police chief Cho Ji-ho and justice minister Park Sung-jae. The two officials have been immediately suspended.",
      "Unlike impeachment motions against presidents, which require 200 votes in the 300-strong National Assembly to be passed, other officials can be impeached with 150 votes.",
      "In his address, his first since his apology over the weekend, Yoon denied that his martial law order was an act of insurrection, claiming that his political rivals were creating \"false incitement\" to bring him down.",
      "Yoon repeated many of the same arguments that he used on the night he declared martial law: that the opposition was dangerous, and that by seizing control, he had been trying to protect the public and defend democracy.",
      "However, Yoon added that he would not avoid his \"legal and political responsibilities\".",
      "On Saturday, an attempt by opposition lawmakers to impeach the president failed after members of his own ruling People Power Party (PPP) boycotted the vote. But opposition members are set to hold another impeachment vote this weekend and have vowed to hold one every Saturday until Yoon is removed from office.",
      "The floor leader of the PPP, Choo Kyung-ho, stepped down after the failed impeachment attempt, and on Thursday the party elected Kwon Seong-dong, a Yoon loyalist, as his replacement.",
      "Kwon told reporters on Thursday that he would hold discussions with PPP lawmakers on whether they should continue opposing Yoon's impeachment.",

      "If South Korea's parliament passes an impeachment bill, a trial would be held by the Constitutional Court. Two-thirds of that court would have to sustain the majority for Yoon to be removed from office permanently.",
      "Yoon has been a lame duck president since the opposition won the April general election by a landslide - his government has not been able to pass the laws it wanted and has been reduced to vetoing bills proposed by the opposition.",
      "Yoon also accused North Korea sympathisers of trying to undermine his government when he declared martial law on the night of 3 December.",

    "summary": "For the first time, the annual report delved into race and ethnic data of those who underwent assisted dying.",
    "story": [
      "The rate of medical assistance in dying - also known as euthanasia - has grown in Canada for the fifth straight year, albeit at a slower pace.",
      "The country released its fifth annual report since legalising assisted dying in 2016, which for the first time included data on the ethnicity of those seeking euthanasia.",
      "Around 15,300 people underwent assisted dying last year, accounting for 4.7% of deaths in the country. Canada lawmakers are currently seeking to expand access to euthanasia to cover people with mental illnesses by 2027.",
      "Canada is among a few countries that have introduced assisted dying laws in the past decade. Others include Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Austria.",
      "The figures released on Wednesday by Health Canada show that the rate of assisted dying in Canada increased by nearly 16% in 2023. This number is a sharp drop from the average increase of 31% in previous years.",
      "The report cautioned that it is too early to determine what caused the rate to slacken.",
      "Nearly all of those who requested assisted dying - around 96% - had a foreseeable natural death. The remaining 4% were granted euthanasia due to having a long-term chronic illness and where a natural death was not imminent.",
      "The average age of those seeking assisted dying was around 77 years old, with cancer being the most frequent underlying medical condition.",
      "For the first time, the report delved into race and ethnic data of those who died by euthanasia.",
      "Around 96% of recipients identified as white people, who account for about 70% of Canada's population. It is unclear what caused this disparity.",
      "The second most reported ethnic group was east Asians (1.8%), who account for about 5.7% of Canadians.",
      "Assisted dying continued to have the highest usage rate in Quebec, which accounted for nearly 37% of all euthanasia deaths, despite the province holding just 22% of Canada's population.",
      "Quebec's government launched a study earlier this year to examine why its euthanasia rate was so high.",
      "While the number of assisted deaths in Canada is growing, the country still falls behind the Netherlands, where euthanasia accounted for around 5% of total deaths last year.",
      "UK MPs voted late last month to pass a similar bill that gives terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death, though it will face months of further scrutiny before it could become law.",
      "As British MPs debated the legislation, Canada was cited by some as a cautionary tale due to its perceived lack of safeguards.",
      "Like the UK, Canada initially only legalised assisted dying for those whose death was \"reasonably foreseeable\".",
      "However, Canada expanded access in 2021 to people who may not have a terminal diagnosis, but want to end their life because of a chronic, debilitating condition.",
      "It was set to broaden access once again to people with mental illnesses earlier this year.",
      "But that was delayed for the second time after concerns were raised by Canadian provinces, which oversee healthcare delivery, about whether the system could cope with such an expansion.",
      "On Wednesday, Health Canada defended the procedure, saying that the criminal code sets out \"strict eligibility\" criteria.",
      "But Cardus, a Christian think tank, said the latest figures were \"alarming\" and showed Canada has one of the fastest growing euthanasia programmes in the world.",
      "A report released in October by Ontario - Canada's most populous province - has since shed some light on controversial cases where people were granted assisted dying when they were not nearing their natural death.",
      "One example included a woman in her 50s with a history of depression and suicidal thoughts who had a severe sensitivity to chemicals.",
      "Her request for euthanasia was granted after she failed to secure housing that could have met her medical needs.",
      "Another case made headlines in recent months of a Nova Scotia cancer patient who said she was asked if she was aware of assisted dying as an option twice as she underwent mastectomy surgeries.",
      "The question \"came up in completely inappropriate places\", she told the National Post.",

      "Forensic and ballistic evidence that police say ties the accused murderer of healthcare insurance CEO Brian Thompson to the crime scene will make it difficult for his lawyers to mount a defence, former prosecutors and other legal experts say.",

      "New York authorities say fingerprints and shell casings link him to the crime scene.",

      "Images taken by Maxar on 10 December show some ships have left Tartous naval base since Sunday and are currently sitting offshore in the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "Meanwhile, other photos taken on the same day show activity continuing at Russia's main airbase in Syria, Hmeimim, with jets clearly visible on the tarmac.",
      "On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would enter talks with incoming authorities about Russia's future military presence.",
      "\"Everything possible is now being done to get in touch with those involved in ensuring security and, of course, our military is also taking all the necessary precautions,\" he told reporters in Moscow.",
      "He previously warned that it was \"premature\" to speculate on the bases' future.",
      "\"You know that, of course, we maintain contacts with those who control the situation in Syria now. This is necessary because we have our bases there and our diplomatic office [embassy]. And of course, ensuring the safety and security of our facilities are of utmost importance,\" he told reporters.",
      "The Tartous naval facility houses elements of the Black Sea Fleet and is Russia's only repair and replenishment hub in the Mediterranean. Established by the Soviet Union in the 1970s, it was expanded and modernised by Russia in 2012 as the Kremlin began to increase its support for President Assad's regime.",
      "It allows Russian vessels to remain in the Mediterranean without having to return to ports in the Black Sea via the Turkish Straits. It is also a deep-water port, meaning it can host submarines from Moscow's nuclear fleet, according to the US Naval Institute.",
      "The new satellite images show Moscow has at least temporarily brought its ships out of the port, with two guided missile frigates moored about 13km (eight miles) off the Syrian coast. It is unclear where the remainder of the fleet - pictured in earlier images - currently is.",
      "It is also unclear whether their departure is part of a permanent withdrawal from Tartous. In recent weeks, satellite images have repeatedly shown naval vessels coming and going from the port.",
      "Mike Plunkett from the open-source defence intelligence analysts at Janes organisation noted that the Russian movements appeared to have been \"conducted to ensure that their ships are not vulnerable to attack\".",
      "\"Whether they are worried about attack from the Syrian rebels or collateral damage from any Israeli strike on Syrian assets in Tartus is unknown,\" he added.",
      "Frederik Van Lokeren, a former Belgian navy captain and analyst, told BBC Verify that it appeared the Russian vessels were now in a holding pattern while Moscow deliberated on its next move.",
      "\"They're effectively in limbo at the moment, because they don't quite know what's going to happen,\" Mr Van Lokeren said.",
      "\"Obviously, since they're lingering there, it seems that Russia is not willing to withdraw all its naval vessels out of the area just yet, which might be an indication that they're negotiating with regional partners to see where they can redeploy these vessels.\"",
      "Analysts have speculated that if Russia is forced to close the Tartous naval facility, it could redeploy its presence to Tobruk in Libya. The region is controlled by the Kremlin-backed Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and already hosts some Russian airbases.",
      "But withdrawing from Tartous would be immensely costly, and Mr Van Lokeren noted that the move would also bring Russian vessels closer to Nato bases, making them easier to track. For now, he said, there is no indication that Russia is moving the necessary naval assets to remove equipment from Tartous.",

      "Satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify showed at least two large jets - identified by Janes as IL-76 transport aircraft - still sitting on the tarmac at the base on 10 December. Helicopters could also be seen at the base in the images.",
      "Janes also notes that air defence systems deployed at the site remain visible in the north-western corner of the image.",
      "Dara Massicot, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said on X on Sunday that an evacuation of the airbase would involve a massive airlift requiring far more jets than those visible in the satellite images, suggesting that Moscow does not plan to evacuate imminently.",

      "\"A change signifying a major evacuation will be clear,\" she added.",

      "On the second day of his trip, Mr Kamalmaz - who was born in Syria but grew up and lived in the US - was stopped at a Syrian government checkpoint in Damascus, and has not been seen or heard from since that day.",

      "Both prime ministers have sought to downplay the security aspect of the deals, framing them instead as a boon to what Mr Nobetau says has been a \"thinning\" relationship between the two countries.",
      "Marape made a point to say the agreement \"doesn't stop us from relating with any nation, especially our Asian neighbours\".",
      "\"We relate with China, for instance, a great trading partner, a great bilateral partner,\" he said. \"But in security, closer to home\u2026 our shared territory needs to be protected, defended, policed\u2026 together.\"",
      "Government sources say the deals do not give Australia veto power over PNG security agreements. But their framing does have the effect of eliminating almost every other potential partner - and Mr Nobetau said the announcement could be seen by some in PNG as \"an exertion of Australian power over PNG sovereignty\".",
      "Both he and Dr Murray also note, however, that the dual deals speak to an emerging \"transactional\" dynamic in Pacific relations.",
      "\"People that talk about goodwill and who say sport and politics don't mix, that's the 20th century view,\" Dr Murray said. \"For us, there's no way we're going to give away one of our prize cultural assets for nothing. That doesn't happen in diplomacy.\"",
      "Dr Murray and Mr Nobetau also both agree that the deals mark a significant moment in bilateral relations between the two countries - and are a likely indicator of how Australia is going to continue to pursue its agenda across the region.",
      "\"China puts in a lot of money into sport infrastructure\u2026 which is sort of what China is good at\u2026 [but] China is not going to be offering any alternatives in this space,\" Mr Nobetau said.",
      "\"It's something that other countries can't do,\" Dr Murray added. \"We need to use it, especially in a very, very contested region such as the Pacific.\""

      "A French prosecutor has requested two years of house arrest for Ruggia, 59, who Haenel has said assaulted her in the early 2000s when she was between 12 and 15 and he was in his late 30s.",
      "Ruggia has said the accusations of sexual molestation are \"pure lies\".",
      "He also accused Haenel of wanting to take revenge on him for not hiring her for any more roles after she starred in his 2002 film Les Diables (The Devils).",
      "Haenel has said she was controlled and manipulated by Ruggia when she was a child and that nobody protected her when she was \"asked to do things in the name of art\".",
      "She alleges that Ruggia started molesting her during the shoot, when she was 12.",
      "Haenel, who starred in the acclaimed 2019 film Portrait of a Lady on Fire, publicly quit the French film industry last year because of what she said was its \"general complacency\" towards sexual predators.",
      "In 2019, she gave a lengthy and emotional interview to French outlet Mediapart in which she detailed what she called the \"sexual harassment\" she suffered at Ruggia's hands.",
      "She said she had decided to speak out about her alleged abuse after watching the documentary Leaving Neverland, which explored the singer Michael Jackson's relationships with children.",
      "\"It made me see I had clung for too long to the version of Ruggia, that it had all been a story of love,\" she said, adding that it made her understand the mechanisms of \"control and fascination\".",
      "Haenel said that on set Ruggia would touch her constantly, kiss her on the cheek, put his hands on her hips and call her \"my darling\" and \"sweetie\", and that he progressively isolated her from her family, telling her parents not to come to the film set to avoid distracting her.",
      "Other actors and technicians on the set told Mediapart of the unhealthy atmosphere.",
      "A summary of the charges quoted by French media says Ruggia and Haenel continued to see each other every Saturday after the shooting of Les Diables wrapped up, \"under the guise of film lessons\" during which Ruggia would allegedly touch her sexually and put his hands in her underwear.",
      "Investigators said they had found notes on Ruggia's computer in which he wrote about 12-year-old Haenel's \"overflowing sensuality\".",
      "When she eventually cut off links with him, he kept writing her numerous letters, according to the charge sheet. She later plunged into a deep depression which lasted until she was 28, she said.",
      "\"When I was under his thumb I felt dirty and wanted to die,\" Haenel told investigators.",

      "At the trial, prosecutor Camille Poch said she had \"no doubt\" the allegations were truthful and said Ruggia's defence was \"unlikely\". \"He made the choice to sexually assault her. He had his whole conscience as a grown man to decide to act otherwise.\"",

      "Most of the 50 all come from towns and villages in a 50km (30-mile) radius of the Pelicots' own village of Mazan.",
      "Some defence lawyers have seen in their ordinariness a valuable line of defence. \"Ordinary people do extraordinary things,\" said Antoine Minier, a lawyer representing three defendants.",
      "\"I think almost everybody could end up in a situation - well, maybe not exactly like this one - but could be susceptible to committing a serious crime,\" he told the BBC.",
      "'My body raped her, but my brain didn't'",
      "Prosecutors have based their sentencing demands to the court on aggravating factors. How many times the defendants came to the Pelicot home, whether they  touched Gis\u00e8le Pelicot sexually, and if they penetrated her.",

He was  knowingly HIV-positive and is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on six separate occasions without wearing protection - although his lawyer told the court he had treatment for several years and couldn't have transmitted the virus.",
      "Prosecutors have been able to go into this level of detail because, unusually for a rape trial, there is a staggering amount of evidence, as the alleged assaults were filmed over almost a decade by Dominique Pelicot.",
      "He has admitted all the charges against him and has told the court all 50 of his co-accused are guilty too.",
      "All the video evidence means none of the men have been able to deny they ever went to the Pelicots' home. But the majority vehemently contest the charges of aggravated rape that would incur hefty sentences.",
      "France's rape law defines rape as any sexual act committed by \"violence, coercion, threat or surprise\"; it has no reference to any need for consent.",

      "Usually in rape cases character investigations can take several days.",

      "Fabien S, a 39-year-old man with several previous convictions including drug dealing and sexual assault of a minor, was abused and beaten by foster parents from a very young age. Like several others, he said he only realised during psychiatrist appointments ordered by the court that his hazy, painful childhood memories actually constituted rape.",
      "Many wives, partners and family members of the defendants were called up to give character statements. They, too, scrambled for answers as they sought to understand how the men in their lives could have ended up \"caught up in this kind of situation\", as one woman put it.",

I don't understand what he's doing here at all.'\"  She believed it was the death of their 18-year-old son that had led her ex-husband to fall into a deep depression, start drinking and eventually make contact with Dominique Pelicot.",

      "The Onion said the bid was secured with the backing of families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, who won a $1.5bn (\u00a31.18bn) defamation lawsuit against Jones for spreading false rumours about the massacre.",
      "Judge Lopez said the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee who ran the auction made \"a good-faith error\".",
      "Instead of quickly asking for final offers in the auction they should have encouraged more bidding between The Onion and a company affiliated with Jones' supplement-selling businesses, he said.",
      "\"This should have been opened back up, and it should have been opened back up for everybody,\" Judge Lopez said.",
      "Jones celebrated the judge's ruling on Infowars, calling the auction process \"ridiculous\" and \"fraudulent.\"",

      "The firm will continue its efforts to buy Infowars, he added.",
      "Jones was a fringe figure broadcasting in Austin, Texas in the 1990s and later built an audience of millions with a mix of opinion, speculation and outright fabrication.",
      "The company makes most of its money through an online shop selling vitamins and other products.",
      "The company's \u2013 and Jones's \u2013 financial difficulties stem from broadcasts made after the December 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.",
      "Twenty young children and six school staff were killed in the attack.",
      "After the killings, Jones and guests on his broadcasts repeatedly called into question whether the massacre actually occurred, floating conspiracy theories about whether the murders were faked or carried out by government agents.",
      "At one point Jones called the attack \"a giant hoax\" and in 2015 he said: \"Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured\u2026 I knew they had actors there clearly, but I thought they killed some real kids, and it just shows how bold they are, that they clearly used actors.\"",
      "Believers in the web of conspiracy theories that Jones spun harassed the families of the Sandy Hook victims, in some cases sending them pictures of their dead children or of gravestones and posting their personal information online.",
      "Some travelled to Newtown to \"investigate\", and several people have been arrested in connection with harassment of the victims.",
      "Jones later acknowledged that the killings were real and insisted his statements were covered by US free speech protections.",
      "But relatives of the victims won defamation judgements against Jones and his company over his false statements.",
      "He declared bankruptcy in 2022 as the Sandy Hook case made its way to court, and in June 2024, a judge ordered the liquidation of Jones's personal assets. This included a multimillion-dollar ranch, other properties, cars, boats and guns, in all totalling around $8.6m according to a court filing."

      "US states each have different laws and judicial systems and the process involved in the transfer of fugitives could take days or weeks.",

      "Several years have passed since Cristina and her team, an elite unit of Spanish police detectives, rescued \"Victoria\" from a sex trafficking ring.",
      "When they found her, Victoria's life was hanging by a thread - for three years, she had suffered such an extreme level of physical and emotional abuse that she barely felt human. It was the hope of seeing her children again that helped her survive.",
      "The police investigation has now ended, but the relationship with Cristina and the rest of the team hasn't. They have continued to play a substantive role in her life - from something as powerful as reuniting her with her children after years apart, to something smaller but no less meaningful: surprising her with a cake on her birthday.",
      "It is an autumn afternoon and Victoria [not her real name] gets emotional as soon as she sees Cristina and her colleagues arrive with their present in her local park. She is smiling and glad to celebrate another year with them, but Victoria, in her 40s, says the past was \"tough\".",
      "Her childhood in her native Colombia was brutal. Her father disappeared on his way to work one morning in 1986, leaving no trace. Her mother remarried another man who Victoria says raped her younger sister. As the eldest child, she was keen to get a job in order to rescue her siblings from hardship. When a friend introduced her to a woman who offered her a cleaning job in Spain, Victoria thought she had finally struck lucky.",
      "But what awaited her in Europe was another kind of misery. She was immediately forced into prostitution.",
      "\"I worked 24 hours a day,\" she says. \"I had to sleep with my make-up on and you always had to be [only] in your underwear, ready for any customer who would arrive.\"",
      "We can't give details of her rescue, because as a protected witness we need to conceal her identity, but Victoria says she will never forget that sunny morning when she first saw the detectives and ran towards them.",
      "\"I looked at them, hugged them and cried,\" she recalls. \"They offered to take me to a safe place, where I could be free without fear.\"",
      "Victoria says she was so traumatised by the gang's continual surveillance that she was even asking for permission to sleep.",
      "Since then, in partnership with other organisations, Cristina and her team have helped Victoria access psychological support, as well as advice on how to find a job and progress her studies.",
      "More significantly, they also worked for months to help ensure the safety of her children.",
      "The gang that lured Victoria to Spain had threatened to hurt them back home in Colombia if she ever dared to escape or alert the authorities.",
      "They were highly organised and unlikely to be bluffing - the traffickers had texted her children directly in the past and knew where they lived and which school they went to.",
      "Cristina and others in the Central Operative Unit - a specialised division of Spain's Guardia Civil that prosecutes the most serious forms of organised crime - worked alongside women's organisations and human rights lawyers for months to legalise Victoria's situation in Spain so that they could bring her family over to join her.",
      "The team follows a victim-focused approach, through which women are offered long-term support to help them settle into a stable and safe environment after they have been rescued.",
      "The team says it sometimes get teased by other units for sounding more like a \"charity\" than an elite team of criminal investigators, but Cristina is a passionate advocate for what they do.",
      "\"We believe in a social and humanitarian process that can restore hope in victims' lives, so they can truly recover and live passionately again.\"",
      "While women make up fewer than 10% of Guardia Civil's officers across the board, they make up 60% of Cristina's squad. The head of the unit, Felix Duran, explains their recruitment is a \"priority\".",
      "He believes that sex trafficking victims, particularly teenage girls, feel more comfortable giving details to a female officer.",
      "Approximately 50,000 trafficking victims are detected across the world every year, the United Nations' Office on Crime and Drugs (UNODC) estimates.",
      "Its latest global report on human trafficking, published on Wednesday, says there has been a 25% rise in the detection of victims compared with the pre-pandemic period, as \"more children are exploited and forced labour cases spike\".",
      "The report finds that women and girls continue to account for the majority of victims detected worldwide, who are mostly trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.",
      "Spain is both a country of exploitation and a transit hub for thousands of victims trafficked into Europe.",
      "Victoria and the other victims were concealed inside an apartment, surrounded by other flats. Victoria felt she was being abused in plain sight - she believes that the cries for help, the beatings, and the constant flow of men coming in and out of the property, would have made it obvious.",
      "\"The neighbours; the postman; everyone knew. They could have killed me and nobody would have asked any questions,\" she recalls.",
      "After the lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, human trafficking for sexual exploitation went further underground, the Guardia Civil told the BBC.",
      "It says that, while many women are still exploited in public venues, such as bars or on the streets, most documented victims are now concealed in private apartments supplied by traffickers, making it harder for police forces to detect them.",
      "Ilias Chatzis, chief of the UNODC Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling Section, says the high involvement of organised crime groups means human trafficking is now increasingly intertwined with other illegal activities, such as drug trafficking or cybercrime.",
      "\"A large number of victims remain undetected because sometimes authorities will prosecute the trafficker for some lesser offence, but not for the trafficking crime, so the victim itself would not be recognised as a trafficking victim,\" he told the BBC.",
      "For Victoria, she is grateful that her own experience was recognised by the police, and wants to use it to raise the visibility of those victims still waiting to be rescued.",
      "\"They gave me another chance not only to live, but to heal and hug my children again.\"",
      "She asked the BBC to be referred to as \"Victoria\" because it means \"victory\" in Spanish.",

      "Moreover, he did so amid ongoing war in Gaza and as Israel carries out attacks in Syria during a tumultuous week for the region.",
      "Netanyahu's lawyer, Amit Hadad, first opened the defence argument, portraying the corruption trial as biased and his client as the victim of a political witch-hunt.",
      "Prosecutors, he said, \"weren't investigating a crime, they were pursuing a man\".",
      "Netanyahu then sought to downplay the significance of the charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, and stress his political legacy. He strongly denies any wrongdoing.",

      "They also accuse him of accepting pricey gifts - including cigars and pink champagne - in exchange for advancing the personal interests of a millionaire Hollywood producer.",
      "Netanyahu told the three-judge panel that Israeli media had launched \"absurd\" attacks on him over the years. He said it was \"doubly absurd\" to suggest the presents he had received from wealthy friends were illicit.",
      "In a long diatribe, the prime minister, who leads the right-wing Likud party, criticised his country's media for what he suggested was its leftist stance.",
      "He accused Israeli journalists of hostility towards him over the years because he did not join the push for a Palestinian state.",

      "Eliza Ziv, from Hadera, north of Tel Aviv, said that in times of turmoil, no other Israeli leader came close to the PM's capabilities.",
      "She added that the \"the hatred of the anti-Netanyahu camp, it's not just hate for him, but for his supporters\".",
      "Meanwhile, standing on the other side of the courthouse entrance, Siviona from Tel Aviv told me she saw the veteran leader as \"an enemy of the people\" who prioritised his political survival above the best interests of the country.",
      "Some relatives and supporters of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza came to press for more to be done to free their loved ones.",

      "\"He doesn't care about the hostages. It's very sad\".",
      "Prior to the war in Gaza, Netanyahu's trial opened up deep divisions in Israel and dominated discourse through five successive Israeli elections.",

      "While the deadly attack by Hamas on 7 October 2023 brought public unity, that has largely fallen apart as the war that it triggered has dragged on.",
      "In recent weeks, Israel has reached a fragile ceasefire in Lebanon with the armed group, Hezbollah.",
      "But at the same time, there have been renewed domestic tensions between key cabinet ministers and the judiciary, with threats to bring back some contentious legal reforms.",
      "This trial is not expected to conclude for more than a year.",
      "Even if the prime minister was found guilty, he could then appeal to the Supreme Court, meaning that these legal proceedings look set to continue to overshadow Israeli politics for the foreseeable future."

      "He swept back to power after eight years in opposition, running what political analyst Nansata Yakubu described as a \"masterclass\" in campaigning.",
      "He defeated Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia by 56.6% of votes to 41.6% to notch up the biggest margin of victory by a candidate in 24 years.",
      "But voter turnout was lower than in the 2020 election, especially in some of the heartlands of Bwaumia's New Patriotic Party (NPP), suggesting some people there - disillusioned with its performance in government - stayed at home.",
      "As Mahama's supporters celebrated his victory, Belinda Amuzu - a teacher in the northern city of Tamale, a stronghold of Mahama - summed up their hopes.",
      "\"I'm expecting the new government to change the economy, so that the hardship will come down. He should also prosecute corrupt officials so that it will be a lesson to others,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"The hardship\" has become a common phrase in Ghana since the economy hit rock-bottom in 2022, causing a cost-of-living crisis that shredded Bawumia's reputation as an \"economic whizz-kid\" - and led to his defeat at the hands of Mahama.",
      "Ghanaian economist Prof Godfred Bokpin told the BBC the challenges facing the next government were huge.",
      "\"What Ghana needs right now is credible leadership, lean government and efficiency in public service delivery. Without that, there cannot be a future,\" he said.",
      "Mahama has promised to bring down the size of the cabinet from more than 80 to around 60, but Prof Bokpin argued it should be even smaller while political analyst Dr Kwame Asah-Asante stressed the need for appointments to be on merit rather than loyalty.",
      "Mahama will be flanked by former Education Minister Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, who is set to become Ghana's first female vice-president when the new government takes office next month.",
      "Dr Yakubu said her appointment was not one of \"tokenism\" and she was not someone who could be \"manipulated\".",
      "\"We have a fantastic first female vice-president in Prof Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang,\" she told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Mahama served his first four-year term as president after winning in 2012, but lost his re-election bid in 2016 as Nana Akufo-Addo rose to power with Bawumia as his running-mate.",
      "Dr Yakubu said Mahama contested the 2016 election on his track record in building roads, schools and hospitals but voters rejected him, as their mantra then was: \"We don't eat infrastructure.\"",
      "But, she said, during the Covid pandemic voters came to appreciate the infrastructure his government had built, especially hospitals.",
      "This - along with the fact that the economy had plunged into a deep crisis under the current government, forcing it to seek a $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - led to Mahama being re-elected, Dr Yakubu added.",
      "She told the BBC that Mahama would now be expected to fulfil his campaign promise to create jobs in order to bring down the unemployment rate of almost 15%, and to ease the cost-of-living crisis by scrapping some taxes - or what Ghanaians call \"nuisance taxes\".",
      "Mahama has promised to make Ghana a \"24-hour economy\" through the creation of night-time jobs in both the public and private sectors. He said he would give businesses tax incentives to stay open at night and reduce electricity prices for them.",
      "But his critics have doubts, pointing out that Ghana plunged into its worst electricity crisis during his first term and the power cuts were so bad that Mahama joked at the time that he was known as \"Mr Dumsor\" - \"dum\" means \"off\" and \"sor\" means \"on\" in the local Twi language.",
      "He has pledged to abolish several taxes - including the much-criticised electronic levy on mobile transactions and the one on the carbon emissions produced by petrol or diesel-powered vehicles.",
      "Prof Bokpin said he doubted the Mahama administration would be able to fulfil its promises.",
      "\"They have not done the cost-benefit analysis. There's no budgetary space to translate those promises into actuals,\" he said.",
      "But Mahama is confident he will prove his critics wrong, saying he intends to renegotiate the conditions of the IMF loan so money is freed up for \"social intervention programmes\" in a country where 7.3 million people live in poverty.",
      "In an interview ahead of the election, Mahama told the BBC the IMF wanted \"a certain balance\" in government finances.",
      "\"If you're able to cut expenditure, and you're able to increase revenue and increase non-tax revenue coming in, you'll be able to create a balance,\" he said.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama's experience as former president would stand him in good stead to navigate Ghana through choppy waters.",
      "\"Of course, he is likely to encounter difficulties, but he has what it takes to turn things around,\" the analyst added.",
      "Apart from the economy, corruption is one of the biggest issues facing Ghana but not everyone is convinced that Mahama will be able to tackle the scourge.",
      "Mahama's previous stint in government - as vice-president and president - was plagued by corruption allegations, although he has consistently denied any wrongdoing.",
      "In 2020, a UK court had found that aviation giant Airbus had used bribes to secure contracts with Ghana for military planes between 2009 and 2015.",
      "An investigation was then started in Ghana, but the Office of the Special Prosecutor, in a decision announced just months before the election, concluded there was no evidence that Mahama was involved in any corrupt activities himself.",
      "The outgoing government has also been dogged by corruption allegations, including over the purchase of ambulance spare parts at a cost of $34.9m and a  controversial national cathedral project in which $58m has been spent without any progress in building it.",
      "Mahama promised his government would tackle corruption, and ensure that officials were prosecuted for wrongdoing.",
      "\"We are thinking about special courts,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama should demand financial accountability from the outgoing government during a handover phase so that \"whatever has gone wrong,  he will be able to right\" as soon as his government takes office next month.",
      "The analyst added that Mahama, who will be inaugurated next month when President Akufo-Addo steps down after his two terms in office, had no choice but to meet the expectations of Ghanaians - or else they would \"punish his government the way they have punished the NPP\".",
      "Mahama succinctly acknowledged this in his victory speech, saying: \"Expectations of Ghanaians are very high, and we cannot afford to disappoint them.",
      "\"Our best days are not behind us; our best days are ahead of us. Forward ever - backwards never.\"",

      "In 2011, he brutally crushed a peaceful, pro-democracy uprising, sparking a devastating civil war in which more than half a million people have been killed and 12 million others have been forced to flee their homes.",
      "Thirteen days ago, the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied rebel factions launched a major offensive in north-western Syria.",
      "The rebels quickly captured the country's second-largest city, Aleppo, then swept southwards down the highway to the capital, Damascus, as the military collapsed.",
      "Russia announced that Assad had stepped down and left Syria on Sunday, hours after the rebels entered Damascus and crowds gathered on the streets to celebrate. It later emerged that Assad had flown to Moscow and been granted asylum.",
      "HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani meanwhile arrived in Damascus and told Syrians: \"The future is ours.\"",
      "How did the takeover unfold?",
      "For the past four years, it had felt like the civil war was effectively over.",
      "Assad's government had regained control over most of Syria's cities with the help of Russia, Iran and Iranian-backed militias like Hezbollah, and the front lines were largely frozen.",
      "However, large parts of the country were still out of the government's control.",
      "The rebels' last stronghold was in Aleppo and Idlib provinces, which border Turkey and where more than four million people were living, many of them displaced. It was dominated by HTS, but a number of allied rebel groups and jihadist groups were also based there. Turkish-backed rebel factions also controlled territory with the support of Turkish troops.",
      "On 27 November, HTS and its allies launched their surprise offensive.",
      "After three days, they took control of most of Aleppo - Syria's second-largest city. They said they faced little resistance on the ground after the government rapidly withdrew its troops and security forces.",

      "The Turkish-backed rebel factions meanwhile capitalised on the government's retreat by launching a separate offensive on territory north of Aleppo controlled by a Kurdish-led militia alliance supported by the United States, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).",
      "Assad vowed to \"crush\" the rebels with the help of his allies. Russian warplanes intensified strikes on rebel-held areas and Iran-backed militias sent reinforcements to help the military near Hama - the next city south on the way to Damascus.",
      "But Hama fell to the rebels on Thursday, after several days of fierce battles that eventually prompted the military to withdraw.",
      "The rebels declared their next goal was to take Homs, Syria's third-largest city, and achieved that on Saturday night after only a day of fighting. At the same time, other rebel factions reached the suburbs of Damascus.",
      "Early on Sunday, HTS-led rebels announced they had entered Damascus and released detainees at the country's most notorious military prison, Saydnaya.",
      "Less than two hours later, they declared: \"The tyrant Bashar al-Assad has fled.\"",
      "The rebels also promised to build a \"homeland for all, including all sects and social classes\".",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that at least 910 people had been killed, including 138 civilians, since the start of the rebel offensive.",
      "What is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham?",
      "The Islamist militant group that led the offensive against Assad was set up in 2012 under a different name, al-Nusra Front.",
      "Al-Nusra Front, which pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda the following year, was regarded as one of the most effective and deadly groups fighting President Assad.",
      "But it was feared for its jihadist ideology, and was seen as being at odds with the largely secular main rebel coalition - the Free Syrian Army.",
      "In 2016, Al-Nusra broke ties with al-Qaeda and took the name Hayat Tahrir al-Sham when it merged with other factions a year later.",
      "However, the UN, US, UK and a number of other countries continue to consider HTS as an al-Qaeda affiliate and frequently refer to it as al-Nusra Front. The US named Abu Mohammed al-Jolani as a specially designated global terrorist and offered a $10m reward for information that led to his capture.",
      "HTS consolidated its power in Idlib and Aleppo provinces by crushing its rivals, including al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) group cells. It set up the so-called Syrian Salvation Government to administer the territory according to Islamic law.",
      "Why did the rebels succeed?",
      "For several years, Idlib remained a battleground as Syrian government forces tried to regain control.",
      "But in 2020, Turkey and Russia brokered a ceasefire to halt a push by the government to retake Idlib. The ceasefire largely held despite sporadic fighting.",
      "HTS and its allies said on 27 November that they had launched an offensive to \"deter aggression\", accusing the government and allied Iran-backed militias of escalating attacks on civilians.",
      "But it came at a time when the government had been weakened by years of war, sanctions and corruption - with allies Russia and Iran preoccupied by other conflicts.",
      "The Iran-backed group Hezbollah had recently suffered from Israel's offensive in Lebanon. Israeli strikes had eliminated Iranian military commanders in Syria, and Russia was distracted by the war in Ukraine.",
      "Without them, Assad's forces were left exposed.",
      "What happens next?",
      "Outgoing prime minister Mohammed al-Jalili said on Monday that most members of his former cabinet were working with the rebels \"so that the transitional period is quick and smooth\".",
      "The rebels said in a brief statement that their forces were close to establishing complete control of Damascus and preserving public property. They also said Syria's new government would begin its work as soon as it was formed.",
      "The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, which represents now-former opposition groups, said on Sunday that it was committed to \"completing the transfer of power to a transitional governing body with full executive powers, paving the way for a free, democratic and pluralistic Syria\".",
      "The statement made no mention of HTS, but its vice-president, Dima Moussa, told the BBC that the \"transition requires coming together of all Syrian people, including those who are carrying arms\".",
      "Meanwhile, the war continued in other parts of Syria.",
      "HTS and its allies said their forces were advancing in the western countryside of Deir al-Zour, the largest city in eastern Syria.",
      "Turkish-backed rebel factions fighting under the banner of the Syrian National Army were also advancing north-west of Aleppo into territory held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.",
      "Israel confirmed it was attacking suspected government chemical weapon and missile sites in Syria, saying this was to stop them falling into the hands of extremists. It also said it would keep a \"limited\" troop presence in what had been a demilitarised buffer zone in part of the Golan Heights because Syrian troops had abandoned their posts there.",
      "Former Assad loyalists also appeared to be still in control of the Mediterranean coast and mountains in the west of the country. The region is a stronghold of Assad's minority Alawite sect and also the location of two key Russian military bases - Hmeimim airbase and the naval base in Tartous.",
      "How have world and regional powers reacted?",
      "Russian media said Bashar al-Assad and his family had been granted asylum. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had been as \"surprised\" as everyone else by what had happened and that Syria was \"going through a very difficult period now, due to instability\".",
      "Iran expressed a hope for \"the swift end of military conflicts, the prevention of terrorist actions, and the commencement of national dialogue\" with all parts of Syrian society.",
      "Turkey said Syria was now at a stage \"where the Syrian people will shape the future of their own country\". Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the new government \"must be established in an orderly manner\" and warned that \"the principle of inclusiveness must never be compromised\".",
      "US President Joe Biden said the collapse of the Assad government was a \"fundamental act of justice\" after decades of repression, but cautioned that the takeover by Islamist rebels created a moment of \"risk and uncertainty\".",
      "Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the collapse of the Assad government was the \"direct result\" of his country's action against Hezbollah and Iran.",
      "Iraq, where powerful Iran-backed militias sent fighters to support the Syrian military in the civil war, said it supported efforts to open a dialogue in Syria \"leading to the adoption of a pluralistic constitution that preserves the human and civil rights of Syrians\".",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:35:14 GMT",
    "summary": "The HTS chief has evolved from jihadist leader to rebel statesman while fighting to overthrow Bashar al-Assad.",
    "story": [
      "Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani has dropped that nom de guerre associated with his jihadist past, and been using his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in official communiques issued since Thursday, ahead of the fall of President Bashar al-Assad.",
      "This move is part of Jolani's effort to bolster his legitimacy in a new context, as his Islamist militant group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), leading other rebel factions, announces the capture of the Syrian capital, Damascus, solidifying its control over much of the country.",
      "Jolani's transformation is not recent, but has been carefully cultivated over the years, evident not only in his public statements and interviews with international outlets but also in his evolving appearance.",
      "Once clad in traditional jihadist militant attire, he has adopted a more Western-style wardrobe in the past years. Now, as he leads the offensive, he has donned military fatigues, symbolising his role as the commander of the operations room.",
      "But who is Jolani - or Ahmed al-Sharaa - and why and how has he changed?",

      "Listen to BBC Monitoring's podcast The Global Jigsaw: The rebels who retook Aleppo",
      "Listen to BBC Monitoring's podcast The Global Jigsaw: The rebels who retook Aleppo",
      "The IS-Iraq link",
      "A 2021 PBS interview with Jolani revealed that he was born in 1982 in Saudi Arabia, where his father worked as an oil engineer until 1989.",
      "In that year, the Jolani family returned to Syria, where he grew up and lived in the Mezzeh neighbourhood of Damascus.",
      "Jolani's journey as a jihadist began in Iraq, linked to al-Qaeda through the Islamic State (IS) group's precursor - al-Qaeda in Iraq and, later, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI).",
      "After the 2003 US-led invasion, he joined other foreign fighters in Iraq and, in 2005, was imprisoned at Camp Bucca, where he enhanced his jihadist affiliations and later on was introduced to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the quiet scholar who would later go on to lead IS.",
      "In 2011, Baghdadi sent Jolani to Syria with funding to establish al-Nusra Front, a covert faction tied to ISI. By 2012, Nusra had become a prominent Syrian fighting force, hiding its IS and al-Qaeda ties.",
      "Tensions arose in 2013 when Baghdadi's group in Iraq unilaterally declared the merger of the two groups (ISI and Nusra), declaring the creation of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS), and publicly revealing for the first time the links between them.",
      "Jolani resisted, as he wanted to distance his group from ISI's violent tactics, leading to a split.",
      "To get out of that sticky situation, Jolani pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda, making Nusra Front its Syrian branch.",
      "From the start, he prioritised winning Syrian support, distancing himself from IS's brutality and emphasising a more pragmatic approach to jihad.",
      "Syria's Assad falls - follow live updates",
      "Syria's Assad falls - follow live updates",
      "Joining al-Qaeda",
      "In April 2013, al-Nusra Front became al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, putting it at odds with IS.",
      "While Jolani's move was partly an attempt to maintain local support and avoid alienating Syrians and rebel factions, the al-Qaeda affiliation ultimately did little to benefit this effort.",
      "It became a pressing challenge in 2015 when Nusra and other factions captured Idlib province, forcing them to co-operate in its administration.",
      "In 2016, Jolani severed ties with al-Qaeda, rebranding the group as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and later as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in 2017.",
      "While initially appearing superficial, the split revealed deeper divisions. Al-Qaeda accused Jolani of betrayal, leading to defections and the formation of Hurras al-Din, a new al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, which HTS later crushed in 2020. Members of Hurras al-Din, however, have remained cautiously present in the region.",
      "HTS also targeted IS operatives and foreign fighters in Idlib, dismantling their networks and forcing some to undergo \"deradicalisation\" programmes.",
      "These moves, justified as efforts to unify militant forces and reduce infighting, signalled Jolani's strategy to position HTS as a dominant and politically viable force in Syria.",
      "Despite the public split from al-Qaeda and name changes, HTS continued to be designated by the UN, US, UK and other countries as a terrorist organisation, and the US maintained a $10m reward for information about Jolani's whereabouts. Western powers considered the break-up to be a fa\u00e7ade.",
      "Forming a 'government' in Idlib",
      "Under Jolani, HTS became the dominant force in Idlib, north-west Syria's largest rebel stronghold and home to about four million people, many of whom were displaced from other Syrian provinces.",
      "To address concerns about a militant group governing the area, HTS established a civilian front, the so-called \"Syrian Salvation Government\" (SG) in 2017 as its political and administrative arm.",
      "The SG functioned like a state, with a prime minister, ministries and local departments overseeing sectors such as education, health and reconstruction, while maintaining a religious council guided by Sharia, or Islamic law.",
      "To reshape his image, Jolani actively engaged with the public, visiting displacement camps, attending events, and overseeing aid efforts, particularly during crises like the 2023 earthquakes.",
      "HTS highlighted achievements in governance and infrastructure to legitimise its rule and demonstrate its ability to provide stability and services.",
      "It has previously praised the Taliban, upon their return to power in 2021, lauding them as an inspiration and a model for effectively balancing jihadist efforts with political aspirations, including making tactical compromises to achieve their goals.",
      "Jolani's efforts in Idlib reflected his broader strategy to demonstrate HTS's ability not only to wage jihad but also to govern effectively.",
      "By prioritising stability, public services and reconstruction, he aimed to showcase Idlib as a model of success under HTS rule, enhancing both his group's legitimacy and his own political aspirations.",
      "But under his leadership, HTS has crushed and marginalised other militant factions, both jihadists and rebel ones, in its effort to consolidate its power and dominate the scene.",
      "Anti-HTS protests",
      "For over a year leading up to the HTS-led rebel offensive on 27 November, Jolani faced protests in Idlib from hardline Islamists as well as Syrian activists.",
      "Critics compared his rule to Assad's, accusing HTS of authoritarianism, suppressing dissent and silencing critics. Protesters labelled HTS's security forces as \"Shabbiha\", a term used to describe Assad's loyalist henchmen.",
      "They further alleged that HTS deliberately avoided meaningful combat against government forces and marginalised jihadists and foreign fighters in Idlib to prevent them from engaging in such actions, all to appease international actors.",
      "Even during the latest offensive, activists have persistently urged HTS to release individuals imprisoned in Idlib allegedly for expressing dissent.",
      "In response to these criticisms, HTS initiated several reforms over the past year. It disbanded or rebranded a controversial security force accused of human rights violations and established a \"Department of Grievances\" to allow citizens to lodge complaints against the group. Its critics said these measures were just a show to contain dissent.",
      "To justify its consolidation of power in Idlib and the suppression of plurality among militant groups, HTS argued that unifying under a single leadership was crucial for making progress and ultimately overthrowing the Syrian government.",
      "HTS and its civilian arm, the SG, walked a tightrope, striving to project a modern, moderate image to win over both the local population and the international community, while simultaneously maintaining their Islamist identity to satisfy hardliners within rebel-held areas and HTS's own ranks.",
      "For instance, in December 2023, HTS and the SG faced a backlash after a \"festival\" held at a glossy new shopping mall was criticised by hardliners as \"immoral\".",
      "And this August, a Paralympic Games-inspired ceremony drew sharp criticism from hardliners, prompting the SG to review the organisation of such events.",
      "These incidents illustrate the challenges HTS faces in reconciling the expectations of its Islamist base with the broader demands of the Syrian population, who are seeking freedom and coexistence after years of authoritarian rule under Assad.",
      "Leading a new path?",
      "As the latest offensive unfolded, global media focused on Jolani's jihadist past, prompting some rebel supporters to call for him to step back, viewing him as a liability.",
      "Although he previously expressed willingness to dissolve his group and step aside, his recent actions and public appearances tell a different story.",
      "HTS's success in uniting rebels and nearly capturing the whole country in under two weeks has strengthened Jolani's position, quieting hardline critics and accusations of opportunism.",
      "Jolani and the SG have since reassured domestic and international audiences.",
      "To Syrians, including minorities, they promised safety; to neighbours and powers like Russia, they pledged peaceful relations. Jolani even assured Russia its Syrian bases would remain unharmed if attacks ceased.",
      "This shift reflects HTS's \"moderate jihad\" strategy since 2017, emphasising pragmatism over rigid ideology.",
      "Jolani's approach could signal the decline of global jihad movements like IS and al-Qaeda, whose inflexibility is increasingly seen as ineffective and unsustainable.",
      "His trajectory might inspire other groups to adapt, marking either a new era of localised, politically flexible \"jihadism\" or just a temporary divergence from the traditional path in order to make political and territorial gains."

      "According to a law enforcement bulletin seen by US media, Mr Mangione was allegedly motivated by resentment at what he called \"parasitic\" health insurance companies.",
      "He had spent time in a surfing community in Hawaii, but left owing to debilitating back pain, say those who remember him. It is unclear, however, to what extent his own health troubles shaped his views of the medical industry.",
      "He was arrested on Monday at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and was allegedly in possession of a gun, bullets, multiple fake IDs and cash.",
      "Mr Mangione also had a handwritten document that expressed \"ill will\" towards corporate America and included passages such as \"frankly, these parasites had it coming\", according to police.",
      "Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Mr Thompson's murder.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 22:14:58 GMT",
    "summary": "India's economy slumped to 5.4% , below the central bank's RBI's 7% forecast. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "Is the world's fastest-growing big economy losing steam?",
      "The latest GDP numbers paint a sobering picture. Between July and September, India's economy slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4%, well below the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forecast of 7%.",
      "While it is still robust compared with developed nations, the figure signals a slowdown.",
      "Economists attribute this to several factors. Consumer demand has weakened, private investment has been sluggish for years and government spending - an essential driver in recent years - has been pulled back. India's goods exports have long struggled, with their global share standing at a mere 2% in 2023.",
      "Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies report tepid sales, while salary bills at publicly traded firms, a proxy for urban wages, shrank last quarter. Even the previously bullish RBI has revised its growth forecast to 6.6% for the financial year 2024-2025.",
      "\"All hell seems to have broken loose after the latest GDP numbers,\" says economist Rajeshwari Sengupta. \"But this has been building up for a while. There's a clear slowdown and a serious demand problem.\"",
      "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman paints a brighter picture. She said last week that the decline was \"not systemic\" but a result of reducing government spending during an election-focused quarter. She expected third-quarter growth to offset the recent decline. India will probably remain the fastest-growing major economy despite challenges like stagnant wages affecting domestic consumption, slowing global demand and climate disruptions in agriculture, Sitharaman said.",
      "Some \u2013 including a senior minister in the federal government, economists and a former member of RBI's monetary policy group \u2013 argue that the central bank's focus on curbing inflation has led to excessively restrictive interest rates, potentially stifling growth.",
      "High rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, and potentially reduce investments and dampen consumption, both key drivers of economic growth. The RBI has kept interest rates unchanged for nearly two years, primarily because of rising inflation.",
      "India's inflation surged to 6.2% in October, breaching the central bank's target ceiling (4%) and reaching a 14-month high, according to official data. It was mainly  driven by food prices, comprising half of the consumer price basket \u2013 vegetable prices, for example, rose to more than 40% in October. There are also growing signs that food price hikes are now influencing other everyday costs, or core inflation.",
      "But high interest rates alone may not fully explain the slowing growth. \"Lowering rates won't spur growth unless consumption demand is strong. Investors borrow and invest only when demand exists, and that's not the case now,\" says Himanshu, a development economist at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.",
      "However, RBI's outgoing governor, Shaktikanta Das, believes India's \"growth story remains intact\", adding the \"balance between inflation and growth is well poised\".",
      "Economists point out that despite record-high retail credit and rising unsecured loans - indicating people borrowing to finance consumption even amidst high rates - urban demand is weakening. Rural demand is a brighter spot, benefiting from a good monsoon and higher food prices.",
      "Ms Sengupta, an associate professor at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, told the BBC that the ongoing crisis was borne out by the fact that India's economy was operating on a \"two-speed trajectory\", driven by diverging performances in its \"old economy and new economy\".",
      "The old economy comprising the vast informal sector, including medium and small scale industries, agriculture and traditional corporate sector, are still waiting for long-pending reforms.",
      "In contrast, the new economy, defined by the boom in services exports post-Covid, experienced robust growth in 2022-23. Outsourcing 2.0 has been a key driver, with India emerging as the world's largest hub for global capability centres (GCCs), which do high-end offshore services work.",
      "According to Deloitte, a consulting firm, over 50% of the world's GCCs are now based in India. These centres focus on R&D, engineering design and consulting services, generating $46bn (\u00a336bn) in revenue and employing up to 2 million highly skilled workers.",
      "\"This influx of GCCs fuelled urban consumption by supporting demand for luxury goods, real estate and SUVs. For 2-2.5 years post-pandemic, this drove a surge in urban spending. With GCCs largely established and consumption patterns shifting, the urban spending lift is fading,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "So the old economy appears to lack a growth catalyst while the new economy slows. Private investment is crucial, but without strong consumption demand, firms will not invest. Without investment to create jobs and boost incomes, consumption demand cannot recover. \"It's a vicious cycle,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "There are other confusing signals as well. India's average tariffs have risen from 5% in 2013-14 to 17% now, higher than Asian peers trading with the US. In a world of global value chains, where exporters rely on imports from multiple countries, high tariffs make goods more expensive for companies to trade, making it harder for them to compete in global markets.",
      "Then there is what economist Arvind Subramanian calls a \"new twist in the tale\".",
      "Even as calls grow to lower interest rates and boost liquidity, the central bank is propping up a falling rupee by selling dollars, which tightens liquidity. Since October, the RBI has spent $50bn from its forex reserves to shield the rupee.",
      "Buyers must pay in rupees to purchase dollars, which reduces liquidity in the market. Maintaining a strong rupee through interventions reduces competitiveness by making Indian goods more expensive in global markets, leading to lower demand for exports.",
      "\"Why is the central bank shoring up the rupee? The policy is bad for the economy and exports. Possibly they are doing it because of optics. They don't want to show India's currency is weak,\" Mr Subramanian, a former economic adviser to the government, told the BBC.",
      "Critics warn that the \"hyping up the narrative\" of India as the fastest-growing economy is hindering essential reforms to boost investment, exports and job creation. \"We are still a poor country. Our per capita GDP is less than $3,000, while the US is at $86,000. If you say we are growing faster than them, it makes no sense at all,\" says Ms. Sengupta.",
      "In other words, India requires a significantly higher and sustained growth rate to generate more jobs and raise incomes.",
      "Boosting growth and consumption will not be easy in the short term. Lacking private investment, Himanshu suggests raising wages through government-run employment schemes to increase incomes and spur consumption. Others like Ms Sengupta advocate for reducing tariffs and attracting export investments moving away from China to countries like Vietnam.",
      "The government remains upbeat over the India story: banks are strong, forex reserves are robust, finances stable and extreme poverty has declined. Chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran says the latest GDP figure should not be over-interpreted. \"We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater, as the underlying growth story remains intact,\" he said at a recent meeting.",
      "Clearly the pace of growth could do with some picking up. That is why scepticism lingers. \"There's no nation as ambitious for so long without taking [adequate] steps to fulfill that ambition,\" says Ms Sengupta. \"Meanwhile, the headlines talk of India's age and decade - I'm waiting for that to materialise.\""

    "summary": "Advocacy groups call the controversial weapon \"the fastest growing gun safety problem in the US\".",
    "story": [
      "Investigators say the black pistol allegedly recovered from Luigi Mangione, the suspect arrested in connection with the killing of a healthcare executive, appeared to be a ghost gun - a firearm that can be assembled at home.",
      "Officials said the device might have been made using a 3D printer, but would have to be tested by ballistic experts to confirm.",
      "UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing has once again thrown the spotlight on this controversial weapon that has been called \"the fastest growing gun safety problem in the country\" by advocacy groups.",
      "Here's what to know about these firearms.",
      "What is a ghost gun?",
      "Ghost guns are so-called because they are potentially untraceable. They can be assembled at home, either from scratch or through weapon parts kits, and they are not marked with serial numbers.",
      "The weapon allegedly carried by Mr Mangione in his backpack seems to have been typical. The arrest warrant described it as a \"semi-automatic pistol with what appears to be a 3D-printed loaded receiver with a metal slide and silencer\".",
      "Police said it was capable of firing 9mm rounds, and was consistent with the type of weapon used in the fatal shooting of Mr Thompson in New York the week before.",
      "The Biden administration, arguing in favour of regulating the firearms, has previously described ghost guns as being \"ridiculously easy\" to put together.",
      "Until August 2023, anyone with internet access could legally buy many of the parts needed to make a gun without a background check. Online tutorials explain how to fit together the pieces into a fully functioning firearm in less than an hour.",

      "How big a problem are they?",
      "Experts have called ghost guns the country's fastest-growing gun safety problem. They have been increasingly used in high-profile shootings.",
      "According to figures from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), 20,000 suspected ghost guns were reported as being found by law enforcement in criminal investigations in 2022 - a tenfold increase from 2016.",
      "Authorities say that without serial numbers on their frames, it is virtually impossible to track dealers who are selling these guns illegally to minors or to people without licenses.",
      "A former government official doubted whether people's minds would be changed by Mr Thompson's killing. \"Ghost guns are a new factor in a very complicated and violent country,\" Juliette Kayyem told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "America was finding it \"very hard\" to restrict the firearm, said Ms Kayyem, former assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "More than 48,000 people were killed by firearms generally in the US in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "Are ghost guns regulated?",
      "The killing has renewed scrutiny of ghost guns - which the Biden government has tried to regulate by saying they should be treated in the same way as commercially available firearms.",
      "Manufacturers of ghost gun kits are now required to include serial numbers on their products, and perform background checks on the purchasers.",
      "In October, the US Supreme Court signalled its willingness to uphold the law, which has been challenged by gun rights groups saying that authorities had overstepped the bounds of pre-existing legislation.",
      "A ruling that upholds the ATF's new regulation would mark a change for this Supreme Court, which has a conservative super-majority that has been largely sceptical of gun regulations.",
      "On guns more broadly, US President-elect Donald Trump has positioned himself as a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, which grants the right to bear arms.  Earlier this year, he told the National Rifle Association (NRA) that he was the group's best friend."

      "But there are takers. And in 2022, the Cook Islands gave out three licences to companies to start exploring the possibility of deep-sea mining.",

      "Specifically, that involved drawing up a list of what they called \u201chidden gems\u201d \u2013 alternative holiday destinations in the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and Colombia.",
      "The implications for Cuba are clear.",
      "With tourism now the island\u2019s principal economic motor, and the main source of foreign currency earnings after remittances, that an important tour operator is pointing its customers towards other countries\u2019 beaches over crumbling energy infrastructure is a real concern.",
      "\u201cOur message to Canadians is that tourism is one of the economy\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Lessner G\u00f3mez, director of the Cuban Tourism Board in Toronto in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Tourism has been preparing for the winter season to deliver better services, uninterrupted supplies, a better airport experience, and more and new car rentals.\u201d",
      "While Cuba\u2019s tourism agency tries to ease fears about the extent of the electricity blackouts, few can deny that these have been extremely difficult months on the island. Hurricane Rafael was only the latest storm to hit Cuba in a frenetic Atlantic hurricane season in which more powerful and more frequent storms are the new normal.",
      "Of course, severe weather is a problem across the Caribbean. But for Cuba, there are other complications in play.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election to the White House and his choice for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stand to make life even more complicated for Cubans than it already is.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the Cuban Revolution\u2019s hardest moment,\u201d says former Cuban diplomat, Jes\u00fas Arboleya. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I see nothing on the horizon whatsoever which allows for an optimistic view of the future of US-Cuba relations.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has handed US policy towards Cuba to those sectors of the Cuban American right who have essentially lived off anti-Castro policies since their origins.\u201d",
      "Mr Arboleya adds that Marco Rubio, currently a US Senator for Florida, is the leading voice among them. He is a Cuban American long opposed to the communist government in Havana.",
      "His parents were Cubans who moved to the US in 1956, three years before Fidel Castro seized power, but his grandfather fled the Castro-led turn to communism on the island.",
      "\u201cPeople are horrified by the idea of another Donald Trump presidency. It spells real trouble,\u201d echoes Cuban political commentator and editor of Temas magazine, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Current US policy towards Cuba is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d, he argues.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, the State Department facilitates support to the private sector, and [pushes for] economic changes in Cuba. But on the other hand, Congress and Senate seem to freeze any advances on those reforms.\u201d",
      "The expectation is, however, that a future Secretary of State Rubio will coalesce the US\u2019s Cuba policy around a single idea - maximum pressure on the island by tightening the already-harsh sanctions.",
      "Cubans fear that could mean the suspension of commercial flights to Cuba, or even the closure of the US Embassy in Havana, which was officially reopened in 2015 after decades of frosty relations.",
      "If implemented, such steps would be deliberately designed to further harm Cuba\u2019s floundering tourism trade, the aim to hit the communist-run nation when it\u2019s down. Tourist numbers to Cuba have almost halved since the high point of nearly five million visitors during the Obama-era d\u00e9tente with Cuba.",
      "Between 2015-2017 US visitors flocked to the island under more relaxed travel restrictions, keen to experience a country that had long been denied them. Around the same time, the Cuban government embarked on a major hotel-building spree, confident that demand would remain strong over the next decade.",
      "However, there followed a double blow to Cuban tourism from which it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. First, the Trump Administration rolled back President Obama\u2019s engagement policies, and then the Covid-19 pandemic sent the industry into freefall.",
      "With many of those hotels now registering much lower occupancy rates than originally predicted, and real difficulties in providing the five-star customer experience as advertised amid the blackouts and shortages, some question the strategy of putting so many eggs in the tourism basket in the first place.",
      "\u201cWhy has Cuba invested 38% [of government funds] on average over the past decade in hotels and infrastructure connected to international tourism, but only 8 to 9% on energy infrastructure?\u201d asks economist Ricardo Torres at the American University in Washington DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. The hotels run on electricity.\u201d",
      "Even with all the current challenges, most visitors agree that Cuba remains a unique travel experience. The cliches \u2013 classic cars, cigars and mojitos \u2013 still appeal to many, while others prefer to travel the island absorbing its history, culture and music.",
      "Yet as tour operator Sunwings\u2019 decision to step back shows, some tourists are finding it hard to appreciate Cuba during its energy crisis, especially if it\u2019s about to be exacerbated by a hostile administration \u2013 and Secretary of State \u2013 in Washington."

    "title": "How a uranium mine became a pawn in the row between Niger and France",
    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 01:56:57 GMT",
    "summary": "France's nuclear giant has lost control of its uranium mining operations in the West African state.",
    "story": [
      "In the latest sign of a dramatic deterioration in relations, Niger's military rulers appear increasingly determined to drive France out of any significant sector in their economy - and particularly uranium mining.",
      "This week the French state nuclear company Orano announced that the junta - which deposed France's ally, President Mohamed Bazoum, in a coup in July 2023 - had taken operational control of its local mining firm, Soma\u00efr.",
      "The company's efforts to resume exports have for months been blocked by the regime and it is being pushed into financial crisis.",
      "And the impact could be felt more widely - although Niger accounts for less than 5% of the uranium produced globally, in 2022 it accounted for a quarter of the supply to nuclear power plants across Europe.",
      "So the timing could hardly be more awkward, as Western countries struggle to meet the challenge of climate change and cut their carbon emissions from electricity generation.",
      "For French President Emmanuel Macron, already wrestling with political crisis at home, the potential departure of Orano from Niger is certainly awkward in image terms.",
      "For it coincides with bruising news from other long-standing African partners - Chad has suddenly announced the ending of a defence agreement with Paris, while Senegal has confirmed its insistence on the eventual closure of the French military base in Dakar.",
      "But in any case, the crisis facing Orano in Niger represents a significant practical challenge for French energy supply.",
      "With 18 nuclear plants, totalling 56 reactors, which generate almost 65% of its electricity, France has been ahead of the game in containing carbon emissions from the power sector.",
      "But the country's own limited production of uranium ended more than 20 years ago.",
      "So, over the past decade or so, it has imported almost 90,000 tonnes - a fifth of which has come from Niger. Only Kazakhstan - which accounts for 45% of global output - was a more important source of supply.",
      "The continuing paralysis, or the definitive shutdown, of Orano's operations in Niger would certainly force France to look elsewhere.",
      "This should be achievable, as alternative supplies can be obtained from countries including Uzbekistan, Australia and Namibia.",
      "Last year, as West African neighbours responded to the coup in Niger by imposing a trade blockade that paralysed uranium exports, other suppliers readily stepped into the breach.",
      "The European Union's imports of the mineral from the country plunged by a third, but these were largely replaced by Canada.",
      "But there was also a politically awkward price to pay. EU imports of uranium from Russia rose by more than 70%, despite the heavy sanctions imposed on Moscow because of its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "And of course, it is Russia which has become the new best friend of the military leaders who have seized power in Niger and its allied neighbours, Burkina Faso and Mali, since 2020.",
      "Russian military contractors fight alongside the Malian army in its campaign against jihadists and ethnic Tuareg separatists, while they also help to protect the senior leadership of the juntas in Niger and Burkina Faso.",
      "So although France, and Europe more generally, would be able to find ways to cope with a definitive loss of Niger's uranium supply, the shift would not be entirely comfortable.",
      "In the short-term at least, EU states would probably become more reliant on Russia and its central Asian neighbours, thus undermining their own effort to maintain economic pressure on President Vladimir Putin during a potentially crucial period in the Ukraine crisis.",
      "Moreover, Niger's regime, whose attitude towards the EU as a whole has become almost as mistrustful as its broken relationship with France, continues to seek alternatives to its old Western partnerships.",
      "And Iran - a potential customer, of course, for uranium - has emerged as an option.",
      "Contacts between the two governments have deepened, with Niger's Prime Minister Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine visiting Tehran in January. Rumours of a possible deal for the supply of uranium \"yellowcake\" (concentrate) briefly circulated a few months ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the outlook for Orano's hopes of restoring normal uranium operations and exports from Niger look dim, given the hostile attitude of the military regime in Niamey.",
      "That antipathy is partly explained by Macron's vocal condemnation of the July 2023 overthrow of Bazoum, who had been one of his closest African political and security partners.",
      "Paris firmly endorsed the tough stance of the West African regional grouping Ecowas, and there were even rumours that it might have been ready to provide tacit support had the bloc ever gone ahead with its short-lived threat to intervene militarily in Niger to reinstate Bazoum.",
      "In this poisonous atmosphere of hostility and mistrust, Orano was an obvious and convenient target for junta retaliation.",
      "The French company's predominant role in the uranium sector had for years fuelled resentment among many Nig\u00e9riens, amidst claims that the French company was buying their uranium on the cheap, despite periodic renegotiations of the export deal. Although the mining operations only started years after independence, they were seen as emblematic of France's ongoing post-colonial influence.",
      "After last year's coup, Orano itself tried to stay out of the diplomatic row, keep a low profile and carry on operating normally.",
      "But the Ecowas trade blockade prevented it from exporting the output from the Soma\u00efr mine, near Arlit, in the Sahara Desert.",
      "And even after the sanctions were lifted in late February, the usual uranium export route, via Benin's port of Cotonou, remained blocked, because the junta kept the border closed in an ongoing political row with Benin.",
      "Orano offered to fly the uranium out, but the regime shunned this suggestion.",
      "In June the junta cancelled the French company's rights to develop a new mine at the large Imouraren deposit, which had been seen as the uranium sector's principal new hope for future growth.",
      "Meanwhile, the export blockage was pushing Soma\u00efr, which by November was sitting on 1,150 tonnes of blockaded stocks of uranium concentrate worth $210m (\u00a3165m), into financial crisis.",
      "And when Orano decided to halt further production and prioritise the payment of workforce salaries, relations with the government deteriorated further into this week's almost total breakdown.",
      "Of course, it is not just the company but also Niger's economy that pays a price for this situation, in lost export earnings and risking hundreds of jobs.",
      "For Arlit and other communities in the desert north, this would be a devastating blow, despite talk of revived activity at a Chinese mining project in the region and some interest in the sector among other potential partners.",
      "But Niger's junta feels no need to make concessions to Orano because it is now buoyed by a sharp rise in oil exports, thanks to a new Chinese-built pipeline.",
      "With that financial cushion, the regime appears prepared to bear the cost of paralysing and probably dismantling the traditional uranium partnership with France - now its main international opponent.",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 01:10:18 GMT",
    "summary": "Shanthi tried her best to create a sense of normality for her children on the remote British island Diego Garcia.",
    "story": [
      "It's morning in a makeshift camp on the remote British island of Diego Garcia, and Shanthi's husband has just awoken to find their young children staring through a security fence.",
      "As the children watch an officer and guard dog patrol the secretive island, home to a strategic UK-US military base in the middle of the Indian Ocean, they make a stark remark: \"Even the dogs have more freedom than us.\"",
      "\"When I heard that I felt heartbroken,\" he says.",
      "It was a scene that captured their family's predicament - they were stranded on a mysterious military fortress by accident, yet had a son and daughter, aged five and nine, to raise.",
      "In an effort to find normality in the tiny camp they were housed in under constant surveillance, the family found ways to entertain themselves, to study, grow food and celebrate special occasions.",
      "Shanthi, not her real name, says they had paid $5,000 (\u00a33,900) in savings and given all of her gold jewellery to smugglers for an ambitious journey to Canada, more than 12,000 km away, with dozens of other Sri Lankan Tamils.",
      "They all said they were fleeing persecution in Sri Lanka and India, some because of links with the former Tamil Tiger rebels who were defeated in the civil war that ended in 2009.",
      "The fishing boat they were in leaked in rough seas, prompting their rescue by the Royal Navy who took them in October 2021 to Diego Garcia - and they were placed in the fenced-off migrant camp. Shanthi remembers her son asking if they had arrived in Canada.",
      "Her young children received no formal education on the island for the first six months there so, as a trained teacher, Shanthi began giving English lessons to the children in the camp.",
      "\"We started with the basics - the alphabet, nouns, verbs, present continuous,\" she says.",
      "Shanthi's husband later built a writing desk out of wooden pallets so the children could do homework in the tent.",
      "The children soon began to complain of boredom in the evenings so Shanthi - who had trained in Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance - began giving dance lessons, too, playing music downloaded from her phone.",
      "Three years after the family first arrived in the camp, they were finally sent to the UK this week in what the government described as a \"one off\" case in the interests of their welfare.",
      "\"It's like an open prison - we were not allowed to go outside, we were just living in a fence and in a tent,\" Shanthi, aged in her early 30s, says in an interview on the outskirts of London.",
      "\"Every day our life was the same.\"",
      "It was like living \"in a cage,\" she adds.",
      "While guards watched and military jets occasionally roared overhead, Shanthi and the other Tamils approached British forces on the island with a letter asking to be sent to a safe country. It marked the first time that asylum claims had ever been filed in the territory.",
      "This sparked a lengthy legal battle 6,000 miles away in the UK, and while that took its course, Shanthi and the others stuck there, took matters into her own hands.",
      "While the Tamils were not allowed to cook their own food, the camp was full of coconut trees, and Shanthi and others used the husks to line planters in which they grew their own vegetables - chilli, garlic and cucumber.",
      "\"They would sometimes give us red chilis so we dried them in the sun and collected the seeds and then grew them. In the salad sometimes we'd get cucumber so we collected the seeds and kept them in the sunlight and after they dried they would grow,\" she says.",
      "Every day, they would make sambol - a popular Sri Lankan side dish - by mashing the coconut and chilli.",
      "They struggled to eat the American food served to them from the base, and would put the vegetables in hot water with garlic and chilli to try to make curries.",
      "With limited access to clothing, particularly for the 16 children in the camp, Shanthi and other women stitched dresses from bed sheets. Come Christmas time, they turned paper napkins into flowers, and cut moon and star shapes out of food containers to decorate a tree.",
      "Relations with the guards that watched over them were often tense, but at Diwali, Shanthi says an \"officer with a good heart brought us a biryani\". On another occasion, a guard brought a cake for her son, who had been counting down the days to his birthday.",
      "But as time went on, Shanthi says, the feelings of helplessness grew.",
      "Life in the camp was to exist in a bubble - news of major wars breaking out in Ukraine and the Middle East trickled through from the guards watching over the migrants, but they were kept away from the base and consumed by their own lives.",
      "Access to the island, part of the Chagos Archipelago, is heavily restricted. It has officially had no resident population since the early 1970s when the UK evicted all the people living there so it could develop the strategic base.",
      "\"From day one until we left, every day we were living with rats,\" Shanthi says. \"Sometimes the rats would bite our children - their legs, fingers and hands. They stole our food. At nights sometimes they would crawl over our blankets and our heads.\"",
      "Giant coconut crabs and tropical fire ants would also crawl into the camp.",
      "During storms, rain water would pour in through holes in the tents, which had previously been used for Covid patients in the pandemic.",
      "When United Nations investigators visited the camp late last year, the children told them they dreamed of going for a picnic, riding a bike or eating an ice cream.",
      "At one point earlier this year, a medical official described the camp as being in \"complete crisis\", with mass self-harming and incidents of attempted suicide.",
      "\"My daughter was watching everything that happened. She'd say 'mum they've cut themselves. Should I cut myself?' So I'd say 'no, no. You can't do anything. I'll protect you. Come and listen to some music, come and take some paper and just draw,'\" she recalls through tears.",
      "Both she and her husband sob as they talk about the two times their daughter self-harmed.",
      "\"Both times I felt really bad and couldn't process it. When she did this, she told me she did it because she hoped if she died her parents and her brother would go to a safe third country,\" Shanthi says.",
      "There were also cases and allegations of sexual assault and harassment within the camp by other migrants, including against children.",
      "\"Over three years we suffered so much. I don't know how we survived,\" Shanthi says.",
      "Throughout the Tamils' time on the island, British authorities acknowledged that it was not a suitable place for them, and said they were looking for long-term solutions. The government said the group's wellbeing and safety was the \"top priority\".",
      "Shanthi says the happiest moment in the camp came recently when officials announced that they would be brought to the UK, where they would be given the right to remain for six months. Shanthi says no one in the camp slept that night.",
      "Upon arriving in the UK, Shanthi says she was struck by \"the cold\" - and it felt like waking from a coma. She had forgotten how to download apps, send WhatsApp messages or pay in shops.",
      "Her children talk of starting school, making friends and riding a double-decker bus.",
      "But the family's long-term future remains uncertain. They have now filed asylum claims in the UK in hopes of remaining. If unsuccessful, they will likely be returned to Sri Lanka.",
      "The UK agreed earlier this year to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius in a historic move. Under the deal, which has still to be signed, Diego Garcia would continue to operate as a UK-US military base but Mauritius would take responsibility for any future migrant arrivals.",
      "Shanthi brought a shell with her from Diego Garcia to remember her time there. One day, she plans to put it on a chain and wear it around her neck.",

    "summary": "It has been a steep fall for the 25-year-old batter, once hailed as Indian cricket's 'next big thing'.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as he was signed by Lucknow SuperGiants for 27 crore rupees (\u00a32.54m) at the mega auction in Saudi Arabia.",
      "But it was the news of Prithvi Shaw - Pant's Delhi Capitals teammate - going unsold that grabbed more attention.",
      "Among those seated in the auction in positions to make bids were Sourav Ganguly and Ricky Ponting, who had been closely associated with Shaw in his years with Capitals, as also Rahul Dravid, who was coach when India won the under-19 World Cup under Shaw in 2018.",
      "Their disinterest was telling. Shaw found no takers.",
      "Ironically, just nine months earlier, before the start of the 2024 IPL season, it was Pant whose career looked in jeopardy.",
      "A horrific car crash in December 2022 had left him with multiple life-threatening injuries. But showing iron will, great determination and self-discipline, Pant fought his way back from what seemed a dead-end to his career.",
      "Pant faced the challenges of IPL 2024 head-on and excelled, earning a rapid recall to international cricket. He was part of the T20 World Cup-winning squad. Dominating the domestic season, he impressed in the domestic Duleep Trophy, paving the way for a sensational return to Test cricket. Against Bangladesh, he lit up the field with a scorching century.",
      "Shaw, meanwhile, under pressure after a couple of poor IPL seasons, has lurched from one crisis to another.",
      "His indifferent form in IPL 2024 saw him lose his place in the playing XI mid-season. A spate of low scores in the current domestic season saw him lose his place in the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team too. And an outright rejection in the IPL mega auction has brought his career to the precipice of a premature end.",
      "It's been a mighty tumble for the 25-year-old, who not too long ago, was touted as the 'next big thing\u2019 in Indian cricket.",
      "Shaw hit the headlines in November 2013 as a 14-year-old when he smashed 546 runs for Rizvi Springfield in the Harris Shield, a prestigious school cricket tournament. It was the highest score in the world in minor cricket then.",
      "Sachin Tendulkar, India\u2019s most celebrated cricketer, had retired only a week earlier, and Shaw earned an instant comparison with the maestro.",
      "Tendulkar's spectacular rise to eminence following his world record 664-runs partnership with Vinod Kambli in a school game way back in 1987, had inspired quite a few batting prodigies, especially from Mumbai. Shaw was one of them.",
      "A short and stocky opening batsman, Shaw did not have the technical virtuosity Tendulkar had even as a teenager. But he had a gift of timing, and took the attack to the bowlers with such panache that selectors were instantly enamoured.",
      "He was fast-tracked into first-class cricket, like Tendulkar, scoring a century on debut in the domestic Ranji and Duleep Trophy, which hardened comparisons between the two.",
      "In late 2018, he got a Test call-up against the West Indies. Shaw hit 134 off just 154 deliveries, studded with rifle-shot drives, cuts and pulls. He was barely 19. Only Tendulkar among Indians had scored his maiden Test century at a younger age.",
      "Touted as a worthy successor to Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Shaw had the world at his feet. But he's been on a slippery slope since.",
      "Six years after his sensational debut he played in only four more Tests. Add six ODIs and a solitary T20i, it still makes for a dismal aggregate of international appearances for a batsman whose precocity had promised a long, dazzling career.",
      "An unfortunate foot injury, which saw him being sent back from the tour of Australia in 2020 was the start of Shaw's problems. Later that year, he tested positive for a banned substance and was lucky to get away with a light sentence. Thereafter his batting form started declining steadily, touching excellence agonisingly infrequently to impress selectors.",
      "Meanwhile stories of Shaw getting embroiled in wild parties and brawls started to spread. By the middle of IPL 2024, he was on notice, as it were. After the IPL 2025 mega auction, his career seems engulfed in uncertainty.",
      "Injury, illness, and poor form can derail even the best, but those close to Shaw reveal that misfortune has played only a minor role in his precarious downfall.",
      "Ricky Ponting, who as Delhi Capitals coach worked closely with Shaw, says: \"There's only so much [advice] you can give and only so many times you can try [to sort him out] .\"",
      "Former India batsman Praveen Amre, who was assistant coach with Delhi Capitals was more direct. \"Prithvi\u2019s inability to handle IPL fame and money has been his undoing. I\u2019ve talked to him several times, giving him the example of Vinod Kambli who frittered away his career for the lack of discipline,\u2019\u2019 Amre told a national daily.",
      "The IPL has revolutionised young players\u2019 lives, offering a platform for talent and livelihood. Yet, the challenges of early success, instant fame,and rapid wealth remain pressing. Rahul Dravid, drawing on his experience as U-19 and India A coach, has emphasised the need for stronger junior-level mentoring to keep players on track. Shaw\u2019s struggles underscore the importance of his insight.",
      "What the future holds for Shaw time will tell.",
      "At 25, he still has age on his side. But Indian cricket is overflowing with talent, and competition for places is intense. The path from here is all uphill.",
      "\"Some of the greatest sports stories are comeback stories, If Prithvi Shaw has decent people around him who care about his long term success, they\u2019d sit him down, tell him to get off social media & train his absolute backside off in getting super fit. It\u2019ll get him back into the correct path where past success can return. Too talented to throw it all away,\" Former England captain Kevin Pietersen posted on X.",

It is also why President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law this week \u2013 the first to happen in 45 years and during democratic rule - was particularly triggering and prompted such a visceral response.",

      "As part of a settlement first\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2022, the video game maker has been ordered by the FTC to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that it used unlawful billing practices involving design tricks\u00a0known as dark patterns to get players to unintentionally rack up charges. It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",

Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",

      "\"Not Fade Away\" closed out the Kennedy Center Honors at this year's ceremony, just as honorees The Grateful Dead had used Buddy Holly's ode to enduring love to close out hundreds of concerts over the years.",
      "The packed house Sunday night danced in the aisles to the bouncy beat after a night of honoring the Dead and other recipients of the lifetime achievement award for artistic accomplishment: director\u00a0Francis Ford Coppola,\u00a0jazz trumpeter\u00a0Arturo Sandoval\u00a0and singer-songwriter\u00a0Bonnie Raitt.\u00a0The venerable Harlem theater\u00a0The Apollo, which has launched generations of Black artists, also was recognized.",
      "Longtime Deadheads, including actors Miles Teller and Chloe Sevigny and talk show host David Letterman, paid tribute to the band's blend of musical experimentation, longevity and community-building. \"Their music fills the universe,\" Letterman proclaimed.",
      "The choice to honor The Apollo was an unusual one: the first time the Kennedy Center has chosen to honor a specific performance venue.",
      "\"The Apollo means so much to so many of us,\" Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said while arriving on the red carpet. Moore pointed to iconic Apollo performances from Lauryn Hill and a young Michael Jackson as treasured memories of his youth.",
      "The tribute to The Apollo highlighted the sheer diversity of art forms showcased at the 90-year-old theater. Savion Glover did a spirited tap dance routine; husband and wife duo The War and Treaty performed a medley of hits by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell; and comedian Dave Chappelle recounted his terrifying first Apollo performance at age 15.",
      "\"Everybody started booing. It was like I was outside my body watching,\" he said. Eventually Chappelle was rushed off the stage by the theater's infamous \"Sandman,\" but he credited the experience with helping him overcome his fear of bombing.",
      "The annual gala at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts always features personalized tributes with performances and testimonials from fellow artists. Medallions were presented during the traditional Saturday night ceremony at the State Department.",
      "In the first of the night's tributes, Emmylou Harris and Dave Matthews performed a cover of Raitt's duet with the late John Prine, \"Angel from Montgomery.\"",
      "Music star Sheryl Crow paid tribute to Raitt's trailblazing career as not just a singer or songwriter but as a widely respected blues guitarist in a male-dominated field.",
      "\"I would not be doing what I'm doing if I had not seen her perform as a 17-year-old,\" said Crow, who bought her first guitar shortly after seeing Raitt in concert.",
      "Raitt herself, on the pre-event red carpet, predicted an emotional evening.",
      "\"I've brought a massive box of Kleenex and my waterproof eyeliner,\" she laughed.",
      "Coppola received a tribute filled with previous Kennedy Center honorees, including Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino and George Lucas. All described an iconoclastic and driven auteur who loved to nurture and support younger filmmakers.",
      "\"What Francis does creatively is jump off cliffs,\" Lucas said. \"When you spend enough time with Francis, you begin to believe you can jump off cliffs, too.\"",
      "Sandoval's tribute featured multiple performances from an all-star band featuring Trombone Shorty and pianist Chucho Valdez from Sandoval's original band, plus a flamenco dance performance by Timo Nunez. It also included a bit of light roast comedy from actor Andy Garcia.",
      "\"Arturo spoke very little English when he first came to America from Cuba all those years ago,\" Garcia said. \"But now his English ... is much worse.\"",
      "The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat-out lied to her longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on stage to perform Cher's hit, \"If I Could Turn Back Time.\"",
      "At a ceremony at the White House before attending the awards event itself, President Biden praised each honoree. He also had De Niro, who was in the audience, stand before declaring, \"If I get in trouble, I'm coming to you pal.\"",
      "De Niro grinned and nodded and others in attendance, including the honorees, laughed at what appeared to be a reference to De Niro sometimes playing hardnosed enforcers in movies like \"The Godfather.\" But Biden actually meant he might seek the actor's help for post-presidency career advice.",
      "\"Things are not looking good for February,\" Biden joked.",
      "Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris received an extended standing ovation from the audience when introduced at Kennedy Center. But this could be the last honors ceremony without political intrigue for a while.",
      "During Donald Trump's first four years in office, Kennedy Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy toward Trump from multiple honorees. In 2017, recipient Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump, who takes office in January, skipped the ceremony for the entirety of his first term.",
      "On the red carpet Sunday night, multiple Democratic political figures seemed to offer an olive branch.",
      "\"I hope he does come,\" Moore said. \"This is a wonderful celebration of genius in all its forms.\"",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi added, \"I think he would really enjoy it.\"",
      "The 47th Annual Kennedy Center Honors will air on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ on Dec. 22 at 8:30 p.m. Eastern with host Queen Latifah.

      "The studio confirmed on Saturday that Steve Mensch, its 62-year-old president and general manager, had died.",
      "\"We are incredibly saddened by the passing of our dear friend Steve Mensch,\" the studio said in a statement. \"Steve was a cherished member of our team for more than eight years and well-beloved in the community of Atlanta. It's hard to imagine not seeing him smiling throughout the halls. We will miss him dearly. Our heart goes out to his family as we all send them our prayers.\"",
      "The crash happened in Homosassa, about 60 miles north of Tampa. Photos from the scene show the plane having come to rest upside down on a road. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating.",
      "The single-engine Vans RV-12IS was registered to Mensch at his home address in the Atlanta suburb of Fayetteville, according to FAA records.",
      "In a post to Instagram Saturday evening, Perry wrote: \"I've been trying to understand this tragedy all day\u2014what went wrong with that plane. Steve loved flying, and he loved that plane; he took so much pride in it. Steve Mensch was truly a kind soul and a great leader at the studio. We all adored him and are devastated that he's gone. I'm praying for his family as we all try to make sense of this heartbreak.\"",
      "Mensch helped advocate for and maintain Georgia's film tax credit of more than $1 billion a year. Those lavish subsidies have made Georgia one of the most active places in the United States for film and television production.",
      "Mensch got into the movie business when he started working for Feature Systems, which provides equipment for the movie industry. He was hired by Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting to run its studio operations, later becoming director of strategic production partnerships. It was there that he began to lobby state government for more aid to movie and television production.",
      "Ric Reitz, an actor who also helped create the tax credits, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Mensch helped market the state before the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and helped launch the Georgia Production Partnership, an entertainment industry lobbying group.",
      "\"He was trying to formulate the vision for the marketplace before the Olympics and wanted a think tank of people in the community to make Georgia competitive,\" Reitz said. \"He was an important figure in the our growth to become a strong film and TV market.\"",
      "After a year helping plan and build a giant studio in China and brief stint helping to open Third Rail Studios in suburban Atlanta. Perry hired Mensch to help create and run his namesake studio in 2016. The studio sprawls across 330 acres of a former Army base in southern Atlanta that Perry acquired in 2015.",
      "Mensch died on the same day that Perry released \"The Six Triple Eight,\" a war drama about a mostly Black and all-female World War II battalion. The film was shot at the Atlanta studio.",
      "Mensch is survived by his wife, Danila, and three children.",

      "Caffey says it's the longest-running singing competition in history. \"Well, 'The Voice,' and 'America's Got Talent,' and 'American Idol,' and 'Star Search,' we are the great-grandfather of all of that,\" he said. \"This was the blueprint.\"",
      "The theater's motto is \"Where stars are born and legends are made\"\u2026 and it's launched plenty of them, from James Brown and Ella Fitzgerald, to Stevie Wonder, Lauryn Hill and H.E.R.",
      "And if you're wondering why every performer rubs that tree stump, according to Caffey, \"This stump used to be a full tree. And it stood outside the Lafayette Theater. And they would pull leaves from the tree for good luck. And now everyone comes here and rubs the Tree of Hope for good luck.\"",
      "Does it work? \"Well, I think it's good luck if you win, and it's not such good luck if you lose,\" Caffey said.",
      "But it worked for the award-winning singer Dionne Warwick, whose career skyrocketed since she and her gospel group won Amateur Night back in 1958.",
      "What did winning prove to her? \"Well, that we were good enough, first of all,\" Warwick said. \"And that we won $50!\"",
      "Warwick said going to the 1,500-seat theater was like going to school and getting a crash course in performing: \"The old saying is true, it is so true: 'If you can make it at the Apollo, you can make it anywhere.' They brought out the very best in you. Every single time I played the Apollo, it got better and better and better. And I mean, I felt like I was at home.\"",
      "But it wasn't always welcoming. Before it was the Apollo, it was a whites-only burlesque theater. In 1934, under new ownership and a new name, it opened its doors to everyone. Music historian Guthrie Ramsey said, \"It was one of the first to allow Black and white patrons to enjoy the music together. After all, it's New York City, and the Black community was growing. And so, it was basically a business model decision to allow Black citizens in.\"",
      "Ramsey says the story of the Apollo and the story of America are intertwined. \"It was a representative of anything that was going on in America, you could see the Apollo Theater reflecting that,\" he said. \"It's all of our histories. We all have a stake in it.\"",
      "During the civil rights movement, the Apollo became more than just a performance space. Motown great Smokey Robinson said, \"Sittin' in and marching and doing all this, and going to restaurants and they don't wanna serve us, and all that, we couldn't stay in any hotels \u2013 it was a rough time, you know?\"",
      "But the Apollo was like a beacon. \"It was the beacon,\" Robinson said. \"It was the Black music staple. It was just, you know, where the Black acts came. Couldn't play nowhere else!\"",
      "Robinson says the first time he and The Miracles performed here, he was a nervous wreck. They bombed! \u00a0\"I was frightened to death to be at the Apollo Theater,\" he said. \"Had we not had a record out and supposedly be 'professional' at that point, that the guy with the hook would have came and took us off the stage, because we were terrible!\" he laughed. \"We were just amateurs, we were so terrible, until Mr. Schiffman, the guy who owned the Apollo at that time, called Berry Gordy, who was our manager and stuff at that point, and told him he wanted his money back!\"",
      "In the decades that followed, as more places became integrated, the Apollo struggled financially, and closed its doors more than once. \"We could've lost the Apollo, but we're still here,\" said actress and singer Melba Moore. She says she grew up watching shows at the theater, and then got a chance to perform here \u2013 and later became a guest host on \"It's Showtime at the Apollo,\" the TV version of Amateur Night.",
      "Moore says this theater is something to be treasured.",
      "Tonight, the Apollo Theater is being awarded a prestigious Kennedy Center Honor at a ceremony that we'll see later this month on CBS.",
      "Michelle Ebanks, president and CEO of the theater, says it's the first time an institution (rather than a person) has received such recognition. \"The idea of the Apollo opened up this whole universe, so that everyone could see this is American culture, too,\" Ebanks said. \"This is the magic of art, the power of art.\"",
      "This is also the year the theater begins its 90th season. And to Smokey Robinson, the Apollo is still a force to be reckoned with. \"You know, it's the beginning. It's the proving ground. It's the Apollo!\"",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 10:45:39 -0500",
    "summary": "The internationally acclaimed Netflix series \u2013 a dystopian parable about capitalism and greed \u2013 is now releasing Season 2. Hwang Dong-hyuk says the lethal competition, played with childish games, is \"getting darker, episode by episode.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"Squid Game\" fans know that trumpet wakeup call means someone is going to die. Not our hero, Gi-hun, but one or more of the players hoping to win a fortune competing in childish, but lethal, games. It's at once a thriller and a critique of inequality and greed.",
      "Season 1 was an international blockbuster. With 330 million views, it's Netflix's most-watched series of all time. It won Emmys for its lead actor, Lee Jung-jae, and creator Hwang Dong-hyuk. Both made history as the first Asian winners in their categories.",
      "We first spoke with Hwang in Korea just as he was about to start a global promotional tour for Season 2.",
      "\"So, you are kind of in a sweet spot now?\" I asked.",
      "\"I don't know what you mean by 'sweet spot,'\" Hwang replied.",
      "\"Just that things are going your way?\"",
      "\"But it's not easy. Nothing's easy,\" he said. \"People keep saying to me, 'You are the happiest person in Korea.' But in my mind, I am not that happy. I'm struggling every day and night.\"",
      "That's thanks to a brutal workload: Hwang directed and wrote every episode. Sworn to secrecy, \"Sunday Morning\" was invited to a soundstage outside Seoul where much of Season 2 was shot.",
      "Hwang was at the top of his game, but it wasn't always that way. He was only five when his father died. After that, he says, his family was trapped in poverty. As a struggling filmmaker, and in debt, Hwang said he sought escape in comic books. \"I read a lot in the survival game genre and gambling genre,\" he said. \"And that led me to think, what if I were to combine childhood games with people putting their lives at stake for a huge cash prize? And that was really how the idea was conceived.\"",
      "And a blockbuster was born.",
      "In the show, contestants driven by desperation risk everything for money, exploited by a sinister game master, the powerful Front Man.",
      "Asked if \"Squid Game\" represents how he sees capitalists and capitalism in general - a group of desperate people manipulated by a cruel and wealthy elite - Hwang replied, \"I think fundamentally what continues to drive this system is human selfishness and greed. These days I'm becoming more pessimistic about human nature. I almost think that, for homo sapiens, it's greed that allows them to create a society that they feel most comfortable in.\"",
      "Many of the characters in Season 2 are new (Hwang having killed off so many of them in Season 1), but the guards are back, and so is Gi-hun, now on a doomed mission to stop the game.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Squid Game: Season 2\" click on the video player below:",
      "Hwang said that \"Squid Game\" Seasons 2 and 3 \"will show people the bottom of this world, the bottom of the human being.\"",
      "So, it gets even darker? \"Yeah, it's getting darker, episode by episode,\" Hwang said.",
      "The show is so popular that recently 50,000 people applied for a chance to take part in a real-life (but non-deadly) Squid Game in Paris. The prize: an early look at the new season.",
      "Hwang is amazed, especially by his show's wild success in the U.S., where audiences have not traditionally gone for a subtitled TV series: \"I was always hoping to make something very popular in the States, so I was surprised,\" he said. \"At the same time there was, like, in my dream come true. But that level of success [was] just beyond my expectations.\"",
      "Ironically, this creator of a dystopian parable about desperation and poverty now finds himself a wealthy man \u2013 one of the great winners of capitalism. Has that changed him? \"Not much,\" he said. \"Made my life better, for sure, because I don't have to worry about [making] money anymore. But since then, I don't think I was changed a lot by more success or more money, because it's just a number. It doesn't have any meaning to me at all.\"",
      "What does have meaning is his work. But the success and the pressure of \"Squid Game\" have taken a toll: \"It's more than, like, five years I've been just working on this one project, day and night. I'm so exhausted. I'm so sick of, you know?\" he laughed. \"I need a break, I need a break.\"",
      "A break from non-stop work \u2026 and from his deep dive into the dark depths of human nature.",
      "So, what makes Hwang Dong-hyuk laugh? \"My friends! I love talking to my friends and having a beer.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 10:08:24 -0500",
    "summary": "With her album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft,\" and her current tour (her first without brother Finneas), Billie Eilish is discovering parts of herself she didn't know were there \u2013 from finding a new voice as a songwriter, to stretching her singing after starting vocal lessons.",
    "story": [
      "At the open of a Billie Eilish concert, a giant light box rises in the arena. \"Spoiler alert! I'm in the cube, but you can't see me,\" she said. \"I can literally see everybody so well from inside this box, but they have no idea I can see them. It feels like I'm wearing an invisibility cloak.\"",
      "\"That's a luxury you don't have most of the time,\" I said.",
      "\"That's true!\" she laughed. \"But it also makes me feel a little like I'm not real?\"",
      "Her whole career has been kind of unreal. Eilish, who turns 23 this month, has more than 100 million followers on Spotify, an ardent fan base that filled the United Center in Chicago.",
      "A few hours before showtime, Eilish was scurrying around backstage, introducing us to her backup singers \u2026 her band \u2026 and taking us to a room full of rescue dogs, who offer stress relief. \"Welcome to the puppy room!\" she said. A couple have already been adopted.",
      "She's filled her crew with friends (even the furry kind) because this tour is different. Since Eilish broke out at 14, her older brother, Finneas, has been her producer, songwriting partner and backing band. For the first time, she's on tour without him. \"I've never done a show without my brother in my life,\" she said. \"I mean, I've barely performed and sung without my brother, like, ever.\"",
      "But they agreed it was time for her to go out on her own. Finneas told us, \"I was built into the show for several years in an irreplaceable way. And I always kind of was trying to make myself replaceable.\"",
      "Her mom, Maggie Baird, came to the Chicago show. But Eilish's parents also aren't touring with her anymore. \"It does feel strange, yeah,\" Baird said. \"But it also feels okay. And there's also a lot of jobs I used to do where I'm like, I'm happy I don't have to do that one anymore!\"",
      "\"Honestly, she won't admit it, but I think it's been really nice for her that I've been gone,\" Billie laughed. \"And that then she can come see me and it's not just, like, her whole life. I mean, I've been her whole life for, like, 23 years now.\"",
      "\"Pretty good life, though,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, a lot! But, yeah\u2026\"",
      "Earlier this year, Eilish won her second Oscar for the \"Barbie\" theme, \"What Was I Made For.\" She already has nine Grammys, and now another seven nominations. Among her nominations are record of the year and song of the year, for a song (\"Birds of a Feather\") that she almost didn't put on her album.",
      "Billie and Finneas had struggled with the song. \"We wrote, like, the first half and it was super-good,\" she said. \"And then we overthought it for, like, months and months and months.\"",
      "I asked, \"When you sing it, do you hear all that you went through to create it?\"",
      "\"Sometimes,\" she replied. \"Sometimes when I listen to it, I hear certain parts that I'm like, 'Oh, that was such a nightmare! That was so punishing!'\"",
      "Watch Billie Eilish perform \"Birds of a Feather\":",
      "Eilish admits that, until recently, she didn't think of herself so much as a songwriter. That has changed. \"I did, like, way more writing on this album than anything ever,\" she said. \"But this is the thing I'm trying to say: I've been writing music since I was 11. But because I wasn't as fast at it, or wasn't as good, as my brother, I kind of thought, 'Oh, I'm not a songwriter.'\"",
      "But when they sat down to write Billie's third album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft,\" Finneas felt uninspired.",
      "\"We'd get in the studio to write and I'd be, like, 'Can we go play pickleball?'\" he said. \"I think I just sort of had a little fatigue there.\"",
      "Billie said they were in \"different places,\" and that she felt alone. In the past, Finneas would help pull a lyric out of his sister. This time, she had to coax the words out of herself. \"And then, in just being given that space, I'd come up with it,\" she said.",
      "On the last chorus of \"Birds of a Feather,\" Eilish reached for a note she wasn't sure she could hit.\u00a0 Her vocal bravery came after she started taking singing lessons.",
      "I asked, \"Have you found some part of yourself you didn't even know was there?\"",
      "\"Yeah! Oh, yeah. I mean, my voice!\" she laughed. \"I can't express how gratifying, and satisfying, and fulfilling it has been to, like, learn these things about my own voice \u2013 that's in my body \u2013 that I didn't even know I was capable of. \u2026 It's so liberating.\"",
      "Hear Billie Eilish's isolated vocal track for \"Birds of a Feather\":",
      "For all we may think we know about Billie Eilish, the singer is just beginning to know herself.",
      "I asked, \"What's interesting to me is, you're talking now about two things: one is, you've discovered a part of your voice you didn't even know was there; and you've discovered you're more of a songwriter than you ever thought. Where does that leave you?\"",
      "\"Great question,\" Eilish said. \"We'll see. I don't know!\"",

    "story": [
      "Daniel Craig is back on the big screen \u2013 not as 007, or the smooth Southern private investigator in the \"Knives Out\" movies, but in the movie \"Queer,\" directed by Luca Guadagnino. Craig plays William Lee, an American living in 1950s Mexico City, who becomes infatuated with Eugene Allerton, another much younger expatriate (played by Drew Starkey).",
      "In one tender and poignant scene, a translucent image of Lee is seen leaning over towards Allerton. \"The sort of invisible hand,\" Craig described it. \"is what you're talking about \u2013 [something] you hope would happen, yes. The yearning \u2013 and hope is a really good word \u2013 that something will become of it. Maybe it's falling in love.\"",
      "Craig's character is an alcoholic and heroin addict, and undeterred by the reticence of Allerton.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think that your character Lee is especially ardent in his overture because the Allerton character is aloof?\"",
      "\"Maybe, maybe,\" Craig replied. \"I also think that he's searching \u2013 clearly from the top of the movie, he's searching for something. And he finds Allerton. And he thinks this is it, this is the one, so therefore he throws everything at it \u2013 probably awkwardly, and embarrasses himself in the process.\"",
      "\"When you walk into the bar and do that bow, that's (as the young people say) 'very cringe.'\"",
      "\"Yes. Is that what they say? Yes, it is very cringe!\" Craig laughed. \"Yeah, yeah. But that sung to me. I've been in situations like that certainly when I was younger, of trying to impress and trying to be kind of that person, and just failing miserably. That really rang out to me.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Queer\" click on the video player below:",
      "The movie is based on the book \"Queer,\" Beat writer William S. Burroughs' semi-autobiographical account of his own time in Latin America.",
      "Craig's latest role harkens back to the grittier parts he was known for in Britain pre-James Bond, such as \"Other Voices,\" \"Sylvia,\" \"Infamous\" and \"Layer Cake.\"",
      "Daniel Craig was born in the north of England, and at 6 years old saw his first stage production. He was introduced to the theater by his mother: \"We lived in Liverpool in the '70s. There was a theater called the Everyman, it's still there. They had cheap tickets so everybody could go. A lot of my mum's friends were designers and costume designers and worked backstage. She was a single mum, and we spent most of our time there.\"",
      "\"Was it magical to you?\"",
      "\"It was, yeah,\" Craig said. \"I think that's the moment I said, 'I wanna be an actor.' I mean, these people would walk off stage, and I'd see them in the bar afterwards. And I'd think they were gods, and they were just drunk!\"",
      "His mother's love for theater, it turned out, ran deeper than her son realized. He found out later that, as a young woman, she had been accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, one of the world's great acting schools. \"Yeah, she was, and she hadn't told me,\" Craig said. \"But they couldn't afford to go, so she had to go home, and went to art college instead up North.\"",
      "He was moved once he found out: \"She's always encouraged me. I mean, she sort of gently kicked me out the door, to say, 'Go, get on with it.' All the drama schools are in London, everything that was happening, and she said, 'You gotta go.' I left and went.\"",
      "He was only 16. \"She realized I was failing so badly at school, there was really no other option, I think!\" Craig laughed.",
      "He hasn't just been successful; he's one of the most recognized actors on the planet, whether he likes that or not.",
      "I asked, \"We interview a lot of big name actors on this show, and a lot of them say they don't like being famous. And it's not that I don't believe it, but I need to understand: what does being famous do to your brain?\"",
      "\"Oh God, well, that's the big question,\" Craig replied. \"It can do all sorts of wonderful things, of course, and as an actor, why did I become an actor? Because I like dressing up and showing off and I want people to like me. I mean, it's like, you want to sort of distill it down to its absolute basics. But what does fame do? I think fame can take you off in all sorts of weird and strange and not very healthy directions.\"",
      "\"It's gotta make acting harder in a way, because you can't, for instance, easily go on the subway and just look at the person across from you and kind of observe life around you?\"",
      "\"People watching, yes. Yeah, I did it a lot when I was younger, so I've got a lot in the bank!\"",
      "Daniel Craig has always been known for his intensity. But at 56, his next chapter might not be quite as physically rigorous, being 20 years older than when he was first cast as 007 in \"Casino Royale.\" \"God, remind me, why don't you?\" he laughed. \"Life is pain! And that's why I wanted to stop, one of the reasons I wanted to stop, because I'd throw myself into those movies, each one. From the very beginning I've been wanting to do as many stunts and as many of the action sequences as I possibly can. And I've injured myself. And I don't wanna do that. I don't want to take that risk anymore. I've got kids and I've got a life. And I want to spend the rest of my life upright if I can.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 10:25:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Consumers are venting frustrations about health insurance in wake of UnitedHealthcare CEO murder. Costs have outpaced inflation for years.",
    "story": [
      "Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly 1 in 5 claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",
      "Frustration over denials and medical costs has fueled an outpouring of vitriol against health insurance companies in the wake of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also last week, a similar outcry led Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to reverse a\u00a0decision\u00a0to limit anesthesia coverage during surgeries.",
      "The anger may be rooted in fears that unexpected medical costs could prove financially ruinous, as well as concerns that essential care could be denied by an insurer, putting health and well-being at risk even for those who have health insurance.",
      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",
      "\"It's not like, 'How much do I have to pay for a lawn chair or a steak,'\" Andrews noted. \"People are sick or having some sort of health problem they are worried about.\"",
      "To be sure, people with employer-sponsored health insurance typically don't pay the full premium, as their employers pick up much of the tab.",
      "Yet KFF data shows that employees' share of their premiums are also on the rise, with a worker with family coverage typically paying premiums of $5,700 per year in 2017, the most recent year for that data, up from about $1,600 in 2000, KFF data shows. The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",
      "About 81% of Americans last year said they were dissatisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S, a 16-year high, Gallup polling found.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings on Friday.",
      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 17:05:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",
      "\"This is just the latest in a long line of appalling behavior by commercial health insurers looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,\" said Donald E. Arnold, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"This egregious policy breaks the trust between Anthem and its policyholders who expect their health insurer to pay physicians for the entirety of the care they need.\"",

      "The Federal Reserve has been battling high inflation since 2022, when it began ratcheting up its benchmark rate in order to dampen demand from consumers and businesses. That's helped lower the inflation rate to its current level from a recent peak of 9.1% in June 2022, yet the last leg of the Fed's journey to push inflation down to a 2% annual rate is proving elusive.",
      "\"This is the second month in a row that the year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index has increased. Prices rose by 0.3% between October and November,\" noted Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant in an email after the report was released.",
      "She added, \"Since May 2023, wages have been rising faster than inflation, which is the main reason why persistently higher inflation has not slowed overall consumer spending.\"",
      "But the impact of high consumer prices is pinching many families, she added. \"Recent research from the U.S. Census Bureau has shown that moderate-income families are experiencing the strain of inflation much more than higher-income households,\" Sturtevant added.",
      "Problem areas: Shelter and grocery prices",
      "Pinch points for consumers last month were shelter prices \u2014 rent and housing costs \u2014 as well as food, according to the CPI data. Housing prices have proved particularly sticky since the pandemic, with home prices, rents and mortgage rates all rising significantly in recent years.",
      "The increase in shelter costs contributed about 40% of the CPI increase last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday.",
      "Food prices also rose last month, with groceries increasing 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, the BLS said.",
      "\"Shelter costs continue to be the number one source for higher prices, and that the rate of increase has slowed is no comfort,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"Many food prices rose, including the proxy for that category, eggs, up about 8% for the month.\"",
      "He added, \"This report may show a mild increase in the grand scheme, and should guarantee another rate cut when the Fed meets next week, but especially for lower-income Americans it's adding to the harsh burden of high costs.\"",
      "Fed's December rate meeting",
      "That stalling may complicate the Fed's current rate-cutting path. In September, the central bank issued its first cut in four years, followed by a second reduction in November, citing progress on inflation and weakness in the job market.",
      "While a majority of economists still forecast the Fed will again cut rates at its next meeting, set for Dec. 18, some forecasters are now expecting fewer cuts in 2025.",

      "\"Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding, \"Andrew will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country's History.\"",
      "Fertitta, meanwhile, the billionaire CEO of hospitality group Landry's, Inc., is Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to Italy, people familiar with the decision told CBS News Tuesday. Trump transition officials declined to comment.",
      "Fertitta is a friend of Trump's and longtime GOP donor who leads Landry's Inc., a Texas-based corporation with hotels, restaurants and casinos.

      "Johnson \u2014 not the Republican senator \u2014 served as ambassador to El Salvador during Trump's first administration. His nomination comes as the president-elect has been threatening tariffs on Mexican imports and the mass deportation of migrants who have arrived to the U.S.-Mexico border. Johnson is also a former U.S. Army veteran and was in the Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "Guilfoyle is a former California prosecutor and television news personality who led the fundraising for Trump's 2020 campaign and became engaged to Don Jr. in 2020. Trump called her \"a close friend and ally\" and praised her \"sharp intellect make her supremely qualified.\" Guilfoyle was on stage with the family on election night.",

      "Deals that were blocked by the Biden administration could find new life with Trump in command.",
      "For example, the new leadership could be more open to a proposed merger between the country's two biggest supermarket chains, Kroger and Albertsons, which forged a $24.6 billion deal to combine in 2022. Two judges halted the merger Tuesday night.",
      "The FTC had filed a lawsuit in federal court earlier this year to block the merger, claiming the deal would eliminate competition, leading to higher prices and lower wages for workers. The two companies say a merger would help them lower prices and compete against bigger rivals like Walmart.",
      "One of the judges said the FTC had shown it was likely to prevail in the administrative hearing.",
      "Yet given the widespread public concern over high grocery prices, the Trump administration may not fully abandon the FTC's efforts to block the deal, some experts have said.",
      "And the FTC may continue to scrutinize Big Tech firms for any anticompetitive behavior. Many Republican politicians have accused firms such as Meta of censoring conservative views, and some officials in Trump's orbit, most notably Vice President-elect JD Vance, have previously expressed support for Khan's scrutiny of Big Tech firms.",

    "story": [
      "If you have yet to buy a Christmas tree this year, take cheer \u2014 prices are roughly the same as in 2023.",
      "Growers weren't expecting to raise wholesale prices, according to an annual survey by the Real Christmas Tree Board, based in Howell, Michigan, and sponsored by annual fees paid by growers and importers.",
      "\"It's similar to last year. From what we're hearing, wholesalers are holding their prices,\" Jill Sidebottom, a spokesperson for the National Christmas Tree Association, a trade group that advocates for the tree industry, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For consumers, Christmas trees this holiday season will average around $80 to upwards of $100, compared with $75 in 2023 and in line with the previous year's figures, according to the group.",
      "\"Since COVID, demand thankfully has been very high, and we appreciate that families are still putting up a real tree. The alternative is plastic, and that's not good for the environment,\" Lisa Angevine-Bergs, owner of the Angevine Farm in Warren, Connecticut, and executive director of the Connecticut Christmas Tree Growers told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's more expensive the closer to the city you get,\" she said.",
      "\"The original tight supply goes back to 2008, when there was an oversupply and growers stopped planting as many,\" said Sidebottom, noting that it takes up to a decade to grow a tree. Extreme weather, including a 2021 heat dome, also killed a lot of trees in the Pacific Northwest, she added.",
      "Christmas trees are grown in every U.S. state, with Oregon, North Carolina and Michigan producing the most. Trees are also imported from Canada, with tree types including the Douglas fir imported from British Columbia.",
      "\"We have plenty of live Christmas trees in stock ready for customers and are excited for a great holiday season. We work with supplier partners all over the country to grow our live goods, including live Christmas trees, to ensure we have ample inventory,\" a spokesperson for retailer Home Depot said in an emailed statement.",
      "Drought conditions hit parts of the country in recent months, resulting in wildfires in parts of the East Coast and potentially sleepless nights for tree farmers, given roots that were not properly hydrated in the fall may not make it.",
      "\"We were very worried that it would impact the trees for this year. Thankfully we have not seen any issues,\" Angevine-Bergs said. \"We started cutting some trees early just to see, and in November we began realizing this year's trees are not going to be affected -- taller trees have deeper roots.\"",
      "The roughly 8-foot tree now standard for the Christmas holiday typically takes about eight years to grow, with a white pine, for instance, growing quickly and white fir and spruce trees taking longer.",
      "\"There's about a foot of growth a year, so you're sitting on your money a long time,\" Sidebottom said of the investment made by growers as they wait for their seedlings to sprout and flourish into mature trees.",
      "Just like the holiday shopping season, Americans have moved up the timing as to when they purchase Christmas trees. Last year, a third of Americans bought their Christmas trees during the week after Thanksgiving and another 33% made the purchase during the first week of December, according to a poll of 1,499 adults taken in August and September last year.",
      "Another 16% bought their tree in the second week of December; 14% claimed a tree before Thanksgiving; 3% in the third week of December and only 1% on Christmas Eve, the survey found.",
      "\"The trend now is earlier, even before Thanksgiving,\" Angevine-Bergs said.",
      "In decades past, \"We never sold trees before Thanksgiving,\" said Angevine-Berg of her roughly 50 acre farm, in the family for 156 years and selling Christmas trees since 1960. \"As a child, we were always busy on Christmas Eve, and now you wouldn't necessarily be open. A lot of farms are selling out earlier, and there are a lot of farms that are already sold out and closed.\"",

      "A probate commissioner has ruled against Rupert Murdoch's effort to change his family's trust to give one of his sons control of his media empire and ensure Fox News maintains its conservative editorial slant, according to a sealed document obtained by The New York Times.",
      "In a decision filed on Saturday, a probate commissioner in Nevada concluded that Murdoch, 93, and his son, Lachlan Murdoch, had acted in \"bad faith\" in their endeavor to amend the irrevocable trust, The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0on Monday.",
      "The trust divides control of the company equally among four of Rupert Murdoch's children \u2014 Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James \u2014 after he dies. Lachlan Murdoch has been the head of Fox News and News Corp since late last year, when his father stepped down.",
      "The elder Murdoch has argued that to preserve his businesses' commercial value for all his heirs, the trust must be changed to allow Lachlan Murdoch to maintain Fox News' conservative bent. James and Elisabeth Murdoch are both known to have less-conservative political views than their father or brother, potentially complicating efforts to ensure that Fox News remains conservative.",
      "In his 96-page opinion, Nevada Probate Commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr. of the Second Judicial District Court characterized the plan to change the trust as a \"carefully crafted charade\" to \"permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch's executive roles\" inside the empire \"regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries\" of the family trust.",

The play might have worked; but an evidentiary hearing, like a showdown in a game of poker, is where gamesmanship collides with the facts and at its conclusion, all the bluffs are called and the cards lie face up.\"",

      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",
      "\"It's not like, 'How much do I have to pay for a lawn chair or a steak,'\" Andrews noted. \"People are sick or having some sort of health problem they are worried about.\"",
      "To be sure, people with employer-sponsored health insurance typically don't pay the full premium, as their employers pick up much of the tab.",
      "Yet KFF data shows that employees' share of their premiums are also on the rise, with a worker with family coverage typically paying premiums of $5,700 per year in 2017, the most recent year for that data, up from about $1,600 in 2000, KFF data shows. The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",
      "About 81% of Americans last year said they were dissatisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S, a 16-year high, Gallup polling found.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings on Friday.",
      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 05:45:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The IIHS says a \"small increase in crash speed can really ramp up the danger to a pedestrian,\" and our penchant for big vehicles \"has intensified that effect.\"",
    "story": [
      "Researchers at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety who looked back at data on more than 200 vehicle-pedestrian crashes in the U.S. say Americans' preference for large, tall vehicles is compounding the risks of serious injury to pedestrians associated with higher-speed crashes. The authors of the IIHS study conclude that the size of many American vehicles means serious pedestrian injuries are more likely in crashes when compared to the expected risks on the roads in Europe, where vehicles are generally smaller.",
      "IIHS researchers analyzed 202 crashes involving a vehicle and at least one pedestrian aged 16 or older between 2015 and 2022 in four states, \"to generate an estimate for the link between injury outcomes and impact speed,\" with information about the front-end height of the vehicles being used additionally \"to examine the moderating effect of\" the vehicle's size on the outcome for the pedestrians.",
      "\"A small increase in crash speed can really ramp up the danger to a pedestrian. Our fondness for tall SUVs and pickups in the U.S. has intensified that effect,\" IIHS President David Harkey was quoted as saying about the study's findings.",
      "While it was already understood that more speed at the point of impact increases risks to pedestrians struck by vehicles, the IIHS said the new study was carried out to provide, \"an updated estimate of pedestrian injury risk at different severity levels\" based on the evolving design of vehicles on U.S. roads today.",
      "\"As expected, impact speed strongly predicted injury risk, and hood leading edge height significantly increased the risk of pedestrian injury overall as well as the potency of impact speed for serious injuries,\" the IIHS said.",
      "While the study found no significant change in risk to pedestrians based on the weight of the vehicles involved, the IIHS said that, \"in general, higher vehicle front ends increased the likelihood of both moderate and serious pedestrian injuries.\"",
      "For example, it said that when a median-height pickup, with a front end about 13 inches higher than most cars, hits a pedestrian at 27 mph, there's a 83% chance of moderate injury and a 62% chance of serious injury, compared to 60% and a 30% respectively if the vehicle involved in the crash is a median-height car.",
      "\"Although SUVs are a growing share of the market in Europe, the passenger vehicle fleet there has long been dominated by cars. In contrast, the majority of passenger vehicles on U.S. roads today are SUVs or pickups,\" IIHS senior statistician Sam Monfort, the lead author of the study, was quoted as saying by the institute. \"These choices have very real consequences for pedestrian safety.\"",
      "\"Speed increases have a more pronounced effect when taller vehicles are involved\" in a crash, the organization said. \"For example, as crash speed increases from 15 mph to 35 mph, the risk of a serious injury goes from 9% to 52% when a median-height car is involved. With a median [height] pickup, the risk shoots up from 11% to 91%.\"",
      "Previous research by the IIHS published in 2022 found that drivers of bigger vehicles were more likely to hit pedestrians while making turns than drivers of cars, and another IIHS study published last year that pickups, SUVs and vans with hoods higher than 40 inches at the front edge were about 45% more likely to cause pedestrian fatalities in crashes than cars and other vehicles with lower, sloping hoods.",
      "Despite the concern over the impact of larger vehicles in U.S. pedestrian crashes, however, data showed 2023 saw the first overall year-on-year decline in pedestrian deaths from vehicle accidents in about four years, since the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of pedestrians killed on U.S. roads in 2023 dropped 5.4% compared to the previous year \u2014 which saw a 40-year high \u2014 but it was still 14.1% higher than the number of deaths recorded in 2019, before the pandemic, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.",

It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date.

    "story": [
      "Incoming President Donald Trump has made his feelings about tariffs very clear: \"The word 'tariff' is the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" he has said. \"I think it's more beautiful than 'love.' \u2026 I love tariffs! \u2026 Music to my ears!\"",
      "And what exactly is a tariff? It is a tax. According to Dartmouth economics professor Doug Irwin, \"In U.S. history, we're basically only talking about import tariffs, taxes on imported goods coming into the U.S.\"",
      "Irwin says governments have all kinds of reasons for introducing tariffs: \"Sometimes it's to reduce the trade deficit. Sometimes it's to bring back jobs. Sometimes it's to punish other countries for their unfair trade practices. Sometimes it's to raise revenue so that we can cut income taxes.\"",
      "At its most fundamental, a tariff works like this:",
      "Suppose we import a product from China. The price is $50. But before you can buy it, our government adds $25 to the price. That's the tariff. Your final price is $75. China gets its $50; the extra $25 winds up going to the U.S. Treasury.",
      "But who pays these tariffs?",
      "According to Trump, it's the other countries. \"Trillions and trillions of dollars pouring into the United States Treasury,\" is his description of what happens. \"China paid hundreds of billions of dollars during my term.\"",
      "But as Irwin points out, that's NOT the way tariffs work!",
      "\"I think economists would say that's very misleading to say that that's what's going on,\" he said. \"Of course, it's the U.S. consumers that are paying those, not China itself. China's not writing checks to the U.S. government.\"",
      "Rather, it is a transfer of money from consumers to the federal government. A tax.",
      "Tariffs have been part of international trade since our country was founded; the first one was imposed by George Washington! And what we've learned from history is that they often have unintended consequences.",

      "Then, there was Trump's 25% tariff on imported steel in 2018. Our steelmakers thrived, but companies that make things out of steel (like Ford, GM and Caterpillar) suffered dearly. Just ask Ford's then-CEO Jim Hackett, who in 2018 told Bloomberg, \"The metals tariffs took about a billion dollars of profit from us. If it goes on longer, there will be more damage.\"",
      "Tariffs against one particular country can backfire. Irwin said, \"With the China tariffs, we're importing a lot more from Vietnam, we're importing a lot more from Malaysia. If the idea with the tariff was to bring jobs back home, instead we're just shifting them from China to Vietnam, in some sense.\"",
      "And P.S.: Tariffs don't just raise prices on the imported stuff; they can affect the price of domestic substitutes as well.",
      "So, if there's a tariff on imported steel, and I'm an American steelmaker, I can opportunistically say, \"Well hey, now I can raise my prices, too!\"?\u00a0 Absolutely! says Irwin: \"Consumers don't have the choice anymore. They can buy the really high-priced steel, or they can buy you.\"",
      "Finally, there's the retaliation problem. \"When we imposed the steel tariffs, the European Union and China got very upset with us,\" Irwin said. \"And what did they do? They raised tariffs on American farm goods. So, all of a sudden, American farmers, who had nothing to do with steel per se, found their sales limited overseas.\"",
      "Even Ronald Reagan could have told you that. In fact, he did! In 1987, Reagan said, \"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition.\"",
      "So, exactly what tariffs has Trump proposed? During his campaign, he promised as president he would \"phase in a system of universal baseline tariffs.\" Originally, he outlined tariffs across the board -- every product, in every category, from every country in the world. \"We're going to charge them 10 to 20 percent,\" he said.",

      "Retailers tell consumers that Trump tariffs are a reason to shop now",

      "Now, every recent president has favored some tariffs. The Biden administration, for example, maintained some of the tariffs from Trump's first term, and imposed its own 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. But these tariffs have always targeted particular categories of products. \"An across-the-board tariff? That's not targeting a particular commodity or product, that's not targeting a particular country,\" said Irwin. \"It's just saying, 'All imports, all sources get hit with this tax.' That's a very different type of tariff.\"",
      "And wouldn't we then notice prices going up, on everything?\u00a0 \"We would definitely notice,\" Irwin said.",

      "But Trump's transition leader Howard Lutnick predicts that his boss won't tax imported goods for which there are no American-made alternatives. Back in September, Lutnick told CNBC, \"Tariffs are an amazing tool by the president to use. They're an amazing tool. But he understands, don't tariff stuff we don't make. If we don't make it, and you want to buy it, I don't want to put the price up.\"",

      "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, according to experts",
      "But maybe Trump has no intention of imposing the tariffs for real? Maybe he's playing a strategic game -- tariffs as negotiating tactics?",
      "\"Tariffs can be used as a threat and a bargaining chip,\" said Irwin. \"And sometimes, if you're really credible, just making the threat of a tariff is enough to bring another country to change its policy in a way that you desire without your actually having to impose the tariff in the end.\"",
      "In the end, when a government wants to achieve some economic or geopolitical goal, it can use all kinds of different tools: subsidies, tax breaks or penalties, trade agreements, regulations, certifications, investment incentives, diversification.",
      "According to Doug Irwin, tariffs are a powerful tool, too. They're just rarely the best one. \"What economists have concluded is that tariffs usually have a lot of unintended consequences, can lead to blowback where other countries retaliate against you, and so are not a really good policy instrument for achieving goals that we all Americans want to achieve,\" he said.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in office, but reversed his position during the presidential campaign and vowed to \"save\" the app. He takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Lawmakers and national security officials have long had suspicions about TikTok's ties to China. Officials from both parties have warned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to spy on and collect data from its roughly 170 million American users or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content. The concern is warranted, they have argued, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",
      "The appeals court's decision tees up a fight at the Supreme Court over the law's ultimate fate. The parties asked the judges to make a decision by Friday so there is enough time for the high court to review the case before the law takes effect. The justices could agree to hear the case and pause the law while they consider the legal arguments, or let the appeals court's ruling stand as the final word.",
      "TikTok expects the law will be overturned by the Supreme Court, according to spokesperson Michael Hughes, who argued the law is based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "The Justice Department, meanwhile, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Today's decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"As the D.C. Circuit recognized, this act protects the national security of the United States in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. The Justice Department is committed to defending Americans' sensitive data from authoritarian regimes that seek to exploit companies under their control.\"",
      "The court's decision",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Ginsburg wrote in his opinion. \"Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized the decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Ginsburg said. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "The D.C. Circuit found that the government's national-security justifications for banning TikTok \u2014 to counter China's efforts to collect Americans' data and limit its ability to manipulate content covertly on the platform \u2014 are \"wholly consistent\" with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"The government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.\"",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China committee, praised the decision, calling it \"a loss for the Chinese Community Party,\" while also expressing optimism about the app's future in the U.S.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\" Moolenaar said in a statement.",
      "The House China committee spearheaded the bipartisan effort to pass the law.",
      "The legal arguments",
      "TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge in May that called the legislation \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "\"In reality, there is no choice,\" the petition said, adding that a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\"",
      "The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",
      "During oral arguments in September, the appeals panel appeared skeptical of TikTok's argument that free expression outweighs national security concerns, but the three judges were also critical of the government's stance.",
      "TikTok's lawyer Andrew Pincus said the law \"is unprecedented and its effect would be staggering.\"",
      "\"This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,\" Pincus said. \"Notwithstanding the obvious less restrictive alternatives, the government has not come anywhere near satisfying strict scrutiny.\"",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan said, under TikTok's rationale, the U.S. would not be able to ban a foreign country from owning a major media company in the U.S. if the two are at war.",
      "\"Is your submission that Congress can't bar the enemy's ownership of a major media source in the U.S.?\" Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, asked Pincus.",
      "When Pincus noted that news outlets like Politico and Business Insider are owned by foreign entities, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, quickly chimed in: \"But not foreign adversaries.\"",
      "Rao also pushed back on Pincus' argument that Congress did not include any evidence of its claims that TikTok poses a national security risk in the legislation.",
      "\"I know Congress doesn't legislate all the time, but here they did,\" she said. \"They actually passed a law and many of your arguments want us to treat them as an agency. It's strange. It's a very strange framework for thinking about our first branch of government.\"",
      "Attorney Jeffrey Fisher, who represents TikTok creators, compared the restrictions on TikTok to the U.S. government hypothetically banning bookstores from selling books written by foreign authors in conjunction with a foreign government.",
      "\"We're not talking about banning Tocqueville in the United States,\" Rao countered. \"We're talking about a determination by the political branches that there's a foreign adversary that is potentially exercising covert influence in the United States. Very different.\"",
      "Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, expressed skepticism over the notion that the law singles out TikTok.",
      "\"It describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity,\" he said, noting that the company and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns. \"That's the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny said the data on Americans that could be collected through the app \"would be quite valuable to a foreign adversary if it were trying to approach an American to try to have them be an intelligence asset.\" Tenny also spoke about the risk of content manipulation by China.",
      "\"What is being targeted is a foreign company that controls this recommendation engine and many aspects of the algorithm that's used to determine what content is shown to Americans on the app,\" Tenny said.",
      "But Srinivasan said it's Americans' choice to use the app, despite what content may appear.",
      "\"The fact that that's being denied subjects this to serious First Amendment scrutiny,\" he said.",
      "He later added, \"What gives arguable force to the other side's First Amendment argument is that it's not just that the government is targeting curation that occurs abroad. It's the reason the curation occurring abroad is being targeted, and the reason is a concern about the content consequences of that curation in the U.S.\"",

    "summary": "The public's deep frustration with the health insurance industry is coming to the surface online after the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is surfacing the public's deep frustration with the health insurance industry.",
      "On \"CBS Mornings\" Friday, Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News said the main issue is that health care costs are too high.",
      "\"What we see in this country is that the number one cause of bankruptcy is health-care-related expenses,\" she said.",
      "After groceries, transportation and rent, health care costs are the No. 1 cost of concern to families in this country, according to KFF polling.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Gounder said.",
      "Can the insurance industry do something about high costs?",
      "There are things that can be done, Gounder said.",
      "Under President Barack Obama, for example, there was the Affordable Care Act, which helped to expand health insurance.",
      "\"You had Medicaid, you had the marketplace, then you also have subsidies to make it more affordable to purchase plans on the marketplace,\" Gounder said. \"Those were made even more generous during the pandemic, and then those more generous subsidies were extended under the Inflation Reduction Act under President Biden.\"",
      "But, there is still the challenge of why health care costs are rising.",
      "\"You have efforts to extend coverage and make more people have health care be available, but prices are going up,\" Gounder said.",
      "What could change in U.S. health care look like?",
      "In the U.S., people are faced with both rising health care costs and insurance premiums.",
      "According to a\u00a0KFF poll\u00a0from earlier this year, a quarter of U.S. adults say they've skipped or postponed getting the care they need simply because of the cost.",
      "Compared with other developed countries, the U.S has a different, \"very piecemeal\" approach, Gounder said.",
      "\"Many other countries have what we call socialized medicine,\" Gounder said. \"By the way, Medicare is socialized medicine, and even that socialized medicine is the most expensive in terms of health care for the elderly in the world.\"",
      "Many different proposals have been made to improve the situation, she said, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to negotiate down the price of drugs.",
      "\"We've already seen one round of price negotiations. The incoming administration wants to eliminate the Inflation Reduction Act, at least many of the provisions of that. So whether that will continue, we don't know,\" she said.",
      "There have also been mergers and acquisitions in the health care industry, which means less competition.",
      "\"Biden administration has really been trying to pursue antitrust suits to block some of these,\" Gounder said. \"The Trump administration, the prior administration, tried to make health care pricing more transparent. That was another way of trying to make things better. It's not enough. These are all sort of chipping away at a bigger problem.\"",
      "What you can do if a claim is denied",
      "In posts to social media, doctors are sharing their experiences with more and more claims being denied \u2014 something Gounder is seeing too.",
      "\"What we're also seeing now is increasing use of AI by the insurance companies to deny claims, and then you have competing AIs being developed by health care systems to fight the health insurance AIs,\" she said. \"Me as a doctor, I have to spend a lot of time on the phone with various different companies to try to explain why my patient is in the hospital.\"",
      "If you are finding your claims to be denied, Gounder suggests following a few steps:",
      "Collect all of the paperwork you can to make your case",
      "Review very carefully the statements that are sent to you and what the issues are",
      "See what your doctor can do to start in terms of filing an appeal",
      "Consider state insurance commissions that regulate insurance that you can also appeal to. Go to naic.com and look up your state.",

    "story": [
      "In the wake of\u00a0UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing in New York City Wednesday morning, some companies are taking additional precautionary measures to protect their executives while corporate security firms are reporting an uptick in interest in their services.",
      "The shooting of Thompson, who did not appear to have a security detail with him when he was attacked outside a Manhattan hotel, is shining a light on the business of protecting prominent corporate executives, whose security costs can reach millions of dollars per year.",
      "It's common for the top brass at public companies to be protected by guards around the clock, according to security experts. Social media's amplification of everyday individuals' dissatisfaction with a particular person, product or service has only heightened the need for protection, they say. That's particularly true in an industry like health care insurance, when many Americans say they are dissatisfied with the services they receive.",
      "Indeed, in the wake of Thompson's killing, many on social media expressed vitriol for some health insurers' practices.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings about the public voicing its frustrations.",
      "To be sure, some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, were spending heavily on personal and residential security for their top executives prior to Thompson's killing. Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, at more than $24 million, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "While Thompson had an in-house security detail during his New York City visit, it wasn't with him at the time of the shooting, according to CNN, which cited a source familiar with UnitedHealthcare's security.",
      "In the wake of the attack, corporate security experts said companies should take time to evaluate their corporate security protocols and beef up protective measures, if necessary, to protect against a variety of threats.",
      "\"My phone has been ringing off hook, with calls in particular coming from health care leaders who are reevaluating their security,\" said Paul Sarnese, a safety and security consultant and former president of the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety (IAHSS).",
      "He said the deadly incident will likely prompt more executives to seek more robust protection. \"This incident will definitely change those executives' minds that might have been reluctant to initiate security protocols. I think they'll be more receptive to executive protection,\" he said.",
      "Too much information",
      "In the wake of Thompson's death, some companies are taking steps to limit publicly available information about their executives. For example, a page on UnitedHealthcare's website about the company's leadership \u2014 where Thompson and other executives' bios were listed \u2014\u00a0no longer exists, and instead redirects to the company's home page.",
      "Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, as well as other insurers have taken similar actions, their websites show.",
      "Medica told the Associated Press Friday that it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons, in addition to removing executives bios' from its website.",
      "\"Although we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Experts say these types of moves are wise.",
      "\"I think we share too much. I don't need to know where you live and that you're married and have three wonderful kids,\" Sarnese said. \"We don't need to advertise to the public where the president and CEO are sitting.\"",
      "While executives across all industries should be evaluating their security postures, healthcare industry professionals have received more threats in recent years as a result of divisiveness that arose around safety protocols, including mask mandates, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sarnese said.",
      "\"Every industry has challenges because there is always going to be somebody who is upset with a service or product or philosophy. But COVID changed everything. We never saw the level of threats we saw during COVID toward healthcare workers and leaders, because of some of the mistrust and misinformation that was out there in the community,\" he said.",
      "\"All the ways things can go wrong\"",
      "Security industry veteran Brittney Blair of K2 Integrity said that online threat monitoring is as essential as physical protection.",
      "More companies are becoming more active in tracking cyber threats, including monitoring the web and dark web.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump announced in November that he intended to name Kash Patel to replace Cristopher Wray as FBI director.",
    "story": [
      "FBI Director Christopher Wray announced he will resign from his post at the end of the current administration, leaving the bureau in advance of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration next month.",
      "He made the announcement during a packed, standing-room town hall with FBI employees at the bureau's headquarters Wednesday.",
      "\"After weeks of careful thought, I've decided the right thing for the bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down,\" he said. \"My goal is to keep the focus on\u202four mission \u2014 the indispensable work you're doing on behalf of the American people every day. In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work.\"",
      "\"It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway \u2014 this is not easy for me,\" Wray continued. \"I love this place, I love our mission, and I love our people \u2014 but my focus is, and always has been, on us and doing what's right for the FBI.\"",
      "Thousands from FBI offices across the country tuned in for the live stream of his speech. Some people cried as Wray spoke. At the end of his remarks, he received a standing ovation that went on for over a minute, until Wray left the room.",
      "The president-elect welcomed Wray's announcement in a social media post, calling it \"a great day for America.\"",
      "Trump appointed Wray \u2014 a former federal prosecutor and counterterrorism official \u2014 as FBI director in 2017 for a 10-year term after firing James Comey. Wray has since come under fire from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill over the FBI's handling of investigations into the president-elect. He has remained director under President Biden, but Trump previously said he intended to remove Wray and replace him with Kash Patel, a former GOP congressional staffer who was tapped by Trump during his first term for roles in the Defense Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "Wray told the FBI's rank and file, \"We're not on any one side \u2026 We're on the American people's side,\" and on \"the Constitution's side,\" adding, that \"no matter what's happening out there, in here, we've got to stay committed to doing our work the right way every time \u2014 with rigor and integrity.\"",
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland praised Wray, saying in a statement that he \"has served our country honorably and with integrity for decades, including for seven years as the Director of the FBI under presidents of both parties.\"",
      "\"The Director of the FBI is responsible for protecting the independence of the FBI from inappropriate influence in its criminal investigations,\" Garland said. \"That independence is central to preserving the rule of law and to protecting the freedoms we as Americans hold dear. Director Wray has done that job with integrity and skill.\"",
      "CBS News has learned Wray wrestled with his decision to step down but opted to go because he's concerned if he were to stay, the attacks on him could drag the FBI into another political fight it doesn't need.",
      "FBI directors are appointed for a 10-year term, which has historically been intended to ensure the position is insulated from political considerations. But presidents have the power to fire and nominate directors at will, and many FBI directors have not served their full terms. The Senate must also vote to confirm any president's nominee to serve as FBI director.",
      "Wray's announcement clears the way for Patel to lead the FBI in Trump's second term. Patel has been meeting in the Capitol with senators who will vote on his confirmation.",
      "Wray and FBI leadership became targets of Trump's ire in 2022, when FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The search exposed what had been an ongoing federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records after he left office. The investigation culminated in criminal charges against Trump filed by special counsel Jack Smith, but they have since been dismissed by a federal judge. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "If confirmed, Patel would be the third FBI director to work under a Trump administration and take over the nation's chief federal law enforcement apparatus, amid years of intense criticism from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. While Wray's departure from the job was largely expected, Trump's announcement that he planned to nominate Patel to the position raised speculation among federal law enforcement about whether Wray would resign or remain in his post ahead of Trump's inauguration.",
      "Wray took over the post after Trump fired then-Director James Comey, in part because of the FBI's investigation into the 2016 election that resulted in Robert Mueller's appointment as special counsel for that case. Comey, who has since become an outspoken critic of the president-elect, found himself at odds with Democrats and Republicans upon his departure from the FBI's top job.",
      "Since his confirmation in 2017, Wray has spent much of his tenure focusing on internal matters like agent recruitment and national security issues including countering China's espionage campaigns. He sounded the alarm on foreign efforts to target American infrastructure and warned of aggressive posturing by Iran and Russia.",
      "The FBI employs about 35,000 people \u2014 including thousands of field agents \u2014 tasked with enforcing federal law and investigating crimes across the country, including terrorism, espionage and child exploitation.",
      "Patel, who could soon be Wray's replacement, has been outspoken in his criticism of the federal agency and has said he would implement massive reforms and seek retribution for Trump, saying at one point, \"We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.\"",
      "In his remarks, Wray reminded the bureau's employees that working at the FBI \"means conducting investigations without fear or favor ... and it means not pursuing investigations when the predication is not there.\"",
      "Patel would report directly to the attorney general of the United States \u2014\u00a0 Trump's current pick for the post is former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "Trump's announcement that he planned to nominate the 44-year-old Patel to serve as FBI Director was met with criticism from Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill and some former officials from Trump's first term.",
      "John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump's first term and was Patel's boss, compared the nomination to Joseph Stalin's secret police chief.",
      "\"Fortunately, the FBI is not\" Stalin's secret police, Bolton said. \"The Senate should reject this nomination 100-0,\" a reaction that prompted pushback from Trump allies and Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday defended President Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan while appearing before the Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee, which has long sought to question him over the deadly evacuation.",
      "\"I firmly believe the president's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan was the right one,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "Blinken declined to take the blame for decisions that were made leading up to the exit, explaining that actions taken by the first Trump administration left the Biden administration in a weak position and intelligence assessments expected Kabul to remain the hands of the Afghan government.",
      "Blinken's testimony came nearly three months after the committee\u00a0voted\u00a0along party lines to recommend that the nation's top diplomat be held in contempt of Congress amid a standoff over his appearance before the panel to discuss its investigation into the\u00a02021 withdrawal.",
      "The committee and State Department had been at odds for months, leading Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the Republican chairman, to issue multiple subpoenas for Blinken to testify in September. McCaul said Blinken's appearance was important as the committee considers \"potential legislation aimed at helping prevent the catastrophic mistakes of the withdrawal.\"",
      "The Afghanistan hearing",
      "\"Tragically, more than three years after this administration's disastrous withdrawal, you're finally here to take responsibility,\" McCaul said Wednesday, also accusing Blinken in the lead up to the evacuation of denying \"imminent and dangerous threats to American interests, American citizens and our decade long Afghan partners, all the while, the Taliban captured province after province on their march to Kabul.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee released a lengthy report in September that detailed their yearslong investigation into the chaotic exit from Afghanistan and accused the Biden administration of misleading the public about the end of the 20-year war.",
      "Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the committee, on Wednesday called the report \"partisan and misleading\" and said Republicans have \"muddled the facts\" about whether a suicide bombing that killed 13 U.S. service members was preventable.",
      "Blinken, whose opening statement was repeatedly disrupted by protesters, acknowledged the service members who died and their families, saying he deeply regretted that the U.S. \"did not do more and could not do more to protect them.\"",
      "\"To the extent President Biden faced a choice, it was between ending the war or escalating it,\" Blinken said. \"In the three years since the end of our country's longest war. All of us, including myself, have wrestled with what we could have done differently during that period and over the proceeding two decades.\"",
      "Blinken also acknowledged that the Taliban was not in compliance with a deal the Trump administration struck with the group to withdraw U.S. forces from the country by May 2021. The deal, known as the Doha Agreement, laid out a series of conditions for the Taliban to fulfill in order for U.S. forces to fully leave Afghanistan.",
      "\"The Taliban was in violation of the Doha Agreement in a number of ways,\" he said. \"It was in violation when the previous administration drew down forces repeatedly. It was in violation during the time that we were in office before the evacuation.\"",
      "According to Blinken, the Biden administration unsuccessfully tried to get the Taliban to abide by the conditions and negotiate with the Afghan government.",
      "\"They didn't do that,\" he said. \"But because we had the deadline, and because we had the prospect of the Taliban resuming attacks on U.S. forces, which would have required us to put tens of thousands of Americans back into Afghanistan, we followed through with pulling them out.\"",
      "He said the Doha Agreement \"created a tremendous crisis in confidence\" in the Afghan government. The Afghan government was excluded from the Trump administration's negotiations with the Taliban that led to the agreement.",
      "Blinken said he was on the phone with then-Afghan President Ashraf Ghani the night before he fled the country as the Taliban closed in.",
      "\"He told me that he wanted to continue working on getting an agreement with the Taliban, but if he couldn't, he would stay and fight to the death,\" Blinken said. \"And he left the next day.\"",
      "Though the U.S. tried to get in contact with every U.S. citizen in the Afghanistan, Blinken said, hundreds who wanted to leave the country did not make it out before the withdrawal. As of now, \"every American who identified themselves and said that they wanted to leave has been given an opportunity to do so,\" he said. But some returned after the withdrawal and have been detained, he said.",
      "\"We are working every day to get them out, to get them back,\" he said.",
      "The committee's report",
      "During its investigation, the committee conducted 18 transcribed interviews with Biden administration officials and received more than 20,000 pages of documents from the State Department, some of which were obtained through subpoenas. Blinken was not among those who testified for the report, but the State Department noted amid the standoff with the committee that he has testified to Congress on Afghanistan more than 14 times.",
      "The report accused President Biden and his administration of ignoring repeated warnings from military officials, national security advisers and U.S. allies about the risks of removing all American forces from Afghanistan, saying Mr. Biden \"prioritized politics and his personal legacy over America's national security interests.\"",
      "Blinken was among those faulted in the report, which said he \"remained largely absent throughout the State Department's withdrawal planning\" and the evacuation.",
      "\"Indeed, witnesses interviewed, and documents produced by federal agencies pursuant to the investigation, confirm Secretary Blinken likely ceded his responsibility to subordinates on Afghanistan,\" the report said.",
      "Blinken advocated for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to remain open regardless of the military withdrawal, according to the report, which said that the desire to maintain a diplomatic presence contributed to the State Department's \"lack of urgency and their delays in planning for the worst-case scenarios.\"",
      "The report also noted that diplomatic officials on the ground expressed concerns about the commitment to keep the embassy open despite the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, culminating in a July 2021 dissent cable warning that Kabul would fall after the planned withdrawal. Two weeks before the U.S. troops left Afghanistan, State Department leaders agreed to shutter the embassy, the report said.",
      "Republicans threatened to hold Blinken in contempt of Congress in 2023 as they sought to review the classified dissent cable. The State Department eventually allowed lawmakers to view a partially redacted version.",
      "\"You personally read this, sir,\" McCaul said while questioning Blinken on Wednesday. \"Why did you ignore the cries for help? Why did you leave the embassy open?\"",
      "McCaul also said it appeared that Blinken delegated his responsibility and pressed him on who was calling the shots.",
      "\"To legislate moving forward, I need to know who was in charge,\" McCaul said, calling on Mr. Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan to testify to the committee.",
      "About 20 minutes later, McCaul announced that Sullivan had agreed to testify on Tuesday.",
      "Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee accused Republicans of politicizing the withdrawal and said the majority took \"particular pains to avoid facts involving former President Donald Trump.\"",
      "Last year, the White House released its own 12-page summary of a classified review of the Afghanistan exit that largely blamed the Trump administration for the Doha Agreement.

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:04:45 -0500",
    "summary": "A Democrat-led push to secure a majority on the National Labor Relations Board until 2026 fell short, facing opposition from Republicans and independents.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Democrat-led push to secure a majority on the National Labor Relations Board until 2026 fell short on Wednesday, as Senate Republicans and two independents blocked the nomination of Lauren McFerran to continue serving on the labor board.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer filed cloture Monday on the nominations of McFerran, a Democrat, to remain for another five-year term on the National Labor Relations Board. McFerran is the current chair of the NLRB whose term is set to expire later this month. Her confirmation to another term would have maintained a Democratic majority on the board, in a move that would have marked a key victory for Democrats heading into a second Trump administration and a Republican trifecta in Washington.",
      "In a 50 to 49 vote, Senate Republicans, joined by independent Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, blocked the nomination from advancing. Without the confirmation, the board is expected to swing to come under Republican control, with a vacancy for President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming GOP-controlled Senate to fill in the new year.",
      "Schumer praised McFerran ahead of the vote on Wednesday, saying she has \"served admirably on the NLRB for many years, where she's known for her fairness, her deep expertise and guiding the board to deal with the challenges of the contemporary work place.\"",
      "\"If you truly care about working families, if you care about fixing income inequality in America, then you should be in favor of advancing today's NLRB nominee,\" Schumer said, stressing that \"you can't say you're for working families and then go and vote no today, because the NLRB protects workers from mistreatment on the job and from overreaching employers.\"",
      "The NLRB is an independent federal agency with five board members that serves as a mediator between labor unions and big business by enforcing labor law under the National Labor Relations Act. Under the union-friendly Biden administration, the NLRB has delivered a slew of pro-union rulings.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent and longtime labor advocate, posted Tuesday on social media\u00a0 that McFerran has \"done an exceptional job protecting workers' rights & standing up against illegal union busting,\" arguing that it's \"imperative that a majority of Senators vote to reconfirm her this week so she can continue this vital work.\"",
      "Republicans largely opposed the nomination, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who came out in opposition of McFerran's nomination on Tuesday. The Kentucky Republican, who is leaving leadership in January, said Tuesday in remarks from the Senate floor that his colleagues should consider the \"gross mismanagement of Ms. McFerran's watch.\"",
      "\"Her confirmation would give a lame-duck president control of an independent board well into his successor's term,\" McConnell added.",
      "Manchin, a West Virginia independent who caucuses with Democrats, also joined with Republicans to oppose advancing the nomination, as did Sinema, an Arizona independent. The two senators, who are often key votes on partisan measures, are both departing the Senate after opting not to seek reelection. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, did not vote.",
      "The vote came as Senate Democrats have been making a last-minute push to confirm President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts. Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's judicial confirmations from his first term, but have run into resistance from Republicans in recent weeks who are looking to drag out the process.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House task force investigating the assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump released a final report on its probe on Tuesday, presenting a series of recommendations to combat future security failures, including reducing the number of officials it protects during campaign season.",
      "\"The Task Force found that the tragic and shocking events in Butler, Pennsylvania were preventable and should not have happened. There was not, however, a singular moment or decision that allowed Thomas Matthew Crooks to nearly assassinate the former President,\" the 180-page report said, noting that \"various failures \u2026 coalesced to create an environment in which the former President \u2014 and everyone at the campaign event \u2014 were exposed to grave danger.\"",
      "The House voted to establish the panel following the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, where a gunman opened fire during a rally and a bullet grazed the former president's ear. Secret Service snipers shot and killed the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. The Secret Service came under intense scrutiny following the incident, and its director soon resigned.",
      "The task force, made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats, also looked into a second assassination attempt on Sept. 15 in West Palm Beach, Florida, which was foiled. Trump was golfing when a Secret Service agent discovered a man with a rifle who was waiting along the tree line of the course.",
      "What the report says",
      "Over the course of the investigation, the task force said it conducted 46 interviews, reviewed 18,000 pages of documents and visited the incident sites in Butler and West Palm Beach.",
      "The panel found that the \"failures\" that led to the July 13 incident were \"not isolated to the campaign event itself.\" The lawmakers noted that \"preexisting issues in leadership and training created an environment\" in which the failures could occur, like giving significant responsibilities to Secret Service personnel with little to no experience in advanced planning roles.",
      "\"The events of July 13, 2024, were tragic and preventable, and the litany of related security failures are unacceptable,\" the report says, acknowledging that the Secret Service's mission \"allows no margin for error.\"",
      "The task force made three dozen recommendations, including reducing the number of individuals it protects. The lawmakers also said Congress should examine whether the Secret Service should still be involved in investigating fraud and financial crimes.",
      "\"Congress must consider whether the Secret Service's investigative obligations can effectively coexist with its primary protective mission, and whether the agency's investigative functions should remain within the Department of Homeland Security,\" the report said.",
      "\"The number of individuals being protected has greatly expanded, a resource demand which becomes further taxed during the longer and more intensive modern presidential campaign seasons,\" it said, noting that the Secret Service also protects foreign dignitaries during the U.N. General Assembly in New York City in September, which comes at the height of the campaign season. \"As a result, Congress, DHS, and the USSS should jointly consider the protective role the USSS plays for foreign leaders and consider whether such duties can be transferred or abrogated in order to focus on the USSS's primary duty: to protect the President and other critical U.S. leaders.\"",
      "It also recommended that Secret Service consolidate the plans of all law enforcement entities working an event; fill gaps with its own personnel when local counterparts are unable to provide adequate security; identify all potential lines of sight vulnerabilities; require counter-surveillance assets for all large outdoor events; and address inadequate training. Other recommendations included reviewing protocols for identifying security breaches during golf outings and using a specific type of vehicle, which was redacted in the report, on the golf course.",
      "The panel also called on Congress to review the agency's financial and personnel resources, recommending that it take a look at \"reducing the pace of travel, ensuring overtime is properly compensated, and giving incentives for veteran agents to stay with the USSS beyond minimum retirement ages.\"",
      "While the panel's investigation has wrapped, the task force encouraged relevant committees in Congress to work to address \"important questions\" that it was unable to examine fully. On the top of that list, the panel said, are the motivations of the shooter and would-be shooter, which the panel said \"remain largely unknown.\"",
      "Before wrapping its investigation, the task force held its final hearing last week with testimony from Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe, who acknowledged the agency's \"abject failure\" in the July shooting. Rowe outlined a series of changes he had implemented at the agency since the assassination attempt.",

    "summary": "Manhattan prosecutors say Donald Trump's election in November shouldn't mean his conviction in May needs to be vacated.",
    "story": [
      "New York prosecutors say President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House should not undermine the decision of 12 jurors who found him guilty of dozens of felonies in May, telling the judge overseeing the case that the conviction should stand.",
      "\"This Court should reject [Trump's] motion to 'immediately' dismiss the indictment and vacate the jury's guilty verdict based on the outcome of the recent presidential election,\" prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg wrote in their filing, which was made public Tuesday. \"There are no grounds for such relief now, prior to defendant's inauguration, because President-elect immunity does not exist.\"",
      "Soon after Trump's election in November, his defense lawyers promised to urge Justice Juan Merchan to toss his indictment in the \"hush money\" case and set aside the verdict. They made their motion on Dec. 2, hinging their push to discard the will of 12 jurors who sat for the seven-week trial on an unlikely subject: President Biden's son, Hunter. Trump's attorneys said the announcement of Hunter Biden's controversial pardon echoed Trump's complaints about his prosecution, claiming it was politically driven.",
      "Prosecutors did not mention either Biden or the pardon in their response filing.",
      "They hit back against the core of Trump's effort to set aside his conviction. Trump's lawyers \u2014 two of whom are slated to take on senior roles in the Justice Department after Trump's inauguration \u2014 have argued that it would be unconstitutional for an incoming president to carry the burden of a guilty verdict reached before his election.",
      "\"[Trump's] suggestion that his subsequent election 'superseded' the jury's verdict is deeply misguided,\" prosecutors wrote. \"As this Court carefully and correctly instructed the jury, it was the empaneled jurors who were 'deciding whether the Defendant is guilty or not guilty' because only these jurors \u2014 not the general electorate \u2014 heard all the evidence in this trial.\"",
      "Prosecutors argued Trump's lawyers are trying to \"effectively extend the period of [Trump's] immunity to a time before his presidency, by wiping out the effects of an indictment and jury verdict that took place before he was even reelected President.\"",
      "Trump's sentencing has been postponed three times since his conviction in May. It was initially scheduled for July 11, but Merchan pushed that date back so Trump's attorneys could file a separate motion to dismiss following a landmark Supreme Court ruling. The nation's highest court concluded in early July that former presidents could not be charged for official acts, and evidence related to their official work as president could not be used as evidence against them.",
      "Merchan has not ruled on that motion. He postponed the second sentencing date, Sept. 18, after Trump's lawyers argued it was too close to the election. After Trump's election victory on Nov. 5, they demanded a Nov. 26 sentencing date be postponed so they could file the new motion to dismiss the case, revolving around his return to the White House.",
      "Bragg's office said in its filing it would be open to postponing sentencing and other proceedings until after Trump's term in office, which ends in 2029.",
      "\"If [Trump] is not sentenced before his inauguration, there is also no legal barrier to deferring that sentencing until after the end of his presidency,\" they wrote.",
      "Prosecutors also floated terminating the case \"with a notation that the jury verdict has not been vacated and the indictment has not been dismissed,\" an option they acknowledged is typically used when defendants die before case proceedings conclude.",
      "\"Especially given the novelty of defendant's own immunity claims, it would hardly be improper for this Court to exercise its inherent authority to consider novel remedies such as adopting a version of the Alabama rule in the context of this unique case,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "The judge's decision will be the latest moment in the case to set a historical precedent. Trump was the first person to be elected president after being convicted of crimes. When the unanimous jury concluded in May he was guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, he became the first former president ever convicted of crimes. In March 2023, Trump became the first former president ever indicted when a grand jury concluded he should be charged.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 12:39:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department failed to follow internal policy and ignored protections when seeking records from members of Congress, dozens of congressional staffers and members of the media, a watchdog found.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department failed to follow department policy and ignored some established protections when seeking records from members of Congress, dozens of congressional staffers and members of the media during the first Trump administration, an internal watchdog found.",
      "A report by the department's Office of Inspector General released on Tuesday focused on numerous leak investigations launched by the Justice Department and the FBI between 2017 and 2020 to determine how eight journalists from the Washington Post, the New York Times and CNN obtained classified information that appeared in reports. The data mostly included metadata about emails and phone calls, and did not contain the content of the communications.",
      "In 2017, FBI investigators honed in on members of Congress and their staff as possible sources of various news reports, eventually obtaining data from two Democratic lawmakers and 43 congressional staffers from both parties. Inspector General Michael Horowitz criticized the large number of congressional employees whose information was obtained, and urged the department to implement stronger policies to protect the data of members of Congress and their staff.",
      "\"[D]ozens of congressional staffers became part of the subject pool in a federal criminal investigation for doing nothing more than performing constitutionally authorized oversight of the executive branch,\" the report said. In a 2023 lawsuit against the Justice Department, Kash Patel, Trump's pick to serve as FBI director in the upcoming administration, said he was one of those staffers while working for the House Intelligence Committee. Patel alleged the collection was \"in complete contravention of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\"",
      "The inspector general also revealed the two lawmakers were targeted because a Democratic staffer \"identified them to investigators as potential leakers but without providing any evidentiary support for the claim.\"",
      "CBS News reported in 2021 that Justice Department prosecutors had subpoenaed Apple for data from the accounts of Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell of California while investigating leaks of classified information related to contacts between aides to President-Elect Donald Trump and Russia in the early days of the Trump administration. Both men criticized the investigative steps at the time. Schiff was sworn in this week as the next senator from California, and Swalwell remains in the House.",
      "There were four secret investigations in total, all of which were closed without criminal charges. The probes emerged into public view in 2021, when the Biden administration informed the three news organizations that their records had been swept up in the Trump-era probes. The Post, the Times and CNN each announced and condemned the revelations at the time.",
      "Notably, the inspector general's review said there was no evidence that the investigations were influenced by politics or other improper considerations. The report also said that certain processes and approvals that are now required were not in place at the time.",
      "However, the report said the decision to go after the communications of congressional staffers and members \"implicated the constitutional rights and authorities or a co-equal branch of government.\"",
      "Such conduct, the report argued, \"risks chilling Congress' ability to conduct oversight of the executive branch.\" The inspector general said there was no definitive department policy on the matter and much of the decision-making was left up to line prosecutors on the cases. As a result, the report called for further safeguards and policy changes, some of which have been implemented.",
      "Unlike investigations into members of Congress, Justice Department policy stipulates that prosecutors must first prove to have \"exhausted\" other avenues before seeking to secretly obtain records from members of the media. But Horowitz found investigators in 2020 \"did not fully adhere\" to other policies when they turned their attention to the news media organizations that published the classified information.",
      "According to the report, then-Attorney General William Barr authorized the collection of the journalists' communication data because policy required senior approval for investigations into journalists, but prosecutors working on the cases did not follow other procedures. Horowitz found that in all of the investigations, the Justice Department's New Media Review Committee \u2014 a group of officials within the department tasked with reviewing such investigative steps \u2014 was not established. The report also said prosecutors failed to obtain necessary sign-off from the intelligence community before collecting communications data in at least one instance.",
      "Unsealed court records showed the requests were made in the final weeks of Trump's first term. Barr did not agree to be interviewed for the inspector general's report. The former head of the Justice Department's national security division told the inspector general Barr and his predecessor had \"made it very clear leak investigations were a priority of the Department.\"",
      "\"In our judgment, the Department's deviation from its own requirements indicates a troubling disparity between, on the one hand, the regard expressed in Department policy for the roles of the news media in American democracy and, on the other hand, the Department's commitment to complying with the limits and requirements that it intended to safeguard that very role,\" Horowitz wrote.",
      "Following the revelations that the reporters were subjects of the Trump-era Justice Department investigations, the Garland Justice Department changed department policies governing news media organizations.",

      "His remark came a day after the Canadian prime minister had commented on Trump's tariff threat and what it could mean to U.S. consumers. \"Trump got elected on a commitment to make life better and more affordable for Americans, and I think people south of the border are beginning to wake up to the real reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive,\" Trudeau said at an event at the\u00a0Halifax Chamber of Commerce, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News\u00a0that he told Trudeau Canada needs to \"close\" its borders to prevent migrants and drugs from \"pouring in.\" And if he doesn't close the Canadian border, Trump said he would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada. He leveled the same threats against Mexico.",
      "Trump has complained about fentanyl coming into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada, even though there have been fewer seizures from across the Canadian border than from the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of Senate Democrats is pressing President Biden to work to \"protect immigrant families\" in the final weeks of his presidency, with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office next month.",
      "\"As Senators who represent diverse states across our nation and who collectively represent millions of immigrant families, we write to express our deep concern about the threat the incoming administration poses to immigrants in our communities,\" the group of senators, led by Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, wrote in a letter to the president Monday.",
      "The senators cited Trump's threat of mass deportations that they say will \"jeopardize the safety and security\" of millions of families, \"sow deep distrust and fear\" in the communities and \"destabilize the U.S. economy.\" And they urged Mr. Biden to take a number of actions in advance of Trump's inauguration, stressing that the \"window to secure and finalize your administration's policies is closing rapidly.\"",
      "\"We urge you to act decisively between now and the inauguration of the President-elect to complete the important work of the past four years and protect immigrant families,\" Durbin said in the letter, which was also signed by Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico and Alex Padilla of California.",
      "Among the requests, the group asked the president to prioritize redesignating and extending Temporary Protected Status for all eligible countries, which allows migrants from countries experiencing unsafe conditions to legally reside in the U.S. The group also asked the president to expedite the processing of benefit requests for recipients of DACA, the program for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children and have been granted protection from deportation.",
      "The push comes as Trump has made clear his intention to pursue a radical shift on immigration policy, which became a key part of his campaign as he promised to target both unauthorized and legal immigrants with unprecedented measures.",
      "In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that aired Sunday, reiterated a number of the pledges, including that he's \"absolutely\" still planning to end birthright citizenship on Day One of his presidency. He also made clear that he plans to carry out his mass deportations pledge, beginning with criminals.",
      "When asked by host Kristen Welker whether it's possible to deport everyone who's in the U.S. illegally, Trump responded that \"you have no choice.\" He said his administration would be \"starting with the criminals\" before others, noting that \"we're going to see how it goes.\"",
      "On DACA recipients, known as Dreamers, Trump said he would work with Democrats on a plan, claiming that \"Republicans are very open to the Dreamers.\"",
      "\"I want to be able to work something out,\" Trump said, while indicating that he wants the DACA recipients to be able to stay. Legislative efforts to codify the DACA program have failed for more than a decade, and Republican-led states have filed numerous lawsuits over the years arguing the program is unconstitutional. The president-elect tried to end the program during his first administration.",
      "On immigrant families more broadly, Trump emphasized that he doesn't \"want to be breaking up families,\" saying that \"the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.\"",
      "In their letter, the senators noted that while they support \"commonsense\" border security measures, they \"will continue to oppose any policies that contradict our nation's core values.\"",

      "Many of the governors at the conference were elected during the blue wave in 2018 and have experience working with a Trump White House, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We were able to find ways,\" said Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, who was one of these governors and serves as the chair of the Democratic Governors Association. \"We really took a positive approach to it, and this time around, I think we'll end up doing the same thing, because really, we have no idea what's coming down. So, we'll evaluate it as it comes to us.\"",
      "Politically, Democratic governors are also primed to fill a leadership vacuum in the party in the coming years. Some potential 2028 presidential candidates have already been taking action.",
      "In early December, California Gov. Gavin Newsom launched a special session to \"safeguard California values\" and bolster funds for legal defenses against potential federal actions on abortion, climate and immigration. A week after the election, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker partnered with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis to start the \"Governors Safeguarding Democracy\" group, a think tank to create a \"toolbox\" of policies and responses to Trump's presidency.",
      "\"Anything that's happening right now in Washington, states are gonna be the front line of defense on that,\" said Democratic strategist Corey Platt, who was the DGA's political director from 2013 to 2018. \"There's always a disconnect from voters to D.C. Folks are always angry at D.C., and yet, states have to make things work every day.\"",
      "No \"perfect answer\" for 2024 losses",
      "Still fresh in the minds of these governors were the party's widespread losses in the 2024 election. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein's victory in the governor's race\u00a0was an electoral bright spot for Democrats in the battleground state, where Vice President Kamala Harris lost by 3 points.",
      "He said he didn't \"have a perfect answer\" on why he won (though his\u00a0scandal-plagued GOP opponent helped give him an advantage) and Harris lost. Stein blamed a \"tough national environment,\" but noted that his state often splits their ticket: in seven of the last nine presidential elections, North Carolina has voted for a Republican for president and a Democrat for governor.",
      "\"People were definitely anxious economically, because they were seeing and feeling price increases,\" he said. \"Typically, when you're unhappy, you blame the party that's in control of the White House. Even if it's not nationally their fault.\"",
      "New Jersey and Virginia, a potential flip opportunity for Democrats, have off-year gubernatorial elections in 2025. The 2026 map is vast, with 36 states electing governors. Several of those states, such as Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire, could be targeted pickups for the party. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear will be taking over as DGA Chair in 2026.",
      "\"Lifting up as many people as we can that are running on these common sense, common ground areas that people care about the most, will also create that critical mass for people to say the Democratic Party is for working people,\" said Beshear, the rare Democratic governor who has won in a Republican state.",
      "Platt, a former DGA political director, agreed that the 2026 gubernatorial races can help find \"the good surrogate for Democratic policy and Democratic ideas that has empathy, that folks can understand.\" He added that while a large number of governors are going to be \"in that conversation\" as the party recalibrates, it won't just be them.",
      "\"We're gonna need leaders that can speak to real people,\" he said. \"It doesn't happen because of a poll. It doesn't happen because of a tactic. It's real and authentic, and I'm excited to see how that happens.\"",
      "Courtney Alexander, communications director for the Republican Governors Association, opposes potential attempts by Democratic governors to counter the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"The fact that Americans resoundingly rejected the Democratic Party agenda just one month ago, and yet Democrats continue to believe running against an agenda of lower costs, more safety, and more freedom is their winning message shows just how wholly out of touch they are with the country,\" Alexander told CBS News.",
      "Trump's mass deportation plan",
      "Some governors are laying the groundwork to counter Trump's plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.",
      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that deporting undocumented migrants who are convicted criminals is the first priority in his mass deportation plan, but other, nonviolent undocumented migrants may also be subject to removal.",
      "\"I think you have to do it, and it's a hard \u2014 it's a very tough thing to do. But you have to have, you know, you have rules, regulations, laws. They came in illegally,\" Trump said.",
      "New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said while she'd accept federal assistance to help locate and deport undocumented migrants who are convicted criminals, there would be \"zero way\" she'd cooperate with a broader mass deportation plan.",
      "She noted her control over the state police force, said she wouldn't grant licenses for physical detentions, and said providing the federal government private information about undocumented residents would endanger transgender residents or women who travel from states with abortion bans.",
      "\"I don't doubt that he will make every effort,\" Lujan Grisham said about Trump and his mass deportation plan. \"He's going to have trouble executing that. But I also am not Pollyanna about how serious [he is].... I take him at his word, which is why I know what I must do and will do. And let's see if my strategy works the way that I think it will across the country.\"",
      "Kelly said she would not permit the Kansas National Guard \"to perform that kind of service\" and said it's not the job of the Kansas State Police either.",
      "\"No doubt, if there are things they push us to do that we think are wrong or illegal, we'll draw the line,\" said Kelly.",
      "Stein, who will be taking office as North Carolina governor in January, said the mass deportation of all undocumented migrants in his state \"would create real economic challenges,\" but he has doubts about how likely it is that the mass deportations will be implemented.",
      "\"[Trump] is a master of saying something and creating a great deal of noise, and then the reality may be different. I'm going to wait to see exactly what it is he ultimately proposes,\" Stein said.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 14:29:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll end birthright citizenship, after years of criticizing the constitutional right.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump says he'll end birthright citizenship, after years of criticizing the constitutional right.",
      "In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that aired Sunday, Trump said he's \"absolutely\" still planning to end birthright citizenship on Day One of his presidency. \"We have to end it,\" Trump told host Kristen Welker. In a video post in\u00a02023, Trump had said he'd sign an executive action to do so on the first day in office.",
      "What is birthright citizenship, and is it in the U.S. Constitution?",
      "Birthright citizenship automatically grants citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of the parents' citizenship status.",
      "The Citizen Clause, under the 14th Amendment\u00a0to the Constitution, states that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "Congress passed the 14th Amendment in 1866, during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. In 1868, the amendment was ratified to extend citizenship to people born on U.S. soil, invalidating the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision, which barred slaves and descendants of slaves from becoming citizens.",
      "Why does Trump want to end birthright citizenship?",
      "Trump has been talking about ending birthright citizenship since his presidential campaign in 2015. In a policy paper at the time, he called birthright citizenship \"the biggest magnet for illegal immigration.\" In the 2023 video, Trump blamed birthright citizenship for \"birth tourism,\" in which he said migrants spend the final weeks of their pregnancies in hotels in order to give birth in the U.S. and then use the child's citizenship status to bring relatives into the U.S. through \"chain migration,\" also known as family-based migration.",
      "During his first term, Trump pledged to end birthright citizenship but did not do so. He told \"Meet the Press\" that he had planned to sign an executive action on birthright citizenship before his focus turned to fighting COVID-19.",
      "Trump called the guarantee of citizenship by birth \"ridiculous,\" telling Welker that the U.S. is the only country with birthright citizenship. In fact, dozens of other countries have birthright citizenship.",
      "\"If somebody sets a foot \u2014 just a foot, one foot, you don't need two \u2014 on our land, congratulations, you are now a citizen of the United States of America,\" Trump complained. \"We're going to end that because it's ridiculous.\"",
      "Opponents of birthright citizenship say it was never intended to cover undocumented immigrants' children or so-called \"birth tourism.\" They contend the amendment was ratified to eliminate barriers to birthright citizenship based on race.",
      "More broadly, the pledge is part of what Trump has billed as a radical shift on immigration that he campaigned on, part of a promise to target both unauthorized and legal immigrants using unprecedented measures likely to test the limits on his authority.",
      "Can Trump end birthright citizenship?",
      "When asked whether he could get around the 14th Amendment through executive action, Trump acknowledged \"it would maybe have to go back to the people, but we have to end it,\" which seemed to indicate he might try to initiate a constitutional amendment to end the right, if necessary. He clarified that he would pursue an end to birthright citizenship through executive action \"if we can.\"",
      "Could Trump repeal birthright citizenship through executive action?",
      "\"The answer is no,\" said Michael LeRoy, professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Labor and Employment Relations and College of Law. That's because the president lacks the authority to unilaterally change the Constitution.",
      "Eliminating birthright citizenship through a constitutional amendment would be nearly impossible as well, because of the widespread approval needed not only from Congress but also from the states.",
      "What's enshrined in the Constitution can't be altered\u00a0by a regular congressional vote, either. Amendments not only have to be approved by a two-thirds vote in both chambers of Congress, but ratified by three-fourths of state legislatures, or three-fourths of conventions called in each state for ratification. It's an extensive process with a high bar.",
      "The only time in U.S. history a constitutional amendment has been repealed was when the 18th Amendment prohibiting the manufacture, sale and transportation of intoxication liquors, better known as prohibition, was repealed in 1933 through the addition of the 21st Amendment, LeRoy noted.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina says he's working on drafting a constitutional amendment to end the practice.",
      "Do other countries besides the U.S. have birthright citizenship?",
      "The U.S. is far from the only country with birthright citizenship, although birthright citizenship without conditions is more common in North and South America than it is in the rest of the world.",
      "Unlike some countries, the U.S. does not require a parent to be a citizen for a child born on U.S. soil to become a citizen. It's automatic.",
      "Full list of countries with birthright citizenship",
      "More than 30 countries have birthright citizenship, according to the Central Intelligence Agency's World Factbook. They include:",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 10:36:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a Hawaii man's appeal of his prosecution for carrying a handgun without a license.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a Hawaii man's appeal of his prosecution for carrying a handgun without a license, leaving untouched a state supreme court decision that castigated its new framework for determining whether gun laws comport with the Second Amendment.",
      "Justice Clarence Thomas, in a statement joined by Justice Samuel Alito, criticized the Hawaiian court for its ruling, but said the high court was right to dismiss the challenge on technical grounds. However, he wrote that the court should hear an \"appropriate case\" to \"make clear that Americans are always free to invoke the Second Amendment as a defense against unconstitutional firearms-licensing schemes.\"",
      "The court laid out the so-called \"history and tradition\" standard in a landmark Second Amendment decision in June 2022. The test requires the government to show that a gun law is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.",
      "The Supreme Court provided some clarity about its new standard this past June, when it upheld a federal firearms prohibition for alleged domestic abusers, but lower courts have still struggled to apply the framework when assessing the constitutionality of firearm restrictions. That decision involved whether certain categories of people \u2014 namely those found to pose a credible threat to others \u2014 can be temporarily disarmed.",
      "The case from Hawaii involved the state's rules for licenses to carry handguns in public. Under the state's scheme, residents must obtain a permit to legally own a firearm. Those who want to carry a gun publicly also must obtain a carry license, which can be acquired by demonstrating an \"urgency or need,\" good moral character and that they are \"engaged in the protection of life and property.\"",
      "Applicants also have to be at least 21 years old and a U.S. citizen. Police departments had the discretion to deny licenses.",
      "In December 2017, Christopher Wilson was arrested after he and a group of hikers were found on a trail running through private property into the West Maui Mountains. Wilson and his fellow hikers told police they didn't see \"no trespassing\" signs on the property and were headed into the mountains to look at the moon and planets. Wilson also told police he had a weapon, and a loaded pistol was seized from his waistband.",
      "Wilson didn't have a permit to acquire a gun or a license to carry it and was charged with violating Hawaii laws for carrying or possessing a handgun.",
      "Wilson sought to dismiss the charges on the grounds that they violated his Second Amendment rights under two recent Supreme Court decisions, one of which said the Constitution guarantees the right to keep a handgun in the home for self-defense.",
      "Wilson's bid to toss out the charges was denied, but soon after, the Supreme Court handed down its June 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights and laid out its history-and-tradition test for evaluating the constitutionality of firearms rules.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Wilson again sought to have the charges against him dismissed, arguing that under the Supreme Court's standard, he was legally allowed to carry a firearm for self-defense, and the state had to justify its licensing scheme.",
      "A trial court sided with Wilson and dismissed the charges against him. But the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed that decision and concluded that prosecuting Wilson for carrying a handgun didn't violate the Constitution. The Hawaii court also lambasted the nation's highest court for its Second Amendment rulings.",
      "The state supreme court claimed that the Supreme Court \"distorts and cherry-picks historical evidence\" in its Second Amendment cases and accused the high court of ad-libbing a new standard for evaluating gun laws.",
      "Referencing the Supreme Court's latest decision, the Hawaii Supreme Court said its new test is a \"backward-looking approach\" that \"ignores today's realities.\"",
      "\"The spirit of Aloha clashes with a federally-mandated lifestyle that lets citizens walk around with deadly weapons during day-to-day activities,\" Hawaii's highest court wrote.",
      "Wilson, represented by public defenders, appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Hawaii court showed \"open hostility to the individual rights protected by the Second Amendment.\"",
      "They warned in a filing that refusing to apply the court's history-and-tradition test \"upends the constitutional order between the States and the national government. When constitutional rights are incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment, the states must recognize them.\"",
      "Writing on Monday, Thomas said the decision by the Hawaii Supreme Court \"failed to give the Second Amendment its due regard.\"",
      "\"Had the Hawaii Supreme Court followed its duty to consider the merits of Wilson's defense, the licensing scheme's unconstitutionality should have been apparent,\" he wrote.",
      "But Thomas noted that \"correction of the Hawaii Supreme Court's error must await another day,\" since Wilson sought to dismiss only some of the charges and asked the court to review an \"interlocutory order over which we may not have jurisdiction.\" Thomas said that Wilson could ask the court to review the case again after trial.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed that sentiment in a statement of his own, writing that \"Mr. Wilson remains free to seek this Court's review after final judgment.\"",

    "summary": "Wisdom the Laysan albatross was first tagged by researchers in 1956. Since then, she's believed to have raised as many as 30 chicks.",
    "story": [
      "The oldest known wild bird in the world has laid an egg at the ripe age of about 74, her first in four years, U.S. wildlife officials said.",
      "The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg, the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said in a Facebook post this week.",
      "Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, had returned to the atoll in the Pacific Ocean to lay and hatch eggs since 2006. Laysan albatrosses mate for life and lay one egg per year, but according to the USFWS, Akeakamai hadn't been seen for several years, prompting \"Wisdom to begin courtship dances with other males\" as soon as she returned to the island last week.",
      "\"We are optimistic that the egg will hatch,\" Jonathan Plissner, supervisory wildlife biologist at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge said in a statement. Every year, millions of seabirds return to the refuge to nest and raise their young.",
      "Albatross parents take turns incubating an egg for about seven months. Chicks fly out to sea about five to six months after hatching. They spend most of their lives flying over the ocean and feeding on squid and fish eggs.",
      "Wisdom was first banded as an adult in 1956 and has raised as many as 30 chicks, Plissner said.",
      "The typical lifespan of a Laysan albatross is 68 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "As 60 Minutes reported in 2018, Wisdom's advanced years have seen her defy not only the general longevity odds for her species, but also the odds crated by the grim condition of her natural habitat. The islands of the Midway Atoll were she nests are awash with plastic pollution. The 60 Minutes team found that many of Wisdom's fellow albatrosses have died around her with bellies full of plastic, making her a source of some optimism for researchers.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:39:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Engineers now say they understand the most likely cause of the Ingenuity helicopter's crash landing on Mars earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a year after NASA's Ingenuity helicopter crash landed on Mars following an extended, remarkably successful mission, engineers have determined the most likely culprit: Flight over sand drifts so featureless that on-board sensors could not determine the helicopter's orientation and velocity.",
      "The result was a \"hard\" sideways landing on a steep slope that spun Ingenuity about so fast its rotors, spinning at nearly 400 mph to provide lift in the ultra-thin martian atmosphere, suffered structural failure. One broke off and the others were severely damaged.",
      "H\u00e5vard Grip, Ingenuity's first pilot, said in an interview Wednesday that lessons learned from Ingenuity's 72nd and final flight on Jan. 18 will be fed into designs for more powerful Mars helicopters now being studied at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where Ingenuity was built.",
      "\"We're working very actively right now on what that might look like,\" Grip said in an interview. \"We're developing this large aircraft concept with six rotors and 36 blades that could fly its own science payload around Mars. So that is kind of where our focus is in the helicopter world right now.\"",
      "During a briefing Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Teddy Tzanetos, the Ingenuity project manager, discussed the six-rotor Mars Chopper concept, a rotorcraft that would be 20 times heavier than Ingenuity and could fly up to two miles per day carrying several pounds of science instrumentation.",
      "Ingenuity \"became the first mission to fly commercial off-the-shelf cellphone processors in deep space,\" Tzanetos said in a NASA news release. The mission showed \"that not everything needs to be bigger, heavier and radiation-hardened to work in the harsh Martian environment.\"",
      "Carried to Mars by NASA's Perseverance rover, Ingenuity was dropped to the surface of the red planet in April 2021 and made its initial flight two weeks later. Built primarily to find out if helicopters could fly in the cold, thin atmosphere, Ingenuity was expected to make five flights over 30 days as a proof of concept.",
      "The the surprise of virtually everyone, it ended up making 72 flights over nearly three years, repeatedly scouting ahead of Perseverance while logging more than two hours of flight time and traveling a cumulative 10.7 miles at altitudes up to nearly 80 feet before its final flight on Jan. 18.",
      "During that flight, Ingenuity climbed to an altitude of about 40 feet, hovered and captured photographs of the surrounding terrain and began to descend 19 seconds after takeoff. Thirteen seconds after that, the helicopter was back on the ground, but contact had been lost.",
      "Communications through Perseverance were restored the next day, and six days after the flight, the rover sent back pictures showing the helicopter had sustained major damage to its rotors.",
      "Flight controllers initially suspected Ingenuity made a hard landing at a steep angle, causing its high-speed rotors to hit the ground.",
      "But the most likely scenario, Grip said, is that the helicopter was unable to determine its horizontal velocity as it flew over virtually featureless sand and touched down while moving sideways at a speed well above its design constraints.",
      "\"We also landed on a steep slope, probably the steepest slope that we have encountered in all of our flights,\" he said. \"The combination of the two lends itself well to what our most likely scenario hypothesizes.",
      "\"When it contacted the ground, it sort of whipped around quickly in order to align itself with the surface. That forces the helicopter to rotate around in roll and pitch, and because this rotor is stiff, the rotor has to sort of follow more or less instantly, and that puts a lot of bending moments on the blades.\"",
      "Those bending moments, or forces, were extreme because the tips of the rotors were moving so fast. The tips of the blades broke away, putting the rotor system out of balance. That, in turn, resulted in enough vibration to cause one rotor to break off at its root. Grip said none of the blades touched the surface during the landing.",
      "In yet another surprise for flight controllers, Ingenuity came to a rest on its landing legs with its small solar array pointed skyward. While it could no longer fly, it continued to relay martian weather reports to Perseverance through last November when the rover finally moved too far away to maintain the radio link.",
      "\"I always pictured that a bad landing would end with, you know, the thing just in 1,000 pieces on the surface,\" Grip said. \"So the fact that it's upright and talking to us (was) not at all what I would have anticipated.\"",

      "The shower will peak from Friday Dec. 13 into early Saturday Dec. 14 \u2014 when the moon is nearly full, according to NASA. Illumination from the moon could make spotting the cosmic show a challenge during the peak, but bright meteors can be spotted the week before the peak.",

More than half of the moon's surface will already be illuminated by the sun at that point of the month, so it will still cause some problems with meteor viewing.",
      "Astronomy fans determined to see the Geminids without interference from the moon's light may have some luck if they're willing to get up after moon-set around 3:30 a.m. local time, Cooke said. Even then though, it will be a challenge to spot many Geminids an hour.",
      "\"In short, 2024 is a bad year for Geminid watching \u2013 December 2025 will be much better,\" Cooke said.",
      "What are the Geminids?",
      "Most meteor showers originate from comets, but the Geminids come from 3200 Phaethon, an asteroid. The Geminids first appeared in the mid-1800s. At the time, there were 10 to 20 meteors an hour, but the shower has grown bigger and meteors are now visible at a rate of 120 meteors an hour under perfect conditions.",
      "While most meteors appear to be colorless or white, NASA scientists say the Geminids are bright, fast and usually yellow in color. They streak through the sky at a speed of 22 miles per second.",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere and heat up as they fall toward Earth, according to NASA. The streak of light is actually glowing, hot air.",

    "story": [
      "General Motors says it will move away from the robotaxi business and cease funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle division.",
      "According to a press release issued Tuesday and subsequent conference call that included GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra, the Detroit automaker will instead focus on development of partially automated driver-assist systems like its Super Cruise, which allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel.",
      "GM said it would get out of robotaxis \"given the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.\"",
      "The company said it will combine Cruise's technical team with its own to work on advanced systems to assist drivers.",
      "\"The Cruise Board of Directors and the Cruise leadership team are collaborating closely with GM on next steps,\" Cruise CEO  Marc Whitten told CBS News.",
      "GM bought then San Francisco-based start-up Cruise Automation in 2016 for at least $1 billion with high hopes of developing a profitable fleet of robotaxis. At the time, Cruise Automation, along with Google, was among the few companies with permits from the state of California to test the cars.",
      "Over the years GM invested billions in the subsidiary and eventually bought 90% of the company from investors.",
      "GM even announced plans for Cruise to generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but it scaled back spending on the company after one of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts\u00a0dragged a pedestrian on a San Francisco street who was hit by another vehicle in 2023.",
      "The California Public Utilities Commission alleged the company covered up details of the crash and suspended Cruise's driverless testing permit. Soon afterwards, Cruise\u00a0pulled all its driverless cars off the road nationwide.",
      "The incident\u00a0sparked widespread criticism of the company\u00a0and its autonomous vehicles. Cruise had already been under fire for a number of collisions that led the company to\u00a0cut its operating robotaxi fleet in during the summer of 2023.",
      "The problems triggered a purge of its leadership \u2014 in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "In January of this year, the company offered to pay $75,000 to settle the investigation by California state regulators into Cruise's\u00a0failure to disclose details regarding the collision.",
      "Despite its troubles, Cruise was still attempting to return to viability. In June, General Motors named Marc Whitten -- one of the key engineers behind the Xbox video game console --\u00a0as the division's new chief executive. In August, Cruise announced its robotaxis\u00a0would join Uber's ride-hailing service in 2025 as part of a multiyear partnership\u00a0bringing together two companies that once appeared poised to compete for passengers.",
      "However, more recent Cruise developments have been costly for GM. In September, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials announced the division would pay a $1.5 million penalty as part of a consent order. Last month, Cruise agreed to an additional $500,000 fine after admitting to filing a false report following the San Francisco pedestrian crash.",

    "summary": "The game's design nudged people into racking up unauthorized charges, the FTC said. Here's how customers will be refunded.",
    "story": [
      "Fortnite players and other Epic Games customers tricked by the game maker into making unwanted purchases are set to receive refund payments from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).",
      "As part of a settlement first\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2022, the video game maker has been ordered by the FTC to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that it used unlawful billing practices involving design tricks\u00a0known as dark patterns to get players to unintentionally rack up charges. It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",
      "How much money will each customer get?",
      "The average payment is around $114, the FTC said. Epic Games customers who are entitled to refunds selected their payment method when they submitted a claim form. Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",
      "\"As our complaints note, Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,\" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in December 2022, when the settlement was first announced. \"Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.\"",

      "\"First, we got the gun in question back from Pennsylvania, it's now at the NYPD crime lab.

Police searched his belongings and found a 3D printed ghost gun consistent with the one used in the shooting, along with a U.S. passport, $8,000 in cash and a handwritten note.",
      "Sources tell CBS News investigators are referring to the note as a claim of responsibility. They believe the suspect's grievances toward UnitedHealthcare and other health insurance companies are what motivated the murder.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 20:09:54 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump announced in November that he intended to name Kash Patel to replace Cristopher Wray as FBI director.",
    "story": [
      "FBI Director Christopher Wray announced he will resign from his post at the end of the current administration, leaving the bureau in advance of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration next month.",
      "He made the announcement during a packed, standing-room town hall with FBI employees at the bureau's headquarters Wednesday.",
      "\"After weeks of careful thought, I've decided the right thing for the bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down,\" he said. \"My goal is to keep the focus on\u202four mission \u2014 the indispensable work you're doing on behalf of the American people every day. In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work.\"",
      "\"It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway \u2014 this is not easy for me,\" Wray continued. \"I love this place, I love our mission, and I love our people \u2014 but my focus is, and always has been, on us and doing what's right for the FBI.\"",
      "Thousands from FBI offices across the country tuned in for the live stream of his speech. Some people cried as Wray spoke. At the end of his remarks, he received a standing ovation that went on for over a minute, until Wray left the room.",
      "The president-elect welcomed Wray's announcement in a social media post, calling it \"a great day for America.\"",
      "Trump appointed Wray \u2014 a former federal prosecutor and counterterrorism official \u2014 as FBI director in 2017 for a 10-year term after firing James Comey. Wray has since come under fire from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill over the FBI's handling of investigations into the president-elect. He has remained director under President Biden, but Trump previously said he intended to remove Wray and replace him with Kash Patel, a former GOP congressional staffer who was tapped by Trump during his first term for roles in the Defense Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "Wray told the FBI's rank and file, \"We're not on any one side \u2026 We're on the American people's side,\" and on \"the Constitution's side,\" adding, that \"no matter what's happening out there, in here, we've got to stay committed to doing our work the right way every time \u2014 with rigor and integrity.\"",
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland praised Wray, saying in a statement that he \"has served our country honorably and with integrity for decades, including for seven years as the Director of the FBI under presidents of both parties.\"",
      "\"The Director of the FBI is responsible for protecting the independence of the FBI from inappropriate influence in its criminal investigations,\" Garland said. \"That independence is central to preserving the rule of law and to protecting the freedoms we as Americans hold dear. Director Wray has done that job with integrity and skill.\"",
      "CBS News has learned Wray wrestled with his decision to step down but opted to go because he's concerned if he were to stay, the attacks on him could drag the FBI into another political fight it doesn't need.",
      "FBI directors are appointed for a 10-year term, which has historically been intended to ensure the position is insulated from political considerations. But presidents have the power to fire and nominate directors at will, and many FBI directors have not served their full terms. The Senate must also vote to confirm any president's nominee to serve as FBI director.",
      "Wray's announcement clears the way for Patel to lead the FBI in Trump's second term. Patel has been meeting in the Capitol with senators who will vote on his confirmation.",
      "Wray and FBI leadership became targets of Trump's ire in 2022, when FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The search exposed what had been an ongoing federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records after he left office. The investigation culminated in criminal charges against Trump filed by special counsel Jack Smith, but they have since been dismissed by a federal judge. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "If confirmed, Patel would be the third FBI director to work under a Trump administration and take over the nation's chief federal law enforcement apparatus, amid years of intense criticism from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. While Wray's departure from the job was largely expected, Trump's announcement that he planned to nominate Patel to the position raised speculation among federal law enforcement about whether Wray would resign or remain in his post ahead of Trump's inauguration.",
      "Wray took over the post after Trump fired then-Director James Comey, in part because of the FBI's investigation into the 2016 election that resulted in Robert Mueller's appointment as special counsel for that case. Comey, who has since become an outspoken critic of the president-elect, found himself at odds with Democrats and Republicans upon his departure from the FBI's top job.",
      "Since his confirmation in 2017, Wray has spent much of his tenure focusing on internal matters like agent recruitment and national security issues including countering China's espionage campaigns. He sounded the alarm on foreign efforts to target American infrastructure and warned of aggressive posturing by Iran and Russia.",
      "The FBI employs about 35,000 people \u2014 including thousands of field agents \u2014 tasked with enforcing federal law and investigating crimes across the country, including terrorism, espionage and child exploitation.",
      "Patel, who could soon be Wray's replacement, has been outspoken in his criticism of the federal agency and has said he would implement massive reforms and seek retribution for Trump, saying at one point, \"We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.\"",
      "In his remarks, Wray reminded the bureau's employees that working at the FBI \"means conducting investigations without fear or favor ... and it means not pursuing investigations when the predication is not there.\"",
      "Patel would report directly to the attorney general of the United States \u2014\u00a0 Trump's current pick for the post is former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "Trump's announcement that he planned to nominate the 44-year-old Patel to serve as FBI Director was met with criticism from Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill and some former officials from Trump's first term.",
      "John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump's first term and was Patel's boss, compared the nomination to Joseph Stalin's secret police chief.",
      "\"Fortunately, the FBI is not\" Stalin's secret police, Bolton said. \"The Senate should reject this nomination 100-0,\" a reaction that prompted pushback from Trump allies and Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance.",
      "But Republicans on Capitol Hill have appeared open to the pick and argued he could bring change to the FBI.",

While the majority of Democrats opposed the bill, 81 joined with 200 Republicans in support of its passage. Just 16 Republicans opposed the legislation. It now heads to the Senate for approval.",
      "The vote came after leaders in Congress struck a deal over the weekend on the legislation, which usually passes with wide bipartisan margins. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries acknowledged ahead of the vote on Wednesday that there's \"a lot of positive things\" within the NDAA that were negotiated in a bipartisan manner, but also some \"troubling\" provisions.",

      "The provision, which applies to the military's health care program, outlines that medical intervention \"for the treatment of gender dysphoria that could result in sterilization may not be provided to a child under the age of 18.\"",
      "Smith said the stipulation \"injected a level of partisanship not traditionally seen in defense bills.\"",
      "\"Speaker Johnson is pandering to the most extreme elements of his party to ensure that he retains his speakership. In doing so, he has upended what had been a bipartisan process,\" Smith added.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:39:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Engineers now say they understand the most likely cause of the Ingenuity helicopter's crash landing on Mars earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a year after NASA's Ingenuity helicopter crash landed on Mars following an extended, remarkably successful mission, engineers have determined the most likely culprit: Flight over sand drifts so featureless that on-board sensors could not determine the helicopter's orientation and velocity.",
      "The result was a \"hard\" sideways landing on a steep slope that spun Ingenuity about so fast its rotors, spinning at nearly 400 mph to provide lift in the ultra-thin martian atmosphere, suffered structural failure. One broke off and the others were severely damaged.",
      "H\u00e5vard Grip, Ingenuity's first pilot, said in an interview Wednesday that lessons learned from Ingenuity's 72nd and final flight on Jan. 18 will be fed into designs for more powerful Mars helicopters now being studied at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where Ingenuity was built.",
      "\"We're working very actively right now on what that might look like,\" Grip said in an interview. \"We're developing this large aircraft concept with six rotors and 36 blades that could fly its own science payload around Mars. So that is kind of where our focus is in the helicopter world right now.\"",
      "During a briefing Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Teddy Tzanetos, the Ingenuity project manager, discussed the six-rotor Mars Chopper concept, a rotorcraft that would be 20 times heavier than Ingenuity and could fly up to two miles per day carrying several pounds of science instrumentation.",
      "Ingenuity \"became the first mission to fly commercial off-the-shelf cellphone processors in deep space,\" Tzanetos said in a NASA news release. The mission showed \"that not everything needs to be bigger, heavier and radiation-hardened to work in the harsh Martian environment.\"",
      "Carried to Mars by NASA's Perseverance rover, Ingenuity was dropped to the surface of the red planet in April 2021 and made its initial flight two weeks later. Built primarily to find out if helicopters could fly in the cold, thin atmosphere, Ingenuity was expected to make five flights over 30 days as a proof of concept.",
      "The the surprise of virtually everyone, it ended up making 72 flights over nearly three years, repeatedly scouting ahead of Perseverance while logging more than two hours of flight time and traveling a cumulative 10.7 miles at altitudes up to nearly 80 feet before its final flight on Jan. 18.",
      "During that flight, Ingenuity climbed to an altitude of about 40 feet, hovered and captured photographs of the surrounding terrain and began to descend 19 seconds after takeoff. Thirteen seconds after that, the helicopter was back on the ground, but contact had been lost.",
      "Communications through Perseverance were restored the next day, and six days after the flight, the rover sent back pictures showing the helicopter had sustained major damage to its rotors.",
      "Flight controllers initially suspected Ingenuity made a hard landing at a steep angle, causing its high-speed rotors to hit the ground.",
      "But the most likely scenario, Grip said, is that the helicopter was unable to determine its horizontal velocity as it flew over virtually featureless sand and touched down while moving sideways at a speed well above its design constraints.",
      "\"We also landed on a steep slope, probably the steepest slope that we have encountered in all of our flights,\" he said. \"The combination of the two lends itself well to what our most likely scenario hypothesizes.",
      "\"When it contacted the ground, it sort of whipped around quickly in order to align itself with the surface. That forces the helicopter to rotate around in roll and pitch, and because this rotor is stiff, the rotor has to sort of follow more or less instantly, and that puts a lot of bending moments on the blades.\"",
      "Those bending moments, or forces, were extreme because the tips of the rotors were moving so fast. The tips of the blades broke away, putting the rotor system out of balance. That, in turn, resulted in enough vibration to cause one rotor to break off at its root. Grip said none of the blades touched the surface during the landing.",
      "In yet another surprise for flight controllers, Ingenuity came to a rest on its landing legs with its small solar array pointed skyward. While it could no longer fly, it continued to relay martian weather reports to Perseverance through last November when the rover finally moved too far away to maintain the radio link.",
      "\"I always pictured that a bad landing would end with, you know, the thing just in 1,000 pieces on the surface,\" Grip said. \"So the fact that it's upright and talking to us (was) not at all what I would have anticipated.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Democrat-led push to secure a majority on the National Labor Relations Board until 2026 fell short on Wednesday, as Senate Republicans and two independents blocked the nomination of Lauren McFerran to continue serving on the labor board.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer filed cloture Monday on the nominations of McFerran, a Democrat, to remain for another five-year term on the National Labor Relations Board. McFerran is the current chair of the NLRB whose term is set to expire later this month. Her confirmation to another term would have maintained a Democratic majority on the board, in a move that would have marked a key victory for Democrats heading into a second Trump administration and a Republican trifecta in Washington.",
      "In a 50 to 49 vote, Senate Republicans, joined by independent Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, blocked the nomination from advancing. Without the confirmation, the board is expected to swing to come under Republican control, with a vacancy for President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming GOP-controlled Senate to fill in the new year.",
      "Schumer praised McFerran ahead of the vote on Wednesday, saying she has \"served admirably on the NLRB for many years, where she's known for her fairness, her deep expertise and guiding the board to deal with the challenges of the contemporary work place.\"",
      "\"If you truly care about working families, if you care about fixing income inequality in America, then you should be in favor of advancing today's NLRB nominee,\" Schumer said, stressing that \"you can't say you're for working families and then go and vote no today, because the NLRB protects workers from mistreatment on the job and from overreaching employers.\"",
      "The NLRB is an independent federal agency with five board members that serves as a mediator between labor unions and big business by enforcing labor law under the National Labor Relations Act. Under the union-friendly Biden administration, the NLRB has delivered a slew of pro-union rulings.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent and longtime labor advocate, posted Tuesday on social media\u00a0 that McFerran has \"done an exceptional job protecting workers' rights & standing up against illegal union busting,\" arguing that it's \"imperative that a majority of Senators vote to reconfirm her this week so she can continue this vital work.\"",
      "Republicans largely opposed the nomination, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who came out in opposition of McFerran's nomination on Tuesday. The Kentucky Republican, who is leaving leadership in January, said Tuesday in remarks from the Senate floor that his colleagues should consider the \"gross mismanagement of Ms. McFerran's watch.\"",
      "\"Her confirmation would give a lame-duck president control of an independent board well into his successor's term,\" McConnell added.",
      "Manchin, a West Virginia independent who caucuses with Democrats, also joined with Republicans to oppose advancing the nomination, as did Sinema, an Arizona independent. The two senators, who are often key votes on partisan measures, are both departing the Senate after opting not to seek reelection. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, did not vote.",
      "The vote came as Senate Democrats have been making a last-minute push to confirm President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts. Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's judicial confirmations from his first term, but have run into resistance from Republicans in recent weeks who are looking to drag out the process.",

      "But on Tuesday, an Oregon court ruled that the proposed union would harm grocery industry competition, finding in favor of the Federal Trade Commission, which had argued the deal would violate antitrust law.",

      "\"I'm in a state of professional and commercial shock that they would take this scorched earth approach,\" said Burt Flickinger, a longtime analyst and owner of retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. \"The logical thing would have been for Albertsons to let the decision sink in for a day and then meet and see what could be done.

    "summary": "A humpback whale crossed multiple oceans for a massive migration that covered more than 8,000 miles, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "A male humpback whale made one of the longest and most unusual migrations on record for the species, an anomaly scientists say might be linked to climate change.",
      "The whale was first sighted in waters off northwestern Colombia in July 2013, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal\u00a0Royal Society Open Science on the creature's movements and how to potentially explain them. Authors said that same whale was seen again four years later, in another spot off the Colombian coast about 50 miles away from the location of the first sighting.",
      "An unlikely third encounter with the humpback happened in August 2022, when it was spotted off eastern Africa in a channel between Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania. The whale would have had to cross multiple oceans and travel more than 8,000 miles from the Colombian Pacific to get there, and experts believe it was trying to find a mate or food. The whale's lengthy voyage set a record for the longest known migration between breeding grounds.",
      "Sightings were tracked through photographs submitted by citizen scientists to happywhale.com, where marine enthusiasts, researchers and other professionals plot the locations and movements of whales worldwide.",
      "Though humpbacks are among several species of whales known to\u00a0migrate extraordinarily long distances\u00a0each year to pursue sources of food in colder waters and breed in tropical seas, the study's authors called the humpback's behavior \"atypical.\" This whale's crusade dwarfed even the longest transits reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which notes in a description of humpback whales shared on its site that some populations are known to migrate as far as 5,000 miles in a single year.",
      "The study said the long-distance movement was peculiar \"and raises the question as to what its drivers are, which could include but not necessarily be limited to mating strategies.\"",
      "The whale's penchant to explore an unexpected and faraway habitat could also have been rooted in environmental shifts caused by climate change, the authors said. Things like higher sea surface temperatures are impacting marine life around the world and could similarly affect distributions of krill in certain areas, which could in turn affect feeding grounds for humpbacks like the long-distance traveler.",
      "Their study did note that more research is necessary to arrive at any conclusions about the whale's migration pattern.",
      "\"On the other hand, population increases may also be a driver of these breeding ground shifts, when animals may need to explore new breeding and/or feeding areas due to competition from larger, more established males in both areas,\" the authors wrote. \"The exact cause or drivers of these breeding habitat shifts can only be speculated due to the current limited data availability on humpback whale behavioural ecology.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:33:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The secretary of state's testimony comes months after Republicans issued a scathing report on the Biden administration's handling of the exit from Afghanistan.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday defended President Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan while appearing before the Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee, which has long sought to question him over the deadly evacuation.",
      "\"I firmly believe the president's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan was the right one,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "Blinken declined to take the blame for decisions that were made leading up to the exit, explaining that actions taken by the first Trump administration left the Biden administration in a weak position and intelligence assessments expected Kabul to remain the hands of the Afghan government.",
      "Blinken's testimony came nearly three months after the committee\u00a0voted\u00a0along party lines to recommend that the nation's top diplomat be held in contempt of Congress amid a standoff over his appearance before the panel to discuss its investigation into the\u00a02021 withdrawal.",
      "The committee and State Department had been at odds for months, leading Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the Republican chairman, to issue multiple subpoenas for Blinken to testify in September. McCaul said Blinken's appearance was important as the committee considers \"potential legislation aimed at helping prevent the catastrophic mistakes of the withdrawal.\"",
      "The Afghanistan hearing",
      "\"Tragically, more than three years after this administration's disastrous withdrawal, you're finally here to take responsibility,\" McCaul said Wednesday, also accusing Blinken in the lead up to the evacuation of denying \"imminent and dangerous threats to American interests, American citizens and our decade long Afghan partners, all the while, the Taliban captured province after province on their march to Kabul.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee released a lengthy report in September that detailed their yearslong investigation into the chaotic exit from Afghanistan and accused the Biden administration of misleading the public about the end of the 20-year war.",
      "Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the committee, on Wednesday called the report \"partisan and misleading\" and said Republicans have \"muddled the facts\" about whether a suicide bombing that killed 13 U.S. service members was preventable.",
      "Blinken, whose opening statement was repeatedly disrupted by protesters, acknowledged the service members who died and their families, saying he deeply regretted that the U.S. \"did not do more and could not do more to protect them.\"",
      "\"To the extent President Biden faced a choice, it was between ending the war or escalating it,\" Blinken said. \"In the three years since the end of our country's longest war. All of us, including myself, have wrestled with what we could have done differently during that period and over the proceeding two decades.\"",
      "Blinken also acknowledged that the Taliban was not in compliance with a deal the Trump administration struck with the group to withdraw U.S. forces from the country by May 2021. The deal, known as the Doha Agreement, laid out a series of conditions for the Taliban to fulfill in order for U.S. forces to fully leave Afghanistan.",
      "\"The Taliban was in violation of the Doha Agreement in a number of ways,\" he said. \"It was in violation when the previous administration drew down forces repeatedly. It was in violation during the time that we were in office before the evacuation.\"",
      "According to Blinken, the Biden administration unsuccessfully tried to get the Taliban to abide by the conditions and negotiate with the Afghan government.",
      "\"They didn't do that,\" he said. \"But because we had the deadline, and because we had the prospect of the Taliban resuming attacks on U.S. forces, which would have required us to put tens of thousands of Americans back into Afghanistan, we followed through with pulling them out.\"",
      "He said the Doha Agreement \"created a tremendous crisis in confidence\" in the Afghan government. The Afghan government was excluded from the Trump administration's negotiations with the Taliban that led to the agreement.",
      "Blinken said he was on the phone with then-Afghan President Ashraf Ghani the night before he fled the country as the Taliban closed in.",
      "\"He told me that he wanted to continue working on getting an agreement with the Taliban, but if he couldn't, he would stay and fight to the death,\" Blinken said. \"And he left the next day.\"",
      "Though the U.S. tried to get in contact with every U.S. citizen in the Afghanistan, Blinken said, hundreds who wanted to leave the country did not make it out before the withdrawal. As of now, \"every American who identified themselves and said that they wanted to leave has been given an opportunity to do so,\" he said. But some returned after the withdrawal and have been detained, he said.",
      "\"We are working every day to get them out, to get them back,\" he said.",
      "The committee's report",
      "During its investigation, the committee conducted 18 transcribed interviews with Biden administration officials and received more than 20,000 pages of documents from the State Department, some of which were obtained through subpoenas. Blinken was not among those who testified for the report, but the State Department noted amid the standoff with the committee that he has testified to Congress on Afghanistan more than 14 times.",
      "The report accused President Biden and his administration of ignoring repeated warnings from military officials, national security advisers and U.S. allies about the risks of removing all American forces from Afghanistan, saying Mr. Biden \"prioritized politics and his personal legacy over America's national security interests.\"",
      "Blinken was among those faulted in the report, which said he \"remained largely absent throughout the State Department's withdrawal planning\" and the evacuation.",
      "\"Indeed, witnesses interviewed, and documents produced by federal agencies pursuant to the investigation, confirm Secretary Blinken likely ceded his responsibility to subordinates on Afghanistan,\" the report said.",
      "Blinken advocated for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to remain open regardless of the military withdrawal, according to the report, which said that the desire to maintain a diplomatic presence contributed to the State Department's \"lack of urgency and their delays in planning for the worst-case scenarios.\"",
      "The report also noted that diplomatic officials on the ground expressed concerns about the commitment to keep the embassy open despite the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, culminating in a July 2021 dissent cable warning that Kabul would fall after the planned withdrawal. Two weeks before the U.S. troops left Afghanistan, State Department leaders agreed to shutter the embassy, the report said.",
      "Republicans threatened to hold Blinken in contempt of Congress in 2023 as they sought to review the classified dissent cable. The State Department eventually allowed lawmakers to view a partially redacted version.",
      "\"You personally read this, sir,\" McCaul said while questioning Blinken on Wednesday. \"Why did you ignore the cries for help? Why did you leave the embassy open?\"",
      "McCaul also said it appeared that Blinken delegated his responsibility and pressed him on who was calling the shots.",
      "\"To legislate moving forward, I need to know who was in charge,\" McCaul said, calling on Mr. Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan to testify to the committee.",
      "About 20 minutes later, McCaul announced that Sullivan had agreed to testify on Tuesday.",
      "Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee accused Republicans of politicizing the withdrawal and said the majority took \"particular pains to avoid facts involving former President Donald Trump.\"",
      "Last year, the White House released its own 12-page summary of a classified review of the Afghanistan exit that largely blamed the Trump administration for the Doha Agreement. Another report partially declassified and released by the State Department last year faulted both the Trump and Biden administrations for \"insufficient\" planning surrounding the withdrawal.",

      "A shipwreck dating back to the 5th and 6th centuries B.C. was discovered near Sicily along with ancient anchors made from stone and iron, Italian officials said.",
      "The 2,500-year-old wreck was found buried beneath sand and rocks by crews working on an underwater excavation project in the waters of Santa Maria del Focallo, near Ispica at the southern tip of the Italian island,\u00a0said\u00a0Sicily's Superintendent of the Sea in a statement Monday.",
      "When archaeologists unearthed the sunken ship, they discovered a hull built using an \"on-the-shell\" construction technique, a simplistic early shipbuilding method often traced to populations around the Mediterranean. They also found a trove of anchors several feet from the wreckage, the superintendent said, two of the anchors were made from iron and likely originated in the 7th century A.D. The other four anchors, which were made from heavy stone, probably date back to the prehistoric era.",
      "RITROVATO UN RELITTO ARCAICO NELLE ACQUE DI SANTA MARIA DEL FOCALLO\nUN\u2019IMPORTANTE SCOPERTA ARCHEOLOGICA CHE TESTIMONIA I...",
      "Archaeologists created a three-dimensional model of the shipwreck and collected samples from the artifacts for analysis, hoping to understand more about the materials that compose them.",
      "\"This discovery represents an extraordinary contribution to the knowledge of the maritime history of Sicily and the Mediterranean and highlights once again the central role of the Island in the traffic and cultural exchanges of antiquity,\" said Francesco Paolo Scarpinato, Sicily's regional councilor for cultural heritage and Sicilian identity, in a translated statement on the shipwreck published\u00a0by the University of Udine. \"The wreck, dating back to a crucial period for the transition between archaic and classical Greece, is a precious piece of the submerged Sicilian cultural heritage.\"",
      "The three-week excavation in Santa Maria del Focallo, which was part of the Kaukana Project, an archaeological research initiative, ended in September, but officials did not share their findings until this week. The superintendent of the sea led the initiative with archaeologists from the University of Udine, near the site of the excavation.",
      "Those involved with the project say this wreck could potentially shine a light on an important chapter of ancient Greece, which occupied Sicily for hundreds of years until the island was taken by Rome around 200 B.C.",
      "Massimo Capulli,\u00a0a coordinator of the Kaukana Project\u00a0and professor at the University of Udine, added in a separate statement released by the university that studying the wreck may help illuminate how trade happened between ancient Greeks and Carthaginians, two groups that thousands of years ago fought for control of the seas around present-day Sicily.",
      "\"We are in fact faced with material evidence of the traffic and trade of a very ancient era,\" Capulli said.",

      "The Campania-based Camorra, the Sicilian Mafia and organized crime groups in the region of Puglia also rake in large amounts of money from tourism.",
      "While those mob heartlands are in the south of Italy, the groups made almost 1.5 billion euros out of tourism in the country's wealthy north, the report added.",
      "\"More than seven thousand vulnerable companies risk becoming tasty prey for criminal associations,\" Rio warned, saying that nearly 15 percent of the 48,000 businesses in the sector were struggling with liquidity and debt crises, which made them vulnerable to mob \"offers\" of help.",
      "The organized crime groups loan money to businesses under punishing conditions, and use them to clean ill-gotten gains.",
      "\"The mafias are building a criminal welfare system that crushes entrepreneurs in difficulty,\" Rio said.",
      "\"They promise financial survival, cover debts and guarantee liquidity but at a very high price: the control or total acquisition of companies.",
      "\"This perverse system not only strengthens the power of criminal families on the territory, but fuels a circuit of money laundering, usury and extortion that suffocates the legal economy of our country,\" he said.",
      "The report on tourism in Italy comes just days after a Catholic nun was arrested by Italian police for allegedly bringing messages for the mafia to prisoners.",
      "In March, Italy expanded a controversial program\u00a0to remove children from their mafia families to break the cycle of criminal behavior being passed down to new generations.",
      "Earlier this year, Interpol released a report showing that mafias, cartels and gangs in Europe are using fruit companies, hotels and other legal businesses as fronts to make huge profits.\u00a0 According to the agency, hundreds of criminal networks are able to infiltrate the legal economy to hide their activities and launder their criminal profits.",
      "Europol said the 'Ndrangheta mafia's profits from drug and arms trafficking as well as tax defrauding are invested throughout Europe in real estate, supermarkets, hotels and other commercial activities.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 06:18:34 -0500",
    "summary": "A prison official says South Korea's ex-defense chief Kim Yong Hyun tried to kill himself after being arrested over the martial law declaration he's accused of suggesting.",
    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea\u00a0\u2014 South Korea's previous defense minister was stopped from attempting suicide while in detention over last week's martial law declaration, officials said Wednesday, as President Yoon Suk Yeol's office resisted a police attempt to search the compound.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party is pushing for a new motion to impeach Yoon for his Dec. 3 decree that imposed martial law in South Korea for the first time in more than four decades. Its first impeachment attempt against Yoon last Saturday failed after ruling party lawmakers boycotted the vote. The party said it plans to submit the new motion on Thursday to set up another vote this Saturday.",
      "Yoon's ill-conceived power grab has paralyzed South Korean politics, frozen its foreign policy and rattled financial markets. On Wednesday, rival North Korea's state media for the first time reported about the turmoil across the border, but the country hasn't shown any suspicious activities.",
      "Shin Yong Hae, commissioner general of the Korea Correctional Service, told lawmakers that former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun tried to kill himself the previous night at a detention center in Seoul. He said correctional officers stopped him and that he was in stable condition. Kim was arrested by prosecutors early Wednesday on allegations of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power. He became the first person formally arrested over the martial law decree.",
      "Kim, one of Yoon's close associates, has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and they unanimously rejected Yoon's decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4.",
      "Kim said in a statement on Tuesday that he \"deeply apologizes for causing significant anxiety\" to the public. He said all responsibility for the martial law imposition rests with him and pleaded for leniency for soldiers deployed to enforce it.",
      "Prosecutors have up to 20 days to determine whether to indict Kim.",
      "Later Wednesday, police detained National Police Agency Commissioner General Cho Ji Ho and Kim Bong-sik, head of Seoul's metropolitan police. They were accused of deploying police forces to parliament to block lawmakers from voting.",
      "The focus of the investigation is determining whether Yoon, Kim and others involved in imposing martial law committed the act of rebellion. A conviction for rebellion carries a maximum penalty of death in South Korea.",
      "South Korean police said they sent officers to search Yoon's office Wednesday to look for any evidence related to the martial law introduction. But investigators had failed to enter the office as of Wednesday evening, about six hours after their arrival, senior police officer Lee Ho-young told the parliament. Some observers earlier said the presidential security service was unlikely to permit any searches of Yoon's office, citing a law that prohibits searches of sites with state secrets without approval from those in charge of the areas in question.",
      "Yoon on Saturday apologized over the martial law decree, saying he wouldn't avoid legal or political responsibility for it. He said he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country's political turmoil, \"including matters related to my term in office.\"",
      "The leader of Yoon's ruling party later vowed to arrange the president's stable exit from office, saying the party would coordinate with Cabinet members over state affairs and that Yoon would be sidelined from duties. The comments were criticized as unrealistic and unconstitutional, and caused widespread questions about who is in charge of South Korea and its military at a time of heightened tension with North Korea. The Justice Ministry on Tuesday banned Yoon from leaving the country as he faces investigations.",
      "Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho reiterated Wednesday that Yoon remains in charge of the military. But Yoon hasn't been involved in any major official activities since lifting martial law, except for accepting resignation offers by officials involved in the martial law case and appointing the head for the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.",
      "A Wednesday article from the North's state news agency reported about the South Korean political chaos and protests triggered by Yoon's martial law decree. The report mostly attempted to explain the South Korean events, though it called Yoon \"a traitor\" and his military \"gangsters.\"",
      "Many experts say North Korea is sensitive to the domestic spread of news on major anti-government protests in foreign countries, because its own people have no official access to international news and could be affected by such events. The U.S. State Department said Monday that the U.S.-South Korean alliance remains \"iron-clad\" and that Washington is committed to the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula.",
      "In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed a need to rebuild the country by eliminating \"shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces,\" a reference to his liberal rivals who control parliament. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has had near-constant friction with the Democratic Party, which introduced motions to impeach some of his top officials and launched a political offensive over scandals involving Yoon and his wife.",
      "Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergency situations, but South Korea wasn't in such a predicament. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the constitution doesn't allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation.",
      "If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If he is dismissed from office, a new presidential election would be required.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 05:04:59 -0500",
    "summary": "The sound of a bottle popping may be a familiar harbinger of good, but the humble material behind the pop has more uses than you might imagine.",
    "story": [
      "Lisbon, Portugal \u2014\u00a0The sound of a cork popping out of the end of a bottle is known across the world. It often precedes moments of celebration, a shared meal or simply the quiet enjoyment of a glass of wine. But many who've taken part in the simple ritual may not realize that it's also a synonym for sustainability, natural wonder, and even human ingenuity.",
      "Cork, the humble material used for centuries to seal bottles, is a unique product not only for the way it's grown, but also for the plethora of inventive uses people have found for it \u2014 which go far beyond the ubiquitous bottle stoppers. Cork is used in everything from the building of spacecraft to the insulation of homes, and it can replace rubber or plastic on just about anything that needs protection from heat or vibration.",
      "Thanks to the unique, delicate conditions in which it grows, cork is also a powerful, natural carbon sink, meaning it absorbs harmful CO2 from the atmosphere and locks it away.",
      "CBS News visited the southern European nation of Portugal, which produces the majority of the world's cork, and met Ant\u00f3nio Rios Amorim, who humbly rejects the title \"King of Cork.\"",
      "\"I'm just inheriting a huge legacy from a family that, for the last 154 years, has been dedicating itself to cork, and really trying to develop this unique product to give it new life,\" he said.",
      "Amorim Cork produces more than five billion of the approximately 13 billion cork bottle stoppers produced annually across the globe. It's enough to give the family firm comfortable supremacy in the industry, but Amorim said finding new and innovative uses for the material, beyond sealing bottles, remained \"fundamental\" to his empire's future.",
      "Among the less-well-known applications \u2014 and one Amorim clearly relishes \u2014 is the use of cork on NASA rockets. The material is mixed into the heat shields that protect spacecraft as they leave and reenter the Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Its light weight, malleability and insulating properties against vibration have made the spongy material a natural choice for some of the most important space missions, including the Apollo missions and the Mars rovers. It's also used on Elon Musk's SpaceX rockets.",
      "\"It's remarkable,\" said Eduardo Soares, as he gave CBS News a tour of Amorim's eclectic showroom. \"Cork has this very peculiar effect, a slow burning process. It will absorb heat without transferring it.\"",
      "As head of the unit tasked with dreaming up new ways for Amorim to profit from cork that isn't suitable for bottle stoppers, Soares could easily identify every product in the room.",
      "Biodegradable cork granules replace rubber in artificial turf infill, which also helps keep surface temperatures down and avoids the release of microplastics; Insulation panels that absorb vibration, making train carriages quieter and smoother; Children's playground flooring, normally made of synthetic materials, now have a natural alternative.",
      "For Amorim, the list of alternative uses for cork seems endless.",
      "\"It's very important for us that we use the raw material that we take out from nature until the very last limit,\" Soares explained.",
      "Amorim is also part of a recycling initiative, aptly named The Cork Collective, that aims to help restaurants and hotels recycle the cork stoppers from bottles they open, to give the precious material a new lease of life.",
      "Another family-run business in the field is Sofalca, which specializes in turning cork into natural insulation for walls and floors.",
      "CEO Paulo Estrada gave CBS News a tour of his factory's autoclaves, affectionately nicknamed the \"popcorn makers,\" which cook granules of cork at high temperatures and under intense pressure. The cork expands, and its natural resin glues it all together without the need for added chemicals. A large block rolls off the assembly line, ready to be cut into slabs, shaped into enormous walls of art or even pieces of furniture.",
      "Estrada said the material can give an otherwise unassuming part of someone's home a \"contemplative effect.\"",
      "\"If you come near a cork wall, you will touch, smell and feel it. Nobody stays indifferent,\" he added.",
      "The desire by businesses to make the most out of every single ounce of the natural material can be explained by its biggest caveat: Cork is a layer of bark that grows only on the Quercus Suber oak tree. It typically takes 25 years from the moment a tree is planted for it to be ready for its first harvest. It then takes another nine years to regrow the bark.",
      "\"You have to be patient,\" said Casimiro Milheiras, taking a quick break from climbing up trees with a small axe. At 57, Milheiras is one of thousands of seasonal workers hired every summer to comb through Portugal's scorching Alentejo region to manually strip the bark off the Quercus oaks.",
      "\"It's almost an art form, so you only do this work if you really love it,\" he said.",
      "His 20 years of experience have taught him exactly how to strike the tree hard enough to pierce through the bark, but not so hard that he cuts into the trunk, as doing so would compromise the next harvest.",
      "The natural landscape cork comes from isn't just important for the industry, however. Environmental impact studies by international consulting firms EY and PricewaterhouseCoopers have demonstrated that many of Amorim's products are actually carbon negative, which means the overall process \u2014 from growth to extraction, transportation and production \u2014 absorbs more carbon than it emits into the environment.",
      "\"There is no best example of a carbon sink in a forest like the cork oak forest, because we don't cut the tree,\" explained Nuno Oliveira, \"we want them to grow [for] as long as possible.\"",
      "Oliveira is the director of Amorim's forestry division, which is responsible for the research and practices that keep its cork oak forests healthy. His work helps secure the future of both Portugal's cork industry, and the company.",
      "Standing in a field of planted cork oaks that were about 100 years old on average, Oliveira explained that as long as the trees keep growing and regrowing their precious bark, they will keep sucking carbon out of the air.",
      "His biggest challenge, he said, has been to find a way to shorten the time needed for a tree's first cork harvest from the current 25 years, to just 10, which CEO Amorim highlighted as one of the most \"fundamental\" questions his business needs to answer.",
      "\"This is a gift of nature,\" Amorim said. \"We need to consume products with a negative carbon footprint. That means we are going to have to plant a lot more cork trees, which at the end of the day will make us live in a much better world.\"",

    "summary": "The Arctic tundra has historically helped reduce global emissions. But rising temperatures and wildfires in the region are changing that, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Foreboding environmental milestones abounded again this year in the Arctic, where experts say dramatic climate shifts are fundamentally altering the ecosystem and how it operates. One recent turning point for the region involves its carbon footprint: Where conditions in the Arctic historically worked to reduce global emissions, they're now actively contributing to them.",
      "That's a major transition that could reap consequences on human, plant and animal life far beyond Earth's northernmost arena, warned a cohort of scientists whose research appears in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 2024 Arctic Report Card, published Tuesday. The report is an annual assessment of the polar environment, which in recent years has become a stark alert signal marked by unprecedented and ominous observations all linked to rising temperatures from human-caused climate change.",
      "A focus of the latest Arctic evaluation was the effects of warmer weather and wildfires on the tundra, a far-northern biome that's typically known for extreme cold, little precipitation and a layer of permanently frozen soil, called permafrost, covering the land. Those traits collectively made the Arctic an important carbon sink for millennia, meaning the region essentially helped reduce carbon dioxide emissions worldwide by absorbing more carbon than it emitted into the atmosphere.",
      "That has mainly been due to carbon uptake from plants, which regulate atmospheric levels of the molecule through photosynthesis, and a storage process in the permafrost, which traps carbon dioxide in the ground. But warming air temperatures in the Arctic are breaking down permafrost across the tundra, in some cases, severely. The Arctic report, for example, showed Alaskan permafrost temperatures in 2024 were the second-warmest ever recorded. That causes the soil to heat up and thaw, its carbon repositories decompose along with it.",
      "Research included in NOAA's Arctic report shows carbon once stored in the tundra's permafrost is actually being released into the atmosphere. In parts of the region, it's happening at a rate that outweighs the carbon sink and instead creates a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 something of particular concern to climate scientists at a time when pollution from fossil fuel production has already reached a record high.",
      "The same fossil fuels overwhelming the atmosphere and prompting ongoing admonition from top weather and climate officials\u00a0at the United Nations are fueling the emissions in the Arctic, said Rich Spinrad, the administrator of NOAA, in a statement on the new report's findings.",
      "\"Our observations now show that the Arctic tundra, which is experiencing warming and increased wildfire, is now emitting more carbon than it stores, which will worsen climate change impacts,\" Spinrad said. \"This is yet one more sign, predicted by scientists, of the consequences of inadequately reducing fossil fuel pollution.\"",
      "Wildfires in the Arctic have been raging at rates never seen before, and that alone drives up carbon emissions. Researchers suggest 2024 had the second-highest annual volume of wildfire emissions north of the Arctic Circle on record. Coupled with the release of carbon dioxide and methane gas from permafrost stores, they say net emissions could continue to increase in the place that climate change is heating up faster than anywhere else on the planet.",

    "story": [
      "A Ukrainian man who embarked on a perilous journey fleeing his war-torn country into Romania was rescued from a deep mountain ravine in subzero temperatures with an unlikely companion: his months-old kitten named Peach.",
      "More than a dozen rescuers worked in a harsh blizzard to save Vladislav Duda, 28, who was found \"soaked and frozen\" and severely hypothermic in a 400-meter (437-yard) deep ravine in the northern Maramures region last week, according to the region's mountain rescue service. Duda had fled Ukraine to avoid being drafted into his country's armed forces fighting Russia.",
      "\"The cat was warm and was warming him \u2026 so he saved his life,\" Dan Benga, the director of the Maramures mountain rescue service, told The Associated Press. \"The only thing we saw he is caring about is the cat. He doesn't care about himself.\"",
      "When the rescue team located and found the Ukrainian, they unzipped his jacket and discovered Peach snuggled up inside. Benga recalls asking Duda if he was OK, to which he replied: \"I'm happy because my cat is alive. I got a chance from God for a new life. The happiest moment is because the cat is here with me,\" Benga recalled Duda saying.",
      "The auburn-colored kitten, a tomcat named \"Peach\" in Ukrainian, was experiencing the effects of malnutrition after they ran out of food four days earlier and melted snow helped to keep him alive.",
      "\"It's like a dream, after all I have been through, I only hoped to be found and to survive,\" Duda, who worked as a journalist in Ukraine, told the AP. \"Peach kept my heart warm and he kept my faith alive.\"",
      "A helicopter retrieval was initially launched but was aborted due to dangerous weather that hampered visibility. Ground rescuers then embarked on a grueling mission through deep snow and temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) until they reached the pair.",
      "During the complex ascent out of the ravine which took more than five hours, the Ukrainian would not let go of his kitten. He kept Peach clutched to his chest \"from the bottom to the top ... until we put him in the ambulance,\" Benga said. \"He said only 'Please take care of the cat.'\"",
      "Close to getting frostbite, Duda is now receiving anti-inflammatory medication and blood circulation treatment, said Izabella Kiskasza, who runs a community center for Ukrainian refugees in Maramures and is assisting the duo. Peach received veterinary treatment in Baia Mare on Monday and is expected to fully recover.",
      "Duda left his home in Ukraine's war-ravaged Kharkiv region more than a week before getting stranded with his feline companion in the arching Carpathian Mountain range, which straddles northern Romania and southwest Ukraine.",
      "While Peach is the first feline rescued from the mountainous Romanian region, Duda is just one of many Ukrainian men who have risked their lives traversing the harsh conditions of the mountains to avoid being drafted into their country's grinding war with Russia.",
      "Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, more than 160 Ukrainian men have been rescued from Romania's Maramures region and the numbers have doubled each year since, Benga said. Another 16 have been found dead.",
      "Two other Ukrainian draft-aged men were rescued by helicopter the same day as Duda, he said.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who are coming, but they have no medical problem \u2026 and they don't call for help,\" Benga said. \"The people who are calling for help are in the last few hours of their life.\"",
      "Ukraine has taken steps to broaden its pool of draft-eligible men, but the efforts have only scratched the surface against a much larger Russian military. In April, Ukraine's parliament passed a law lowering its draft-eligible age for men from 27 to 25.",
      "Desertion is also starving the Ukrainian army of desperately needed manpower at a crucial time in its war with Russia. The U.S., which has also urged Ukraine to draft more troops, and allow for the conscription of those as young as 18, on Saturday announced a new $988 million military assistance package for Ukraine in its war with Russia as Washington races to provide aid to Kyiv before\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "\"What I remember is the fear of the unknown and the fear of not making it through the night alive,\" Duda recalled on Monday. \"My Peach kept me alive. When escaping we were afraid of everybody, not to be sent back to fight in a war that is not ours.\"",
      "According to the United Nations, there are nearly 4 million internally displaced people in Ukraine and 6.8 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded globally as of November 2024.",
      "According to the animal welfare group Four Paws, since the start of the war, thousands of pet dogs and cats have been lost or abandoned. In 2022, a German organization set up a shelter at the Ukraine-Poland border to help rescue stranded pets.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 06:33:50 -0500",
    "summary": "Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu is now juggling his own trial on corruption charges along with the war in Gaza and a new security challenge in neighboring Syria.",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv, Israel\u00a0\u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the stand Tuesday in his long-running trial for alleged corruption, setting off what's expected to be a weekslong spectacle that will draw unwelcome attention to his legal woes as he faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes and the fighting in Gaza continues. It is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister takes the stand as a criminal defendant, an embarrassing milestone for a leader who has tried to cultivate an image as a sophisticated and respected statesman.",
      "Upon starting his testimony, Netanyahu said \"hello\" to the judges. One judge told him he had the same privileges as other witnesses and could sit or stand as he chose.",
      "\"I waited eight years for this moment, to say the truth,\" Netanyahu said, standing at a podium in a packed Tel Aviv courtroom. He called the charges against him \"an ocean of absurdness\" and promised his version would cut through the prosecution's case.",
      "Netanyahu appeared at ease as he began telling his version of events and shared personal details about his life that he might hope would shape the judges' perception of him. He said he used to lose sleep over media coverage but learned it had no meaningful bearing \u2014 in contrast to the prosecution's attempts to paint him as image-obsessed.",
      "He said he smoked cigars but could hardly finish them because of his workload, but hated champagne. One case revolves around him receiving a \"supply line\" of cigars and champagne from billionaire associates.",
      "His lawyer asked that he be allowed to receive notes while testifying to help ensure he can continue running the country.",
      "Netanyahu will answer during his court appearances to charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases.",
      "He is accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars' worth of cigars and champagne from a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for assisting him with personal and business interests. He is also accused of promoting advantageous regulation for media moguls in exchange for favorable coverage of himself and his family.",
      "Netanyahu, 75, denies wrongdoing, saying the charges are a witch hunt orchestrated by a hostile media and a biased legal system out to topple his lengthy rule. His testimony caps years of scandals that have swirled around him and his family.",
      "The testimony, set to take place six hours a day, three days a week for several weeks, will take up a significant chunk of Netanyahu's working hours, prompting critics to ask if he can capably manage a country embroiled in a war on one front, containing the fallout from a second, and keeping tabs on other potential regional threats, including from Iran or the recent fall of longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad in neighboring Syria.",
      "Netanyahu, in his testimony, said he could \"find a balance\" between both commitments.",
      "Dozens of people gathered outside of the court in Tel Aviv, some protesting against Netanyahu, including family members of hostages held in Gaza, and also a group of his supporters. A banner draped in front of the court read: \"Crime Minister.\"",
      "Under Israeli law, indicted prime ministers are not required to step down. But the charges against Netanyahu cleaved deep divisions in Israel, with protesters demanding he resign and former political allies refusing to serve in government with the Israeli leader, triggering a political crisis that led to five elections in less than four years beginning in 2019. He overcame the political tumult only two years ago by striking an agreement with smaller right-wing parties that had long languished on the edges of Israeli politics, to form the country's most far-right government ever.",
      "Netanyahu's supporters view the charges as the result of the justice system's bias and overreach, while his opponents have accused him of prolonging the raging war in Gaza in a bid to distract from, if not delay his own court proceedings. Netanyahu launched the war on Gaza's Hamas rulers immediately after they carried out their brutal Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage.",
      "Despite the pressure, the polarizing Netanyahu has rejected calls to step down and has used his position as prime minister to lash out at law enforcement, media and courts.",
      "An Israeli court rejected a request by Netanyahu's lawyers to reduce the expected testimony hours, as well as several other requests to delay its start, which they said were necessary because of the prime minister's busy schedule and the country's significant challenges. A verdict isn't expected until 2026 at the earliest and Netanyahu will have the option to appeal at the Supreme Court.",
      "The court has spent months hearing prosecution witnesses in the three cases, including some of Netanyahu's once closest aides who turned state witnesses. The prosecution has tried to portray the prime minister as an image-obsessed leader who broke the law to improve his public perception.",
      "The most damaging case against Netanyahu involves an influence-peddling scandal in which two of his formerly closest aides have testified against him on suspicions of promoting regulation worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israel's Bezeq telecom company. In return, Bezeq's popular news site, Walla, allegedly provided favorable coverage of Netanyahu and his family.",
      "Netanyahu is also alleged to have offered a newspaper publisher legislation that would weaken his paper's main rival in return for more favorable coverage.",
      "Moreover, the prime minister is accused of accepting nearly $200,000 in champagne and cigars from Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and in exchange, he allegedly operated on Milchan's behalf on U.S. visa matters, tried to legislate a generous tax break for him and sought to promote his interests in the Israeli media market.",
      "Netanyahu's testimony could further tarnish his image at a complicated time for Israel's longest-serving leader. His popular support dropped after the Hamas attack in October 2023, with the public blaming his leadership for failing to prevent the assault, and if elections were held today polls suggest he would struggle to form another new government.",
      "Israel is still fighting Hamas in Gaza with no end in sight, despite heavy international pressure to wind down the war, as well as pressure from the families of hostages still held in Gaza and their supporters to bring their loved ones home.",
      "The Israeli leader, along with his former defense minister, also faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes charges related to the war in Gaza, which his office has dismissed as \"absurd and false actions and charges.\"",

      "A mysterious illness, which the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is calling \"disease X,\" has killed at least 31 people \u2014 mostly children \u2014 in the remote Panzi region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the World Health Organization says.",
      "The WHO said Sunday that 406 cases of the disease have been recorded in the Kwango Province, approximately 435 miles southeast of the capital Kinshasa. More than half of those who died were children younger than 5 years old who were severely malnourished, the health agency said.",
      "The actual number of deaths in the region is difficult to determine, and some reports say as many as\u00a0143 people have died. A team of scientists from the World Health Organization is on the ground investigating the illness, which researchers believe started circulating in October.",
      "The DRC's Ministry of Public health sent an alert to WHO on Oct. 29 saying it was concerned about a mysterious illness that had caused \"increased\" deaths in the Panzi health region, according to the WHO. The ministry said in a press briefing on Dec. 5 that the mortality rate was about 8% and that several deaths were reported outside of health facilities.",
      "The community deaths are of concern, local health officials told CBS News, and the WHO said they need to be investigated.",
      "Doctors say the disease presents much like a respiratory infection, with people suffering from fevers, headaches, coughing, runny noses and body aches. The WHO said rapid response teams have been sent to identify the cause of the outbreak and help coordinate a suitable response.",

The program never made it to air, as Glanville's co-star, Caroline Manzo, accused her of sexual assault in a lawsuit she filed against the Bravo network.",

And we're still here, trying to figure it out,\" Glanville told ET, explaining that during the trip, she consumed food - including meat that had been sitting out for hours.",

      "He continued, \"I wanted my life to continue on as normal as possible, and that led me to believing that as normal as possible more meant spending time with my family, my two daughters, my two son-in-laws, my granddaughters. And the importance of finding the way with Theresa was still there, but it became less of a priority.\"",
      "Nist told People that Turner's cancer diagnosis was not the reason she decided getting a divorce was a good idea.",

And I have every faith that is going to work out that way, that it's going to be the type of cancer that will not affect his life and that he'll live to be a very healthy old age.\"",

I wanted the joy of being in a home together and designing a home together. I really thought that was going to be phenomenal. I was looking forward to that so much.\"",
      "Nist said that they looked at homes in South Carolina \"virtually,\" adding, \"I think it just petered out that we were looking at homes back and forth and we could never agree on one. And then the emails just stopped, [and] we weren't looking anymore.\"",

    "summary": "Kurt &quot;CyberGuy&quot; Knutsson tackles blockchain scams, which are often disguised as legitimate offers that promise easy investment returns.",
    "story": [
      "The \"CyberGuy\" addresses potential blockchain scams.",
      "Blockchain scams are increasingly prevalent, and it\u2019s essential to understand what they are and how to recognize them before they take a toll on your finances.",
      "For instance, John from Sunset Beach, North Carolina, recently reached out with a pressing question about some suspicious messages he\u2019s been receiving in his inbox.",

      "John's experience is not unique; many individuals find themselves in similar situations when confronted with potential blockchain scams. These scams can take various forms, often disguised as legitimate offers or services that promise easy returns on investments. Let's look at the common signs of these scams, why they are so prevalent and what steps you can take to protect yourself from becoming a victim.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "What is a blockchain scam?",
      "A blockchain scam refers to a deceptive scheme aimed at tricking you into losing your money or digital assets within the cryptocurrency space. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to rise, so does the prevalence of these scams, which exploit the lack of regulation and the anonymity often associated with blockchain technology. In essence, blockchain scams come in various forms, each designed to mislead and defraud unsuspecting victims.",
      "One of the most common types is the \"Pump and Dump\" scheme. In this scenario, scammers artificially inflate the price of a low-value cryptocurrency by spreading false information or hype. Once the price reaches a certain level, they sell off their holdings, causing the price to plummet and leaving other investors with significant losses.",
      "Another notorious scam is the Initial Coin Offering scam. Here, fraudsters promote a new cryptocurrency project with promises of high returns and innovative technology. However, once they collect funds from investors, they often vanish without delivering any product or service, leaving investors with worthless tokens.",
      "Phishing scams are also rampant in the blockchain world. Scammers impersonate legitimate cryptocurrency platforms or services to trick you into providing sensitive information such as private keys or login credentials. Once they gain access to a victim's wallet, they can easily transfer funds to their own accounts.",
      "Additionally, there are fraudulent giveaway schemes where scammers promise to double or triple an individual's cryptocurrency holdings if they send a specific amount to a designated wallet. After sending their funds, victims find that the promised rewards never materialize.",
      "Scammers may also create clone platforms, which mimic popular cryptocurrency exchanges or wallet services. Unsuspecting users believe they are using a legitimate platform and deposit their digital currencies, only to have them stolen by fraudsters.",

      "DON'T GET CAUGHT IN THE 'APPLE ID SUSPENDED' PHISHING SCAM",
      "Identifying the red flags of cryptocurrency scams",
      "Here are some of the common elements of such cryptocurrency scam emails.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Legitimate crypto services don\u2019t randomly reach out offering free money. If you receive an unexpected email claiming you\u2019ve won cryptocurrency or are entitled to a payment, it\u2019s a strong indicator that something is off.",
      "Pressure to act: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to push you into making hasty decisions. Phrases like \"Act now!\" or \"Limited time offer!\" are red flags that should make you pause and think twice before responding.",
      "Requests for payment: Any service asking for upfront fees to receive crypto is likely a scam. Genuine platforms will never require you to pay before delivering funds or services. So, be wary of any requests for payment in advance.",
      "Suspicious links: Scammers often embed links in emails or messages that lead to phishing sites designed to steal your credentials. Always hover over links to see where they lead before clicking, and if anything looks suspicious, don\u2019t engage. If you have any doubts about a link's legitimacy, it\u2019s best to avoid clicking on it altogether.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Data breaches: Companies get hacked, and your info gets leaked faster than gossip at a high school reunion. Always monitor your accounts for unusual activity.",
      "Public records: Scammers can piece together your life story from publicly available information, everything from property records to social media profiles.",
      "Social media oversharing: That cute dog pic you posted? It might reveal more than you think about where you live or what you do for fun.",
      "Phishing attacks: Clicking on that \"You won\u2019t believe what happened next!\" link could lead to malware that steals your data faster than you can say \"blockchain.\" The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "IS JUST READING THAT SKETCHY SCAMMER'S EMAIL DANGEROUS, OR DO I HAVE TO CLICK ON A LINK TO GET IN TROUBLE?",
      "Protecting yourself from blockchain scams",
      "Given the decentralized and often anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, scams pose significant challenges in terms of tracing and recovering lost funds. Therefore, it\u2019s essential for anyone participating in the crypto space to stay informed about these scams, exercise caution when engaging in transactions and follow the steps below.",
      "1. Verify independently: Always log in to your accounts directly, not through email links. Scammers often create fake websites that look almost identical to legitimate ones, so it's crucial to enter URLs manually or use bookmarks for trusted sites. This simple practice can prevent you from falling victim to phishing attempts.",
      "2. Use strong authentication: Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on all your crypto accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring not just your password but also a second form of verification, such as a text message code or an authentication app. Even if someone manages to steal your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without this additional verification.",
      "3. Be skeptical: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Scammers often lure victims with promises of guaranteed returns or exclusive investment opportunities. Always approach such offers with skepticism and conduct thorough research before making any commitments.",
      "4. Check email addresses: Scammers frequently use domains that look similar to legitimate ones, so always double-check the email address from which a message originates. A small typo or a different domain can indicate a scam. If you're unsure, reach out directly to the company using contact information from their official website.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and antivirus software are up to date.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities that scammers might exploit. Keeping your software current is a critical step in safeguarding your digital assets.",
      "6. Consider using a data removal service: Personal data removal services can help scrub your personal information from the web, making it harder for scammers to target you with personalized phishing attempts. By reducing your digital footprint, you can significantly decrease the chances of being targeted by malicious actors.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your personal data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Remember, in the world of crypto, vigilance is your best friend. If you're ever unsure about an email or offer, it's always better to err on the side of caution. Don't hesitate to reach out to official support channels. Stay safe out there, and may your crypto wallets always be full (and scam-free).",

    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson discusses how Chinese cyber espionage targets U.S. telecoms to steal Americans&apos; information.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has more on the \"sophisticated penetration\" of several carriers on \"Special Report.\"",
      "U.S. telecom giants are under constant attack from Chinese hackers. A federal investigation has uncovered a massive cyber espionage campaign by the Chinese government, targeting U.S. telecommunications networks to steal Americans' information. A top White House official confirmed that at least eight U.S. telecom companies have been affected by this hacking spree.",
      "To combat this, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have released advice for telecom companies to help them detect and block the hackers while preventing future attacks. I break down the details of this Chinese hacking campaign and share tips on how to keep your data safe.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER \u2013 THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the China hacking campaign",
      "According to the FBI, hackers linked to Beijing have infiltrated the networks of \"multiple\" telecom companies, gaining access to customer call records and private communications of \"a limited number of individuals.\" Since this is an espionage campaign, they\u2019re not interested in the average Joe\u2019s texts or call history. Instead, their targets are Americans involved in government and politics.",
      "The hackers also tried to copy \"certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders,\" according to the FBI. This suggests they might have been attempting to breach programs like those under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows U.S. spy agencies to monitor the communications of individuals suspected of working for foreign powers.",
      "Earlier this month, Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger shared new details about the scale of the Chinese hacking campaign. According to Neuberger, the U.S. believes the hackers managed to access communications from senior government officials and prominent political figures.",
      "She explained that while the hackers were focused on a relatively small group of individuals, a limited number of Americans\u2019 phone calls and texts were compromised. Neuberger also mentioned that the affected telecom companies are working to address the breaches, but none have been able to completely remove the Chinese hackers from their networks yet.",
      "This campaign is believed to have started a year or two ago, according to the\u00a0Associated Press. Authorities suspect a Chinese hacking group known as Salt Typhoon to be behind the operation.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "How are hackers able to access sensitive information?",
      "Salt Typhoon managed to access call records and private communications by exploiting decades-old back doors in major telecom providers, including AT&T and Verizon, experts believe.",
      "\"The irony here is that the back doors exploited by the Chinese are, in fact, the same back doors that are utilized by federal law enforcement for purposes of conducting legal surveillance,\" John Ackerly, CEO and co-founder of Virtru, a data-centric security company, told CyberGuy.",
      "The vulnerabilities are a result of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a federal law that mandates back doors in critical telecommunications infrastructure. CALEA enables law enforcement agencies to access phone records and metadata, including facilitating wiretaps, as part of authorized investigations.",
      "\"The problem with back doors is simple. They're not selective. A back door created for law enforcement is, by its very nature, a vulnerability in the system. And vulnerabilities, once they exist, can be exploited by anyone who discovers them. Both good guys and bad guys can enter back doors,\" said Ackerly, who previously served as a White House technology adviser.",

      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "The solution is end-to-end encryption",
      "To protect private conversations and phone calls, cybersecurity experts recommend using end-to-end encrypted platforms. Jeff Greene, executive assistant director of cybersecurity at CISA, urged Americans to prioritize encrypted communication tools.",
      "\"Use your encrypted communications where you have it,\" Greene advised, emphasizing the importance of secure platforms. He added, \"We definitely need to do that, kind of look at what it means long term, how we secure our networks.\"",
      "An FBI official warned that citizens should be \"using a cellphone that automatically receives timely operating system updates, responsibly managed encryption and phishing resistant MFA for email, social media and collaboration tool accounts.\"",
      "However, cybersecurity experts warn that these measures are not foolproof. The term \"responsibly managed encryption\" is problematic, as it intentionally leaves room for \"lawful access,\" such as the back doors required by CALEA.",
      "\"It\u2019s clear that encryption with back doors is not actually responsible at all,\" Ackerly said. \"It\u2019s time for the U.S. government to acknowledge and support end-to-end encryption as a stronger protection against foreign adversaries.\"",

      "Now that we've discussed the threat, let\u2019s take a look at the solutions. Here are 10 ways you can keep your personal information safe.",
      "1) Use end-to-end encrypted platforms:\u00a0For private communications, prioritize platforms that offer end-to-end encryption. This ensures that only you and the intended recipient can access your messages or calls, preventing unauthorized access by hackers or other third parties.",
      "\"Anyone can take control of their own data and protect themselves from security threats by using applications that provide end-to-end encryption. Whether you\u2019re emailing, sending messages and files or video chatting, the only way to truly ensure your data is safe from bad actors is to encrypt it as it travels,\" Ackerly said. \"Choose an app or tool that is easy to use, so that you will actually use it.\"",
      "For texting, consider apps like\u00a0Signal or WhatsApp. For email services, look for ones that offer easy-to-use end-to-end encryption. These platforms ensure that your private communications remain secure from unauthorized access.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "2) Keep your device's operating system updated:\u00a0Make sure your cellphone and other devices automatically receive timely operating system updates. These updates often include important security patches that protect against new vulnerabilities exploited by hackers. For reference, see my guide on\u00a0how to keep all your devices updated.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Set up phishing-resistant\u00a02FA on your email, social media and collaboration tool accounts. This adds an extra layer of protection, requiring more than just a password to access your accounts, making it harder for cybercriminals to steal your information.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software: Be aware of phishing techniques and remain skeptical of suspicious links, emails or phone calls asking for personal information. Cybercriminals often use these methods to gain access to your sensitive data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "5) Encrypt sensitive data:\u00a0Encrypt data on USB drives, SIM cards and laptops to protect information if devices are lost or stolen. Also, be sure to password-protect your sensitive files or folders by following\u00a0these steps.",
      "6) Implement strong password practices: Use unique, complex passwords for each account and consider using a\u00a0password manager.",
      "7) Regularly backup your data: Backing up your data helps protect against data loss from ransomware or device failure. You'll want to back up your\u00a0mobile device,\u00a0Mac and\u00a0Windows computers.",
      "8) Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Use a\u00a0VPN (virtual private network) when connecting to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks to encrypt your internet traffic. This makes it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "A VPN could be your secret weapon to protect your identity and finances.",
      "VPNs (virtual private networks) are a powerful tool for securing your internet connection. They protect your data by encrypting it, making it harder for hackers or even your internet service provider (ISP) to see what you're doing online. But how should you set up a VPN? Should you install it on each device or run it on your home network through a router? We will break down the pros and cons of both methods to help you make the right decision.",

      "Woman using a VPN on her cellphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms: IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from their server network, effectively preventing websites and cyber criminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",
      "VPN on devices vs. router: What's the difference?",
      "Understanding the difference between using a VPN on individual devices vs. setting it up on your router is crucial for maximizing your online security and privacy.",
      "Most people are familiar with using a VPN app on their phone, laptop or tablet. In this setup, the device connects directly to the internet through the VPN, keeping that device's internet activity secure.",
      "With a VPN router, instead of installing a VPN on each device, the router connects to the VPN. This means every device connected to your Wi-Fi \u2013 whether a smartphone, laptop, gaming console or even a smart TV \u2013 automatically uses the VPN, even if that device doesn\u2019t support VPN apps.",

      "Why use a VPN router?",
      "There are several advantages to running a VPN directly on your router.",
      "A VPN router ensures that every device on your network is protected, even those that don\u2019t support VPNs, like smart home devices or certain game consoles. Once the router is set up with a VPN, it encrypts the internet traffic of all connected devices.",
      "Installing or managing VPN software on every device is unnecessary with a VPN router. Once the router is configured, you can sit back and enjoy a protected internet connection across your entire home network. However, it\u2019s a good idea to occasionally check that the connection is working properly using tools like DNS leak tests.",
      "Using a VPN prevents your ISP from seeing which websites or services you\u2019re using. This is particularly useful if you\u2019re concerned about privacy or want to access geo-restricted content, such as streaming services like Netflix or gaming platforms.",
      "A home router (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Are there any downsides to VPN routers?",
      "While VPN routers are convenient, they do come with a few potential drawbacks.",
      "Most basic routers provided by your ISP don\u2019t support VPN connections. You\u2019ll likely need to purchase a more advanced, VPN-compatible router, which can be pricier, starting at around $50 and going much higher for premium models.",
      "Encrypting all the traffic in your home network requires processing power. If you have a lot of devices connected at once, a primary router might struggle to keep up. In this case, a higher-end router with more processing power is recommended.",
      "When you use a VPN app on a device, switching server locations, adjusting security settings or choosing different VPN protocols is easy. Making these changes on a VPN router requires logging into the router\u2019s settings, which can be more time-consuming and complicated.",
      "DON'T TOSS YOUR OLD INTERNET ROUTER UNTIL YOU DO THIS",
      "How to set up a VPN on a router",
      "Setting up a VPN on your\u00a0router may seem complex, but it significantly enhances your digital security, especially when paired with a robust router. Here\u2019s how to approach this process.",
      "Choose a compatible VPN service: Select a VPN provider that supports\u00a0router installations. Look for services that offer comprehensive guides and customer support to assist you through the setup.",
      "Select the right router: Ensure your router is VPN compatible and has strong security features. Opt for\u00a0routers that support the latest Wi-Fi encryption standards, such as WPA3, and have built-in firewalls to protect against external threats. This will provide a solid foundation for your VPN connection.",
      "Install the VPN: Follow your VPN provider's step-by-step instructions to configure the service on your\u00a0router. This typically involves entering your login credentials, installing necessary certificates and selecting a server location.",
      "Test your connection: Once configured, verify that your VPN is functioning correctly by testing the connection. Ensure that all devices connected to the router are protected by the VPN.",
      "Leverage additional security features: Take advantage of your router\u2019s features such as guest networks and parental controls to enhance security further. A separate guest network prevents unauthorized access to your main network, while regular firmware updates from the manufacturer help mitigate vulnerabilities.",
      "By integrating these steps, you not only set up a VPN but also fortify your home network against potential cyber threats.",

      "While it might sound obvious, the first step to troubleshooting a computer that constantly crashes is ensuring everything is firmly plugged in. It's often the most overlooked step, so if you're using a desktop, you'll want to look behind your PC and ensure everything is plugged in.

      "Computer overheating is a common cause of intermittent shutdowns and crashes. If your CPU (central processing unit), essentially the brain of your computer, or graphics card gets too hot, your computer might shut down to ensure the components aren't damaged. If you notice that your laptop or desktop is giving off a lot of heat, or in the case of a laptop, it is hot to the touch, or if you notice your fans running louder than usual, these are all signs of overheating.",
      "If your computer is overheating, the first step is to clean it thoroughly. I recommend blowing dust out of the interior fans with compressed air and keeping your PC in an area where it can receive proper airflow. If you have a desktop PC, try not to keep it under your desk. Keeping a PC under a desk can cause issues with dust build-up and lack of airflow. It's best to keep your desktop in a part of your home or office where it can receive a decent amount of airflow.",

      "Have you ever found yourself needing to constantly turn the volume up on your TV because it sounds like the actors onscreen are speaking in whispers, but then whenever action is onscreen, your TV feels deafening? It's not just you.",
      "This is one of the most common issues people have with their TV audio, but, fortunately, you can change a few settings on your TV to make the dialogue sound clearer.",
      "Read on for three easy fixes to help your TV audio sound better.",

      "1. Check out your TV's audio settings",
      "A viewer adjusting TV audio settings with a remote control. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Most modern TVs feature preset audio settings that you can adjust on the fly to make things sound better, depending on whether you're gaming, watching a live concert or watching a slow-burn drama. Too much bass will often obscure spoken dialogue in TV shows and movies, and I suggest going through your TV's preset audio settings to see if you can make the audio clearer. Most TVs feature a movie, music and standard mode for TV audio. You can find your TV's audio presets by navigating to the settings from your remote and selecting \"sound.\"",
      "Some TVs will also feature audio presets explicitly designed for dialogue. Check to see if you have a setting for \"Dialogue,\" \"News,\" \"Speech\" or even \"Speech Boost\" in your TV audio settings. Any three of these should help your TV dialogue come through more clearly. You might also want to consider disabling settings for surround sound or bass boost, as these can cover up the sound of dialogue by increasing the bass too much.",
      "Increasing the treble might be worth it if you have access to EQ settings on your TV and are struggling to hear TV dialogue. It's an easy fix that can improve audio quality without taking too much away from non-dialogue sound in a movie or TV show.",
      "HOW TO EASILY CONNECT HEADPHONES TO YOUR TV FOR GREAT SOUND",
      "2. Adjust dynamic range compression",
      "A floor-standing speaker. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Dynamic range compression, or \"volume leveling,\" is useful for tailoring audio sound to personal needs. Volume leveling reduces the gulf between the loudest and quietest sounds onscreen, making it easier to hear and understand onscreen dialogue, especially in action movies, where the dialogue is often much quieter than the preceding action sequence. You'll find the settings for volume leveling or dynamic range compression in your TV audio settings, which, on most TVs, you can access directly from the remote.",
      "My TV features volume leveling, and I love to use it when I watch TV late at night at a low volume. It helps me to understand everything easily without having the speakers loud enough to wake anyone else up. It's also a great way to keep the audio level when commercials come on if you watch cable.",

      "The default speakers built into TVs aren't the best. While a few high-level TVs come with a built-in soundbar, you'll still have the best experience with your own independent speakers or a soundbar. If you followed the two tips above but are still having trouble hearing movie or TV dialogue, it might be time to look into and invest in a set of speakers or, if you want a single unit,\u00a0a soundbar.",
      "I prefer using a soundbar with a TV over speakers for a cleaner setup because they often come with built-in subwoofers that enhance the bass, making action scenes and music sound more immersive. Additionally, modern soundbars are sleek and can easily blend with your home decor. Many of them also support advanced audio technologies like Dolby Atmos, which provides a surround sound experience without the need for multiple speakers scattered around the room.",

      "Using adapters: If your TV lacks a headphone jack but has RCA outputs (the red and white ports), you can use an RCA-to-3.5mm adapter to connect your headphones.",
      "Bluetooth connection: Many modern TVs support Bluetooth. To connect:",

      "Bluetooth transmitter: If your TV doesn\u2019t have Bluetooth, consider using a Bluetooth transmitter. This device plugs into the TV\u2019s audio output (like the headphone jack or RCA ports) and sends audio wirelessly to your Bluetooth headphones.",
      "Media streamers: If you use devices like Roku or Apple TV, they often support Bluetooth connections for headphones, allowing you to listen privately through those devices instead.",

      "Why scambaiting matters",
      "So, why should we care about scambaiting? This creative strategy offers several compelling benefits. First and foremost, it effectively wastes scammers' time. Every minute they spend on the phone with Daisy is a minute they can't use to target real victims. By keeping them occupied, we can potentially prevent them from scamming someone else.",
      "In addition to wasting time, scambaiting raises awareness about common scams. It serves as an educational tool, helping others recognize and avoid falling prey to similar tactics. The more people understand how these scams operate, the less likely they are to become victims. Moreover, watching scammers get flustered sheds light on the lengths these criminals will go to and highlights the importance of staying vigilant against their schemes.",

      "While scambaiting can be a fun way to fight back against scams, the best defense is simply not picking up and answering scam calls in the first place. One effective strategy is to consider investing in personal data removal services that wipe your information from public databases on the internet. By reducing your digital footprint, you can make it more difficult for scammers to contact you in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

    "title": "Fall of Syria's Bashar Assad is strategic blow to Iran and Russia, experts say",
    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 06:12:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Analysts and commentators say the collapse of Syria&apos;s Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime is likely to reshape the power dynamics in the Middle East while signaling a critical shift in influence among world powers.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the latest on the overthrow of Assad's regime in Syria, President-elect Donald Trump's demand for NATO members and the status of Pete Hegseth's confirmation process.",
      "The stunning collapse of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria has sent shock waves throughout the region and beyond, marking a dramatic turning point after nearly 14 years of civil war. Assad\u2019s rule, long sustained by Russia and Iran, has come to an end, leaving his former patrons scrambling to manage the fallout. The implications for these two powers, as well as for the broader regional and global landscape, are profound.",
      "Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria was never just about Assad, experts say. Securing a foothold in the Middle East was a cornerstone of Moscow\u2019s strategy, with the Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus naval facility serving as vital assets for projecting power. However, with Assad now gone, Russia\u2019s assets in Syria are at risk.",
      "Rebekah Koffler, strategic military intelligence analyst and author of \"Putin\u2019s Playbook,\" emphasized the significance. \"Syria has been a key theater in the broader proxy conflict between Russia and the U.S. losing Assad represents a strategic defeat for Russia, costing them critical bases in the Middle East and further stretching their military resources as they continue fighting in Ukraine.\"",

      "Opposition fighters remove a flag from an official building in Salamiyah, east of Hama, Syria, on Saturday Dec. 7, 2024. (AP Photo/Ghaith Alsayed)",
      "Ksenia Svetlova, a senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council, described the fallout as, \"Russia has been exposed for what it really is- a power that overpromises but underdelivers. They came to Syria with grand ambitions, but apart from helping Assad survive through joint efforts with Iran and Hezbollah, they achieved little. The post-war reconstruction never began, and with Russia now focused on Ukraine, Syria became a secondary priority. Now, Russia has abandoned Assad, revealing itself as an unreliable partner.\"",
      "She said this failure sends a message to Moscow\u2019s allies. \"In the Middle East, Russia now looks weak compared to the United States. Syrians are stunned that Moscow left 'Baby Assad,' as the regime opponents call him, to collapse, while the U.S. has demonstrated strength by standing firmly with Israel in its time of need.\"",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad visit an air base in Syria, on Dec. 11, 2017. (Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev via Reuters/File Photo)",
      "The fall of Assad highlights Syria\u2019s role as a battleground in the U.S.- Russia proxy war, as Koffler explained. \"Before Assad\u2019s fall, President Trump reportedly called Putin to de-escalate tensions, but instead, Putin doubled down by escalating his nuclear doctrine, signaling a refusal to back down. Now that Assad, one of Putin\u2019s key allies, has lost Syria, the balance of power shifts dramatically. With this loss, Trump may have newfound leverage over Putin, as losing Syria undermines Russia\u2019s influence in the region and strains its already overstretched resources. This could open a path for Trump to negotiate the end of the war in Ukraine from a stronger position, leveraging Putin\u2019s setbacks in Syria.\"",
      "Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei meets Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in Tehran, on Feb. 25, 2019. (Iranian Leader Press Office/Handout/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",
      "For Iran, Assad's fall deals a devastating blow to its long-term regional strategy. Syria was a crucial link in Tehran\u2019s \"Axis of Resistance,\" connecting Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon and enabling the smuggling of weapons across the region via a corridor stretching from Iran through Iraq and Syria into Lebanon.",
      "\"This is an unprecedented, historic moment,\" Svetlova said. \"The Iranian \u2018Ring of Fire,\u2019 meticulously built by Qassem Soleimani, has been shattered. If Soleimani was still alive, he would be horrified to see the collapse of his life\u2019s work.\"",
      "The weakening of Hezbollah during its war with Israel further exacerbated Assad\u2019s vulnerability, leaving the regime without critical support on the ground. Hezbollah had been a key force assisting Assad\u2019s army during the civil war, but after sustaining heavy losses to Israeli forces, it could no longer provide sufficient support. Meanwhile, Iran refrained from sending additional troops to bolster Assad.",

      "Rebel fighters stand near the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria, Dec. 8, 2024. (Reuters/Firas Makdesi)",
      "An Iranian journalist, speaking anonymously to Fox News Digital from Iran, shed light on the internal reaction in Iran. \"The majority of Iranians are celebrating Assad\u2019s downfall. For years, Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard funneled resources into preserving the Axis of Resistance, draining the Iranian people\u2019s wealth. Now, with Assad gone, there is hope that Iran\u2019s oppressive influence in the region will weaken. This is a moment of joy for those who have long opposed the regime\u2019s policies.\"",
      "\"The Iranian people and the regime are worlds apart in their perspectives,\" said another Iranian dissident who spoke anonymously to Fox News Digital from the country. \"While the regime has largely watched Assad's downfall from the sidelines, likely due to its own internal weaknesses or strategic agreements, the Iranian people are celebrating. There\u2019s a wave of hope and joy spreading across social media, fueled by the idea that revolutions in countries aligned with the Islamic Republic - past or present - could spark a domino effect. For many, Assad's collapse represents the weakening of the resistance axis and a glimmer of possibility for change within Iran itself.\"",

      "While Assad\u2019s fall creates opportunities for a new order in the Middle East, it also presents significant risks. The surprise attack on Assad\u2019s forces, led by the Salafi-jihadist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) under the command of Abu Mohammed al-Golani, underscores the complexity of the situation. HTS, Syria's most powerful rebel faction, evolved from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front but claimed to sever ties with the group in 2016. It remains designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and other nations.",
      "\"Who will fill the void?\" Koffler warned. \"The rebels aren\u2019t good people - they\u2019re the same extremists we\u2019ve seen before. While they may appear on Western media wearing a green T-shirt and giving polished interviews, the reality is different. Removing one dictator often leads to even worse outcomes, as we saw in Iraq and Libya.\"",

      "\"The collapse of Assad\u2019s regime underscores the failures of Russia and Iran as powers in the region. Meanwhile, the U.S. has shown its strength by standing with Israel and choosing the winning side. This is a critical opportunity for Washington to leverage its position and build a coalition of moderate Arab states - Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, and Egypt - with Israel, to counter both Sunni and Shia Islamist forces. This coalition could provide a stabilizing force in the region and counter the growing influence of extremist groups.\"",

      "Golov said there are ramifications for Beijing. \"China has been largely absent in the Middle East conflicts, focusing instead on its global economic goals. In contrast, Russia has proven itself unreliable in Syria, retreating while the U.S. supported its allies. This presents a unique opportunity for America to strengthen its position in the Middle East amid the collapse of the Iranian axis.\"",

The report notes that nine of the 12 participated in the terror attack of Oct. 7, with \"some even serving as Nukhba operatives,\" members of the special forces units of Hamas.

The NGO found that these schools promoted \"libels against and non-recognition of Israel\" and \"gratuitously insert[ed] content promoting hatred and violence against Israel into grammar exercises.\"",

    "title": "On Reddit account linked to Luigi Mangione, posts describe back pain and spinal surgery",
    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 01:04:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Luigi Mangione, who is charged with killing the UnitedHealthcare CEO, appears to have posted online about struggling with chronic back pain and undergoing spinal surgery.",
    "story": [
      "The man charged with killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson posted online in recent years about undergoing spinal surgery and struggling with chronic back pain, numbness and restless sleep, according to what appears to be an archived version of his deleted Reddit account.",
      "Luigi Mangione, 26, was charged Monday in New York with one count of murder, three counts of criminal possession of a weapon and one count of possession of a forged instrument. Thompson\u2019s murder, which occurred last week outside a hotel in New York City, has captured national attention, spurring conversations about gun violence, corporate America and the health care industry.",
      "Mangione\u2019s attorney has said that he intends to plead not guilty to all charges.",
      "The archived Reddit posts may shed light on Mangione\u2019s interests and mental state over the last eight years. He appears to have been active on the platform since 2016 under the username \u201cMister_Cactus,\u201d posting most frequently about spine health, travel and gaming.",
      "Although the account has been suspended, NBC News reviewed an archive of its deleted posts and comments spanning several years. The activity appears to match up with known events in Mangione\u2019s life. NBC News also spoke to several of his friends who said that although they weren\u2019t able to confirm that the Reddit account was Mangione\u2019s, some of the posts aligned with Mangione and his life events.",
      "A Reddit spokesperson said the platform\u2019s policy is to suspend accounts that may be related to suspects in high-profile criminal investigations, a common practice among tech companies to avoid impersonation or interference in such cases.",
      "The activity on the \u201cMister_Cactus\u201d account included posts on a subreddit focused on spondylolisthesis, a condition in which a bone in the spine slips out of alignment and puts pressure on the lower vertebrae and the nerves around the spine.",
      "In comments exchanged with another user on the subreddit in April, \u201cMister_Cactus\u201d wrote that his condition \u201cwent bad to the point where I felt it every day.\u201d",
      "A post sharing advice with other spondylolisthesis patients in October 2023 reads: \u201cConstant pain means something is wrong.\u201d",
      "Yoni Ashar, an expert in pain science and an assistant professor at the University of Colorado\u2019s Anschutz Medical Campus, said back pain can lock patients in a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d that affects sleep, mental health and other aspects of their well-being.",
      "\u201cIt could be the endless agony from the moment you wake up to the moment you manage to fall asleep, if you\u2019re able to sleep,\u201d Ashar said. \u201cIt\u2019s just nonstop, always there, always hurting.\u201d",
      "On a separate subreddit, the \u201cMister_Cactus\u201d account solicited guidance in 2018 about \u201crestless sleep,\u201d describing waking up frequently throughout the night and feeling \u201cunrefreshed no matter how much sleep I get.\u201d",
      "Reddit posts from last year suggest that the back problems flared up after the user went surfing. The movement aggravated back pain that he said he had dealt with since childhood, according to a post in July 2023. After the surfing incident, the post continued, \u201cI slipped on a piece of paper and my right glute locked and right leg shut down for a week.\u201d",
      "\u201cMister_Cactus\u201d wrote at the time that he had been experiencing issues with his right hip for the past year and a half. He felt pain while sitting, he said, and he had twitching in his leg muscles and sometimes numbness and tingling in his groin",
      "The Reddit posts suggest that the account holder underwent spinal fusion surgery in 2023 and that he grappled with the decision beforehand.",
      "Spinal fusion surgery involves inserting bone or a bonelike material into the space between two spinal bones, then connecting the grafts and the bones with metal plates, screws or rods. The goal is to fuse the bones to relieve pressure on the vertebrae and reinforce the spine\u2019s shape and stability.",
      "That type of back surgery can reduce pain significantly, though recovery can take up to a year as bone grafts fuse with the vertebrae. A 2022 study found that out of around 100 patients who underwent the surgery, around 85% to 90% reported satisfaction.",
      "In the post from July 2023, \u201cMister_Cactus\u201d told another Reddit user that his operation was scheduled for two weeks later, \u201cand I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it.\u201d",
      "In the same exchange about the surgery, he said that \u201cit\u2019s not worth being so afraid of more pain/fusions down the line that you don\u2019t live your life now.\u201d",
      "The posts the next month suggest he saw positive results after the operation \u2014 he wrote that after a week, he \u201cwas on literally zero pain meds\u201d and was able to sit, walk and stand.",
      "\u201cWhen my spondy went bad on me last year (23M) it was completely devastating as a young athletic person,\u201d \u201cMister_Cactus\u201d wrote in a separate post in August 2023, referring to spondylolisthesis. He included a list of athletes with \u201csuccess stories\u201d following spinal fusion surgery.",
      "\u201cThis is not to encourage surgery per se, but just to provide reassurance that athletic life is totally normal after fusion if/when the surgery is necessary,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The Reddit posts correspond with the activity of accounts that seem to be linked to Mangione on other social media platforms. An account that appears to be Mangione\u2019s on the book review site Goodreads has on its \u201cread\u201d list books about chronic back pain and dieting, as well as \u201cIndustrial Society and Its Future,\u201d the so-called Unabomber Manifesto written by domestic terrorist Ted Kaczynski. The account gave it four out of five stars. The profile, which went private Wednesday, uses a photo of Mangione that matches others available of him, and it has activity dating to at least 2017.",
      "On X, meanwhile, header photos on an account under Mangione\u2019s name show an X-ray image of a spine with what appear to be four rods or screws inserted. (Posts on the X account date to 2016 and appear to align with Mangione\u2019s life events, such as a reference to a speech he gave as a high school senior.)",
      "Two people who were in touch with Mangione in recent years told NBC News that he talked to them about either his back pain or his concerns about the U.S. health care system.",
      "Gurwinder Bhogal, a British freelance writer who publishes a Substack newsletter called \u201cThe Prism,\u201d said he corresponded with Mangione from April to June.",
      "\u201cWe briefly touched on the differences between the U.K. and U.S. health care systems,\u201d Bhogal said. \u201cLuigi complained about how expensive health care in the U.S. was and expressed envy at the U.K.\u2019s nationalized health system.\u201d",
      "R.J. Martin, the founder of a co-living space in Hawaii called Surfbreak, where Mangione lived for six months in 2022, said Tuesday on \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d that the two had talked at the time about Mangione\u2019s spinal condition.",
      "\u201cI knew it was something that constantly weighed on him,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt was something that impeded him from doing many things.\u201d",
      "Martin described Mangione\u2019s time at Surfbreak as \u201ca bit of a roller coaster,\u201d adding that Mangione had stayed in Hawaii to \u201ctake care of himself\u201d but \u201chad his ups and downs.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "He\u2019s feared as one of the world\u2019s deadliest predators. But Oscar-winning actor Ariana DeBose \u2014 who plays Kraven\u2019s trusted friend Calypso in Sony\u2019s new Spider-Man universe movie \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d\u2014 wants you to rethink what you know about this supervillain.",
      "\u201cNo matter how you view him, I don\u2019t necessarily use the word \u2018villain\u2019 to describe him. I don\u2019t necessarily use the word \u2018hero\u2019 to describe him,\u201d she said in a video interview with NBC News about Kraven (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson).",
      "DeBose says the movie shows complicated characters who are neither good nor evil, but shades of gray cutting both ways.",
      "\u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d releases nationwide Friday, and director J.C. Chandor features a Kraven who is a superhuman killer and a conservationist, as well as a fierce protector of his family.",
      "\u201cThis film is all about motives and understanding why these characters are doing what they\u2019re doing,\u201d DeBose said.",
      "She believes this steeps the film in a level of reality \u201cthat some of the previous Sony Marvel works have not\u201d shown.",
      "Viewers will see Kraven deliver a brutal hit on a kingpin in a maximum-security prison and eliminate poachers who raided a nature preserve, all while marking other enemy targets as prey. He also checks in on his brother (played by Fred Hechinger) as his gangster father (played by Russell Crowe) runs into trouble.",
      "\u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d is the\u00a0first Spider-Man universe movie from Sony\u00a0to get an R rating. And DeBose says that this gives both the film and its viewers the space to explore the origin and motives of characters who have been depicted as villains.",
      "\u201cI think it being rated R definitively liberated the film in a way. The reality is Kraven, even in the comics, is depicted as a vicious character,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I think it does allow the audience to really go on the journey and ask themselves questions of \u2018who\u2019s actually doing what?\u2019 And \u2018who has pure intentions?\u2019 And \u2018who\u2019s doing this for personal gain?\u2019\u201d",
      "When asked to define the motives of her character, DeBose said that she leaves that up to the audience.",
      "\u201cMy goal was to play a woman at a transitional point in her life and to go on the journey,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fun to buy into the origin story of it all, if that makes sense. So, as you\u2019re getting to know Kraven, you\u2019re getting to know Calypso.\u201d",
      "DeBose made history in 2022 when she became the first Afro Latina and first openly queer woman of color to win an\u00a0Academy Award, when she took home the best supporting actress award for her role as Anita in Steven Spielberg\u2019s remake of \u201cWest Side Story.\u201d Before that, she was part of the original cast of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s Tony Award-winning musical \u201cHamilton.\u201d",
      "And next year, DeBose will be teaming up with Oscar-winning actor Ke Huy Quan in the action comedy \u201cLove Hurts.\u201d",
      "Looking back at other characters who inspired her to play Calypso, DeBose pointed to one not in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (commonly referred to as the MCU).",
      "\u201cI loved Disney\u2019s interpretation of Maleficent and how you could take a character that\u2019s historically deemed evil and give them an origin story that allows for explanation of one\u2019s history and how they got to the point that they got to,\" DeBose said. \"I love stories like that, which is probably why I was drawn to Kraven.\u201d",
      "Now, DeBose wants viewers to ask questions about the origins and motives of both Kraven and her character, Calypso, even if they've only known them in one way before.",
      "\"I think you have to make a wide variety of entertainment for audiences so that we don\u2019t teach them that just one interpretation is the right or good interpretation. That\u2019s not the point of art,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "Gerry Turner, star of the \"The Golden Bachelor,\" said he has been diagnosed with an incurable form of bone marrow cancer.",
      "Turner, 72, a father of two, broke the news in an interview with People, saying he found out when he visited an orthopedic surgeon to address an old shoulder injury.",
      "\"Finally I got around to going (to the doctor) and the orthopedic surgeon said, 'Yeah Gerry, there\u2019s not much we can do for your shoulder, but there are some unusual blood markers here,'\" he told People. \"And so an orthopedic surgeon went to my family doctor, my family doctor referred me to an oncologist, and now I\u2019m working with a hematology-oncology group in Fort Wayne,\" Indiana.",
      "Turner said he was diagnosed with Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia, a disease that changes white blood cells into cancer cells that build up in the bone marrow, according to the\u00a0Mayo Clinic. It grows slowly and \"may not cause symptoms for years.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, there\u2019s no cure for it. So that weighs heavily in every decision I make,\" Turner told People. \"It was like 10 tons of concrete were just dropped on me. And I was a bit in denial for a while, I didn\u2019t want to admit to it.\"",
      "While he was reluctant to speak about it at first, Turner told People that getting involved with various charities and fundraisers inspired him to open up about his diagnosis and how it played a part in his divorce from Theresa Nist.\u00a0He married Nist on live TV\u00a0in January after he gave her his final rose on his season of ABC's reality dating show \"The Golden Bachelor.\"",
      "Three months after their televised marriage, Turner filed for divorce. On same day of the filing, the newlyweds announced their decision to divorce in a joint interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d",
      "At the time, Turner and Nist attributed their breakup to an inability to agree on a place to settle down, as the two live near their families in Indiana and New Jersey, respectively.",
      "But now, Turner has revealed that his cancer diagnosis came just as the couple was working to figure out their new lifestyle and that he no longer believed uprooting his life and moving to a new location with Nist was the best decision.",
      "\"I wanted my life to continue on as normal as possible, and that led me to believing that as normal as possible more meant spending time with my family,\u00a0my two daughters, my two son-in-laws, my granddaughters,\" he said. \"And the importance of finding the way with Theresa was still there, but it became less of a priority.\"",
      "After the couple's divorce announcement, rumors spread about what could have led to their breakup. Turner told People he hopes news of his diagnosis will compel the public to \"look at things a little bit differently now.\"",
      "\"When you are hit with that kind of news and the shock wears off after a few days or a few weeks and you regroup and you realize what\u2019s important to you, that\u2019s where you start to move forward,\" he told People. \"And I hope that people understand in retrospect now that that had a huge bearing on my decisions and I think probably Theresa\u2019s as well.\"",
      "Nist, however, shared a different perspective with People, saying Turner's diagnosis \"wasn\u2019t a factor\" in ending the relationship.",
      "\"If that was something on his part, maybe, I don\u2019t know. But no, that didn\u2019t factor into ending the relationship,\" she told People. \"Part of it was the distance, but that wasn\u2019t the only part. That\u2019s really all I will say.\"",
      "Nist also told People that four weeks is a \"very short span of time to get to know someone, and it\u2019s a very accelerated pace.\"",
      "\"During that four weeks, it\u2019s not that you\u2019re with that person every day anyway,\" she said. \"There were only certain times that I was with him one-on-one.\"",
      "As Jan. 4 \u2014 the ex-couple's wedding anniversary \u2014 approaches, Nist told People that the occasion is \"bittersweet.\"",
      "She said that before their divorce, she and Turner had made plans to move together to Charleston, South Carolina.",
      "\"I really wanted a home together. I wanted the joy of being in a home together and designing a home together,\" she told People. \"I really thought that was going to be phenomenal. I was looking forward to that so much.\"",
      "But after some online house hunting over email that never resulted in a commitment, \"the emails just stopped, [and] we weren\u2019t looking anymore,\" Nist told People.",
      "Even so, Nist told People that she wishes Turner the best and knows he was in a \"very difficult situation.\"",
      "Turner wished her the same, calling their time together a \"cherished memory.\"",
      "\"It was wonderful, and I certainly wish it would\u2019ve had a different ending, that we would\u2019ve found our way, that we would\u2019ve found solutions to a problem,\" he told People. \"And most of all, that I would not have had a diagnosis that so strongly influenced my decisions and the direction I went.\""

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 23:14:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Biden administration officials said Wednesday they have no current plans to authorize a stockpiled bird flu vaccine, despite an escalating outbreak among livestock in the U.S. and at least 58 human infections across seven states.",
    "story": [
      "Biden administration officials said Wednesday they have no current plans to authorize a stockpiled bird flu vaccine, despite an escalating outbreak among livestock in the U.S. and at least 58 human infections across seven states.",
      "The move means any decisions about a bird flu vaccine will likely be left to health officials in the incoming Trump administration, who may be led by anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Trump has picked to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The virus has been spreading in dairy cows since the spring and had infected at least 774 herds in 16 states as of Wednesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last Friday, the Agriculture Department stepped up its response to the outbreak, issuing a federal order mandating testing of the national milk supply.",
      "The USDA said the testing, set to begin next week in six states, will give farmworkers better confidence in the safety of their animals and their ability to protect themselves from infection, as well as give officials a better sense of where herds are infected.",
      "The virus\u2019s spread in mammals that have close contact with humans is concerning for public health experts, because it gives the bird flu many opportunities to jump to people and potentially mutate to spread effectively from person to person.",
      "Almost all bird flu cases in the U.S. have been in farmworkers who have had contact with infected animals \u2014 either dairy cows or poultry \u2014 aside from a patient in Missouri and a child in California. A teen in Canada who got very sick and was hospitalized also had no clear contact with infected animals.",
      "The federal government has two bird flu vaccine candidates available in limited quantities in the nation\u2019s Strategic National Stockpile, though they need to be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration before they can be used.",
      "In May, health officials said the government would begin looking at vaccination if the virus mutated in ways that would make existing antivirals like Tamiflu less effective, or if it appeared it was causing serious illness in people.",
      "Dr. Nirav Shah, the CDC\u2019s principal deputy director, said Wednesday that the criteria for deploying a vaccine remains the same.",
      "\u201cWhen we think about respiratory vaccines, their sweet spot is really in preventing severe disease and death,\u201d Shah said. \u201cWhen we look at what is currently unfolding with H5, even in the human cases, thankfully what we\u2019ve seen thus far is mild disease,\u201d he said, using a shorthand for the strain of the influenza virus causing the bird flu outbreak.",
      "\u201cThat is not a guarantee, and that could change, but that is one of the things that we are on the lookout for because the vaccine would be maximally effective against reducing severity of disease,\u201d Shah said. While the administration isn\u2019t considering a vaccine today, that could change if the outbreak changes, he said.",
      "Still, some public health experts believe the time for vaccination is now, particularly for farmworkers.",
      "\u201cI do not think we should gamble with farmworkers\u2019 lives by waiting for them to be hospitalized or die before using the tools we have to protect them,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health.",
      "A balancing act",
      "Whether to authorize or deploy a vaccine is a constant balancing act for public health agencies, Shah said, noting that even the safest vaccine can come with side effects.",
      "In 1976, at the first signs of an H1N1 swine flu outbreak in the U.S., public health officials quickly initiated a nationwide vaccine campaign. The shot, however, caused a small increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare condition that causes the immune system to attack healthy nerve cells.",
      "The outbreak never spread widely, but it set public trust in the flu shot back decades.",
      "\u201cIt led to an analysis and introspection about whether the response to those 13 cases of swine flu had been an overreaction,\u201d Shah said. \u201cAnd, indeed, there was a high degree of vaccine skepticism that emerged.\u201d",
      "Still, the public health agencies are prepared to authorize a vaccine for bird flu if needed, Shah said, adding officials are consistently testing strains against the vaccine candidates.",
      "A spokesperson at the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, an agency within HHS that manages the Strategic National Stockpile, said the agency has worked to \u201cfill and finish\u201d vaccine doses of a candidate vaccine that\u2019s well-matched to the virus circulating in dairy cows.",
      "There will be up to 10 million doses available by the end of the first quarter of next year, enough to vaccinate 5 million people, the spokesperson said.",
      "A spokesperson for the FDA said the agency is \u201cactively engaged with federal partners in the U.S., as well as industry,\u201d including evaluating potential vaccine candidates, should the need arise for use in people.",
      "When is the right time?",
      "Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said there isn\u2019t a need to authorize a vaccine at this time, given the lack of evidence of human-to-human spread nor signs that the virus is causing severe disease in people. Existing tools, such as antivirals and personal protective equipment, are sufficient enough right now, he said.",
      "There are a higher number of cases, but Schaffner attributed that to public health officials looking harder for the virus through testing and surveillance.",
      "Schaffner said the incoming Trump administration\u2019s anti-vaccine rhetoric doesn\u2019t change his stance.",
      "\u201cI think we should be very careful about anticipating what the new administration will do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe administration will be getting a lot of good, solid scientific evidence, not only from people at the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration, but they will hear from industry and lots of public health officials and experts across the country.\u201d",
      "The Trump transition team didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Dr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, also said it\u2019s not necessary to authorize a vaccine at this time.",
      "\u201cWe need to keep advocating based on the science and data to make informed decisions, or do the best we can at the intersection of science, economics and political science,\u201d\u00a0Poulsen said.",
      "Nuzzo, of the Brown University School of Public Health, said that while antivirals are important for anyone exposed to or infected with the virus, their effectiveness is limited by a very small window of time in which they must be given.

      "Belichick, 72, coached the Patriots from 2000 to 2023. He won Super Bowls after the 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016 and 2018 seasons before he and New England mutually parted ways in January.",
      "Belichick is second on the NFL\u2019s all-time coaching wins list, with 333. He also won two Super Bowls as the New York Giants' defensive coordinator after the 1987 and 1990 seasons.",
      "\"I am excited for the opportunity at UNC-Chapel Hill,\" Belichick said in a statement. \"I grew up around college football with my Dad and treasured those times. I have always wanted to coach in college and now I look forward to building the football program in Chapel Hill.\"",
      "UNC athletic director Bubba Cunningham said the program is \"excited to welcome him to Chapel Hill.\"",
      "\"We know that college athletics is changing, and those changes require new and innovative thinking,\" he said in a statement. \"Bill Belichick is a football legend, and hiring him to lead our program represents a new approach that will ensure Carolina football can evolve, compete and win \u2014 today and in the future. At Carolina, we believe in providing championship opportunities and the best experience possible for our student-athletes, and Coach Belichick shares that commitment.\"",
      "The Tar Heels fired head coach Mack Brown on Nov. 26. Brown, who previously coached at North Carolina from 1988 to 1997, had led the team for the last six seasons. He had a 43-33 record during his second stint, winning one bowl game.",

      "The Giants hired Belichick as a special teams assistant in 1979 and promoted him to defensive coordinator in 1985. He won two championships under head coach Bill Parcells before he accepted the head coaching position with the Cleveland Browns in 1991.",
      "In four seasons with the Browns, Belichick was 36-44, making the playoffs only once. After he was fired in 1996, he reunited with Parcells, first as a defensive assistant with the Patriots in 1996, then as the New York Jets defensive coordinator from 1997 to 1999.",
      "Belichick originally agreed to become the Jets head coach in 2000 but surprised the team by resigning before what was supposed to be his introductory news conference. He instead left for New England, where he was given final say over player personnel in addition to his coaching duties.",
      "Though he oversaw six Super Bowl wins, Belichick\u2019s relationship with Patriots owner Robert Kraft reportedly grew strained in 2020. That year, Belichick decided the Patriots would part ways with quarterback Tom Brady, who started in all of New England\u2019s Super Bowl wins and is headed to the Hall of Fame as one of the greatest signal callers of all time.",
      "In his last four years as the Patriots head coach, all without Brady, Belichick posted a 29-38 record, making the playoffs only once.",
      "In January, Belichick interviewed for the head coaching position with the Atlanta Falcons, who hired Raheem Morris."

      "And even if the Mets, the White Sox and the Angels will never be the Yankees, the Cubs or the Dodgers, there are still plenty of wins and dollars to be had, Granderson said.",
      "\"When we were in the World Series [in 2015], there was a lot of blue and orange in the city. They are wearing it,\" said Granderson, who played four seasons for the Mets and four years for the Yankees. \"So there's always room to grow your own fan base.\""

    "title": "Trump plans to scrap policy restricting ICE arrests at churches, schools and hospitals",
    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 16:34:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The long-standing policy has prevented ICE agents from arresting immigrants at so-called \"sensitive locations\" except under certain circumstances.",
    "story": [
      "The incoming Trump administration intends to rescind a long-standing policy that has prevented Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from arresting undocumented people at\u00a0or near\u00a0so-called sensitive locations, including houses of worship, schools and hospitals or events such as funerals, weddings and public demonstrations without approval from supervisors, according to three sources familiar with the plan.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump plans to rescind the policy as soon as the first day he is in office, according to the sources \u2014 who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the change publicly.",
      "The move would be intended to boost ICE\u2019s authority to arrest migrants across the country, and its speed in doing so, as part of Trump\u2019s plan to carry out what he has said he wants to be the \u201clargest deportation operation in American history.\u201d",
      "The policy preventing agents from making arrests in sensitive locations without approval started in 2011 with a memo sent by then-ICE Director John Morton, and continued through the first Trump and Biden administrations. It was meant to allow undocumented people to operate freely in certain public areas with the idea that doing so will ultimately benefit not just them, but also the larger community. In 2021, the Biden administration issued its own guidance expanding the areas that \u201crequire special protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cImmigration enforcement has always required a balance. In the\u00a0past, Presidents of both parties have recognized that merely because it may be lawful to make arrests at hospitals and schools doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s humane or wise public policy,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want people with contagious diseases too scared to go to the hospital or children going uneducated because of poorly considered deportation policies.\u201d",
      "Under the policy, ICE agents have been allowed to go into the sensitive locations to make arrests under certain conditions including a national security or terror issue, the arrest of a felon considered dangerous, or if there was imminent risk of death or physical harm to a person or property or concern that evidence in a criminal investigation would be destroyed.",
      "Even when those circumstances existed, agents had to get approval from superiors in order to plan an arrest in a sensitive location. They could also go in to make an arrest in exigent circumstances when they felt immediate action was required, but needed to consult with superiors after the fact.",
      "During the first Trump administration, there were at least\u00a063\u00a0planned and five exigent ICE arrests at or near a sensitive location, according to ICE data covering the period from Oct. 1, 2017, through Oct. 31, 2020.",
      "The idea that Trump might allow ICE agents to make arrests anywhere, even inside schools and houses of worship, without the current limitations began circulating in Project 2025, a list of policy proposals distributed by the Heritage Foundation prior to the election.",
      "Some\u00a0church leaders say they have faced\u00a0harassment for\u00a0providing sanctuary space to migrants and\u00a0are already having conversations about the impacts of a policy change on sensitive locations.",
      "\u201cA lot of churches, faith communities are very concerned that there could be backlash,\u201d\u00a0said a deacon at a church in Arizona that has served as a sanctuary space for migrants in the past.\u00a0The church leader asked that NBC News not use the person's name because of safety concerns for the congregation.",
      "In January 2017, at the beginning of Trump\u2019s first term, then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly rewrote several policies of both ICE and Customs and Border Protection, but did not rescind the sensitive location rule.",
      "One former Department of Homeland Security official said changing the sensitive locations policy might be welcome news for some agents who have felt stymied by restrictions on where they can operate and\u00a0felt the policy was \u201cabused\u201d by wanted individuals in the past.",
      "\u201cI think maybe at the time, there was good reason for it,\u201d the former official said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary anymore.\u201d",
      "According to the former Homeland Security official, ICE agents already take an individual\u2019s circumstances into account when considering where to best carry out an enforcement action, and removing the policy only makes things \u201cless administratively burdensome.\u201d",
      "Though the change would have broader implications, it could mean an end to the\u00a0history of people\u00a0who have sought out deportation protection, sometimes for years, by living at sensitive locations such as churches. In 2019, there were a least 46 people staying in churches across 15 states, according to Church World Service, a faith-based organization that tracked the number of sanctuary seekers in America."

      "Trump said on Truth Social that Lake would be nominated by the next head of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, a pick he said he would announce \"soon.\"",
      "Trump said Lake would \"ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.\"",
      "VOA representatives did not immediately respond to questions about the processes for nominating and approving a new director, as well as what Trump's announcement could mean for the current director, Michael Abramowitz.",
      "Lake said on X she was \"honored\" by Trump's announcement.",
      "\"Under my leadership, the VOA will excel in its mission: chronicling America\u2019s achievements worldwide,\" she said. \"Thank you for putting your trust in me, President Trump. I look forward to leading the Voice of America, and I can\u2019t wait to get started.\"",
      "The VOA's stated mission is not to promote America's achievements; rather, its website says it is \"committed to providing comprehensive coverage of the news and telling audiences the truth.\"",
      "The VOA also emphasizes a \u201cfirewall\u201d that its website says \u201cprohibits interference by any U.S. government official in the objective, independent reporting of news, thereby safeguarding the ability of our journalists to develop content that reflects the highest professional standards of journalism, free of political interference.\u201d",
      "Lake worked as a news anchor in Arizona for more than 20 years at KSAZ, the Phoenix Fox affiliate. In the years since she parted ways with the news industry, she ran failed bids for both the Senate and governor of Arizona.",
      "On the campaign trail, Lake positioned herself as a staunch ally of Trump and a fierce critic of the industry she once belonged to. She taunted journalists as being \"fake news,\" saying at the Republican National Convention that they have \"worn out your welcome.\" She tried to discredit reporters, arguing that journalists have \"spent the last eight years lying about President Donald Trump,\" leaning into an unfounded right-wing claim.",
      "Lake has also embraced debunked election denialism about the 2020 election and touted false claims that the 2022 governor's race was stolen from her.",
      "The VOA has a broad international reach, with a global weekly audience of about 354 million people and programming in 49 languages, according to its website.",
      "Trump previously faced criticism for his 2020 appointment of Michael Pack to head the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Pack was accused of undermining the independence of the networks he oversaw.",
      "Trump posted about Lake alongside a handful of other administration announcements on Truth Social. He also said Wednesday night that he wants Leandro Rizzuto to be ambassador to the Organization of American States, Peter Lamelas to be ambassador to Argentina, Daniel J. Newlin to be ambassador to Colombia and Michael J. Rigas to be deputy secretary of state for management and resources."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 In legacy mode, outgoing President Joe Biden\u2019s White House is warning the Republicans who are about to take power against repealing his biggest achievements.",
      "\u201cRepealing President Biden\u2019s signature laws would be an historic redistribution of wealth from working Americans to Big Pharma and China,\u201d Andrew Bates, a senior White House spokesperson, writes in the subject line of a new memo being circulated to interested parties and allies, which was first obtained by NBC News.",
      "The memo makes an economic and political case against undoing Biden-era laws that President-elect Donald Trump and other Republicans have put on the chopping block in major party-line legislation that they\u2019re eyeing for next year, most notably the clean energy and health care provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\u201cDepriving the American people of these benefits would be a gut-punch to our economic growth,\u201d the memo says, and it \u201cwould provoke a tidal wave of opposition from the American people.\u201d",
      "It serves as a mix of messaging advice for Democrats and a preview of the fight to come next year as Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress seek to use the budget \u201creconciliation\u201d process to advance key parts of Trump\u2019s agenda along party lines.",
      "During the campaign, Trump said, \u201cWe will rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.\u201d",
      "Republicans won a 53-seat Senate majority and a slim House majority of 220-215 in the elections. Democrats don\u2019t have the votes to stop them from advancing a major bill to change spending and tax laws; all they can do is make it politically painful for the GOP to slash the programs Biden and Democrats passed along party lines in his term.",
      "To that end, the White House memo noted that the clean energy funding under the Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 the GOP\u2019s top target for repeal \u2014 includes benefits for many House Republicans' districts and said it has helped fuel \u201cAmerica\u2019s long-sought manufacturing resurgence.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat includes the creation of over 330,000 clean energy jobs \u2014 disproportionately in House districts represented by Republicans. Because of the Inflation Reduction Act, we\u2019ve already saved more than 3.4 million Americans $8.4 million on clean energy upgrades to their homes, and more than 300,000 Americans have saved over $2 billion upfront on [electric vehicle] purchases,\u201d Bates wrote. \u201cWe have also capped the price of insulin at $35, Medicare has already negotiated lower costs for 10 major drugs, and more Americans have health insurance than ever before.\u201d",
      "The memo said that significant grants for projects under the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as the CHIPS and Science Act, \u201chave been locked-in\u201d and that more will become available over the 10-year horizon.",
      "\u201cThese landmark achievements are so popular with the American people that Republican members of Congress who voted to prevent them are now being caught trying to take credit for their benefits, and even writing formal letters advocating against their repeal,\u201d Bates wrote.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., a Finance Committee member, said all unspent funds under the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as other Democratic-led programs, are fair game for cuts to find savings to pay for an extension of the Trump tax cuts and other provisions of the GOP's planned party-line legislation.",
      "Other Republicans say there are plenty of other places for the GOP to find cuts to finance their multitrillion-dollar effort.",
      "\u201cThe good thing is there\u2019s been so much waste and reckless spending over the last four years, it\u2019s going to be a target rich environment,\u201d said Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, which will play an important role in writing the GOP bills next year.",
      "Murphy said he also favors slashing Affordable Care Act subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act, which the Biden administration has used to limit insurance premiums for many in the middle class. The money will expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress renews it.",
      "\u201cACA subsidies to insurance companies \u2014 does nothing for health care,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of it needs to go away.\u201d",
      "Asked whether the slim margins could hinder House Republicans when it comes to passing the major party-line measures, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said it\u2019s a familiar dynamic for them.",
      "\u201cWhat else is new?\u201d he said."

    "summary": "The House passed a massive defense bill that includes a ban on gender-affirming care for children of servicemembers despite opposition from Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A massive defense policy bill that cleared the House on Wednesday includes a ban on gender-affirming care for children of service members \u2014 a provision that sparked opposition from the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee and many others in the party.",
      "The bill passed 281-140. Two hundred Republicans and 81 Democrats voted yes, while 124 Democrats and 16 Republicans voted no.",
      "The sweeping must-pass bill \u2014 known as the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA \u2014 authorizes spending for the Defense Department and sets defense policies before they expire at the end of the year. It now heads to the Democratic-controlled Senate and must be signed by President Joe Biden to become law.",
      "The bill was negotiated between senior House and Senate lawmakers. But Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the former Armed Services chairman who is now the panel\u2019s ranking member, said he would oppose passage of the NDAA because it includes the ban on gender-affirming care.",
      "\u201c[B]lanketly denying health care to people who need it \u2014 just because of a biased notion against transgender people \u2014 is wrong,\u201d Smith said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe inclusion of this harmful provision puts the lives of children at risk and may force thousands of service members to make the choice of continuing their military service or leaving to ensure their child can get the health care they need.\u201d",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had pushed publicly and behind the scenes to include the controversial provision in the package. In a statement after the vote, Johnson said the NDAA refocuses \"the Pentagon on military lethality, not radical woke ideology. This legislation permanently bans transgender treatment for minors, prohibits critical race theory in military academies, ends the DEI bureaucracy, and combats antisemitism.\u201d",
      "Smith accused Johnson in his statement of fighting for the ban to appease conservatives in his conference ahead of the Jan. 3 vote to keep him as speaker for two more years.",
      "\"Rather than take that [bipartisan] path and ensure service members and military families get the support they need and deserve, he chose to pander to the most extreme elements of his party in an attempt to retain his speakership,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Congress typically passes the NDAA with big, bipartisan votes. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters before the vote that his team was not whipping or urging rank-and-file Democratic members to vote one way or the other. And his leadership team split over the issue: Jeffries, along with Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., and Vice Chair Ted Lieu, D-Calif., voted for the defense bill, while Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., and Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse, D-Colo., voted no.",
      "The provision in question, which specifically applies to Tricare, the military\u2019s health care program, would prohibit \u201cmedical treatment for military dependents under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria.\u201d",
      "Republicans believe their attacks on transgender rights during the 2024 campaign helped propel them to victory. And they\u2019re now doubling down on that strategy. After the election, Johnson issued a new policy barring transgender women from using women\u2019s bathrooms in the House \u2014 directly targeting Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, D-Del., the first openly transgender person elected to Congress.",
      "Johnson also played a role in the fight over a provision that would have expanded Tricare coverage to include in vitro fertilization treatment. He \u201cmade dropping it a red line demand during negotiations,\u201d according to a Senate aide familiar with the talks.",
      "But the speaker's office said the disagreement was more nuanced. Both the House and the Senate Armed Services committees had passed separate NDAAs that included provisions to make it easier for military families to access IVF treatment. However, House and Senate negotiators couldn't agree on \"sufficient pro-life protections,\" the speaker's office said.",
      "\"The Speaker remains pro-IVF and has encouraged states to take up the issue responsibly and ethically,\" a Johnson spokesman said.",
      "Despite representing a broad constituency of military families in San Diego, Rep. Sara Jacobs was among the Democrats who voted against the NDAA.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, because Speaker Johnson added these poison pills, I am forced to vote against a bill that I would otherwise happily have supported,\u201d Jacobs told NBC News, referring to the ban on gender-affirming care.",
      "Jacobs said the policy would affect \u201cthousands\u201d of families. \u201cI get lots of phone calls from service members. ... They care about the fact that they can\u2019t find child care, that their housing is inadequate, that they\u2019re having to go to the food bank,\u201d she said.",
      "No calls, she said, are about culture war issues, like \u201cwhether they\u2019re going to drag shows.\u201d",
      "Jacobs, a progressive Democrat and member of leadership, also worked across the chamber, and across the aisle, to insert language in the package that would have expanded coverage of fertility treatments, including IVF, to service members.",
      "Johnson stripped the provision out of the bill, Jacobs said, because \u201cthere were some people in his caucus who were uncomfortable with it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe military is having a recruitment and retention problem,\" she continued. \"And the idea that we would not be giving them [access to IVF] that is going to be a standard across the federal workforce, to me, makes no sense.\u201d"

      "The board, where Democrats have a 3-2 edge, could now move to certify the victory by Democrat Allison Riggs, eliminating a major hurdle for the party in the contested race.",
      "NBC News has not yet projected a winner in the race.",
      "Riggs, who was appointed to the state Supreme Court in 2023, emerged from Election Day with a narrow lead over Republican Jefferson Griffin, a state appeals court judge, triggering two recounts.",
      "A full machine recount showed Riggs leading Griffin by 734 votes. A second, partial hand recount of the race increased Riggs\u2019 lead marginally, but that total is not considered official by North Carolina's elections board. More than 5.5 million ballots were cast in the race.",
      "Following Election Day, Griffin\u2019s team filed hundreds of legal challenges across all of North Carolina\u2019s 100 counties, alleging that nearly 60,000 people voted illegally. Many of the allegations centered around people who Griffin\u2019s lawyers claimed didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license number or Social Security number on file in their voter registration records.",
      "\u201cThese voters were not eligible to cast a ballot without first lawfully registering,\u201d attorneys for Griffin\u2019s campaign wrote in the first brief to North Carolina's election board.",
      "The protests from Griffin pertained to votes that fall into three categories.",
      "The vast majority of the votes in question are ones that were cast by voters whose registration records lack required information, Republicans claimed.",
      "At the center of that category is the fact that voter registration applications approved by legislators 20 years ago were intended to require people to note their driver\u2019s license or Social Security numbers. The form, however, didn\u2019t include that requirement, and in subsequent years, tens of thousands of voters didn\u2019t include them on it. In addition, some voters likely registered before the 2004 law was passed.",
      "The other two categories of votes Republicans contested related to overseas voters.",
      "The Board of Elections held consecutive votes on all three categories Wednesday. The first vote, on the matter regarding driver's license and Social Security numbers, and the second vote on a matter related to overseas voters who haven\u2019t lived in North Carolina, came along party lines. A third vote on an issue related specifically to overseas voters who failed to provide photo identification with their ballots, was rejected unanimously.",
      "Griffin or the North Carolina Republican Party could appeal the decision, which would insert the case into the state court system. If that occurs, the case could eventually make its way to the state Supreme Court.",
      "In a statement, North Carolina GOP Chairman Jason Simmons criticized the ruling and said the party would \"review the board\u2019s decision and reserve the right to any future actions to protect the integrity of our elections.\"",
      "The North Carolina Democratic Party filed a suit in federal court on Friday seeking to ensure all ballots in the race were counted. The suit, which effectively sought to preempt a potential elections board ruling against Riggs, pointed out that the federal law does not allow states to toss out ballots because voter registration papers are missing a driver\u2019s license number or a Social Security number.",
      "Ahead of the election, Republicans had filed a suit seeking to remove 225,000 voters from the rolls who had the same information missing in their registration records. The case, filed in a federal court, was dismissed.",
      "Republicans currently have a 5-2 majority on the state Supreme Court. A Riggs victory would maintain that.",
      "Joining in the challenge to the North Carolina elections board board was the Republican candidate in a close state House race that will determine whether the GOP maintains its supermajority in the chamber.",
      "Democrat Bryan Cohn leads Republican state Rep. Frank Sossamon  by fewer than 300 votes, but The Associated Press hasn't projected a winner in the race. A Cohn victory would officially end the GOP's supermajority in the state House, and the power to override the governor's veto that comes with it.",
      "Wednesday's hearing came as another pivotal issue was being considered by the Republican-controlled Legislature.",
      "Democrats currently control the North Carolina board of elections. Under current law, the governor gets to appoint all five members: Three from the governor\u2019s party and two from the opposition party.",
      "But later Wednesday, Republican lawmakers passed a bill that, among other things, strips the governor of that power, after they overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper."

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump announced that he wants ally Kari Lake to serve as the next director of the Voice of America, a federal network that's part of the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he wants ally Kari Lake to be the next director of the Voice of America, a federal network that's part of the U.S. Agency for Global Media.",
      "Trump said on Truth Social that Lake would be nominated by the next head of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, a pick he said he would announce \"soon.\"",
      "Trump said Lake would \"ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.\"",
      "VOA representatives did not immediately respond to questions about the processes for nominating and approving a new director, as well as what Trump's announcement could mean for the current director, Michael Abramowitz.",
      "Lake said on X she was \"honored\" by Trump's announcement.",
      "\"Under my leadership, the VOA will excel in its mission: chronicling America\u2019s achievements worldwide,\" she said. \"Thank you for putting your trust in me, President Trump. I look forward to leading the Voice of America, and I can\u2019t wait to get started.\"",
      "The VOA's stated mission is not to promote America's achievements; rather, its website says it is \"committed to providing comprehensive coverage of the news and telling audiences the truth.\"",
      "The VOA also emphasizes a \u201cfirewall\u201d that its website says \u201cprohibits interference by any U.S. government official in the objective, independent reporting of news, thereby safeguarding the ability of our journalists to develop content that reflects the highest professional standards of journalism, free of political interference.\u201d",
      "Lake worked as a news anchor in Arizona for more than 20 years at KSAZ, the Phoenix Fox affiliate. In the years since she parted ways with the news industry, she ran failed bids for both the Senate and governor of Arizona.",
      "On the campaign trail, Lake positioned herself as a staunch ally of Trump and a fierce critic of the industry she once belonged to. She taunted journalists as being \"fake news,\" saying at the Republican National Convention that they have \"worn out your welcome.\" She tried to discredit reporters, arguing that journalists have \"spent the last eight years lying about President Donald Trump,\" leaning into an unfounded right-wing claim.",
      "Lake has also embraced debunked election denialism about the 2020 election and touted false claims that the 2022 governor's race was stolen from her.",
      "The VOA has a broad international reach, with a global weekly audience of about 354 million people and programming in 49 languages, according to its website.",
      "Trump previously faced criticism for his 2020 appointment of Michael Pack to head the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Pack was accused of undermining the independence of the networks he oversaw.",
      "Trump posted about Lake alongside a handful of other administration announcements on Truth Social. He also said Wednesday night that he wants Leandro Rizzuto to be ambassador to the Organization of American States, Peter Lamelas to be ambassador to Argentina, Daniel J. Newlin to be ambassador to Colombia and Michael J. Rigas to be deputy secretary of state for management and resources."

Naturally, we kind of look a little more introspectively into ourselves and analyze where we\u2019re at, and what we love about our life and our surroundings, and then what we want to kind of evolve into.",
      "What was it like to work with an all-woman team for this record?",
      "I was lucky enough to work with only women on this record \u2014 four of them, Jessie Jo Dillon, Karen Fairchild, Hillary Lindsey, and Alysa Vanderheym. And the reason that came to be \u2014 it was not this pre-calculated idea. I honestly knew that to start writing a record, I needed to feel safe, and so I called my friends, who just happened to be incredible pillars in music. We went away to a retreat outside of St. Louis, and it was just womanhood with some wine. A lot of music came out of it, and that is \u201cPatterns.\u201d",
      "Do you have a message for your fellow \u201cVoice\u201d coaches?",
      "You know, it\u2019s such a love fest this season. There\u2019s so much love and respect, especially amongst the coaches. But don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t want to win! Listen, I know that I\u2019m the girl. I know that I\u2019m new. I know you guys have like, 85 years on me. That\u2019s the vibe.",
      "What\u2019s another creative avenue you want to explore in the future?",
      "I really do love cooking. I want to get better at it because I\u2019m Italian. So, I really gotta dig my heels into the pasta realm. I want to host. That\u2019s my thing. When my friends come over, I\u2019m always just like, \u201cWhat do you want to eat, to drink? Like, what do you need? Sweatpants? What can I get you?\u201d I think that\u2019s part of my love language.",
      "What was it like working with boyfriend Chase Stokes for the \u201cFirst Rodeo\u201d music video?",
      "\u201cFirst Rodeo\u201d is the first love song that I wrote for \u201cPatterns,\u201d and I couldn\u2019t put a visual out into the world and not have his essence in it. I mean, the song is about him, and that moment of kind of surrendering to the idea of falling in love again. And it\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s like this delicate balance, where we love being able to share our relationship, but also we want to protect it at the same time. So I\u2019m really proud of how we were able to just gently put \u201cus\u201d into the video together. But still, you know, we don\u2019t want to exploit it \u2014 our relationship. I just wanted his heart in it.",
      "What is your best advice on how to successfully slide into someone\u2019s DMs?",
      "Am I known for this now? Am I a DM slider?",
      "You just have to shoot your shot, because I think the worst thing that can happen is it doesn\u2019t work out, and that means it\u2019s not meant to be. But you\u2019re coming from a place of empowerment. No harm, no foul. Shoot your shot. Send the DM, send the text.",
      "Not to your ex, though. Get off your phone. Put it down.",
      "How are you preparing for your sold-out performance at Madison Square Garden?",
      "With a lot of rehearsals. It\u2019s a whole new record. It\u2019s a whole new show. I mean, our production is the biggest I\u2019ve ever gotten to have as a headliner. And we\u2019ve just gotten into town in New York from rehearsals. So, I think I just want to be present. I want to give this record a life for the first time, and to do it on that stage at MSG, which I\u2019ve never played before ... I mean, it\u2019s one for the books. For me, I\u2019ll remember it for the rest of my life.",
      "What can your fans expect from your upcoming tour?",
      "We have a hydraulic lift. We have some movement. We have a little pyro. Mostly it\u2019s a show that I wanted to feel very all-encompassing. It\u2019s very visual-heavy, and I just want people to feel like you\u2019re stepping into a different world for an hour and a half. Whether you\u2019re more connected to yourself, or the person that you\u2019re with, or us on stage, I just want you to feel connected. And so we\u2019ve really tried to curate the whole night to feel like that.",
      "If you could form a super group with two other country artists, who would you choose?",
      "I would pick Carly Pearce, because we\u2019re just real life friends. I love her so much. And I would pick Shania (Twain), because I think we both just love her. We would let her sing the whole time, and we\u2019d just hold down the background vocals.",
      "Rapid fire round:",
      "Visual, emotional and fun.",
      "An oat milk latte with one pump of pumpkin spice. Just one \u2014 just enough just to get a whiff of fall.",
      "My favorite karaoke song to perform is Kelly Clarkson's \"Since You\u2019ve Been Gone,\" because no one can really sing that, except for Kelly Clarkson.",
      "What\u2019s not Virgo about me? I love a plan. I\u2019m a control freak. I\u2019m very tidy in the way that I operate in a career space. But if you saw my bathroom or my closet, that\u2019s not very Virgo of me. It\u2019s just open suitcases, clothes everywhere. But my boyfriend is also a Virgo, and he\u2019s the same way. So I wonder how that works. I should talk to an astrologist about that.",
      "The last show I watched and loved was \u201cNobody Wants This\u201d on Netflix. I already die for Kristen Bell, but I just feel like the way that that show was written and represented, like a modern relationship, was just so yummy. I\u2019m such a fan."

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:46:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Golden Bachelor Gerry Turner says that he has cancer and it led to his breakup from Theresa Nist. Here's what happened.",
    "story": [
      "Gerry Turner is sharing a sobering update on his health.",
      "The \"Golden Bachelor\" star revealed that he has an incurable form of bone marrow cancer called Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and said the diagnosis played a part in his breakup with Theresa Nist, whom he married on live TV in January 2024.",
      "Turner, 72, shared the news in an interview with People.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s no cure for it. So that weighs heavily in every decision I make,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like 10 tons of concrete were just dropped on me. And I was a bit in denial for a while, I didn\u2019t want to admit to it.\u201d",
      "Per the Mayo Clinic, Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia is a form of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma that originates in the white blood cells, transforming some of them into cancer cells that build up in bone marrow. The Mayo Clinic said this type of cancer grows slowly and \"may not cause symptoms for years.\"",
      "At first hesitant to speak about the cancer, Turner said he felt compelled to after getting involved with charities. He also thought going public with his diagnosis might \"clear up a lot of mystery\" surrounding his split from Nist in the spring of 2024.",
      "After getting engaged on the ABC dating series \u201cThe Golden Bachelor,\u201d the couple tied the knot in a live televised ceremony in January 2024. Three months later, in April, Turner filed for divorce.",
      "During an interview on ABC at the time, Turner said the decision came out of a \"number of heart-to-heart conversations\" about \"our situation, our living situation, so forth.\" Together, he said they decided \"it's probably time for us to \u2014 dissolve our marriage.\"",
      "Turner gave further context to the decision in his People interview.",
      "\u201cAs Theresa and I were trying very hard to find our lifestyle and where we were going to live and how we were going to make our life work, I was unfortunately diagnosed with cancer,\u201d Turner told People.",
      "The father of two first started the journey to being diagnosed when he went to an orthopedic surgeon to address an old shoulder injury. After the doctor pointed out \"some unusual blood markers,\" Turner started the process of seeking answers, which led him to an oncologist.",
      "Initially, oncologists suspected that the reality star had a \"blood disorder.\" Following several rounds of testing, including a bone marrow biopsy, Turner got an official diagnosis and shared the news with his new wife.",
      "\u201cCertainly, it was hard for me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the conversation was brief and I think (she was) a little bit awestruck by the news. So understandable.\u201d",
      "At the time, Turner and Nist \u2014 who live in Indiana and New Jersey, respectively \u2014 were in the process of figuring out where they would settle down.",
      "Turner decided that uprooting his life after his diagnosis wasn't the best route.",
      "\u201cI wanted my life to continue on as normal as possible, and that led me to believing that as normal as possible more meant spending time with my family, my two daughters, my two son-in-laws, my granddaughters,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the importance of finding the way with Theresa was still there, but it became less of a priority.\u201d",
      "After the couple announced their divorce, speculation ran rampant about what led to their breakup.",
      "Now that he's sharing his diagnosis, Turner hopes that the public will \u201clook at things a little bit differently.\"",
      "\u201cWhen you are hit with that kind of news and the shock wears off after a few days or a few weeks and you regroup and you realize what\u2019s important to you, that\u2019s where you start to move forward,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd I hope that people understand in retrospect now that that had a huge bearing on my decisions and I think probably Theresa\u2019s as well.\u201d",
      "Turner wishes nothing but \"all of the good luck in the world\" for Nist, calling their journey together a \"cherished memory.\"",
      "\u201cIt was wonderful, and I certainly wish it would\u2019ve had a different ending, that we would\u2019ve found our way, that we would\u2019ve found solutions to a problem. And most of all, that I would not have had a diagnosis that so strongly influenced my decisions and the direction I went,\" he said.",
      "Nist, on her end, shared a different story with the publication. Nist said she was \"extremely upset\" after finding out about the cancer. But from her experience, Turner's cancer \"wasn't a factor\" in ending the relationship \u2014 \"at least not for me,\" she said.",
      "\u201cIf that was something on his part, maybe, I don\u2019t know. But no, that didn\u2019t factor into ending the relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cPart of it was the distance, but that wasn\u2019t the only part. That\u2019s really all I will say.\u201d",
      "This follows a cryptic remark in a November 2024 interview on the podcast \u201cAlmost Famous.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou really can\u2019t know somebody in four weeks. I\u2019ll just say that,\u201d she said, and added \u201cnot just the location thing\u201d led to their divorce.",
      "Nist told People she wishes her ex-husband the best. \u201cI wish him the best and that I know that he was in a very difficult situation and that good things will come to him,\u201d she said."

    "title": "How \u2018Feliz Navidad\u2019 became such a hit \u2014 and my favorite Christmas song",
    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 18:58:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The hit Christmas song by Jos\u00e9 Feliciano was born out of loneliness. Learn the 'Feliz Navidad' lyrics in English and Spanish, and the song's history.",
    "story": [
      "I stared out the car window as my mom drove our Dodge Dart through the desert night. I was 10 years old, and my family was on a trip from Los Angeles to El Paso, Texas, to visit my grandpa for the holidays. Beside my mom, Aunt Emma was asleep in the front seat, and so were my brothers next to me in the back. Then the AM radio crackled. \u201cFeliz Navidad,\u201d a man sang. \u201cI wanna wish you a merry Christmas, from the bottom of my heart!\u201d",
      "My mother hummed along with the melody. That song seemed like a beacon, the sound of people like us coming over the airwaves. We were in an old car on a dark road in the middle of nowhere. But with my family so close, and \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d on the radio, it felt like the safest place in the world.",
      "As a kid in the 1970s, I assumed that the voice behind \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d was Mexican American like me. In fact, singer Jos\u00e9 Feliciano was born in 1945 in Puerto Rico. He wrote \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d in 10 minutes and recorded it in one take, he once told The New Yorker. The novelty song that has become a holiday staple was released in 1970, when Richard Nixon was president, the Vietnam War was raging, and Hispanic Heritage Month didn\u2019t exist yet.",
      "For Feliciano, \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d represented a comeback. After coming to prominence with his rendition of \u201cLight My Fire\u201d in 1968, he performed an unconventional version of the national anthem at the World Series. This generated a backlash that nearly derailed his career. Luckily, two years later Feliciano charmed his way back into the public eye with \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d",
      "Although I grew up in an assimilated household, where my family spoke English at home, it was still special to hear Feliciano\u2019s bilingual song every year. Before Latinos were a regular presence on TV and radio, we would hear him and feel like, in a sense, he was us.",
      "I was in sixth grade the year that my older brother got a movie camera for Christmas. His present sparked a performance in our living room by my Aunt Lela, the free spirit of the family. Wearing a cape fashioned from wrapping paper, she belted out her own version of \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is my first live Christmas special!\u201d she exclaimed. My cousins and I clapped along as the adults rolled their eyes. \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d was perfect for my aunt \u2014 and for everyone \u2014 because anybody can sing it.",
      "The genius of \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d is its simplicity. It has only 19 words, 13 in English and six in Spanish. (The English: I wanna wish you a merry Christmas/ From the bottom of my heart. The Spanish: Feliz Navidad/ Pr\u00f3spero a\u00f1o y felicidad. Translated, it means merry Christmas and happy new year.) Feliciano repeats them for three minutes, long enough to craft a bouncy earworm. If you listen closely, you can hear the strings of the cuatro, an instrument derived from the guitar that often accompanies Christmas carols in Puerto Rico.",
      "Like \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d by Mariah Carey, \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d has become one of the best-known holiday songs of all time. It has been covered by artists including Luciano Pavarotti, Celine Dion and Latin superstar Thalia. For many Latinos, it is not officially the Christmas season until we\u2019ve heard this song.",
      "Ironically, Feliciano has stated in interviews that this song was born of loneliness. He was in an L.A. studio over the holidays, missing his family, when he wrote and recorded it.",
      "I learned what it was like to feel melancholy at Christmas in 2020, during the pandemic. Instead of spending the holidays in California with my family, I stayed home in New York City. I took solo walks in Central Park and stared out the window a lot. One day, I was so lonely that I went and sat at the bus stop even though I wasn\u2019t even waiting for a bus.",
      "In the evenings, when I listened to streaming radio, there was \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d It was only then that I detected a yearning in Feliciano\u2019s voice. That year, the song struck me as bittersweet; it made me miss my relatives more, while simultaneously reminding me of happier times.",
      "It\u2019s now been over five decades since Feliciano released \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d Yet he will always be the original crossover artist who brought Latin sounds into the mainstream, and his most famous song remains the only Spanish-language Christmas classic in the U.S.",
      "These days, when I hear \u201cFeliz Navidad,\u201d it can call up all kinds of emotions. I think of my mom humming to herself, back when a long car trip was a big adventure. I remember my childhood Christmases with my cousins, aunts and my grandpa. I reflect on how amazing it is that this snappy tune has been an annual presence in my life for nearly as long as I\u2019ve been alive. And sometimes, I don\u2019t think about any of these things. I just sing along."

      "\u201cCallas has always been a fascinating character,\u201d Marc A. Scorca, CEO and president of advocacy group Opera America, tells TODAY. \u201cYou could write an opera about her \u2014 about someone who made an indelible impression in her 20s and 30s, and by the time she was 40 was finished as a singer.

    "story": [
      "Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark has helped take the WNBA to a whole new level of popularity, but she has made sure to remind people that much of the foundation of the league was built by Black stars.",
      "Clark, who was named Time's 2024 Athlete of the Year on Dec. 10, reflected in the publication's story on her achievement about how she views her place in the league's lineage of talent.",
      "\u201cI want to say I\u2019ve earned every single thing, but as a white person, there is privilege,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of those players in the league that have been really good have been Black players. This league has kind of been built on them.\"",
      "\"The more we can appreciate that, highlight that, talk about that, and then continue to have brands and companies invest in those players that have made this league incredible, I think it\u2019s very important,\" she continued. \"I have to continue to try to change that. The more we can elevate Black women, that\u2019s going to be a beautiful thing.\u201d",
      "Clark's comments refer to her white privilege, defined as the inherent and unearned advantages and benefits white people have over non-white people. According to Learning for Justice, white privilege \"exists because of historic, enduring racism and biases.\"",
      "The issue of race often came up during Clark's Rookie of the Year campaign this past season, whether it was her reported rivalry with Chicago Sky star Angel Reese, taking flagrant fouls on the court or her immediate popularity compared to some of the league's established Black stars.",
      "Las Vegas Aces star A'ja Wilson, a three-time WNBA MVP, spoke to Marie Claire magazine in May about the effect Clark's arrival has had on other players.",
      "\u201cI felt like I was mentally tired in that whole whirlwind of people constantly saying, \u2018A\u2019ja you\u2019re only known because of Caitlin; we\u2019re only here because of Caitlin,\u2019\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s great, I get that, but while you\u2019re here I\u2019m not going to let you discredit me or the work that I\u2019ve done, or my teammates or the people who came before have done.\u201d",
      "Wilson also told The Associated Press that she believes Clark's race is \"a huge thing\" when it comes to her popularity.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of people may say it\u2019s not about Black and white, but to me, it is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really is because you can be top notch at what you are as a Black woman, but yet maybe that\u2019s something that people don\u2019t want to see.\"",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t see it as marketable, so it doesn\u2019t matter how hard I work. It doesn\u2019t matter what we all do as Black women, we\u2019re still going to be swept underneath the rug. That\u2019s why it boils my blood when people say it\u2019s not about race because it is.\u201d",
      "Black players like Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie, Candace Parker, Cynthia Cooper and Maya Moore helped establish the WNBA as a top women's basketball league in the world. The WNBA has also had white stars before Clark, from Sue Bird to Breanna Stewart.",
      "Clark didn't believe any hard fouls against her by Black players had anything to do with her popularity.",
      "\u201cI never thought I was being targeted,\u201d she told Time. \u201cObviously, that shouldn\u2019t ever happen within a game. But basketball is physical. Your emotions can get the best of you. My emotions have gotten the best of me many times.\u201d",
      "She also tries not to give oxygen to those looking to make any confrontations or rivalries on the court about race.",
      "\"A lot of people that wanted to have opinions on what was happening probably didn\u2019t even watch half the games that they were trying to have a take on and hadn\u2019t supported the W for a really long time,\u201d she said."

      "I feel more free, but not because I had felt stuck before, just kind of more able. (When I was with Kody) I was able to do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. Nothing was holding me down, even prior to us terminating our marriage. But it\u2019s in a different way now, and it\u2019s just lighter and freer.",
      "Stereotypically, when a wife leaves polygamy, it\u2019s because she was stuck and she was forced to stay there. I didn\u2019t feel like that because at that time, I wanted to make my marriage work because I had committed to it.",
      "No. Flagstaff was not a place that was ever on my radar to even move to. When the family brought it up I was like, \u201cOh, there\u2019s a place called Flagstaff, Arizona. OK. We\u2019ll go with it.\u201d",

I\u2019m finally the favorite of something.\u201d I guess now that he\u2019s not a polygamist, he can say he has a favorite.",

I say it that way because I do feel like there is the Janelle and Christine club and the Kody and Robyn club and I\u2019m not in any of them and I don\u2019t want to be. I don\u2019t say that in any derogatory way at all. It\u2019s just the way it is and I don\u2019t see any benefit of talking trash about any of them and what they\u2019re doing.",

      "The reason why I wanted to stay the whole time was because I had made a marriage commitment that I was committed to. Some might say now that I was never loyal, but obviously I was \u2014 I\u2019m just saying \u2014 because I stuck with it and I wanted to work through it and figure it out. That\u2019s where my commitment level was.",
      "Conversations that he was finally willing to have with me. I know that he just was not having the conversations with me because he didn\u2019t want to deal with it. It was easier to set it aside.",
      "When we really started having conversations and he was actually honest with me to my face, which I deserve, (things shifted). There are a lot of people who are like, \u201cWhy\u2019d you stay so long? He was saying it to the world forever.\u201d It\u2019s like, yeah, he was, but I deserved to hear it. Maybe it was just a little bit of, \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with me until you say it to my face.\u201d",
      "I don\u2019t have any regrets of how it played out because there was so much that I learned about myself in the process that I\u2019m glad about.",
      "I\u2019m confident in my decision of when we decided to split because there\u2019s no question on either of our parts. He might have been there sooner and I didn\u2019t know about it. But for me, I was able to learn a lot about myself. There\u2019s no point in having regrets because you wouldn\u2019t be the person that you are had you not gone through the experiences that you did."

Pretty quickly I learned that, OK, FGL, the season of being in a band and a duo is coming to an end,\" he said. \"I guess God has something different for me, so I tried to embrace it. But it was the year that we were all kind of just figuring out life at the time. What\u2019s happening? Will I ever even play shows again?\"",

      "\"But once I dove off into it, I\u2019m like, man, this is actually what made me fall in love with this the first time and it's doing it again,\" he continued. \"And so it\u2019s just the excitement of the build and the challenge.

      "He added, \u201cThe book is this collection of 10 different families that I met. They\u2019ve been in the same home forever, and it turned into this really beautiful love letter to home and the idea of how we see home.\u00a0And it\u2019s definitely shifted the way I create, the way that I look at things, the way that I pull things in my own home.\u201d",

I\u2019m not going to say anything,\u201d she told TODAY. \u201cBut it\u2019s a story that\u2019s been brewing in the back of my mind for a long time. ... I think it\u2019s going to be a very emotional book for me to write just in terms of the world I\u2019ll be writing and the characters that might pop up.\u201d",
      "What could Sarah J. Maas\u2019 next books be about?",
      "While the synopsis of the next \u201cACOTAR\u201d book is not public knowledge yet, readers could guess: The first four books followed the adventures of heroine Feyre Archeron and her love story with Rhysand, while the latest book, \u201cA Court of Silver Flames,\u201d followed Feyre\u2019s sister Nesta and her romance with Rhysand\u2019s friend Cassian. There\u2019s a third Archeron sister, Elain, as well as another in Rhysand\u2019s trio of friends, Azriel, whose stories are left to tell.\u00a0(And Maas did say she plans to explore Azriel more.)",
      "The fated \u201cmates\u201d trope \u2014 where two characters are destined to be together \u2014 is also a big part of SJM\u2019s writing. Those who read the \u201cACOTAR\u201d books know Elain has a mate and Azriel hasn\u2019t yet found his. There\u2019s a bonus chapter for \u201cA Court of Silver Flames\u201d where readers get a peek at Azriel\u2019s point of view, and he seems to be drawn to Elain ... and another character named Gwyn.",
      "So there\u2019s a lot to work with here \u2014 and her characters often have several love interests. Without providing specifics, Maas told TODAY the idea of one\u2019s agency in their love life is \u201cvery interesting\u201d to her.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to explore within the concept of mates and your agency about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say if I am exploring it in future books or not. But it definitely offers a wealth of things to explore with this concept of free will and what is true love. Is it something that\u2019s destined? Or is it something that you make? Is it both?\u201d",
      "There are also plenty of questions about \u201cThrone of Glass.\u201d The last book in that series, \u201cKingdom of Ash,\u201d came out in 2018. But in a 2022 interview, Maas mused about those books continuing.",
      "\u201c\u2018Throne of Glass\u2019 is technically ended, but ... is it?\u201d she had said in 2022. \u201cI\u2019ve said before, there are other stories in that world that I want to tell at some point.\u201d",
      "Those who read \u201cHouse of Sky and Breath,\u201d the second \u201cCrescent City\u201d book published in 2022, know that Maas created a crossover between two of her book series, when the \u201cCrescent City\u201d heroine, Bryce, falls into the \u201cACOTAR\u201d world in a shocking, cliff-hanger ending. This left fans wondering: Could \u201cThrone of Glass\u201d be involved in all this, too?",
      "Maas told TODAY.com \u201cthe gates between worlds could open again, possibly to other places.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not committing to anything,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I love the idea of being able to play in all three worlds.\u201d"

      "\u201cMy alopecia was hard to navigate during my early cheering days,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt was such a tumultuous time that I was only able to give about 50 percent of my effort. Some people\u00a0picked up on the fact that I was more withdrawn and not my bubbly self, and having teammates that I could sit and cry with about what I was going through was healing.\u201d",
      "She also wrote that she became interested at the beginning of this NFL season in the possibility of cheering without a wig, eventually deciding to do so during the team\u2019s My Cause My Boots \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d game on Dec. 9 against the Cincinnati Bengals.",
      "\u201cAt first, I was a bit scared to commit to it because doing a photoshoot or taking a video of yourself and posting it on social media is not in real time,\u201d she wrote.",
      "\u201cKnowing that the game would be live in front of over 80 thousand people and I may end up on TV is a bit intimidating. But I\u2019m reminding myself that I\u2019ll be out there dancing with my best friends, and my family will be there as well. I know that it\u2019ll be an impactful moment for whoever it touches.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 16:45:39 GMT",
    "summary": "A Salafist flag behind Syria\u2019s new interim Prime Minister Mohammad al-Bashir has concerned those hoping for a future of moderation and tolerance.",
    "story": [
      "When Syria\u2019s new interim prime minister, Mohammad al-Bashir, chaired a Cabinet meeting in Damascus on Tuesday, hanging behind him was the flag of the country\u2019s suddenly victorious opposition.",
      "Next to it, however, was a second banner popular with the region\u2019s Sunni Islamist fighters, featuring the large Arabic letters of the Shahada, an Islamic declaration of faith.",
      "As a new Syria fast emerges from the ruins of the Assad regime, the world is watching for hints of what that might look like \u2014 and that second flag has concerned those hoping for a future of moderation and tolerance.",
      "That path will largely depend on Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel organization that led the charge into Damascus and is now stewarding Syria\u2019s political overhaul.",
      "HTS is banned as a terrorist organization in the United States and elsewhere and grew out of a branch of\u00a0 Al Qaeda. Its leader, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, said a decade ago that there would be no room for religious minorities in the Islamist Syria of which he dreamed about. He also suggested that he could bring terrorism to the West unless it withdrew from the Middle East\u2019s wars.",
      "More recently, however, Jolani, who now uses his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa, has undergone something of a rebrand, trimming his beard, donning Westernized green fatigues and espousing tolerance for all of Syria\u2019s myriad faiths. Nevertheless plenty of observers are reserving judgment until these words become actions.",
      "\u201cI think we should be very cautious of him,\u201d said Bilal Sukkar, a Syrian-born senior associate with the London-based intelligence consultancy S-RM. That trepidation goes for \u201cnot only respecting the rights of people belonging to other religious and sectarian groups,\u201d he said, \u201cbut actually looking at them as equal citizens.\u201d",
      "Seeing Syria\u2019s corridors of power welcome a flag \u201cindicating Islamist-Salafist leanings\u201d has \u201cput people on alert,\u201d Sukkar said. Although he does not think deploying the emblem was a \u201cwise\u201d move, he sees it as more reflective of the rebels\u2019 origins in Idlib rather than anything else.",
      "Such demographic accommodations are a huge deal in Syria, which is \u201chome to a vast diversity of religious and ethnic groups,\u201d according to the Harvard Divinity School. Some 74% of the population are Sunni Muslims, another 13% belong to other sects, such as Shia and Alawite, and 10% are Christian.",
      "The classic worry among Western foreign policy watchers was that Assad might be toppled but replaced by something that is not much better: an extremist terror group.",
      "Assad\u2019s regime was, rightly or wrongly, seen internationally as one of brutal secularism and relative interreligious tolerance. By contrast, HTS has in the past explicitly defined itself as Islamist, meaning it seeks to reorder society along Islamic law.",
      "Displaying the flag in an image meant to represent Syria\u2019s new transition government shows how HTS and Jolani are still \u201cdeeply entrenched in their Salafist-Sunni ideology and worldview,\u201d according to Fawaz Gerges, a professor at the London School of Economics and author of the 2024 book, \u201cWhat Really Went Wrong: The West and the Failure of Democracy in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "They are not going to rule Syria with the brutality of the Islamic State terrorist group or the Taliban, Gerges added, \u201cbut it would be disingenuous to say he has shedded his ideology.\u201d",
      "Gerges is among observers who see the presence of the flag as a signal that the militant group is intent on keeping its imprimatur on the new era it helped birth. Al-Bashir, chosen after a meeting with Jolani, says he will only be in post until March. But it\u2019s not clear what happens then.",
      "There have been positive early signals, including an edict that women should not be told what they can and cannot wear, as well as a plea for people not to seek vigilante vengeance.",
      "\u201cWe will guarantee the rights of all people and all communities in Syria,\u201d al-Bashir told the Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera on Tuesday. Asked whether the country\u2019s new Constitution would be \u201cIslamic,\u201d he added, \u201cGod willing, we will clarify all these details during the constitutional process.\u201d",
      "With the group now making more moderate noises, and also in a position of considerable influence, the United States is exploring removing HTS\u2019 terrorist designation, two current administration officials and a former senior U.S. official told NBC News. Although Washington will watch closely the militant group\u2019s moves from its new political vantage point.",
      "Some observers, such as Gerges, see the interim prime minister as little more than an Jolani figurehead.",
      "Even inside Syria, he is not a well-known figure. Previously, he ran the government in Idlib province, a small, rural corner of northwestern Syria where rebels maintained control outside Assad\u2019s regime until their stunning offensive.",
      "He heads what is being touted by the incoming officials as a technocratic government; he is a trained electrical engineer and has previously backed the digitization of Idlib\u2019s public services.",
      "He and his officials are now going about the process of auditing and stripping back what they and independent international watchdogs say was a deeply corrupt regime.",
      "Gerges worries that HTS and its leader have already amassed such power that they may be reluctant to relinquish it, and that there is little sign of checks or balances to contain Jolani\u2019s ambitions now that Assad has been toppled.",
      "Syria may be getting \u201crid of a strongman,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cand replacing him with another strongman.\u201d"

    "summary": "South Korean police said they had raided the office of President Yoon Suk Yeol as they investigate his failed attempt to impose martial law last week.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Police faced off with security officials as they sought to raid South Korean President\u00a0Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s office Wednesday and one of his top lieutenants attempted suicide after being arrested, in a dramatic escalation of the crisis engulfing the key U.S. ally after the\u00a0failed attempt to impose martial law.",
      "Investigators said they had been unable to enter Yoon\u2019s office because of the standoff. Raids were also being conducted at the offices of the National Police Agency, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency and the National Assembly Police Guards.",
      "The raids came as opposition lawmakers were set to resubmit a motion to impeach Yoon over his short-lived martial law declaration, which plunged the East Asian democracy into chaos last week.",
      "On Wednesday, former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun became the first person to be formally arrested in connection with the martial law declaration. Kim, whose resignation Yoon accepted last week, is accused of playing a key role in the episode. Kim was in stable condition after attempting suicide at a Seoul detention center on Tuesday night, Shin Yong Hae, commissioner general of the Korea Correctional Service, told lawmakers.",
      "The martial law declaration has deeply shaken South Korea, which has a long history of military-authoritarian rule. It has left its leadership mired in uncertainty, while a combination of opposition lawmakers and police pursue actions that could yet see Yoon forced out. Large crowds of protesters have come out in recent days demanding Yoon\u2019s removal from office, while smaller rallies have been held by supporters.",
      "Yoon, 63, who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term, is barred from traveling overseas as he faces investigation on possible rebellion charges. Though Yoon has apologized for the martial law order, which he rescinded about six hours after announcing it, he has declined to resign.",
      "Yoon\u2019s party says he has been effectively suspended from duty and that it will \u201crestore order\u201d by ensuring his early departure from office. In the meantime, the party says it is working closely with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo to manage state affairs.",
      "That has fueled the uncertainty about who is in charge of South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",
      "Asked earlier this week who was running the country of 50 million people, the presidential office declined to comment."

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 17:30:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Russia is providing sanctuary to Bashar al-Assad, after the swift collapse of the Syrian leader's regime, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "Russia is providing sanctuary to Bashar al-Assad, having transported the former Syrian leader there \u201cin the most secure way possible\u201d after the swift collapse of his regime, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister told NBC News in an exclusive interview Tuesday.",
      "\u201cHe is secured, and it shows that Russia acts as required in such an extraordinary situation,\u201d Sergei Ryabkov said, becoming the first Russian official to confirm Assad\u2019s presence in the country.",
      "\u201cI have no idea what is going on with him right now,\u201d Ryabkov said, adding that it \u201cwould be very wrong for me to elaborate on what happened and how it was resolved.\u201d",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has been dealt a huge blow by the collapse of a regime to which he gave his full support, helping Assad cling to power after Syria descended into civil war and maintain his family\u2019s brutal dynasty, which began in 1971.",
      "And Ryabkov said Russia would continue to support the Syrian leader whose regime has been accused by human rights groups, whistleblowers and former detainees of attacks with chemical weapons and barrel bombs and other war crimes, as well as murder, systematic torture and the enforced disappearance of tens of thousands of people since the 2011 mass uprising, which sparked that conflict.",
      "\u201cRussia is not a party to the convention that established the International Criminal Court,\u201d Ryabkov said when asked if the Kremlin would hand over Assad for trial.",
      "Syria has not joined the court, which is based in the Hague, Netherlands, and has not accepted its jurisdiction. Russia and China blocked an attempt to impose its jurisdiction in 2014. The United States and Israel also do not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC, which has no police to enforce its warrants.",
      "Separately, in March 2023, the court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for \u201cwar crimes\u201d in overseeing the unlawful abduction and deportation of children\u00a0from Ukraine to Russia.",
      "And last month, the ICC issued\u00a0arrest warrants\u00a0for Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0and his former Defense Minister\u00a0Yoav Gallant over alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza. Israel\u00a0rejected the charges and the U.S. said it rejected the decision.",
      "Assad \u201cwas accused by the same group of countries and governments that continuously defeat attempts to live their own ways as it happened in Iraq, in Libya and in many more,\u201d Ryabkov said, adding that it was \u201camazing, but it is also very revealing,\u201d that the U.S. \u201cconfigures its reaction and response\u201d depending on whom the court is prosecuting.",
      "Whoever ends up governing Syria, be it the  Hayat Tahrir al-Sham\u00a0(HTS) militant group, which led rebel forces as they stormed across Syria, or someone else, Ryabkov said, Russia \u201cforcefully and strongly\u201d believes that Syria \u201cshould be sovereign, unified and integral.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not have a situation there, hopefully, that will mean separation of parts of Syria from one another,\u201d he added.",
      "He also urged Israel \u201cto seriously consider what is going on in the Golan Heights,\u201d after Netanyahu ordered his military to seize control of the demilitarized and U.N.-patrolled buffer zone with Syria that was established under a 1974 cease-fire agreement. Israel, Ryabkov said, should observe that agreement and it should \u201cnot infringe\u201d on Syria\u2019s territorial integrity.",
      "One thing Russia did share with the U.S. was concerns about the potential for the re-emergence of the Islamic State terrorist group in Syria, he said.\u00a0The U.S. has launched multiple airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria, where it maintains a small force.",
      "On a separate matter, Ryabkov added that the Kremlin would \u201cdefinitely be prepared to consider\u201d another prisoner swap, similar to the one in August that resulted in the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and three other U.S. residents from Russian captivity.",
      "Deals like this required \u201ca multiphased or multistep approach on both sides,\u201d including in some cases, the pardoning of those serving sentences. Several other countries, including Germany and Slovenia, were involved in the deal mediated by Turkey.",
      "While he did not \u201cwant to pre-empt anything,\u201d Ryabkov said such deals help improve the relationship between Russia and the U.S., adding that a new deal would be \"a healthy step forward, especially at the beginning of the next administration.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The swift collapse of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s Syrian regime represents a devastating defeat for Iran, the latest in a string of setbacks that have punctured long held assumptions in the West about Tehran\u2019s military prowess.",
      "In recent months, Iran has proved unable to thwart Israeli covert operations from targeting key figures in the regime, defend itself from damaging Israeli airstrikes, or protect an ally next door that was a linchpin in its regional proxy network, dubbed the \u201caxis of resistance.\u201d",
      "For decades, Syria has served as a vital land bridge to Iran\u2019s Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, allowing Tehran to ferry weapons to its partners across the Syrian border. After a mass uprising against Assad in 2011, Russia provided air power for Damascus and Iran propped up the brutal ruler with weapons, cash, Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers and militants from Iranian-backed proxy forces in Lebanon, Iraq and elsewhere.",
      "But when Syrian rebel forces seized Aleppo last month against poorly trained, demotivated Syrian army troops, Iran was caught off guard at a difficult moment, with its military depleted from Israeli air raids and its proxy forces in Lebanon decimated from fighting with Israel, current and former U.S. officials said. As the rebels pressed ahead, there was no concerted effort to stop the advance with Russian warplanes or Iranian-backed proxy forces.",
      "The dramatic events over the weekend marked \u201ca fundamental change in the equation of the entire Middle East,\u201d a senior Biden administration official told reporters on Sunday.\u201cAssad was effectively abandoned because his only friends ... Iran, Hezbollah and Russia, no longer had the capacity to help,\u201d the official added.",
      "Iran\u2019s weakened position has challenged prevailing assumptions in Washington and other capitals about Iran\u2019s power and resilience, as well as expectations about how a direct clash between Israel and Iran would play out, former U.S. intelligence officials and experts said.",
      "\u201cYou have a series of myths that have evaporated over the last year,\u201d said one former U.S. official.",
      "The United States and other governments had feared an Israeli attack on Iran would produce an overwhelming response against Israel by Iran\u2019s proxies. There also was a widespread view that Iran\u2019s vast missile arsenal would deter Israel from ever directly attacking, and if it did, Tehran might overwhelm Israeli air defenses in retaliation.",
      "And there were fears that a direct clash between Iran and Israel would result in an open-ended conflagration that would draw in the United States and other countries.",
      "None of those scenarios came to pass.",
      "Israeli air raids against Iran did not trigger a crippling response from Iran\u2019s proxies in Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq or Yemen. It was unclear whether those proxy forces lacked the means and the will to act more aggressively, or whether Tehran\u2019s leadership was reluctant to confront Israel directly, former officials said.",
      "With crucial help from the United States and its allies, Israel was able to shoot down most of the ballistic missiles and drones launched by Iran. Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia armed and trained by Iran, have proved no match for Israel\u2019s military and intelligence operations, which have killed much of its leadership and penetrated its communications.",
      "Those incorrect assumptions about Iran \u201cshaped and indeed constrained regional and U.S. policy on Iran,\u201d said Norman Roule,\u00a0former senior U.S. intelligence official and senior adviser to United Against Nuclear Iran, a nonprofit that focuses on combating threats posed by Iran.",
      "The loss of Syria as a reliable and subservient ally has likely irreparably damaged Iran\u2019s proxy network, which Tehran viewed as a defensive wall protecting Iran and a way of fighting countries with more powerful conventional militaries, current and former U.S. officials said.",
      "\u201cThe fall of Assad really puts a big question mark around whether the \u2018axis of resistance\u2019 is still feasible,\u201d said Alex Vatanka of the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cIran paid billions in the last two decades to establish this \u2018forward defense\u2019 model \u2014 and for a long time it delivered results,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cBut once under pressure, the model and the Arab partners of Iran have proven to lack the capacity to withstand pressure,\" Vatanka added. \"It began with Hezbollah and now Assad.\"",
      "Mohammad Ali Abtahi, a former vice president of Iran,\u00a0wrote on social media\u00a0shortly before the Assad government collapsed that the fall of the regime \u201cwould be one of the most significant events in the history of the Middle East.\u201d Abtahi added that \u201cresistance in the region would be left without support. Israel would become the dominant force.\u201d",
      "Recent events, including the failure to fend off anti-regime rebel forces in Syria over the past two weeks, have exposed a \u201crot\u201d inside Iran\u2019s military and security apparatus, Roule said.",
      "\u201cStarting with the killing of Soleimani in 2020, Iran faced a series of setbacks and defeats that exposed weaknesses and failures in Iran\u2019s intelligence and security services,\u201d Roule said, referring to Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the leader of the Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad in January 2020.",
      "\u201cOver the past year, Israel accelerated this rot through its killing of a large number of experienced IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) and Hezbollah officers involved in Syria,\u201d he said.",
      "Those officers had decades of experience in Syria and a network of contacts among the militants in Iran\u2019s proxy network, including Iraqis, Afghans, Pakistanis, Yemenis and others.",
      "\u201cWhen those officers and their \u2018rolodex\u2019 were lost, Iran\u2019s bureaucratic cohesion and efficiency suffered,\u201d Roule said.",
      "Iran\u2019s intelligence services appear incapable of giving their leaders advance warning about direct threats or disrupting hostile covert operations, according to Roule and other analysts.",
      "It was unclear why commanders in the Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force, which oversees the proxy network and has worked closely with the Syrian army, did not take decisive action to rescue the Assad regime\u2019s forces.\u00a0In both Lebanon and Syria in recent months, Iran has chosen not to deploy its own forces in significant numbers to aid its partners.",
      "Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, \u201chas traditionally refused to allow Iranian forces to risk themselves to protect proxies,\u201d Roule said.",
      "The loss of Syria has undermined the image Iran cultivated about its Quds Force being an elite military unit able to defeat its adversaries and protect Shiite populations abroad.",
      "Iran now may have second thoughts about the Oct. 7 attack on Israel last year by Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza, which Tehran applauded at the time.\u00a0The attack, masterminded by the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, caught Israel by surprise but set off a chain of events that have undermined Iran on multiple fronts, culminating in the demise of the Assad regime, according to Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA officer with experience in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian axis of resistance has crumbled thanks to one person, Yahya Sinwar, who started this on October 7,\u201d Polymeropoulos said.",
      "Although Iran has suffered a blow in the short term, it will most likely seek to rebuild its proxy forces, possibly by using Yemen as a hub or exploiting possible chaos in Syria after Assad\u2019s exit.",
      "The United States and Arab partners will need to cut off Iran\u2019s ability to dispatch weapons and trainers to Lebanon to ensure that Tehran does not rebuild its militant network, said Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., a former U.S. diplomat.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s in our national security interest that we cut off Iran\u2019s capabilities in Syria because that\u2019s how they were transitioning and transferring weapons to Hezbollah, through the ground as well as overflight over Iraq and Syria,\u201d Kim told MSNBC. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re able to sever this right now, this could be not just a setback but a devastating blow.\u201d",
      "With its air defenses, missile arsenal and regional status damaged, Iran will have to decide how to manage its nuclear program and how to approach the new U.S. administration under President-elect Donald Trump, who imposed severe economic sanctions on Tehran during his first term. Those sanctions have remained in place, and Iran has continued to enrich uranium to levels close to weapons-grade while refusing to fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors over its nuclear program.",
      "But Iran so far has opted to stop short of building nuclear weapons, and may look for a diplomatic compromise with the United States and other powers as it tries to regroup, experts said.",
      "\u201cI think Iran will think twice before weaponizing and will maintain the nuclear card as a bargaining chip, and for now attempt compromises with its foreign opponents,\u201d Vatanka said."

      "In a lengthy national address, Yoon accused \u201canti-state forces\u201d in the opposition-controlled parliament of paralyzing the government and undermining the rule of law. He largely repeated comments he made last week when he announced the surprise martial law order, saying it was necessary to protect democracy.",
      "\u201cThe opposition party is doing a crazy sword dance saying the declaration of martial law is a crime of insurrection,\u201d Yoon said. \u201cIs it really true?\u201d",

      "Han, who said he did not know about the national address in advance, said he was ordering an emergency meeting to expel Yoon from the party.",
      "\u201cI believe this is the time to make clear where we stand,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very serious situation, and what he said in his national address cannot be accepted by the people, and we also cannot accept it from the standpoint of democracy.\u201d",
      "The PPP\u2019s newly elected floor leader, Kweon Seong-dong, said he continued to oppose impeachment as well as convening the ethics committee over Yoon\u2019s party membership.",

      "Roh Jong-myung, a spokesperson for the main opposition Democratic Party, said that while it was a positive sign that Han recognized the seriousness of the situation, \u201che is too late.\u201d",
      "The next impeachment vote is set to be held Saturday around 5 p.m. local time (3 a.m. ET). Though the opposition controls parliament, it is eight seats short of the 200 it needs for the bill to pass, and it remains unclear whether lawmakers from Yoon\u2019s party will attend the vote.",

      "The United Kingdom on Wednesday indefinitely banned new prescriptions of puberty blockers to treat minors for gender dysphoria. The announcement comes a week after the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case involving state bans on puberty-suppressing medication and other forms of transition-related care for minors.",
      "Puberty blockers are commonly prescribed to transgender children in countries throughout the Western world to delay the onset of puberty or pause it as it is transpiring. The medication is prescribed with the goal of giving children who are experiencing gender dysphoria more time to decide if they want to take more permanent steps to transition genders. Puberty resumes when the medication is no longer taken.",
      "The indefinite ban on the medication in Britain comes several months after an independent study commissioned by England\u2019s National Health Service concluded that the medical evidence around transition-related care for minors is \u201cremarkably weak\u201d and that more research is needed.",
      "\u201cChildren\u2019s healthcare must always be evidence-led,\u201d British Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said in a press release. \u201cThe independent expert Commission on Human Medicines found that the current prescribing and care pathway for gender dysphoria and incongruence presents an unacceptable safety risk for children and young people.\u201d",
      "Dr. Hilary Cass, the author of the independent study, known as the \u201cCass report,\u201d said she supported the ban, according to the same release.",
      "\u201cPuberty blockers are powerful drugs with unproven benefits and significant risks, and that is why I recommended that they should only be prescribed following a multi-disciplinary assessment and within a research protocol,\u201d she said.",
      "Transgender activists around the world condemned the ban.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish medical negligence on my worst enemy. Labour activists just wished it on my entire community,\u201d Iris Duane, a former candidate for Britain\u2019s Parliament, wrote on X. \u201cTo friends, family and community, many of us will survive, and we will remind them that hell is calling.\u201d",
      "Trans minors in the U.K. who are already taking the medication can continue doing so, according to the government, and cisgender minors who experience puberty at an abnormally early age will still be able to receive new prescriptions for the medication.",
      "A temporary ban on new puberty-blocker prescriptions for\u00a0British minors experiencing gender dysphoria was already put in place over the summer. Wednesday\u2019s\u00a0announcement extends the ban indefinitely as the government begins clinical trials on the medications starting next year. The ban will be revisited in 2027.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 11:10:06 GMT",
    "summary": "A 92-year-old Japanese survivor of the U.S. atomic bombing of Nagasaki described the horrors he witnessed in 1945 as he accepted this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize on Tuesday on behalf of his anti-nuclear weapons group.",

      "A 92-year-old Japanese survivor of the U.S. atomic bombing of Nagasaki described the horrors he witnessed in 1945 as he accepted this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize on Tuesday on behalf of his anti-nuclear weapons group.",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in October to Nihon Hidankyo,\u00a0which is made up of survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a group also known as hibakusha. The organization, founded in 1956, has battled for nearly 70 years to eliminate nuclear weapons globally by aiming to maintain a taboo around their use.",
      "The U.S. used the weapons for the first and only time in the two Japanese cities in 1945, hastening Japan\u2019s surrender to the Allies to end World War II. By the end of that year, the bombings had killed an estimated 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 70,000 in Nagasaki, and the death toll continued to rise for decades as people succumbed to the long-term effects of radiation exposure.",
      "Since then, nuclear weapons have multiplied around the globe, with the ability to inflict damage hundreds or thousands of times greater than they did in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As the hibakusha age, many fear that the stigma associated with the deployment of nuclear bombs will fade and their stories will be lost to history.",
      "\u201cThe nuclear superpower Russia threatens to use nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine, and a Cabinet member of Israel, in the midst of its unrelenting attacks on Gaza in Palestine, even spoke of the possible use of nuclear arms,\u201d the 92-year-old survivor, Terumi Tanaka, said in his acceptance speech in Oslo.",
      "\u201cI am infinitely saddened and angered that the \u2018nuclear taboo\u2019 threatens to be broken,\u201d said Tanaka, one of three chairpersons of Nihon Hidankyo.",
      "Tanaka said there are 12,000 nuclear warheads around the world today, with 4,000 of them operationally deployed and ready to be launched immediately.",
      "J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said in introductory remarks that the mission of the hibakusha was more urgent than ever.",
      "\u201cNone of the nine countries that possess nuclear weapons \u2014 the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea \u2014 appear interested in nuclear disarmament and arms control at present,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the contrary, they are modernizing and building up their nuclear arsenals.\u201d",
      "According to a report in June by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017, $10.7 billion more was spent globally on nuclear weapons in 2023 than in 2022.",
      "Frydnes said the committee was calling on the five nuclear powers that have signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \u2014 the U.S., Britain, China, France and Russia \u2014 to take their obligations seriously and said more countries should ratify it.",
      "\u201cIt is naive to believe our civilization can survive a world order in which global security depends on nuclear weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is not meant to be a prison in which we await collective annihilation.\u201d",
      "Tanaka was 13 years old when the U.S. bombed Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after it detonated the first atomic bomb over Hiroshima.",
      "Tanaka, who was at home just a couple of miles from where the bomb hit, said he heard the buzzing sound of a bomber jet and was then \u201cengulfed in a bright, white light.\u201d An intense shock wave followed, crushing his house and others.",
      "He saw the full devastation three days later when he and his mother went looking for the families of two of his aunts, who lived closer to ground zero.",
      "He found the charred body of one aunt at what remained of her house, along with the body of her grandson, a university student. At his other aunt\u2019s house, his aunt had died just before they arrived, while his grandfather was on the verge of death, having been severely burned all over his body.",
      "His uncle, who at first had seemed mostly unharmed, later died after he left the area to seek help.",
      "\u201cThe deaths I witnessed at that time could hardly be described as human deaths,\u201d Tanaka said. \u201cThere were hundreds of people suffering in agony, unable to receive any kind of medical attention.",
      "\u201cI strongly felt that even in war, such killing and maiming must never be allowed to happen.\u201d",
      "Tanaka said that the average age of atomic bomb survivors is now 85 and that he hoped the next generation would find ways to build on their advocacy efforts.",
      "\u201cI hope that the belief that nuclear weapons cannot \u2014 and must not \u2014 co-exist with humanity will take firm hold among citizens of the nuclear weapon states and their allies,\u201d he said, \u201cand that this will become a force for change in the nuclear policies of their governments.\u201d"

      "President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that he would nominate former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle and his longtime billionaire friend\u00a0Tom Barrack to be ambassadors to Greece and Turkey, respectively.",
      "Trump made the announcements in a pair of social media posts.",
      "\"For three decades, Tom successfully managed a global private equity firm,\" Trump wrote of Barrack on Truth Social. \"He is a well respected and experienced voice of reason to a wide range of thought leaders in both political and business circles.\"",
      "Barrack, who founded the private equity firm Colony Capital and chaired Trump's 2017 inaugural committee, was acquitted in 2022 of charges that he acted as an unregistered foreign agent for the United Arab Emirates during the Trump administration and then made false statements to the FBI.",
      "In a separate post announcing his selection of her for ambassador to Greece, Trump referred to Guilfoyle, who\u00a0announced in 2022\u00a0that she was engaged to his son Donald Trump Jr., as a yearslong \u201cclose friend and ally.\u201d",
      "\"Kimberly is perfectly suited to foster strong bilateral relations with Greece, advancing our interests on issues ranging from defense cooperation to trade and economic innovation,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Both positions require Senate confirmation. Guilfoyle said Tuesday that she looked forward to securing that support.",
      "\"As ambassador, I look forward to delivering on the Trump agenda, supporting our Greek allies, and ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity,\" Guilfoyle wrote on X.",
      "Trump also named Ronald Johnson \u2014 not the senator \u2014 on Tuesday as ambassador to Mexico.",
      "\"Ron will work closely with our great Secretary of State Nominee, Marco Rubio, to promote our Nation\u2019s security and prosperity through strong America First Foreign Policies,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Johnson was ambassador to El Salvador during Trump's first administration, from 2019 until 2021.",
      "Before he took on that role, he was the CIA\u2019s science and technology liaison to U.S. Special Operations Command and served in the Army and the Alabama National Guard.",
      "Last month, Trump said he would nominate Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, to be ambassador to France\u00a0in his incoming administration.",
      "He also named Massad Boulous, whose son is married to Trump's younger daughter, Tiffany Trump, as a senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs."

      "Coffee lovers and caf\u00e9 dwellers are likely to see the price of a cup of joe increase soon, experts warn.",
      "The price of arabica coffee beans, the high-quality beans found in most restaurants and shops, spiked this month, recently jumping to $3.50 a pound.",
      "That\u2019s up 70% this year, which has brought the highest prices for the crop since 1977.",
      "Adjusted for inflation, $3.50 would be about $0.66 in 1977.\u00a0Prices increased back then because a frost killed more than a billion coffee bean trees.",
      "And today, experts say, climate change is to blame.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen significant drought in some of the key coffee-growing areas in the world, places like Brazil, which is the largest coffee exporter in the world,\u201d said David Ortega, a professor of food economics and policy at Michigan State University.",
      "Ortega studies the supply chain and how ingredients move from farmers to the grocery store.",
      "He said droughts, frost, floods, high temperatures and other unpredictable weather played a role in diminished crop yield in Brazil and Vietnam, another major coffee exporter.",
      "Vietnam grows robusta beans, slightly lower-quality beans used for products including instant coffee.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see these types of [climate] events just get more frequent into the future. And so we have to start taking this seriously and make investments in agricultural research and development to be able to mitigate and tackle the impacts of climate change on our agricultural production and agricultural system,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "\u201cOne impact of this is a rise in cost, which then gets translated to a rise in price for consumers,\u201d he added.",
      "Consumers will feel the increase, but so will the roasters and distributors who get them their pick-me-up cup.",
      "\u201cClimate change is the No. 1 factor on the increase and change in prices in the coffee market. It puts a lot of stress on the market. The supply is down and the demand is up,\u201d said Jackie Newman, vice president of World of Coffee Inc.",
      "World of Coffee is a family-owned business that processes raw green coffee beans and packages them for private labels, food services and coffee shops.",
      "Newman said the company\u2019s products are served to thousands of customers across the country every day.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to be as fair as possible and eat as much of the cost as we can. Obviously, people still need their cup of coffee in the morning,\u201d Newman said. \u201cBut we also have to make sure that we\u2019re accounting for all of our costs, not just the increase in coffee but also the increase in packaging and labor costs, as well.\u201d",
      "She expects coffee prices could increase anywhere from 50 cents to $1 a pound in the coming days.",
      "\u201cPeople are very reactive to coffee prices, and this affects everyone down the chain. The farmers are impacted because they have very low supply. The green coffee sellers are affected because they don\u2019t have that much coffee to sell and the demand is high,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cRoasters are extremely affected because the price is so high and we still have our customers that we have to fill orders for. That does trickle down the chain and affects the everyday consumer,\u201d Newman added.",
      "\u201cThere is just simply not enough coffee to go around.\u201d",
      "The forecast for other crops could follow a similar trend.",
      "\u201cIf we look at the recent floods in Europe, for example, that impacted the Valencia region [in Spain], a key agricultural producing region in that country, it had some pretty detrimental effects on things like oranges,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "\u201cIf you look back, not that long ago, two years ago, we had a mega drought out West in places like California, where a lot of our specialty crops are grown. Things like lettuce that saw a significant rise in price a couple of years ago, even beef production was impacted by that mega drought. And we\u2019re feeling the effects on beef prices at the moment,\u201d he said."
