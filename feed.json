    "story": [
      "Tollywood, the Telugu-language film industry, is rapidly gaining global attention, challenging Bollywood's dominance",
      "HYDERABAD, India -- A fast-rising parallel film industry in India is competing with Bollywood's musicals and action-packed films and has taken the world by storm: It\u2019s called Tollywood.",
      "As Mumbai is to Hindi films \u2014 or Bollywood \u2014 the southern Indian city of Hyderabad is to movies made in Telugu, one of the country\u2019s most widely spoken languages. Tollywood films like \u201cRRR\u201d and \u201cBaahubali\u201d have achieved international acclaim at the box office and on the awards stage.",
      "The Telugu-language film industry, widely known as Tollywood, is one of India\u2019s many regional movie-producing centers. But it's drawn national and global audiences with its high-adrenaline action movies, mythic storylines and grand visual style. It has carved out its own identity separate from Hindi-language Bollywood by leaning toward star-driven spectacle and large-scale epics.",
      "Tollywood primarily operates out of Hyderabad, which is home to Ramoji Film City. The 1,666-acre (674-hectare) facility, recognized by Guinness World Records as the world\u2019s largest film studio complex, houses massive film studio complexes, dozens of production houses, warehouses, movie sets and post-production facilities. The industry churns out around 300 films every year \u2014 fewer than Bollywood but still enough to make it one of India\u2019s largest regional industries.",
      "Tollywood\u2019s growing exposure was in large part sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, as the rapid expansion of streaming services in India allowed regional films to find wider audiences. That expansion also coincided with Bollywood\u2019s struggle to lure audiences back to theaters amid repetitive storylines and rehashes of hits from other languages.",
      "What has also worked in favor of Tollywood is that it offers a rare balance of high-octane action films and nuanced movies charged with real human drama.",
      "\u201cTelugu people have a lot of interest in movies. The Telugu audience watch and accept all kind of movies. They are cinema lovers,\u201d says filmmaker T.V. Ravi Narayan, who is working on a biopic based on an 18th-century social activist. \u201cBecause they are cinema lovers, be it \u2018Baahubali,\u2019 \u2018Pushpa\u2019 or \u2018RRR,\u2019 be it big budget or small budget, be it realistic or biopics or fantasy movies, the audiences accept it.\u201d",
      "Tollywood is known for its high-energy storytelling, big action set pieces and grand spectacle that are heavy on visual effects. It often blends family drama, action and mythology into movies, increasingly marketed as \u201cpan-India\u201d releases and dubbed in multiple regional languages.",
      "The films, like other big Indian productions, have crowd-pleasing visuals and feature viral songs and dances central to the narrative and usually presented as grand performance set pieces.",
      "Many Tollywood films are also remade in Bollywood, which has become a proven formula to expand Telugu cinema across India. Dubbing \u2014 where actors record voice-overs in Hindi or a professional voice artist replaces the track \u2014 is also a standard and tested practice that has made Tollywood more accessible.",
      "The industry does also produce smaller, low-budget films that tend to focus on stories rooted in Telugu culture. Most of them are set in rural landscapes and explore themes such as social issues, regional cultures and class inequality. Some of those films are sent straight to streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where they enjoy a wide reach across India.",
      "Many Tollywood movie stars like Mahesh Babu, Allu Arjun, Prabhas, Ram Charan and N.T. Rama Rao Jr. command a near-godlike following, with devoted fan bases that cut across generations. Their movie releases are often tied to regional religious festivals and are preceded by carefully marketed music launch events and dance performances that are a spectacle in itself. Tens of thousands of fans attend such events, as they did recently with the first look of S.S. Rajamouli's \u201cVaranasi.\u201d",
      "The industry has also led to a massive fan club culture, predominantly centered around male film stars. Some fans are so invested in their favorite stars that they often organize charitable drives and blood donation camps in their names. It is not unusual for fans to perform acts of literal worship, washing male stars' cardboard cutouts or statues with milk \u2014 a ritual usually reserved for Hindu gods.",
      "In theaters across Hyderabad, viewers will commonly dance, whistle and throw confetti in the air during releases of films. Outside, billboards of major stars are a frequent sight in the city.",

After sweeping state elections, he became the chief minister.",
      "Tollywood\u2019s rapid commercial success and audience acceptance over the past decade has reshaped the country\u2019s entertainment landscape and pushed regional cinema further onto the world stage.",

Rajamouli became an international name after \u201cRRR,\u201d or \u201cRise, Roar, Revolt,\u201d his 2022 three-hour epic set in British India. The sprawling anti-colonial tale became one of India\u2019s biggest hits, a global streaming phenomenon that won an Oscar for best original song. His two-part \u201cBaahubali\u201d series, released in 2015 and 2017, broke box-office records in India and a reedited version combining the two parts, \u201cBaahubali: The Epic,\u201d released in cinemas worldwide just last month.",

      "Just like Bollywood, the Telugu film industry also draws its revenue from theatrical releases, television and music rights, overseas distribution and brand partnerships. It is widely regarded as India\u2019s second-highest-grossing film industry, trailing only Bollywood.",
      "Even though the industry is largely controlled by some regionally influential film families and businessmen that have power over movie distribution and screenings, huge marketing campaigns have carried Telugu films across India and beyond.",
      "Dubbed releases, remakes in other Indian languages and talent collaborations across other regional industries have further positioned Tollywood releases as national events, with stars often raking money from profit-sharing arrangements and brand endorsements as well.",

      "NEW DELHI -- Dharmendra, one of Indian cinema\u2019s most popular stars whose versatile performances made him a defining screen presence of 1970s and 1980s Bollywood films, died Monday. He was 89.",
      "The actor, who would have turned 90 on Dec. 8, had been in and out of a hospital in the financial capital, Mumbai, over the past few weeks.",
      "A senior police official who had spoken to Dharmendra's doctor confirmed the death on condition of anonymity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences, saying the actor's death marks the end of an era in Indian cinema.",
      "\u201cHe was an iconic film personality, a phenomenal actor who brought charm and depth to every role he played. The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,\u201d Modi said on social media platform X.",
      "Often called Bollywood\u2019s \u201cHe-Man,\u201d Dharmendra combined the old-school heroism of an action star with the tenderness of a romantic lead, making him one of India\u2019s most iconic actors. Though most of his fame came from roles in which he embodied the archetype of a larger-than-life hero \u2014 upright, patriotic and fearless \u2014 his charming performances in romantic hits equally made him popular with the masses.",
      "Dharmendra\u2019s performance in \u201cSholay\u201d (1975) \u2014 Bollywood\u2019s take on the Spaghetti Western and regarded as one of India\u2019s greatest films \u2014 earned him enduring popularity. His roles in other Hindi-language hits, from the romantic comedy \u201cChupke Chupke\u201d (1975) to the action drama \u201cMera Gaon Mera Desh\u201d (1971), made him one of the most recognizable film faces from that era.",
      "His role in Bollywood classic \u201cSholay,\u201d where he played an affable character alongside Amitabh Bachchan, his co-actor in the film, cemented his status as a superstar. The duo\u2019s on-screen partnership also became one of Bollywood\u2019s most iconic pairings.",
      "His on-screen chemistry with actress Hema Malini, whom he later married, became one of Bollywood\u2019s most popular collaborations, as the pair acted together in more than two dozen films. But their union was rooted in scandal. Dharmendra had married Prakash Kaur before his film debut, and went on to have four children with her, including two who would follow in his acting footsteps \u2014 Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol.",
      "Despite his marriage to Malini in 1980, he reportedly never divorced Kaur and continued to live with her. According to local media reports, he briefly converted to Islam before marrying Malini as Indian law disallows Hindus to marry twice, especially if their spouse is alive.",

      "Later in his career, Dharmendra moved to more character-driven roles, frequently portraying paternal figures in the 1990s and 2000s in a career that continued through 2025. He was last seen in war biopic film \u201cIkkis.\u201d",
      "\u201cI never thought I would come this far,\u201d he said in a 2021 interview with Indian news website Rediff.",
      "Born Dharmendra Kewal Krishan Deol in India\u2019s northern state of Punjab in 1935, he grew up in a farming family and moved to Mumbai in the late 1950s, making his Bollywood debut in 1960. Over a career spanning six decades, he acted in more than 300 films.",
      "In 2012, Dharmendra was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India\u2019s third-highest civilian honor, in recognition of his contribution to Indian cinema. He also briefly turned to politics, serving as a Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker in Parliament from 2004 to 2009, though his political stint was short-lived.",
      "Dharmendra is survived by his wives, children and grandchildren.",

      "Universal Pictures\u2019 two-part \u201cWicked\u201d gamble continues to defy gravity at the box office. Just a year after part one brought droves of audiences to movie theaters around the country, even more people bought opening weekend tickets to see the epic conclusion, \u201cWicked: For Good.\u201d According to studio estimates on Sunday, \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d earned $150 million from North American theaters in its first days in theaters and $226 million globally.",
      "Not only is it the biggest opening ever for a Broadway musical adaptation, unseating the record set by the first film\u2019s $112 million launch, it\u2019s also the second biggest debut of the year behind \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u2019s\u201d $162 million.",
      "\u201cThe results are just fantastic,\u201d said Jim Orr, who heads domestic distribution for Universal. \u201cSome films can deliver a false positive when tickets go on sale early but these results speak for themselves.\"",
      "Universal began rolling out \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d in theaters earlier this week, with previews on Monday ($6.1 million from 1,050 theaters) and Wednesday ($6.5 million from 2,300 theaters). By Friday it was playing in 4,115 North American locations and had raked in $68.6 million. IMAX showings accounted for $15.5 million, or 11%, of its domestic haul \u2014 a November record for the company.",
      "IMAX CEO Rich Gelfond said in a statement that the strong market share shows, \u201cour momentum carries into demos and genres beyond our traditional core, including families.\u201d",
      "As with the first film, women powered opening weekend, making up around 71% of ticket buyers according to PostTrak exit polls. Critics were somewhat mixed on the final chapter, but audiences weren\u2019t: An overwhelming 83% of audiences said it was one they would \u201cdefinitely recommend\u201d to friends. As far as foot traffic is concerned, the box office tracker EntTelligence estimates that about 2 million more people came out for \u201cWicked: For Good's\u201d first weekend than for \u201cWicked's.\"",
      "Jon M. Chu directed both \u201cWicked\u201d films, starring Cynthia Ervio and Ariana Grande. The first film made over $758.7 million worldwide and received 10 Oscar nominations (winning two, for costume and production design ). The question is how high \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d can soar. Combined, the two films cost around $300 million to produce, not including marketing and promotion costs.",
      "\u201cThe first film paved the way,\u201d Orr said. \u201cIt's really become a cultural event I think audiences are going to be flocking to theaters for quite some time to come.\u201d",
      "Two other films also opened in wide release this weekend, but further down on the charts behind a buffet of holdovers. Searchlight Pictures opened its Brendan Fraser film \u201cRental Family\u201d in 1,925 theaters where it earned $3.3 million. The Finnish action film \u201cSisu: Road to Revenge,\" a Sony release, also played in 2,222 theaters. It earned an estimated $2.6 million.",

      "NEW YORK -- The story of Jimmy Cliff, who has died at age 81, is in part the story of reggae itself.",
      "Like so many Jamaican teens of his time, he moved to Kingston in the early 1960s and joined a rising musical movement that would help give voice to the country's independence from Great Britain. A decade later, he helped reggae ascend to the international stage with his starring role in the cult favorite \u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d and his featured place on the film's classic soundtrack. In the years following, his songs were covered by everyone from Bruce Springsteen to UB40 and confirmed the music's power to inspire or just get you dancing.",
      "Here are a few songs that trace the arc of his career, and of reggae.",
      "Singing along to an easy, bluesy groove, Cliff had a way of sounding both relaxed and fully committed, and could make a nursery rhyme sound like an anthem: \u201cRoses are red / violets are blue / Believe me / I love you.\u201d He also joined a long popular tradition, most famously expressed in such 1970s standards as Billy Joel's \u201cJust the Way You Are\u201d and Springsteen's \u201cThunder Road,\u201d of offering praise to a very personal kind of beauty: \u201cAlthough you may not have such a fabulous shape / To suit the rest of the world / But you do suit me and that\u2019s all I want to know.\u201d",
      "Like Marvin Gaye's \u201cWhat's Going On\u201d and other anti-war songs, Cliff's \u201cVietnam\u201d was drawn from the horrors of those who had served overseas. \u201cVietnam\u201d was a seething, mid-tempo chant \u2014 \u201cVi-et-nam, Vi-et-nam,\u201d the very name an indictment, in this song for the death of a soldier who had written home to say he would soon be returning, only for his mother to receive a telegram the next day announcing his death.",
      "One of Cliff's many talents was looking clear-eyed at life as it is, and imagining so well what it could be \u2014 a paradise made real by the melody, the feel and lyrics of \u201cWonderful World, Beautiful People,\u201d a vision so inevitable even the likes of President Richard Nixon and British Prime Minister Harold Wilson can't get in the way. \u201cThis is our world, can\u2019t you see? / Everybody wants to live and be free.\u201d",

      "Onstage, he sometimes literally jumped for joy, but Cliff also could call out the deepest notes of despair. The somber, gospel-style \u201cMany Rivers to Cross\u201d was inspired by the racism he encountered in England in the 1960s and tells a story of displacement, longing, fatigue and gathering rage \u2014 but never defeat. \u201cI merely survive because of my pride,\u201d he tells us, a variation of the old saying that hopes dies last.",
      "Cliff\u2019s political songs were so enduring in part because they were so catchy, and because they offered hope without the promise of easy success. Kicked off by a spare horn riff, \u201cYou Can Get It If You Really Want\u201d has a lighter mood than \u201cVietnam,\u201d but just as determined a spirit. \u201cYou must try, try and try, try and try,\u201d Cliff warns. \u201cPersecution you must fear / Win or lose you got to get your share.\u201d",
      "The title track to the movie which would mark the high point of his success, \u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d has a spiky, muscular rhythm, the kind you could set to the forward march of a mass protest. It\u2019s a sermon of retribution for oppressors \u2014 \u201cthe harder they fall, one and all\u201d \u2014 and of earthly rewards for those who have been robbed: \u201cSo as sure as the sun will shine / I\u2019m gonna get my share now, what\u2019s mine.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhere I come from, there is no hospital,\u201d Bulle said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I am here.\u201d",
      "One of the world\u2019s poorest countries faces a crisis of health care exacerbated by the Trump administration's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development this year. The loss of USAID funding has disheartened many Somalis who believe they can\u2019t depend on their own government, which focuses mostly on defeating the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab.",
      "Somalia's deputy health minister, Mohamed Hassan Bulaale, told The Associated Press that the U.S. cuts led to over 6,000 health workers losing their jobs while up to 2,000 health facilities were affected \u2014 a massive hit in a country that the Center for Global Development this year said was among the world's most likely to suffer as donors draw back.",
      "Bomb and gun attacks by the militants \u2014 including against health centers \u2014 have reduced in frequency and intensity in recent months, leading some to see success in President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud\u2019s \u201ctotal war\u201d against al-Shabab.",
      "But hospital administrators, civic leaders and others say the latest push to defeat al-Shabab has come at the expense of health care and other public services.",
      "Somalia's Ministry of Health was allocated $91 million of a national budget exceeding $1 billion this year, with those funds tied mostly to projects backed by outside groups. That's a significant improvement from last year's $52 million, but almost all of that increase came from donors, said Mahad Wasuge, who runs the Somali Public Agenda think tank.",
      "And as the United States has shown, donor money comes and goes.",
      "Even with major setbacks in overall foreign support this year, including from other key benefactors such as Britain, \u201csecurity remains the first priority\u201d for Somali authorities, Wasuge told the AP.",
      "Many areas outside Mogadishu don\u2019t have functioning public hospitals, he said, with people forced to trek through often insecure areas to receive care at the ones still functional.",
      "Such facilities in the capital include Banadir Hospital, built with Chinese support in 1977, and De Martino Hospital, established in 1922 by Italian colonialists.",
      "During an AP visit, officials at those hospitals said much of their work would stop without assistance from the United Nations and international groups.",
      "Even at Banadir, Mogadishu\u2019s main public referral hospital, expectations of the Somali government aren\u2019t high. The unit looking after malnourished children depends entirely on donor funds channeled through the humanitarian group Concern Worldwide, said supervisor Dr. Mohamed Haashi.",
      "After 37 people employed in the unit lost their jobs with this year's U.S. aid cuts, Concern Worldwide still pays the salaries of 13 others in addition to milk and food for mothers and babies, Haashi said.",
      "At De Martino Hospital, director Dr. Abdirahim Omar Amin said he worries what will happen when contracts with two other humanitarian groups expire at the end of 2025.",
      "The hospital was looking after dozens of children suffering from diphtheria, an infectious disease of the throat preventable by vaccination but now spreading in rural areas. Parents are not taking their kids for routine vaccinations because they are afraid of militant attacks, Amin said.",

    "story": [
      "The White House is circulating a proposal to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for two more years",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House is circulating a proposal that would extend subsidies to help consumers pay for coverage under the Affordable Care Act for two more years, as millions of Americans face spiking health care costs when the current tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "The draft plan suggests that President Donald Trump is open to extending a provision of Obamacare as his administration and congressional Republicans search for a broader policy solution to a fight that has long flummoxed the party. The White House stresses that no plan is final until Trump announces it.",
      "The subsidies were at the heart of the Democrats\u2019 demands in the government shutdown fight that ended earlier this month. Most Democratic lawmakers had insisted on a straight extension of the tax credits, which expire at the end of the year as a condition of keeping the government open.",
      "Eligibility for the Obamacare subsidies, which were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people afford health care coverage, would be capped at 700% of the federal poverty level, according to two people with knowledge of the proposal. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a White House proposal that is in draft form.",
      "The baseline tax credits that were originally part of the Affordable Care Act were capped at 400% of the federal poverty level, but that cut-off was suspended because of the temporary COVID-era credits that allowed middle- and higher-income people to benefit from subsidies too.",
      "The White House would also require those on Obamacare, regardless of the type of coverage, to pay some sort of premium for their Obamacare plans. That would effectively end zero-premium plans for those with lower incomes, addressing a concern from Republicans that the program has enabled fraud. One option is a requirement that everyone pay 2% of their income, or at least $5 per month, for lower-tier plans.",
      "Even as the White House\u2019s proposal remains in flux, the notion of extending any part of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement is likely to rankle conservatives who have sought to repeal and replace the law for well over a decade.",
      "\u201cUntil President Trump makes an announcement himself, any reporting about the administration\u2019s health care positions is mere speculation,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday afternoon that Trump \u201cis very much involved in these talks\u201d and that he is \u201cfocused on unveiling a health care proposal that will fix the system and will bring down costs for consumers.\u201d",
      "But there are signs that parts of the nascent White House plan could get buy-in from Democrats. New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, one of eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus who voted to reopen the government earlier this month, said it \u201crepresents a starting point for serious negotiations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that President Trump is putting forward any offer at all to extend the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax credits shows that there is a broad understanding that inaction in this regard will cause serious harm to the American people,\u201d Hassan said.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve had constructive conversations with many of my Republican colleagues who I believe want to get this done,\u201d Shaheen said. \u201cThey understand that the vast majority of people who benefit from these tax credits live in states the President won, and that the President\u2019s own pollsters have underscored the enormous political urgency of Republicans acting.\u201d",
      "In 2017, Trump fell short in a push to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, an embarrassing defeat for Republicans who had just seized control of all levers of power in Washington. The GOP has failed to coalesce around a unified health care proposal since, and the expiration of the pandemic-era subsidies gives Trump and his party an opportunity to put their own stamp on the issue.",
      "As the White House worked quietly on its plan, led by the Domestic Policy Council, key lawmakers on Capitol Hill have drafted their own proposals. For instance, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and others have proposed various ideas for redirecting the program\u2019s spending on federal subsidies into health savings accounts that enrollees could use to shop for plans or defray out-of-pocket costs. Scott's plan has been discussed with the White House multiple times since it was released Thursday, according to a person familiar not authorized to discuss the private conversations.",
      "The draft of the White House plan would allow those in lower-tier plans, such as the bronze-level or catastrophic plans, to put money into health savings accounts.",
      "It would also codify the \u201cprogram integrity rule\u201d to further help root out fraud, waste and abuse.",
      "Americans shopping for Obamacare coverage have already faced the sticker shock of price hikes, because the window for selecting next year\u2019s coverage began Nov. 1. Without congressional action, the average subsidized enrollee will face more than double their current cost in premiums next year, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",

      "Although the walkers and the crowd perform very different roles during the annual June ritual, they report similar feelings: an ineffable feeling of togetherness, as if the entire group becomes one, said Dimitris Xygalatas, a cognitive anthropologist at the University of Connecticut, who witnessed the Spanish ritual years ago as a researcher.",
      "He has experienced similar feelings in a stadium while chanting and cheering together with 30,000 fans of his hometown soccer team. Both are instances of collective effervescence, said Xygalatas, author of \u201cRituals: How Seemingly Senseless Acts Make Life Worth Living.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s that feeling that happens when people engage together in a meaningful activity that sparks positive emotions. Such as when you get goose bumps at a concert, feel the rush of adrenaline in group exercise classes or get swept up in religious festivals.",
      "Recently, collective effervescence has been referred to as \u201cwe mode,\u201d and it\u2019s something that can be cultivated to improve your life, said Kelly McGonigal, a Stanford University health psychologist.",
      "\u201cWhen you are connected through shared positive emotion, expressions often act as this aerosolized joy, where you catch other people\u2019s smiles, laughter, their physical expressions,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cIt becomes contagious.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe mode\u201d has also been called physiological synchrony, and McGonigal calls it \u201ccollective joy.\u201d The concept was documented more than a century ago by French sociologist Emile Durkheim, who described cultural effervescence after studying aboriginal Australian societies.",
      "Xygalatas\u2019 research has focused on measuring it in various group activities. To quantify \u201cautonomic responses,\u201d he has fitted people with heart monitors and electrodes and extracted thousands of stills from videos to analyze facial expressions.",
      "He found that people\u2019s physiological responses synchronize during exciting events. The heartbeats of sports fans who attend a game, for instance, sync up, while those of fans watching the same game on TV don\u2019t. Fans at the game also have higher levels of endorphins, which have been linked to bonding, he said.",
      "On a basic level, collective rituals involve meeting and connecting with people, which is a key to psychological well-being, Xygalatas noted.",
      "\u201cIf we all dress alike and we move alike and we feel alike, we express the same emotions that trigger mechanisms in our brain,\u201d Xygalatas said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental need for synchrony.\u201d",

      "Experts have mixed reactions to the recent U.N. climate talks in the Amazon",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- After an agreement from U.N. climate talks in the Amazon that fell short of many nations' expectations, experts found some bright spots alongside weighty reasons for worry in the fight against global warming.",
      "The Associated Press asked 17 experts \u2014 diplomats, analysts, advocates and scientists \u2014 the simple question: After the talks, known as COP30, in the city of Belem, what's next?",
      "\u201cWe leave here with a clear signal, very very clear signal, that we have entered the era of implementation,\" said U.N. Climate Executive Secretary Simon Stiell. \"As we move forward, it\u2019s about doing. It's about rolling sleeves up.\u201d",
      "Others look at the key failure of not delivering a road map to phase out coal, oil and gas \u2014 the main causes of warming. The road map had the public support of Brazil's president and more than 80 nations, but powerful opponents.",
      "\u201cThis should have been the moment. A COP in the Amazon, a president calling for a fossil fuel transition road map, the science screaming for action. But the world blinked again,'' Panama climate negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey G\u00f3mez said. \u201dThe next year will be harder on communities and ecosystems. Impacts will intensify, because emissions are not slowing down.\"",
      "Stiell pointed to seven different paragraphs in the agreements from Belem that could spur action for reduced greenhouse gas emissions and fewer fossil fuels. The COP presidency highlighted 117 \u201caction agenda\u201d items mostly for business to put pledges into real-life action.",
      "That agenda includes a promise of $1 trillion for improving energy grids and infrastructure; ramping up the production of biofuels; industrial decarbonization plans in developing countries; $5.5 billion toward a fund to pay countries to keep their forests standing; and other pledges of funding, including from the private sector, for projects in areas like farming and adaptation. Among the most ambitious actions is a push to raise $1 trillion for renewable electrical grids and energy storage.",
      "One specific action that Stiell and several others emphasized was a new \u201cglobal implementation accelerator,\" a voluntary and cooperative system designed to help nations that want to do more than they've previously proposed in their climate fighting plans. The emphasis is on getting money to where it's needed.",
      "\u201cIf the \u2018ambition accelerator\u2019 can help to do this, it will make a massive difference to the global warming outlook,\u201d said Bill Hare, CEO of the climate science and policy institute Climate Analytics.",
      "Because they couldn't get a consensus at the talks in Belem, the COP30 presidency promised to create two new \u201croad maps,\" one to guide the transition away from fossil fuels and another to stop deforestation. But those road maps won't have the force of something agreed upon in UN talks.",
      "COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago said his office will study both areas extensively and use science and economics to come up with those plans. He said they would be tailored to different countries' needs.",
      "Do Lago also promised that his office will join with Colombia and the Netherlands to organize a special fossil fuel phaseout conference scheduled next April.",
      "\u201cIf they come with real timelines, accountability and finance, they have the potential to shape global action and hold governments to their word,\u201d said Mariana Paoli of the anti-poverty group Christian Aid. \u201cThey don\u2019t have power on their own, but they can create the structure around which real change is built.\u201d",

      "Yet Paoli said these conferences are not powerless. She said they are \"slow and imperfect, yet they have still moved the world forward \u2014 sometimes in unexpected ways.''",
      "\u201cOver the next year, we are likely to see continued escalation of climate impacts alongside gradual progress on climate action,\u201d said Mohamed Adow, director of PowerShift Africa. \u201cRenewable energy expansion will continue, but so will new fossil fuel investments in many parts of the world.\u201d",
      "Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research, said all forms of extreme weather and climate events will increase, hitting the most vulnerable people hardest and threatening the survival of coral reefs and the very Amazon that hosted the talks.",
      "\u201cThese are unacceptable outcomes of a solvable problem,\u201d Rockstrom said.",
      "With the United States' federal government withdrawing from climate action under President Donald Trump, states, cities and businesses are cutting emissions in a way that will allow the U.S. to reach its climate goal, said former U.S. climate envoy Trigg Talley, now a representative of America's All In.",
      "\u201cThe COPs are only one part of a wide tapestry for action on climate change,\u201d said World Resources Institute's International Climate Director David Waskow. \u201cWe need to pull all the levers at our disposal to limit global warming.\"",
      "\u201cThe giant boulder of climate action is already rolling down the hill in the right direction,\u201d Hayhoe said. \u201cIt already has millions of hands on it. And as each of us adds our hand too, it goes a little faster.\u201d",

      "IZNIK, Turkey -- IZNIK, Turkey (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV traveled Friday to join Orthodox patriarchs in commemorating an important moment in Christian history, gathering at the site in Turkey of an unprecedented A.D. 325 meeting of bishops to pray that Christians might once again be reunited.",
      "Leo, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I and other Christian leaders were meeting on the shores of Lake Iznik, the site of the Council of Nicaea that produced a creed, or statement of faith, that is still recited by millions of Christians today.",
      "Leo flew by helicopter to Iznik from Istanbul to take part in an ecumenical prayer to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the Nicaea meeting, the highlight of his visit to Turkey. He arrived just after the Muslim call to prayer rang out from a nearby mosque.",
      "The Nicaea gathering happened at a time when the Eastern and Western churches were still united. They split in the Great Schism of 1054, a divide precipitated largely by disagreements over the primacy of the pope. But even today, Catholic, Orthodox and most historic Protestant groups accept the Nicaean Creed, making it a point of agreement and the most widely accepted creed in Christendom.",
      "As a result, celebrating its origins at the site of its creation with the spiritual leaders of the Catholic and Orthodox churches and other Christian representatives marked a historic moment in the centuries-old quest to reunite all Christians.",
      "In Iznik, the Christian leaders were to light candles and pray at the lakeside archaeological excavations of the ancient Basilica of Saint Neophytos in a service featuring alternating Catholic and Orthodox hymns.",
      "The stone foundations of the basilica, which were recently uncovered by the receding waters of Lake Iznik, are believed to be on the site of an earlier church that hosted the council 1,700 years ago.",
      "Speaking Friday before arriving, Leo said the creed wasn\u2019t merely a doctrinal formula, but the \u201cessential core of the Christian faith.\u201d",
      "\u201cTherefore, its development is organic, akin to that of a living reality, gradually bringing to light and expressing more fully the essential heart of the faith,\u201d he said.",
      "Christians are a minority in predominantly Sunni Muslim Turkey, and ahead of the prayer in Iznik, around 20 members of a small Turkish Islamic party staged a brief protest, saying the encounter posed a threat to Turkey\u2019s sovereignty and national identity.",
      "Under a heavy police presence, Mehmet Kaygusuz, a member of the New Welfare Party, read a statement denouncing what he said were efforts to establish a \u201cVatican-like Greek Orthodox state\u201d in Turkey. The group dispersed peacefully shortly after.",
      "Leo arrived in Turkey  on Thursday, emphasizing a message of peace as he met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It\u2019s a message he\u2019ll bring to Lebanon on Sunday, the second and final leg of the trip for history\u2019s first American pope.",
      "Iznik resident Suleyman Bulut, 35, acknowledged his town\u2019s deep historical and spiritual significance for Christians and said he had no issue with them coming to honor their heritage. \u201cMuslims (too) should go and visit places that belong to us in the rest of the world, in Europe,\u201d he said. But Hasan Maral, a 41-year-old shopkeeper said he felt uncomfortable with visit. \u201cThe pope coming here feels contradictory to my faith,\u201d he said.",

      "For 17 years, she had earned a living cutting and polishing the gems that helped transform Botswana from one of the world\u2019s poorest nations into one of Africa\u2019s success stories. Diamonds were discovered in 1967, a year after independence, an abrupt change of fortune for the landlocked country.",
      "Botswana became the world\u2019s top diamond producer by value, and second-largest by volume after Russia. Diamonds are woven into the national identity, with local Olympic champion runner Letsile Tebogo heading a De Beers campaign celebrating how the industry funds schools and stadiums.",
      "The stones that Koko and thousands of others dug and polished over the decades have funded Botswana\u2019s health, education, infrastructure and more. The country risked the \u201cresource curse\u201d of building its economy on a single natural asset \u2014 and unlike many African nations, it was a success.",
      "But Koko lost her job a year ago, joining many others left adrift as Africa\u2019s trade in natural diamonds buckles under growing pressure from cheaper lab-grown diamonds mass-produced mainly in China and India.",
      "\u201cI have debts and I don\u2019t know how I am going to pay them,\u201d said the mother of two, who had survived on about $300 a month and relied on her employer for medical insurance. It had been a decent situation for a semi-skilled worker in a country where the average monthly salary is about $500. \u201cEvery month they call me asking for money. But where do I get it?\u201d",
      "Botswana, which has unearthed some of the world\u2019s biggest stones, has prided itself on prudently managing its natural wealth, avoiding the corruption and fighting that have plagued many African peers.

      "He warned that new U.S. tariffs under the Trump administration could worsen Botswana\u2019s downturn, triggering staffing freezes, unpaid leave and more layoffs. The U.S. has imposed a 15% tariff on diamonds that are mined, cut and polished there.",

      "Debswana, the largest local diamond producer and a joint venture between the government and mining giant De Beers, saw revenues halve last year. It has paused operations at some mines as Botswana and Angola enter talks to take over controlling stakes in De Beers\u2019 diamond mining unit.",

      "The global rise of synthetic diamonds has been swift. They have \u201cgiven stiff competition, especially in lower-quality stones,\u201d said Siddarth Gothi, chairman of the Botswana Diamond Manufacturers Association.",
      "The gems emerged in the 1950s for industrial use. By the 1970s they had reached jewelry quality. Lab-grown stones now sell for up to 80% less than natural diamonds. Once making up just 1% of global sales in 2015, they have surged to nearly 20%.",
      "Glitzy social media videos have fueled the appeal of synthetic gems made in weeks under intense heat and pressure and marketed as cheaper, conflict-free and eco-friendly alternatives to stones formed over billions of years.",

      "The shift is felt beyond Botswana. Across southern Africa, falling production of natural diamonds and revenue have led to job cuts and financial strain.",
      "To counter the trend, Botswana, Angola, Namibia, South Africa and Congo in June agreed to pool 1% of annual diamond revenues, translating into millions of dollars, into a global marketing push led by the Natural Diamond Council to promote natural stones.

      "Hong Kong\u2019s deadliest fire in decades is raising questions about corruption and negligence in the renovations of the apartment complex where at least 128 people died",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's deadliest fire in decades has raised questions about corruption and negligence in the renovations of the apartment complex where at least 128 people died.",
      "An intense fire broke out at Wang Fuk Court complex in Hong Kong's northern suburbs Wednesday afternoon, with flames covering seven of eight of the towers. The complex was home to some 4,800 residents, some of whom had raised safety concerns about the renovations more than year before the fire.",
      "Police on Wednesday arrested three men from a construction company on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence. They are now out on bail. Authorities then arrested seven men and one woman, ranging in age from 40 to 63, including scaffolding subcontractors, directors of an engineering consultant company and project managers supervising the renovation, in a corruption probe.",
      "Police have not identified the company where the suspects worked, but documents posted to the homeowners association\u2019s website showed that the Prestige Construction & Engineering Company was in charge of renovations. Police have seized boxes of documents from the company, where phones rang unanswered Thursday.",
      "Officials also said they were investigating the materials used, both the netting on the scaffolding and the foam panels, and their role in the blaze.",
      "For almost a year, some residents at the Wang Fuk Court complex had been raising safety concerns to Hong Kong authorities about the construction netting being used in the renovation project, according to documents reviewed by the AP, specifically about the netting that covered the scaffolding.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s labor department in a statement on Saturday confirmed they had received such complaints, adding that officials had carried out 16 inspections of Wang Fuk Court\u2019s renovation project since July 2024, and had warned contractors multiple times via writing that they must ensure they met fire safety requirements.",
      "The labor department said they had reviewed the product quality certificate of the netting and that it was in line with standards.",
      "Those very materials are now of great interest after preliminary investigations showed the fire started on a lower-level scaffolding net of one of the buildings. It then spread rapidly as the foam panels caught fire, said Chris Tang, the city's secretary for security. Police also said they had been looking at highly flammable foam panels.",
      "\u201cThe blaze ignited the foam panels, causing the glass to shatter and leading to a swift intensification of the fire and its spread into the interior spaces,\u201d Tang said.",
      "Further, first responders found that some fire alarms in the complex, which housed many older people, did not sound when tested, said Andy Yeung, the director of Hong Kong Fire Services, though he did not say how many were not working or if others were.",
      "It took firefighters a day to bring the fire under control, and it was not fully extinguished until Friday morning \u2014 some 40 hours after it started.",
      "Crews prioritized apartments from which they had received emergency calls during the blaze but were unable to reach in the hours that the fire burned out of control, Derek Armstrong Chan, a deputy director of Hong Kong Fire Services, told reporters.",

      "The online sale of the disputed dolls in Sweden came to the public's attention after the child protection group ChildX filed a police report against Amazon and several other e-commerce platforms earlier this month over the sale of sex dolls with a clear childlike appearance.",

      "After 12 years of the conservative National party, whose last president Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez is serving a prison sentence in the U.S., and now four years of Castro\u2019s democratic socialist Libre, Hondurans have tried both ends of the political spectrum and neither has satisfied their basic demands for jobs and safety.",
      "In addition to Moncada, 60, who served as Castro\u2019s finance and later defense secretary before leaving to run for president, polls indicate two other candidates have a chance to win Sunday when Hondurans will also elect a new Congress. The now perennial candidate, Salvador Nasralla, is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the Liberal Party. And former Tegucigalpa Mayor Nasry \u201cTito\u201d Asfura, carries the mantle of the National Party.",
      "The candidates have all been light on policy specifics during the campaign, instead spending their time preemptively accusing their rivals of manipulating the vote.",

      "Nasralla, 72, who joined Castro\u2019s ticket in the last election and briefly served as a vice president, has focused on rooting out corruption in his campaign discourse. The former television personality still casts himself as the outsider despite having allied himself with various parties over the years. He too has warned of fraud ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote.",
      "Asfura, 67, is making his second run for president for the conservative National Party. He ran Tegucigalpa for eight years as mayor and presents himself as a practical builder who can address Honduras\u2019 infrastructure needs. But he has previously been accused of embezzling public funds, allegations that he denies.",
      "After irregularities were reported during a test run of the preliminary election results system earlier this month, which allows electoral authorities to present preliminary results within hours of polls closing, Moncada said she would not recognize them.",
      "The rhetoric undermining the election\u2019s legitimacy has worried observers.",

      "Castro took office in January 2022, with high expectations as Honduras\u2019 first woman to be elected president and a radical departure from Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s thoroughly discredited National party.",

      "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has met Russian President Vladimir Putin for talks at the Kremlin",
      "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Friday, once again shunning efforts by his European Union partners to isolate Moscow over its invasion of neighboring Ukraine nearly four years ago.",
      "The trip to Moscow is the second since last year for Orb\u00e1n, who is widely considered Putin\u2019s closest partner among all EU leaders. Hungary is one of only a few EU countries to continue importing large quantities of Russian fossil fuels, and Orb\u00e1n has strongly opposed efforts by the bloc to wean its 27 member nations off Russian energy supplies.",
      "\u201cWe have important areas of cooperation, and we haven\u2019t given up on any area of that cooperation, no matter the external pressure,\u201d Orb\u00e1n said. \u201cRussian energy forms the basis of Hungary\u2019s energy supply, now and in the future.\u201d",
      "Orb\u00e1n has long argued for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine but without outlining what that might mean for the country\u2019s territorial integrity or future security. That stance has dismayed Hungary\u2019s EU and NATO allies, who accuse Russia of breaking international law and threatening the security of Eastern European countries.",
      "In his opening remarks at the Kremlin talks, Putin noted Obran\u2019s \u201cbalanced position\u201d on the war in Ukraine.",
      "Earlier this month, Orb\u00e1n traveled to Washington for a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and succeeded in securing an exemption to sanctions the Trump administration placed on Russian energy companies Lukoil and Rosneft \u2014 an allowance Orb\u00e1n said ensured Hungary\u2019s continued energy security.",
      "Orb\u00e1n said Friday that following Hungary's exemption from U.S. sanctions, \u201cnow all we need is oil and gas, which we can buy from the Russians. I am going there to ensure Hungary\u2019s energy supply at an affordable price both this winter and next year.\u201d",
      "Orb\u00e1n has long argued Russian energy imports are indispensable for his country\u2019s economy, and that switching to fossil fuels sourced from elsewhere would cause an immediate economic collapse \u2014 a claim some critics dispute. As the rest of Europe has gradually cut off Russian energy, Hungary has maintained and even increased its imports, and argued against an EU plan to eliminate all Russian fossil fuels by the end of 2027.",
      "The Trump administration has said it is seeing signs that its sanctions on major Russian oil producers are crimping the economic engine that has allowed Moscow to continue to fund its war in Ukraine. Prices for Russian oil have plunged as major Indian and Chinese buyers moved to comply with U.S. sanctions before they went into effect last week, according to a senior Treasury Department official.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump last week released a plan for ending the nearly four-year war. The 28-point proposal heavily favored Russia, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to quickly engage with American negotiators. European leaders, fearing for their own future facing Russian aggression, scrambled to steer the negotiations toward accommodating their concerns.",
      "Trump said Tuesday that his plan to end the war had been \u201cfine-tuned\u201d, and that he\u2019s sending envoy Steve Witkoff to Russia to meet with Putin and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll to meet with Ukrainian officials. He suggested he could eventually meet with Putin and Zelenskyy, but not until further progress has been made in negotiations.",

      "The areas were largely cut off by damaged roads and downed communications lines, and relief aircraft were delivering aid and supplies to the hard-hit district of Central Tapanuli in North Sumatra province and elsewhere in the region.

      "Ukrainians in the southern city of Kherson live in constant fear of Russian drone attacks",
      "KHERSON, Ukraine -- When Olena Horlova leaves home or drives through town outside the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, she fears that she's a target. She believes that Russian drones could be waiting on a rooftop, along the road or aiming for her car.",
      "To protect herself and her two daughters, the girls stay indoors, and she stays alert \u2014 sometimes returning home at night along dark roads without headlights so as not to be seen.",
      "After living through the occupation, refusing to cooperate with Russian forces and hiding from them, Horlova, like so many other residents, found that even after her town was liberated in 2022, the ordeal didn't end.",
      "Kherson was among the first places where Russian forces began using short-range, first-person view, or FPV, drones against civilians. The drones are equipped with livestreaming cameras that let operators see and select their targets in real time. The tactic later spread more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) along the right bank of the Dnipro River, across the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions.",
      "The United Nations' Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks leave little doubt about their intent. In an October report, the commission said that the attacks have repeatedly killed and wounded civilians, destroyed homes and forced thousands to flee, concluding that they amount to the crimes against humanity of murder and forcible transfer.",
      "\u201cWe live with the hope that one day this will finally end,\u201d Horlova said, her voice trembling. \u201cWhat matters for us is a cease-fire, or for the front line to be pushed further away. Then it would be easier for us.\u201d",
      "Horlova lives in Komyshany, a village just outside Kherson and only 4 kilometers (2\u00bd miles) from the Dnipro River, where the level of intense attacks has remained the same, despite Ukrainian forces retaking the city from Russian occupation in November 2022 \u2014 about nine months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 of that year.",
      "But the war didn't end there. Instead, it shifted into a phase in which the area has effectively become what locals and the military term a \u201chuman safari,\u201d describing it as a testing ground where people are often the target of drone attacks.",
      "Horlova says that FPVs often land on rooftops when their batteries run low and then wait out.",
      "\u201cWhen people, cars or even a cyclist appear, the drone suddenly lifts off and drops the explosive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where they even drop them on animals \u2014 cows, goats.\u201d",
      "She believes that civilians are hunted as \u201crevenge\u201d for the celebrations that broke out when Kherson was liberated.",
      "The report from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks have spread terror among civilians and violated their right to life and other fundamental human rights. Investigators found that Russian units on the occupied left bank of the Dnipro carried out the strikes and identified specific drone units, operators and commanders involved. They also noted that Russian Telegram channels routinely share videos of the attacks, often with mocking captions and threats of more.",
      "The U.N. commission said that it examined Russian claims that Ukrainian forces had launched drone attacks on civilians in occupied areas, unable to conclude its investigation because it lacked access to the territory, couldn't ensure witness safety and didn't receive answers from Russian authorities.",
      "Interceptions obtained by The Associated Press from the 310th Separate Marine Electronic Warfare Battalion show Russian FPV drones that appear to be hunting for vehicles. The videos capture drones flying low over roads and locking onto moving or parked cars \u2014 often pickups, supply vehicles, sedans and even clearly marked ambulances \u2014 before diving for a strike.",
      "The commander of the 310th Battalion, which protects the skies over 470 kilometers (nearly 300 miles) of southern Ukraine, including Kherson, says at least 300 drones fly toward the city every day. In October alone, the number of drones that flew over Kherson was 9,000.",
      "\u201cThis area is like a training ground,\u201d said the battalion\u2019s commander, Dmytro Liashok, a 16-year military veteran and one of Ukraine\u2019s early pioneers in electronic warfare. \u201cThey bring new Russian crews here to gain experience before sending them elsewhere.\u201d The AP couldn't independently verify the claim.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Black Friday bargains no longer tempt people to leave Thanksgiving tables for midnight mall runs. Brawls in store aisles over toys and TVs with limited-time discounts are spectacles of holidays past. Online shopping and retailers launching discounts weeks before the turkey feast subdued that kind of fervor.",
      "But the sales event still has enough enthusiasts to make the day after Thanksgiving the one when U.S. stores get the most shoppers coming in the door. For that reason, Black Friday still rules as the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season.",
      "This year's kickoff comes as consumer confidence in the U.S. economy fell this month in the aftermath of the federal government shutdown, weak hiring and stubborn inflation, according to a report The Conference Board issued Tuesday.",
      "Many retail executives have reported customers becoming more discerning and increasingly focused on deals while at the same time remaining willing to splash out for important occasions like the start of the school year and the winter holidays, creating a halo effect.",
      "\u201cConsumers have been saying the economy is terrible while continuing to spend for years now, so the outlook is probably better than they are telling us,\u201d Bill Adams, the chief economist at Comerica Bank, said this week of shoppers' moods heading into Black Friday. \"But business surveys also report consumers are being more sensitive to prices and selective in spending.\"",
      "While planning for the holidays in the spring and summer, retail companies were wrestling with the volatility of President Donald Trump \u2019s wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Many accelerated shipments of some merchandise before the tariffs took effect or decided to absorb some of the import tax costs instead of raising prices for customers.",
      "Market research firm Circana said that 40% of all general merchandise sold in September saw a price increase of at least 5% compared with the first four months of the year.",
      "Toys, baby products, housewares, and team sports equipment were among the hardest hit categories. For example, 83% of toys sold in September saw an increase of at least 5%, Circana said. Industry group The Toy Association says nearly 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. are made in China, a country the Trump administration hit with especially high tariffs at various points this year.",
      "Still, analysts and mall executives cited solid momentum heading into Black Friday week. At the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, foot traffic in recent weeks surpassed the numbers from pre-pandemic 2019, said Jill Renslow, the mall's chief business development and marketing officer.",

      "Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods, predicted a 3.6% increase in holiday sales from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase last year.",

      "THC-infused drinks and snacks have soared in popularity as alcohol sales have declined in recent years",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The production lines at Indeed Brewing moved quickly, the cans filling not with beer, but with THC-infused seltzer. The product, which features the compound that gets cannabis users high, has been a lifeline at Indeed and other craft breweries as alcohol sales have fallen in recent years.",
      "But that boom looks set to come to a crashing halt. Buried in the bill that ended the federal government shutdown this month was a provision to ban those drinks, along with other impairing beverages and snacks made from hemp, which have proliferated across the country in recent years. Now the $24 billion hemp industry is scrambling to save itself before the provision takes effect in November 2026.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\" said Ryan Bandy, Indeed's chief business officer. \"It would be a mess for our breweries, for our industry, and obviously for a lot of people who like these things.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know about the looming ban on impairing products derived from hemp.",
      "Marijuana and hemp are the same species. Marijuana is cultivated for high levels of THC in its flowers. Low-THC hemp is grown for its sturdy fibers, food or wellness products. \u201cRope, not dope\u201d was long the motto of farmers who supported legalizing hemp.",
      "After states began legalizing marijuana for adult use over a decade ago, hemp advocates saw an opening at the federal level. As part of the 2018 farm bill, Congress legalized the cultivation of industrial hemp to give farmers, including in Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell's home state of Kentucky, a new cash crop.",
      "But the way that law defined hemp \u2014 as having less than 0.3% of a specific type of THC, called delta-9 \u2014 opened a huge loophole. Beverages or bags of snacks could meet that threshold and still contain more than enough THC to get people high. Businesses could further exploit the law by extracting a non-impairing compound, called CBD, and chemically changing it into other types of impairing THC, such as delta-8 or delta-10.",
      "The result? Vape oil, gummy candies, chips, cookies, sodas and other unregulated, untested products laden with hemp-derived THC spread around the country. In many places, they have been available at gas stations or convenience stores, even to teens. In legal marijuana states, they undercut heavily taxed and regulated products. In others, they evaded the prohibition on recreational use of weed.",
      "Some states, including Indiana, have reported spikes in calls to poison-control centers for pediatric exposure to THC.",
      "Dozens of states have since taken steps to regulate or ban impairing hemp products. In October, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill banning the sale of intoxicating hemp products outside the state's legal marijuana system.",
      "Texas, which has a massive hemp market, is moving to regulate sales of impairing hemp, such as by restricting them to those over 21. In Nebraska, lawmakers have instead considered a bill to criminalize the sale and possession of products containing hemp-based THC.",
      "Washington state adopted a program to regulate hemp growing. But the number of licensed growers has cratered since the state banned intoxicating hemp products outside of the regulated cannabis market in 2023. Five years ago, there were 220, said Trecia Ehrlich, cannabis program manager with the state agriculture department. This year, there were 42, and with a federal ban looming, she expects that number to drop by about half next year.",
      "Minnesota made infused beverages and foods legal in 2022 for people 21 and older. The products, which must be derived from legally certified hemp, have become so popular that Target is now offering THC drinks at some of its stores in the state.",
      "They've also been a boon to liquor stores and to small Minneapolis brewers like Indeed, where THC drinks make up close to one-quarter of the business, Bandy said. At Bauhaus Brew Labs, a few blocks away, THC drinks account for 26% of their revenues from distributed products and 11% of revenues at the brewery\u2019s taproom.",
      "None of that was what McConnell intended when he helped craft the 2018 farm bill. He finally closed the loophole by inserting a federal hemp THC ban in the measure to end the 43-day federal government shutdown, approved by the Senate on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cIt will keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children, while preserving the hemp industry for farmers,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIndustrial hemp and CBD will remain legal for industrial applications.\u201d",

That has given the industry hope that there is still time to pass regulations that will improve the hemp THC industry \u2014 such as by banning synthetically derived THC, requiring age restrictions on sales, and prohibiting marketing to children \u2014 rather than eradicate it.",

Klobuchar noted at a recent news conference that the ban was inserted into the unrelated shutdown bill without a hearing. She suggested the federal government could allow states to develop their own regulatory frameworks, or that Minnesota's strict regulations could be used as a national model.",

      "Valuable eels are in decline all over the world, leading to a new push for restrictions on trade to try to help stave off extinction",
      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- Eels are the stuff of nightmares \u2014 slimy, snakelike creatures that lay millions of eggs before dying so their offspring can return home to rivers and streams. They've existed since the time of the dinosaurs, and some species are more poorly understood than those ancient animals.",
      "Yet they're also valuable seafood fish that are declining all over the world, leading to a new push for restrictions on trade to help stave off extinction.",
      "Freshwater eels are critically important for the worldwide sushi industry, and some species have declined by more than 90% since the 1980s. The eels have succumbed to a combination of river dams, hydroelectric turbines, pollution, habitat loss, climate change, illegal poaching and overfishing, according to scientists. Some environmental organizations have called for consumers to boycott eel at sushi restaurants.",
      "The loss of eels motivated the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES, to consider new restrictions to protect the wriggling fish. The members of CITES, an international treaty, met in Uzbekistan this week to determine if the new rules on trade are needed. Member nations voted against the new protections on Thursday.",
      "Conservation groups said the protections were long overdue, but not everyone was on board. Some fishing groups, seafood industry members and regulatory agencies in the U.S., China and Japan \u2014 all countries where eel is economically important \u2014 have spoken out against restricting the trade.",
      "The push for more restrictions is the work of \u201can international body dominated by volunteer scientists and unelected bureaucrats,\" said Mitchell Feigenbaum, one of North America's largest eel dealers and an advocate for the industry. But several conservation groups countered that the protections were needed.",
      "\u201cThis measure is vital to strengthen trade monitoring, aid fisheries management, and ensure the species\u2019 long-term survival,\" said Susan Lieberman, vice president of international policy for Wildlife Conservation Society.",
      "The eels in question are the eels of the anguilla genus, which spend their lives in freshwater but migrate to the ocean to spawn. They are distinct from the familiar, grinning moray eels, which are popular in aquariums and are mostly marine fish, and the electric eels, which live in South America.",
      "Anguilla eels, especially baby eels called elvers, are valuable because they are used as seed stock by Asian aquaculture companies that raise them to maturity for use as food. Freshwater eel is known as unagi in Japan, and it's a key ingredient in numerous sushi dishes. Eel is also culturally significant in Japan, where people have eaten the fish for thousands of years.",
      "The elvers have become more valuable in the U.S. over the last 15 years because of the steep decline of eels elsewhere in the world. While the population of American eels has fallen, the drop has not been as severe as Japanese and European eels. Attempts to list American eels under the Endangered Species Act in the U.S. have failed.",
      "Maine is the only U.S. state with a significant fishery for the elvers, and it is heavily regulated. Maine's baby eels were worth more than $1,200 per pound at the docks in 2024, and they were worth more than $2,000 per pound the year before that.",
      "CITES, which is one of the world's largest multinational wildlife agreements, extended protections to European eels in 2009. The organization considered adding more than a dozen more eel species, including the American and Japanese eels, to its list of protected species.",
      "Adding the eels to the list would mean exporters would need a permit to ship them. Before the permit could be granted, a scientific authority in the home country would have to determine that the export would not be detrimental to the species' survival and that the eels weren\u2019t taken illegally under national wildlife laws. That is significant because poaching of eels is a major threat, and rare species are often illegally passed off as more common ones, CITES documents state.",

      "Japan and China have both told CITES that they don't support listing the eels. And in the U.S., the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, which regulates the American eel fishery, submitted testimony to CITES opposing the listing.",

      "A coalition of industry groups in China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan also submitted a request that the protection be rejected, saying CITES' assertion that international trade is causing eel populations to decline is \u201cnot supported by sufficient evidence.\u201d",
      "The strong demand for eels is a reason to protect the trade with new rules, said Nastya Timoshyna, office director for Europe with TRAFFIC, a U.K.-based nonprofit that fights wildlife trafficking.",

      "Britain's Treasury chief Rachel Reeves is on her way to deliver a crucial tax-raising budget statement to lawmakers",
      "LONDON -- Britain's Treasury chief Rachel Reeves left her offices at No. 11 Downing Street Wednesday to deliver a crucial tax-raising budget statement to lawmakers that she hopes will manage to please financial markets, businesses and jaded voters at the same time.",
      "Following weeks of speculation and mixed signals that unsettled the markets, Reeves held out her red ministerial briefcase to the awaiting media, as is custom and tradition.",
      "The budget, her second since Britain's center-left Labour government returned to power after 14 years with a landslide election victory in July 2024, could prove pivotal in the fortunes of both Reeves and her boss, Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Reeves is set to tell lawmakers that more tax-raising measures are necessary to plug a hole in the public finances. In a video statement before she headed to the House of Commons, Reeves said she would \u201ctake the fair and necessary choices\u201d to ease the cost of living, safeguard public services and keep debt under control.",
      "\u201cAnd I will push ahead with the biggest drive for growth in a generation,\" she said.",
      "Reeves, the first woman to hold the post of chancellor of the exchequer, said much the same at her first budget a little more than a year ago. She insisted at the time it would be the one and only big tax-raising budget in this parliamentary term, which is due to run to 2029.",
      "Unfortunately for Reeves, the British economy, the world's sixth-largest, is not doing as well as she hoped, with many critics blaming her decision last year to slap taxes on business. Though there were signs that the economy was on the mend in the first half the year, when it was the fastest-growing among the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, it has faltered again.",
      "\u201cThe chancellor faces a delicate balancing act of conveying fiscal stability while advancing the growth agenda,\u201d said Peter Arnold, chief economist at consulting firm EY U.K.",
      "False dawns have been a regular feature of the British economy since the global financial crisis of 2008-9. If the economy had kept growing at precrisis levels, it would be nearly a quarter bigger than it is now. That's a lot of lost activity \u2014 and a lot of lost tax revenue going into the Treasury's coffers.",

      "In addition to the long-term costs of the financial crisis, Britain\u2019s public finances, like those of other nations, have been further squeezed by the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s global tariffs. The U.K. bears the extra burden of Brexit, which has knocked billions off the economy since the country left the European Union in 2020.",
      "Meanwhile, Reeves has a bunch of spending commitments aimed at easing the cost of living as inflation remains stubbornly high, including making up for a series of about-turns on planned welfare cuts and the likely ditching of a cap on benefits paid out to families with several children. That and measures such as freezing rail fares or cutting green taxes on energy bills don't come cheap.",
      "All in all, economists think that she will have to find something like 20-30 billion pounds ($26-39 billion). After flirting with the idea of hiking income tax rates, which would break a key Labour election promise, Reeves now looks likely to raise money from smaller, and more fiddly, taxes.",
      "The main measure anticipated is a further freeze in the levels at which earners pay Britain's different tax levels, meaning as wages rise more people fall into higher tax brackets. Other potential changes include a mansion tax on high-valued properties, changes to the capital tax regime and a cut to tax-free provisions for private pensions.",
      "The budget is a high-stakes moment for Reeves and Starmer, who is facing mounting concern from Labour lawmakers over his dire poll ratings. Opinion polls consistently put Labour well behind the hard-right Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage.",
      "The next election does not have to be held until 2029, and the government continues to hope that its economic measures will spur higher growth and ease financial pressures.",
      "But speculation is swirling about a potential challenge to Starmer's leadership from within his party, and analysts say a misfiring budget could add to the sense of crisis within the government.",

      "BANGKOK -- A court in Thailand said Wednesday that it has issued an arrest warrant for a co-owner of the Miss Universe Organization in connection with a fraud case.",
      "Jakkaphong \u201cAnne\u201d Jakrajutatip was charged with fraud then released on bail in 2023. She failed to appear as required in a Bangkok court on Tuesday. Since she did not notify the court about her absence, she was deemed to be a flight risk, according to a statement from the Bangkok South District Court.",
      "The court rescheduled the hearing for Dec. 26.",
      "According to the court\u2019s statement, Jakkaphong and her company, JKN Global Group Public Co. Ltd., were sued for allegedly defrauding Raweewat Maschamadol in selling him the company\u2019s corporate bonds in 2023. Raweewat says the investment caused him to lose 30 million baht ($930,362).",
      "Financially troubled JKN defaulted on payments to investors beginning in 2023 and began debt rehabilitation procedures with the Central Bankruptcy Court in 2024. The company says it has debts totaling about 3 billion baht ($93 million).",
      "JKN acquired the rights to the Miss Universe pageant from IMG Worldwide LLC in 2022. In 2023, it sold 50% of its Miss Universe shares to Legacy Holding Group USA, which is owned by a Mexican businessman, Ra\u00fal Rocha Cant\u00fa.",
      "Jakkaphong, who is transgender, resigned from all of the company\u2019s positions in June after being accused by Thailand\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission of falsifying the company\u2019s 2023 financial statements. She remains its largest shareholder.",

Two judges reportedly dropped out, with one suggesting that there was an element of rigging to the contest. Separately, Thai police investigated allegations that publicity for the event included illegal promotion of online casinos.",

    "summary": "Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott is one of the world&rsquo;s wealthiest women",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott is one of the world\u2019s wealthiest women",
      "NEW YORK -- MacKenzie Scott, one of the world's wealthiest women and most influential philanthropists, is now known for her \u201cno strings attached\u201d surprise grantmaking. But, as a Princeton University sophomore, she learned what it was like to be on the receiving end of generosity.",
      "Facing the prospect of dropping out if she couldn't come up with $1,000, Scott was crying when her roommate, Jeannie Tarkenton, found her and got her dad to loan Scott the money.",
      "\u201cI would have given MacKenzie my left kidney,\u201d Tarkenton told the Associated Press recently. \u201cLike, that\u2019s just what you do for friends.\u201d",
      "Today, Scott\u2019s net worth is around $34 billion, according to Forbes. In October, Scott wrote that Tarkenton's act is among the many personal kindnesses she has considered as she has donated more than $19 billion of the wealth she amassed mostly through Amazon shares as part of her 2019 divorce from company founder Jeff Bezos. And when Tarkenton started Funding U, a lending company that offers last-gap, merit-based loans to low-income students without co-signers, Scott said she jumped at the chance to help.",
      "A quarter century passed between the end of their sophomore year and Funding U's creation, a period when Tarkenton realized just how many more students were being pushed into her former roommate's position by the rising cost of college. That Scott took an interest in her old friend's mission to help economically disadvantaged students finance school is unsurprising. Her unusual gifts \u2014 which she rarely discusses or discloses outside of essays and a database on her website, Yield Giving \u2014 tend to focus on issues of equity, higher education and economic security.",
      "But the revelation of Scott's Funding U support offers a new glimpse into her investments. Scott wrote last year that she would invest in \u201cmission-aligned ventures\u201d led by \u201cundercapitalized groups\u201d that focus on \u201cfor-profit solutions\u201d to the challenges that her philanthropy seeks to address. However, this is among the few confirmed publicly.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s looking for innovative ways to create opportunity for those that don\u2019t have it,\" said Marybeth Gasman, who runs Rutgers\u2019 Center for Minority Serving Institutions and follows Scott\u2019s donations. \"I have to say, as somebody who went to school on a Pell Grant and who came from an extremely low-income family, that\u2019s really meaningful.\u201d",
      "Scott, in many ways, resembled the exact students that Funding U seeks to serve. Tarkenton recalled the undergraduate Scott as a \u201chardworking student with very good grades\u201d who was \u201chighly focused\" and had already been accepted into a competitive program.",
      "Her lending company plugs those sorts of details \u2014 student transcripts and internship experiences, for example\u2014 into an algorithm that determines the likelihood applicants will complete college, get a job and make enough money to pay back the loan.",
      "Tarkenton suggested that this formula is fairer \u2014 and more predictive \u2014 than existing criteria that determine loan eligibility based on the credit histories of students or their co-signers.",
      "Scott provides most of the \u201cjunior debt\u201d they use to reduce the risk for larger investments from banks such as Goldman Sachs, according to Tarkenton. She is among a handful of philanthropists who provide 30 cents for every dollar that Funding U loans. These funders lend at concessionary rates, meaning they make less money back than the market suggests they should and wait a longer period of time to recoup the money.",
      "Funding U gets the other 70% from banks, who support them to comply with federal laws aimed at preventing anti-poor discrimination by requiring banks to make loans that benefit their communities.",
      "\u201cI wanted to combine capital from people who were participating in this because they cared about the underlying person,\u201d Tarkenton said, \u201cand also, knowing that scale of philanthropy wasn\u2019t quite big enough, bring to the table some sort of market solution alongside that capital.\u201d",

      "But the approach represents a model that Scott's former roommate thinks more philanthropists should embrace. Tarkenton said there's more space for the likes of Scott to \u201cbring a spirit of investment\u201d that serves a \u201cgreater good\u201d but isn't purely charitable.",
      "\u201cI think philanthropists can get a little messier and do more with their money,\" Tarkenton said. \u201cI\u2019m all about pushing philanthropists in a very aligned way.\u201d",
      "It's why she started Funding U. Working at an Atlanta-based adult literacy nonprofit, Tarkenton said she noticed persistent disparities in degree completion rates based on socioeconomic status. She found the problem too big for philanthropy to solve. But the need was too small for most market players to care about addressing, she said.",

      "And the full circle impact of Tarkenton's college-era loan?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really lovely story in a time when we\u2019re not seeing a lot of kindness and generosity,\" Fitzgerald added. \"And just a reminder that helping your fellow humans is both a good thing to do at the time and something that could have a massive impact down the road.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration says pharmaceutical companies have agreed to slash the Medicare prices for 15 prescription drugs after months of negotiations and that it's expected to produce billions in savings for older adults",
      "NEW YORK -- Pharmaceutical companies have agreed to slash the Medicare prices for 15 prescription drugs after months of negotiations, reductions that are expected to produce billions in savings for taxpayers and older adults, the Trump administration said.",
      "But the net prices it unveiled for a 30-day supply of each drug are not what Medicare recipients will pay at their pharmacy counters, since those final amounts will depend on each individual\u2019s plan and how much they spend on prescriptions in a given year.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. touted the deals as part of the administration\u2019s efforts to address affordability concerns among Americans. The Medicare drug negotiation program that made them possible is mandated by law and began under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump directed us to stop at nothing to lower health care costs for the American people,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Tuesday evening. \u201cAs we work to Make America Healthy Again, we will use every tool at our disposal to deliver affordable health care to seniors.\u201d",
      "The announcement marks the completion of a second round of negotiations under a 2022 law that allows Medicare to haggle over the price it pays on the most popular and expensive prescription drugs used by older Americans, bringing the total number of negotiated drug prices to 25. The new round of negotiated prices will go into effect in 2027. Reduced prices for the inaugural round of 10 drugs negotiated by the Biden administration last year will go into effect in January.",
      "The latest negotiated prices apply to some of the prescription medications on which Medicare spends the most money, including the massively popular GLP-1 weight-loss and diabetes drugs Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy. Some of the other drugs involved in the negotiations include Trelegy Ellipta, which treats asthma; Otezla, a psoriatic arthritis drug; and various drugs that treat diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome and different forms of cancer.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, said the administration delivered \u201csubstantially better outcomes for taxpayers and seniors in the Medicare Part D program\u201d than the previous year's deals.",
      "Under the first round of Medicare price negotiations, the Biden administration said the program would have saved about $6 billion on net covered prescription drug costs, or about 22%, if it had been in effect the previous year.

      "It\u2019s unclear exactly how much money the newly announced deals could save Medicare beneficiaries when they are buying prescription drugs at the pharmacy because those costs are determined by various individual factors.",
      "A new rule that kicked off this year also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries at $2,000, giving some relief to older adults affected by high-cost prescriptions. The administration said estimated out-of-pocket savings for Medicare beneficiaries with drug plans is about $685 million.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Black Friday may no longer be the retail bacchanalia of years past, when the promise of one-time bargains caused people to leave Thanksgiving tables for malls where some customers got into fistfights over toys or TVs. But the event still has enough enthusiasts to make it the biggest shopping day in the U.S.",
      "For that reason, the day retains its crown as the official start of the holiday shopping season. This year's kickoff comes as companies navigate an uncertain economic environment and wrestle with the volatility of President Donald Trump 's wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods.",
      "Many have absorbed some of the costs and pulled back on hiring instead of raising prices for customers. Consumer confidence in the U.S. economy fell this month to the lowest since April \u2014 when Trump announced his tariffs \u2014 in the aftermath of the government shutdown, weak hiring and stubborn inflation, according to a report The Conference Board issued Tuesday.",
      "Shoppers nonetheless have remained resilient and willing to spend, at least judging by the solid quarterly sales reports from Walmart, Best Buy and other retailers. But many retail executives also say customers are focusing on deals and have been selective in what they're buying.",
      "Aron Boxer, 50, from Greenwich, Connecticut, said he delayed buying a car this year amid worries about tariffs. He said he'll be looking for deals on toys on Cyber Monday but is also willing to wait to the end for the best discount.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs definitely are not behind me, and I am concerned about it,\" the founder of an educational services company and a life coaching service said. \u201cI did consider buying earlier this year, but I feel like some people made some pretty bad business decisions anticipating tariffs to have a bigger impact than they did.\u201d",
      "Still, analysts and mall executives cited solid momentum heading into Black Friday week.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing a very positive start to the holiday season,\" said Jill Renslow, chief business development and marketing officer at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, which plans to give gift cards and other giveaways to the first 250 customers who show up at 7 a.m. on Friday. \u201cThe last few Saturdays in November have been very strong.\u201d",

      "Tariffs have played a role in stores' merchandising and pricing strategies. Many retailers accelerated shipments of some holiday merchandise before the tariffs took effect while also absorbing some of the extra import costs. But stores still have passed on some of the expense for items like toys, which are largely sourced in China.",

      "As with its tariffs on Australian wines in 2020, and restrictions on Philippine banana imports in 2012, Beijing is using its economic clout to pressure Tokyo while also hurling a torrent of invective at its government. The only question is how far China will go and how long the measures will last.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s countermeasures are all kept secret and will be rolled out one by one,\u201d said Liu Jiangyong, an international relations professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing. \u201cEverything is possible, because this involves the core of the nation\u2019s core interests.\u201d",

      "It's not the first time Japan has faced China's economic wrath. In 2012, protesters attacked Japanese businesses in China and boycotted their goods after a dispute erupted over a group of uninhabited islands that both countries claim. Group tours to Japan were canceled.",
      "Based on what happened then, when Chinese visitors fell by one-fourth, Nomura Research Institute economist Takahide Kiuchi has estimated the current travel advisory could cost Japan 1.8 trillion yen ($11.5 billion), knocking 0.3 percentage points off its already low annual economic growth.",

      "Ukrainians in the southern city of Kherson live in constant fear of Russian drone attacks",
      "KHERSON, Ukraine -- When Olena Horlova leaves home or drives through town outside the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, she fears that she's a target. She believes that Russian drones could be waiting on a rooftop, along the road or aiming for her car.",
      "To protect herself and her two daughters, the girls stay indoors, and she stays alert \u2014 sometimes returning home at night along dark roads without headlights so as not to be seen.",
      "After living through the occupation, refusing to cooperate with Russian forces and hiding from them, Horlova, like so many other residents, found that even after her town was liberated in 2022, the ordeal didn't end.",
      "Kherson was among the first places where Russian forces began using short-range, first-person view, or FPV, drones against civilians. The drones are equipped with livestreaming cameras that let operators see and select their targets in real time. The tactic later spread more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) along the right bank of the Dnipro River, across the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions.",
      "The United Nations' Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks leave little doubt about their intent. In an October report, the commission said that the attacks have repeatedly killed and wounded civilians, destroyed homes and forced thousands to flee, concluding that they amount to the crimes against humanity of murder and forcible transfer.",
      "\u201cWe live with the hope that one day this will finally end,\u201d Horlova said, her voice trembling. \u201cWhat matters for us is a cease-fire, or for the front line to be pushed further away. Then it would be easier for us.\u201d",
      "Horlova lives in Komyshany, a village just outside Kherson and only 4 kilometers (2\u00bd miles) from the Dnipro River, where the level of intense attacks has remained the same, despite Ukrainian forces retaking the city from Russian occupation in November 2022 \u2014 about nine months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 of that year.",
      "But the war didn't end there. Instead, it shifted into a phase in which the area has effectively become what locals and the military term a \u201chuman safari,\u201d describing it as a testing ground where people are often the target of drone attacks.",
      "Horlova says that FPVs often land on rooftops when their batteries run low and then wait out.",
      "\u201cWhen people, cars or even a cyclist appear, the drone suddenly lifts off and drops the explosive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where they even drop them on animals \u2014 cows, goats.\u201d",
      "She believes that civilians are hunted as \u201crevenge\u201d for the celebrations that broke out when Kherson was liberated.",
      "The report from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks have spread terror among civilians and violated their right to life and other fundamental human rights. Investigators found that Russian units on the occupied left bank of the Dnipro carried out the strikes and identified specific drone units, operators and commanders involved. They also noted that Russian Telegram channels routinely share videos of the attacks, often with mocking captions and threats of more.",
      "The U.N. commission said that it examined Russian claims that Ukrainian forces had launched drone attacks on civilians in occupied areas, unable to conclude its investigation because it lacked access to the territory, couldn't ensure witness safety and didn't receive answers from Russian authorities.",
      "Interceptions obtained by The Associated Press from the 310th Separate Marine Electronic Warfare Battalion show Russian FPV drones that appear to be hunting for vehicles. The videos capture drones flying low over roads and locking onto moving or parked cars \u2014 often pickups, supply vehicles, sedans and even clearly marked ambulances \u2014 before diving for a strike.",
      "The commander of the 310th Battalion, which protects the skies over 470 kilometers (nearly 300 miles) of southern Ukraine, including Kherson, says at least 300 drones fly toward the city every day. In October alone, the number of drones that flew over Kherson was 9,000.",
      "\u201cThis area is like a training ground,\u201d said the battalion\u2019s commander, Dmytro Liashok, a 16-year military veteran and one of Ukraine\u2019s early pioneers in electronic warfare. \u201cThey bring new Russian crews here to gain experience before sending them elsewhere.\u201d The AP couldn't independently verify the claim.",

      "At one of Kherson\u2019s main hospitals treating drone victims, 70-year-old Nataliia Naumova is recovering after a strike by a Shahed drone, which carries a heavier explosive than FPV drones, left her with a blast injury to her left leg on Oct. 20.",

      "A federal judge called out an immigration enforcement agent for using artificial intelligence to write the narrative of a use-of-force report as just a small part of a scathing opinion that rebutted federal officials' narratives about appropriate force...",
      "Tucked in a two-sentence footnote in a voluminous court opinion, a federal judge recently called out immigration agents using artificial intelligence to write use-of-force reports, raising concerns that it could lead to inaccuracies and further erode public confidence in how police have handled the immigration crackdown in the Chicago area and ensuing protests.",
      "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis wrote the footnote in a 223-page opinion issued last week, noting that the practice of using ChatGPT to write use-of-force reports undermines the agents\u2019 credibility and \u201cmay explain the inaccuracy of these reports.\u201d She described what she saw in at least one body camera video, writing that an agent asks ChatGPT to compile a narrative for a report after giving the program a brief sentence of description and several images.",
      "The judge noted factual discrepancies between the official narrative about those law enforcement responses and what body camera footage showed. But experts say the use of AI to write a report that depends on an officer\u2019s specific perspective without using an officer\u2019s actual experience is the worst possible use of the technology and raises serious concerns about accuracy and privacy.",
      "Law enforcement agencies across the country have been grappling with how to create guardrails that allow officers to use the increasingly available AI technology while maintaining accuracy, privacy and professionalism. Experts said the example recounted in the opinion didn't meet that challenge.",
      "\u201cWhat this guy did is the worst of all worlds. Giving it a single sentence and a few pictures \u2014 if that\u2019s true, if that\u2019s what happened here \u2014 that goes against every bit of advice we have out there. It\u2019s a nightmare scenario,\u201d said Ian Adams, assistant criminology professor at the University of South Carolina who serves on a task force on artificial intelligence through the Council for Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment, and it was unclear if the agency had guidelines or policies on the use of AI by agents. The body camera footage cited in the order has not yet been released.",
      "Adams said few departments have put policies in place, but those that have often prohibit the use of predictive AI when writing reports justifying law enforcement decisions, especially use-of-force reports. Courts have established a standard referred to as objective reasonableness when considering whether a use of force was justified, relying heavily on the perspective of the specific officer in that specific scenario.",
      "\u201cWe need the specific articulated events of that event and the specific thoughts of that specific officer to let us know if this was a justified use of force,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThat is the worst case scenario, other than explicitly telling it to make up facts, because you\u2019re begging it to make up facts in this high-stakes situation.\u201d",
      "Besides raising concerns about an AI-generated report inaccurately characterizing what happened, the use of AI also raises potential privacy concerns.",
      "Katie Kinsey, chief of staff and tech policy counsel at the Policing Project at NYU School of Law, said if the agent in the order was using a public ChatGPT version, he probably didn't understand he lost control of the images the moment he uploaded them, allowing them to be part of the public domain and potentially used by bad actors.",
      "Kinsey said from a technology standpoint most departments are building the plane as it\u2019s being flown when it comes to AI. She said it\u2019s often a pattern in law enforcement to wait until new technologies are already being used and in some cases mistakes being made to then talk about putting guidelines or policies in place.",

We can start from transparency.\u201d",
      "Kinsey said while federal law enforcement considers how the technology should be used or not used, it could adopt a policy like those put in place in Utah or California recently, where police reports or communications written using AI have to be labeled.",
      "The photographs the officer used to generate a narrative also caused accuracy concerns for some experts.",
      "Well-known tech companies like Axon have begun offering AI components with their body cameras to assist in writing incident reports. Those AI programs marketed to police operate on a closed system and largely limit themselves to using audio from body cameras to produce narratives because the companies have said programs that attempt to use visuals are not effective enough for use.",
      "\u201cThere are many different ways to describe a color, or a facial expression or any visual component. You could ask any AI expert and they would tell you prompts return very different results between different AI applications, and that gets complicated with a visual component,\u201d said Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.",

      "Used to extract fossil fuels, the field is now getting a second lease on life as a means of permanently storing planet-warming carbon dioxide beneath the seabed.",
      "In a process that almost reverses oil extraction, chemical giant INEOS plans to inject liquefied CO2 deep down into depleted oil reservoirs, 1,800 meters (5,900 feet) beneath the seabed.",
      "The Associated Press made a rare visit to the Siri platform, close to the unmanned Nini field, the final stage in INEOS\u2019 carbon capture and storage efforts, named Greensand Future.",
      "When the project begins commercial operations next year, Greensand is expected to become the European Union\u2019s first fully-operational offshore CO2 storage site.",
      "Environmentalists say carbon capture and storage, also known as CCS, has a role to play in dealing with climate change but should not be used as an excuse by industries to avoid cutting emissions.",
      "Mads Gade, chief executive of INEOS Energy Europe, says it will initially begin storing 400,000 tons (363,000 metric tons) of CO2 per year, scaling up to as much as 8 million tons (7.3 million metric tons) annually by 2030.",
      "\u201cDenmark has the potential to actually store more than several hundred years of our own emissions,\u201d says Gade. \u201cWe are able to create an industry where we can support Europe in actually storing a lot of the CO2 here.\u201d",
      "Greensand has struck deals with Danish biogas facilities to bury their captured carbon emissions into the Nini field\u2019s depleted reservoirs.",
      "A \u201cCO2 terminal\u201d that temporarily stores the liquefied gas is being built at the Port of Esbjerg, on the western coast of the Danish Jutland peninsula.",

      "The crackling of electrical discharges was captured by a microphone on the rover, a French-led team reported Wednesday.",
      "The researchers documented 55 instances of what they call \u201cmini lightning\u201d over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches (centimeters) in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet (2 meters) of the microphone perched atop the rover\u2019s tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",
      "Scientists have been looking for electrical activity and lightning at Mars for half a century, said the study\u2019s lead author Baptiste Chide, of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse.",
      "\u201cIt opens a completely new field of investigation for Mars science,\u201d Chide said, citing the possible chemical effects from electrical discharges. \u201cIt\u2019s like finding a missing piece of the puzzle.\u201d",
      "The evidence is strong and persuasive, but it's based on a single instrument that was meant to record the rover zapping rocks with lasers, not lightning blasts, said Cardiff University's Daniel Mitchard, who was not involved in the study. What's more, he noted in an article accompanying the study in the journal Nature, the electrical discharges were heard \u2014 not seen.",

      "Lightning has already been confirmed on Jupiter and Saturn, and Mars has long been suspected of having it too.",
      "To find it, Chide and his team analyzed 28 hours of Perseverance recordings, documenting episodes of \u201cmini lightning\u201d based on acoustic and electric signals.",

      "Once he learned more about The Miami Project, Dalton said he was impressed by its science-driven approach. Its setting on a university campus was also important to the former chairman of the board of trustees at Denison and Vanderbilt universities.",
      "\u201cThey put the line in the water,\u201d said Dalton, who now chairs the Buoniconti Fund\u2019s biggest annual fundraiser, The Great Sports Legends Dinner. \u201cThey hooked me. I\u2019m all in.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a common feeling around The Miami Project, which counts legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus and Grammy winner Gloria Estefan among its supporters. And it\u2019s something Marc Buoniconti says he does not take for granted.",
      "He hopes The Miami Project\u2019s work will continue to expand.",
      "\u201cMy biggest dream is for our researchers to find a way to fully repair the nervous system,\u201d Buoniconti said. \u201cWhen we do that, we\u2019ll change the entire landscape for paralysis and so many other neuro conditions. We\u2019ll give so many people their lives back. That\u2019s what keeps me going, and that\u2019s what makes every struggle to this point worth it.\u201d",

      "Chinese companies are rushing to deploy low-flying vehicles and drones for various uses as the country finds innovative ways to drive its economy",
      "HONG KONG -- An unmanned, oval-shaped craft from flying taxi maker EHang hovers, whirring noisily like a mini-helicopter over a riverside innovation zone on the outskirts of the southern Chinese business hub of Guangzhou, part of a trial of a mini-flying taxi that once might have been found only in sci-fi films.",
      "In nearby Shenzhen, food-delivery drones already are part of daily life and a novelty attraction for tourists, even if such services cost more. In the waterfront park surrounded by high-rises, Polish tourist Karolina Trzcia\u0144ska and her friends ordered bubble tea and lemon tea by phone, just to give it a try. Their drinks arrived via a drone buzzing through the drizzle about 30 minutes later.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m seeing something like this, so it was super fun to see the food being delivered by the drone,\" she said.",
      "Such businesses are growing quickly with support from the government, though the take off of the so-called \u201clow-altitude economy\u201d faces obstacles such as strict airspace controls and battery limitations.",
      "Activities in airspace below 1,000 meters (about 3,280 feet) accounted for business turnover worth 506 billion yuan ($70 billion) in 2023, about 0.4% of China\u2019s economy. By 2035, it's expected to hit 3.5 trillion yuan (about $490 billion), said Zhang Xiaolan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a think tank affiliated with China's main planning agency.",
      "Guangdong province, home to drone giant DJI with an estimated 70% of the global commercial drone market, leads in development of the low-altitude economy, followed by wealthy eastern coastal provinces Jiangsu and Zhejiang, near Shanghai, according to a report by a research unit of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University, and other institutions.",
      "Other big players in Guangdong include EHang, logistics company SF Express\u2019s drone arm Phoenix Wings, and automaker XPENG\u2019s flying car unit ARIDGE.",
      "In October, Guangdong announced it plans to speed up construction of flight service stations and platforms to facilitate airspace operations and will support locally issued discount vouchers for low-altitude tourism.",
      "Its technology and financial hub Shenzhen has launched a 15-million-yuan ($2.1 million) award for companies that earn certifications required for passenger eVTOLs, short for \u201celectric vertical take-off and landing\" vehicles that lift off the ground like helicopters, among other incentives.",
      "China\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration has granted certificates allowing EHang to offer commercial passenger services with its pilotless eVTOL, a low-altitude aircraft that can reach speeds of 130 kph (81 mph) with a maximum range of 30 kilometers (19 miles).",
      "EHang hasn\u2019t launched commercial routes, but its vice president, He Tianxing, says it aims to start with aerial sightseeing services. The company has been building takeoff and landing sites in 20 Chinese cities over the past two years. He expects aircraft of various companies will be flying multiple routes, possibly after five years.",

      "The biggest challenge for developing eVTOL aircraft is maintaining longer flights and overcoming battery capacity limitations, said Guo Liming, co-founder of Shenzhen-based Skyevtol, whose single-seat manned eVTOL aircraft, priced at around $100,000, can only fly 20 to 30 minutes before it must be charged.",
      "It also has not all been smooth skies.",
      "In September, two XPENG's eVTOL aircraft collided after a rehearsal for an exhibition and one of them caught fire while landing. The company said no one was hurt, but another expo canceled flying demonstrations a week later.",

      "Less than one-third of China's low-altitude airspace was accessible for general aviation use in 2023 and there were problems with uneven distribution and a lack of internet connectivity, Zhang, the State Information Center researcher, said in a report. The number of registered general aviation aerodromes in China, excluding private airports, was just about a tenth of those in the U.S., she said.",

      "China is a latecomer to the industry but now leads in developing small drones and low-altitude airspace investments, said Chen Wen-hua, director at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University\u2019s Research Centre for Low Altitude Economy.",
      "One advantage is the ruling Communist Party's ability to mobilize regulators, industry players and universities to work toward the same goal, he said. But development of the technologies involved and safety concerns and public acceptance will determine how quickly different applications of drones and low-flying vehicles are adopted.",

      "As daily cannabis use rises to historic levels in the U.S., some longtime users are finding it harder to quit",
      "BROOKLINE, Mass. -- For the past several years, 75-year-old Miguel Laboy has smoked a joint with his coffee every morning. He tells himself he won\u2019t start tomorrow the same way, but he usually does.",
      "\u201cYou know what bothers me? To have cannabis on my mind the first thing in the morning,\u201d he said, sparking a blunt in his Brookline, Mass., apartment. \u201cI\u2019d like to get up one day and not smoke. But you see how that\u2019s going.\u201d",
      "Since legalization and commercialization, daily cannabis use has become a defining \u2014 and often invisible \u2014 part of many people\u2019s lives. High-potency vapes and concentrates now dominate the market, and doctors say they can blur the line between relief and dependence over time so that users don\u2019t notice the shift. Across the country, people who turned to cannabis for help are finding it harder to put down.",
      "Overall, alcohol remains more widely used than cannabis. But starting in 2022, the number of daily cannabis users in the U.S. surpassed that of daily drinkers \u2014 a major shift in American habits.",
      "Researchers say the rise has unfolded alongside products that contain far more THC than the marijuana of past decades, including vape oils and concentrates that can reach 80% to 95% THC. Massachusetts, like most states, sets no limit on how strong these products can be.",
      "Doctors warn that daily, high-potency use can cloud memory, disturb sleep, intensify anxiety or depression and trigger addiction in ways earlier generations didn\u2019t encounter. Many who develop cannabis use disorder say it\u2019s hard to recognize the signs because of the widespread belief that marijuana isn\u2019t addictive. Because the consequences tend to creep in gradually \u2014 brain fog, irritability, dependence \u2014 users often miss when therapeutic use shifts into compulsion.",
      "Laboy, a retired chef, began seeing a substance-use counselor after telling his doctor he felt depressed, unmotivated and increasingly isolated as his drinking and cannabis use escalated.",
      "Naltrexone helped him quit alcohol, but he hasn\u2019t found a way to quit marijuana. Unlike alcohol and opioids, there is no FDA-approved medication to treat cannabis addiction, though research is underway.",
      "Laboy, who first smoked at 18, said marijuana has long soothed symptoms tied to undiagnosed ADHD, childhood trauma and painful experiences \u2014 including cancer treatment and his son's death. Through decades in restaurant kitchens, he considered himself a \u201cfunctional pothead.\u201d",
      "Lately, though, his use has become compulsive. After retiring, he began vaping 85% THC cartridges.",
      "\u201cThese days, I carry two things in my hands: my vape and my cellular \u2014 that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it, but it\u2019s the reality.\u201d",
      "Cannabis eases his anxiety and \u201csettles his spirit,\u201d but he\u2019s noticed it affects his concentration. He hopes to learn to read music, but sustaining focus at the piano has grown difficult.",
      "He\u2019s seen an addiction psychiatrist for six months, but he hasn\u2019t been able to cut back. The medical system doesn\u2019t seem equipped to help, he said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not ready yet,\u201d Laboy said. \u201cI go to them for help, but all they say is, \u2018Try to smoke less.\u2019 I already know that \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m there.\u201d",
      "Younger users describe a similar slide \u2014 one that begins with relief and ends somewhere harder to define.",
      "Kyle, a 20-year-old Boston University student, says cannabis helps him manage panic attacks he\u2019s had since high school. He spoke on the condition that only his first name be used because he buys cannabis illegally.",
      "In the Allston apartment he shares with fraternity brothers, they have a communal bong.",
      "When he\u2019s high, Kyle feels calm \u2014 and able to process anxious thoughts and feel a sense of gratitude. But that clarity has become harder to reach when he\u2019s sober.",

Brawls in store aisles over toys and TVs with limited-time discounts are spectacles of holidays past. Online shopping and retailers launching discounts weeks before the turkey feast subdued that kind of fervor.",

      "While planning for the holidays in the spring and summer, retail companies were wrestling with the volatility of President Donald Trump \u2019s wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Many accelerated shipments of some merchandise before the tariffs took effect or decided to absorb some of the import tax costs instead of raising prices for customers.",

      "THC-infused drinks and snacks have soared in popularity as alcohol sales have declined in recent years",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The production lines at Indeed Brewing moved quickly, the cans filling not with beer, but with THC-infused seltzer. The product, which features the compound that gets cannabis users high, has been a lifeline at Indeed and other craft breweries as alcohol sales have fallen in recent years.",
      "But that boom looks set to come to a crashing halt. Buried in the bill that ended the federal government shutdown this month was a provision to ban those drinks, along with other impairing beverages and snacks made from hemp, which have proliferated across the country in recent years. Now the $24 billion hemp industry is scrambling to save itself before the provision takes effect in November 2026.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\" said Ryan Bandy, Indeed's chief business officer. \"It would be a mess for our breweries, for our industry, and obviously for a lot of people who like these things.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know about the looming ban on impairing products derived from hemp.",
      "Marijuana and hemp are the same species. Marijuana is cultivated for high levels of THC in its flowers. Low-THC hemp is grown for its sturdy fibers, food or wellness products. \u201cRope, not dope\u201d was long the motto of farmers who supported legalizing hemp.",
      "After states began legalizing marijuana for adult use over a decade ago, hemp advocates saw an opening at the federal level. As part of the 2018 farm bill, Congress legalized the cultivation of industrial hemp to give farmers, including in Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell's home state of Kentucky, a new cash crop.",
      "But the way that law defined hemp \u2014 as having less than 0.3% of a specific type of THC, called delta-9 \u2014 opened a huge loophole. Beverages or bags of snacks could meet that threshold and still contain more than enough THC to get people high. Businesses could further exploit the law by extracting a non-impairing compound, called CBD, and chemically changing it into other types of impairing THC, such as delta-8 or delta-10.",
      "The result? Vape oil, gummy candies, chips, cookies, sodas and other unregulated, untested products laden with hemp-derived THC spread around the country. In many places, they have been available at gas stations or convenience stores, even to teens. In legal marijuana states, they undercut heavily taxed and regulated products. In others, they evaded the prohibition on recreational use of weed.",
      "Some states, including Indiana, have reported spikes in calls to poison-control centers for pediatric exposure to THC.",
      "Dozens of states have since taken steps to regulate or ban impairing hemp products. In October, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill banning the sale of intoxicating hemp products outside the state's legal marijuana system.",
      "Texas, which has a massive hemp market, is moving to regulate sales of impairing hemp, such as by restricting them to those over 21. In Nebraska, lawmakers have instead considered a bill to criminalize the sale and possession of products containing hemp-based THC.",
      "Washington state adopted a program to regulate hemp growing. But the number of licensed growers has cratered since the state banned intoxicating hemp products outside of the regulated cannabis market in 2023. Five years ago, there were 220, said Trecia Ehrlich, cannabis program manager with the state agriculture department. This year, there were 42, and with a federal ban looming, she expects that number to drop by about half next year.",
      "Minnesota made infused beverages and foods legal in 2022 for people 21 and older. The products, which must be derived from legally certified hemp, have become so popular that Target is now offering THC drinks at some of its stores in the state.",
      "They've also been a boon to liquor stores and to small Minneapolis brewers like Indeed, where THC drinks make up close to one-quarter of the business, Bandy said. At Bauhaus Brew Labs, a few blocks away, THC drinks account for 26% of their revenues from distributed products and 11% of revenues at the brewery\u2019s taproom.",
      "None of that was what McConnell intended when he helped craft the 2018 farm bill. He finally closed the loophole by inserting a federal hemp THC ban in the measure to end the 43-day federal government shutdown, approved by the Senate on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cIt will keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children, while preserving the hemp industry for farmers,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIndustrial hemp and CBD will remain legal for industrial applications.\u201d",

      "But the ban doesn't take effect for a year. That has given the industry hope that there is still time to pass regulations that will improve the hemp THC industry \u2014 such as by banning synthetically derived THC, requiring age restrictions on sales, and prohibiting marketing to children \u2014 rather than eradicate it.",
      "\"We are very hopeful that cooler heads will prevail,\" said Jonathan Miller, general counsel of the industry group U.S. Hemp Roundtable. \u201cIf they really thought there was a health emergency, there would be no year-long period.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf this goes through as written currently, I don\u2019t see a way at all that Bauhaus could stay in business,\" Hurst said.",
      "A number of lawmakers say they will push for regulation of the hemp THC industry. Kentucky's second senator, Republican Rand Paul, introduced an amendment to strip McConnell's hemp language from the crucial government-funding bill, but it failed on a lopsided 76-24 vote.",
      "Minnesota's Democratic U.S. senators, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, are among those strategizing to save the industry. Klobuchar noted at a recent news conference that the ban was inserted into the unrelated shutdown bill without a hearing. She suggested the federal government could allow states to develop their own regulatory frameworks, or that Minnesota's strict regulations could be used as a national model.",

      "A federal judge in Washington has relaunched his contempt probe of the Trump administration for failing to turn around two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in March",
      "Two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants out of the U.S. were midair on March 15 when a federal judge in Washington ordered the Trump administration to turn them around.",
      "Instead, the planes landed in El Salvador hours later, touching off an extraordinary power struggle between the judicial and executive branches of the U.S. government over what happened and why the judge's order went unexecuted.",
      "That fight entered a critical phase on Friday when U.S. District Judge James Boasberg relaunched an investigation to determine whether the Republican administration deliberately ignored his instruction, letting the planes continue onto El Salvador.",
      "The judge previously concluded it did and threatened to have the responsible official or officials prosecuted on a contempt charge. The administration has denied any violation.",
      "But an appeals court threw Boasberg's decision out. The contempt probe appeared dead until in yet another twist, a larger panel of judges on the same appeals court ruled on November 14 that the investigation could proceed.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what makes this case unusual and what could happen now:",
      "They are a last resort, former federal judges Jeremy Fogel and Liam O'Grady told The Associated Press in an interview Monday conducted on Zoom.",
      "\u201cThe judge has to believe that some line may have been crossed that you can\u2019t ignore,\u201d said Fogel, who spent 20 years on the bench in Northern California before retiring in 2018.",
      "Fogel said the issues raised by Boasberg's contempt probe \u2014 whether the migrants were deprived of their due process rights and whether the court's authority was flouted \u2014 meet that standard.",
      "\u201cWhatever actually happened, I think it would be very hard for him to just let it go,\u201d the judge said.",
      "O'Grady, who served in Alexandria, Virginia, just outside Washington, for 16 years, credited Boasberg for his efforts to determine the facts.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s making sure that his record is absolutely clear,\u201d O'Grady said.",
      "On Friday, Boasberg ordered the administration to submit declarations by December 5 from all officials involved in the decision not to return the flights to the U.S. He said he will then decide whether to seek testimony from witnesses.",
      "The declarations should detail the officials' roles in the decision, the judge said in the brief order.",
      "Justice Department attorneys had urged him to abandon the probe, but Boasberg said he must determine whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem or anyone else \u201cshould be referred for potential contempt prosecution.\u201d",

      "That order blocked the administration from removing \u201cany of the individual Plaintiffs from the United States for 14 days,\u201d but said nothing about the flights already airborne.",
      "The two planes had already departed U.S. territory and airspace, so the migrants aboard them had already been \u201cremoved\u201d and therefore fell outside of the court's order, Justice Department lawyers said in the court filing.",

Circuit. Katsas was appointed by President Donald Trump.",

      "Trump has already attacked Boasberg. After the March 15 ruling, Trump derided the judge as a \u201ctroublemaker and agitator\u201d and called for his impeachment. Boasberg was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Barack Obama and currently serves as the chief judge of the federal court for the District of Columbia.",
      "In July, the Justice Department filed a misconduct claim against him, alleging he told Chief Justice John Roberts and other federal judges in March that the administration would trigger a constitutional crisis by disregarding federal court rulings.",
      "Boasberg has framed the contempt inquiry as an effort to uphold the U.S. Constitution, which he says requires compliance with judicial orders. Separately, he is considering a request to require the administration to give at least 137 of the migrants, who are now back in Venezuela, a chance to challenge their gang designation.",
      "He has accused Trump administration officials of rushing the migrants out of the U.S. and said significant evidence had surfaced indicating that many of them were not connected to the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "But history shows such punishments are rarely issued or allowed to stand against the government.",
      "A survey of thousands of federal court opinions published in the Harvard Law Review in 2018 turned up 82 contempt findings against government officials and agencies since the end of World War II. Judges issued or tried to issue fines in 16 of those cases, but higher courts blocked them in all but three.",
      "Prison time is even more uncommon. Judges locked up or credibly threatened to lock up a federal agency official in only four of the cases, and high courts similarly intervened to block the sanction, the study by Yale Law School professor Nicholas Parrillo found.",
      "Noll, the Rutgers Law professor, said if the inquiry moves ahead, it could influence public debate about whether the administration can carry out its mass deportation policy legally.",
      "\u201cA lot of a district court's power just comes from the ability to get an issue in front of the public,\u201d he said in a phone interview on Tuesday.",

      "A lot of snow, rain and cold weather await travelers for the rest of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, with winter storm warnings posted Friday across the northern part of the country and more snow falling over the Great Lakes region.",
      "Storm warnings and advisories extended from Montana to New York, the National Weather Service said. Snow was expected to start Friday and last well into the weekend in some areas with Iowa and Illinois getting the brunt of it. Six inches (about 15 centimeters) to a foot (30 centimeters) of snow is expected in much of west-central Illinois Friday night through Saturday night.",
      "So far, forecast conditions do not meet blizzard warning criteria, meteorologists said \u2014 winds of at least 35 mph (56 kph), visibilities of less than a quarter mile (400 meters) and lasting more than three hours.",
      "A storm that already brought snow to parts of the northern Plains states and the Great Lakes region continued Friday. Snowfall totals of at least a foot were expected by the end of the storm, particularly downwind of Lake Superior across the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan and downwind of lakes Erie and Ontario, the weather service said. Areas of central New York state could see a foot (30 centimeters) of snow.",
      "Snow squalls Friday bringing quick bursts of heavy snow and dangerous, whiteout conditions for driving were possible across the interior Northeast, the weather service said.",

      "The realities of geopolitics have long required the United States to ally itself with foreign leaders who commit terrible deeds. Defeating foreign threats often requires the help of countries that fall far short of being liberal democracies that respect human rights. Saudi Arabia is a classic example of such a country today. It both has a disturbing human rights record and is a legitimately valuable American partner in countering Iran\u2019s aggressions and building a more stable Middle East.",
      "But working with imperfect partners does not mean that the United States should cover up and lie about their misdeeds, as President Trump did when receiving Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler, in the Oval Office on Tuesday. It was a fawning, cringe-worthy performance that belied America\u2019s more powerful status. It was absolution rather than realpolitik.",
      "Mr. Trump embraced the prince\u2019s implausible claim of innocence in the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen and journalist, and berated Mary Bruce, of ABC News, for asking about the killing. The C.I.A. has concluded that the crown prince almost certainly ordered the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a critic of the prince who was living in self-imposed exile in the United States and was murdered while visiting a Saudi consulate in Turkey. A United Nations investigator and a coalition of nongovernmental organizations reached similar conclusions.",
      "These inquiries noted that Saudi officials offered conflicting accounts of the killing and concealed information about it. Eventually, the kingdom investigated several members of Prince Mohammed\u2019s inner circle for the killing.",
      "The president\u2019s performance was alarming for three main reasons. One, it suggested that the truth was irrelevant, and it discarded the hard work of American intelligence in trying to determine that truth. It continued a long pattern of Mr. Trump lying when it suits his interests.",
      "Two, he whitewashed a brutal human-rights violation \u2014 a killing by strangulation, followed by the dismembering and disposal of the body, committed by a team of Saudi operatives. The United States does not have the power to rid the world of human-rights abuses. At its best, though, this country has successfully nudged allies toward better behavior. Mr. Trump, by contrast, signaled this week that foreign despots can eliminate bothersome critics without worry of American disapproval.",
      "Three, the president showed open disdain for the principles of press freedom enshrined in the Constitution. Traditionally, foreign leaders who visit the White House understand that they will not be able to avoid hard questions, as authoritarian leaders can at home. Ms. Bruce, the ABC correspondent, lived up to this tradition with a two-part question about the Trump family\u2019s business dealings in Saudi Arabia and the prince\u2019s role in Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing.",
      "Mr. Trump unpersuasively waved away his conflicts of interest before demeaning Mr. Khashoggi \u2014 \u201ca lot of people didn\u2019t like that gentleman that you\u2019re talking about\u201d \u2014 and defending Prince Mohammed. \u201cHe knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.\u201d",
      "The role of the news media in our democracy is not to flatter foreign leaders or, for that matter, American ones. It is to pose important and sometimes challenging questions and publish the facts. As president, Mr. Trump repeatedly shows contempt for this principle. Over the past week alone, he called Ms. Bruce \u201ca terrible person\u201d and told another female reporter, \u201cQuiet, piggy.\u201d His behavior suggests that he would prefer an American news media that behaves more like Saudi Arabia\u2019s largely muzzled and obsequious media.",
      "The prince is a complicated dictator. He has pushed his country to become more modern and open in important ways, including by expanding women\u2019s rights, reducing the influence of religious hard-liners and diversifying the economy. He also remains an authoritarian. In addition to evidently masterminding the savage killing of Mr. Khashoggi, he regularly jails critics and has overseen a sharp increase in executions for low-level drug offenses. The appropriate role for the United States is to make him uncomfortable about his abuses and push Saudi Arabia toward a freer future.",

      "The Washington Post says Trump's immigration policies are over the top",
      "The Trump administration has named New York City the next target in its deportation tour. White House border czar Tom Homan revealed last week he is planning a widespread dragnet across the Big Apple \u201cin the near future,\u201d in addition to enforcement sweeps already happening.",
      "The administration sees this as the obvious next step in its pressure campaign against \u201csanctuary\u201d policies in blue cities and states. But these actions are not without cost. In fact, the administration\u2019s mass deportation campaign is already backfiring.",
      "Securing the border and deporting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes are some of President Donald Trump\u2019s most popular policies. The latter has support among 79 percent of Americans \u2014 including 69 percent of Democrats \u2014 in the latest Harvard-Harris poll. Despite this, approval for Trump\u2019s immigration agenda has dropped nine points since February.",
      "The president\u2019s over-the-top approach to deportations is almost certainly the reason why. While Homan has vowed to prioritize going after the \u201cworst of the worst,\u201d the administration has rounded up more than just hardened criminals. Americans can see the difference between carting off a rapist and deporting the neighborhood gardener who pays taxes.",
      "The Trump administration blames \u201ccollateral arrests\u201d \u2014 picking up people who weren\u2019t the target of an operation \u2014 on sanctuary policies. Todd M. Lyons, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has said they wouldn\u2019t feel compelled to be so aggressive if localities willingly turned over \u201cviolent criminal aliens.\u201d",
      "Lyons raised a valid public safety concern. Some progressive states and cities limit local law enforcements\u2019 ability to honor ICE detainers, or requests for law enforcement to hold people past their release date, unless a serious crime has been committed. And some cities, such as New York, require a conviction for a serious crime or a judicial warrant. Sanctuary jurisdictions often argue that holding someone for a civil ICE detainer amounts to unlawful detention. This means that some migrants with criminal charges have been released back into the community in defiance of a detainer.",
      "It\u2019s reasonable to debate how local law enforcement can cooperate with ICE to track down potentially dangerous criminals. But that isn\u2019t an excuse for the government to round up just anyone, nor is it a particularly effective way to convince moderates to rethink sanctuary policies. \u201cBringing hell\u201d to Boston, as Homan promised to cheers at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, hasn\u2019t gotten Massachusetts to change its policy on honoring ICE detainers, but it did make Boston\u2019s defiant mayor, Michelle Wu, a progressive hero. Some states, such as Colorado, have even strengthened their sanctuary laws since Trump took office.",
      "Meanwhile, mass deportations \u2014 and Trump\u2019s broader anti-immigration policies \u2014 are threatening key industries like construction and agriculture. In October, Trump\u2019s own Labor Department released a document that \u201cthe near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens combined with the lack of an available legal workforce\u201d is disrupting production costs and \u201cthreatening the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S consumers. \u201dFor a moment, Trump seemed to understand this, briefly directing immigration officers in June to stop arresting agriculture and hospitality workers before reversing that policy a week later.",
      "New Yorkers have already been through a roller-coaster of immigration policies. In 2022, Republican governors in border states bused migrants to the city to test the sincerity of its sanctuary laws. In time, Mayor Eric Adams (D), once a defender of those laws, changed his tune. In April, his administration issued an executive order allowing ICE into New York\u2019s Rikers Island prison complex to investigate transnational gang members, just days after federal prosecutors dismissed corruption charges against the mayor. His order was blocked in September by the New York State Supreme Court because of an \u201cimpermissible appearance of a conflict of interest.\u201d",
      "At his chummy news conference with Trump on Friday, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said New York\u2019s laws allow the city to coordinate with ICE on some serious crimes, but that these have \u201cvery little to do\u201d with the deportation of women and children whose only crime is being in the country illegally. Some members of the Trump administration don\u2019t care about that distinction, but the American people seem to.",

      "The Wall Street Journal on what Trump's latest peace offering means for Russia and Ukraine",
      "The Trump Administration is making another run at ending the war in Ukraine, and a lasting peace with honor would be a laudable achievement. But for three years the only peace on offer has been Ukraine\u2019s surrender, and the latest American offer\u2014really, an ultimatum\u2014is merely another dressed-up version.",
      "The 28-point plan that was mooted in the press but became public on Thursday includes a reduction in Ukraine\u2019s military and a cap on its manpower at 600,000, from about 900,000 now. It isn\u2019t clear if foreign peace-keeping troops would be allowed on Ukraine\u2019s soil or if it could maintain long-range weapons.",
      "The deal hands Mr. Putin all of the Donbas in the east. He\u2019d pocket the territory he\u2019s already seized there\u2014and get the rest that Ukraine still holds despite nearly four years of Russian assaults.",
      "Ukraine would forfeit its right to join a defensive Western alliance in NATO. Oh\u2014and the U.S. and Ukraine would recognize Russian control of Crimea, which Mr. Putin took by force in 2014. Mr. Putin has made these demands since 2022 after his failed storming of Kyiv.",
      "This managed capitulation would be a bitter pill in Ukraine. \u201cNow is one of the most difficult moments in our history,\u201d Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday. Ukraine must choose between \u201cdignity, or the risk of losing a key partner.\u201d",
      "That bracing remark underscores that Mr. Trump is essentially saying Ukraine must agree to his terms or he will stop U.S. weapons and intelligence support. Mr. Zelensky is in a weakened domestic position amid the embarrassment of a fresh corruption scandal in Kyiv. But after Mr. Putin\u2019s brutalities, it will be hard for any Ukrainian patriot to sell this settlement to the Ukrainian public.",

The decision for Ukraine is whether to believe this guarantee. A parchment promise does not mean Mr. Putin has abandoned his designs to control Ukraine. For him it is an ideological and historical mission that is part of his legacy. \u201cIf Vladimir Putin lives up to a cease-fire or peace treaty with Ukraine,\u201d as Sen. Roger Wicker put it this year, \u201cit will be the first time ever.\u201d",
      "Then there are the questions for the United States. Mr. Putin\u2019s method is to push against red lines and probe the will of his opponents. Mr. Trump will have handed Mr. Putin favorable terrain in the east that helps the Russian make a direct run for Kyiv when he\u2019s rearmed and ready.",
      "Mr. Trump\u2019s offer would defang a fighting ally in Ukraine\u2014the kind the Administration says it wants\u2014and expose the U.S. to a greater risk of a direct confrontation with Russia. Where are the supposed realists and restrainers who run this Administration? We are supposed to believe that the same President who won\u2019t sanction China for buying Russian oil and assisting its war machine will go to war for Kyiv?",
      "And assume for a moment that Mr. Trump is prepared to back up his promise to Ukraine with the lives of the men and women of the U.S. military. What about a President JD Vance or President Gavin Newsom?",
      "Also extraordinary is the offer to rescue and rehabilitate Mr. Putin financially. \u201cRussia will be reintegrated into the global economy,\u201d the document says, and return to make the G7 again the G8 group of nations. Russia would be the only dictatorship in that group.",
      "The U.S. will enter some \u201clong-term economic cooperation agreement\u201d with Russia, an outgrowth of the Trump delusion that Mr. Putin can be wooed with commerce. The plan floats working with Russia on\u2014we are not making this up\u2014artificial intelligence. Mr. Trump might as well skip the middle man and surrender the U.S. tech advantage to China directly.",
      "Mr. Trump insists the war in Ukraine is Europe\u2019s problem, but then why not first consult those who live in Mr. Putin\u2019s backyard? The deal looks like an echo of Trump\u2019s first term freeze out of the Afghan government while Zalmay Khalilzad negotiated with the Taliban in Doha. That set the stage for President Biden\u2019s abandonment of Afghanistan.",
      "Mr. Trump may figure he can finally wash his hands of Ukraine if Europe and Ukraine reject his offer. He\u2019s clearly sick of dealing with the war. But appeasing Mr. Putin would haunt the rest of his Presidency. If Mr. Trump thinks American voters hate war, wait until he learns how much they hate dishonor.",
      "Mr. Trump can tarnish his legacy if he wants, but the bigger risk here is to the United States. A bad deal in Ukraine would broadcast to U.S. enemies that they can seize what they want with force or nuclear blackmail or by pressing on until America loses interest. The odds of a Pacific crisis will go up.",
      "European capitals and the last adults in Congress will now scramble to try to talk Mr. Trump off this plan\u2014and don\u2019t rule out Mr. Putin still overplaying his Trump hand. These are the forces that can save the U.S. President from appeasement he\u2019ll regret.",

      "The St. Louis Post-Dispatch hope the GOPs defiance Trump on Epstein files is an indicator of things to come",
      "America doesn\u2019t yet know, and will probably never know, what if any role Donald Trump played in Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sick world of child sex trafficking. Whatever this president says, there\u2019s zero chance that his compliant Justice Department will allow anything damning or even unflattering about him to emerge when they finally release the long-awaited, heavily redacted Epstein files.",
      "What we have learned, however, is that Trump doesn\u2019t always, in every instance, hold similar sway over the usually subservient Republicans who control Congress. On this issue, the GOP lapdogs rebelled, making clear they were ready to defy Trump\u2019s resistance to releasing the files \u2014 to the point that he finally had to lurch to the head of that parade and pretend he was leading it, lest he get trampled by it.",
      "Which raises an encouraging question: If congressional Republicans can finally find the grit to actually carry out their duty of checking presidential power on this one issue, might there theoretically be others? After all, on topics ranging from tariffs to government service cuts to domestic militarization, Trump\u2019s rogue policies are burdening their constituents in ways far more relevant than a dead pedophile.",
      "Epstein, of course, was the wealthy financier who hung himself in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors in New York and Florida. His long history of hobnobbing with powerful people \u2014 including Trump and former President Bill Clinton \u2014 made revelations of his twisted double life politically explosive.",
      "Trump himself helped light that fuse with his usual reckless conspiracy-mongering, such as retweeting an allegation shortly after Epstein\u2019s death that Epstein \u201chad information on Bill Clinton & now he\u2019s dead.\u201d",
      "It was largely Trump\u2019s drumbeat on the issue, starting in his first presidential term, that convinced his MAGA movement to treat the release of the Epstein files as a holy quest. Which made it all the more interesting that, in his current term, Trump did an about-face and became the chief obstructionist to that crusade.",
      "This cannot be said emphatically enough: Through the entire Epstein saga this year, Trump has always had the authority to simply order all the Epstein records in the federal government\u2019s possession released. Yet it took the recent action by Congress to force the issue.",
      "Before those bipartisan, nearly unanimous congressional votes in the past week, Trump and his people, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, had been trying to douse the issue, claiming (in a reversal of their own previous claims) that the much-speculated-upon Epstein \u201cclient list\u201d of fellow pedophiles didn\u2019t actually exist.",
      "It wasn\u2019t the only suspicious movement by the administration. Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s imprisoned co-conspirator, was recently moved to a lighter-security facility, allegedly is getting preferential treatment there, and is reportedly preparing to petition Trump for clemency.",
      "At the same time, multiple media outlets have reported that the Justice Department has been scouring hundreds of thousands of Epstein documents on orders to redact any mention of Trump. Trump himself, with a typically ham-handed diversionary tactic, is again regurgitating unsupported claims that Clinton has been implicated.",
      "None of this should be taken as evidence of criminality by Trump. We all know his fragile ego and bottomless self-regard well enough to consider that he was merely trying to avoid embarrassing accounts of his time as an Epstein insider.",
      "In any case, Trump had lobbied for months to prevent congressional Republicans from taking up legislation to force release of the files, dismissing as a \u201cDemocrat hoax\u201d the very conspiracies he used to promote.",
      "It was only when it became clear that congressional Republicans were on a path to defy him anyway and demand the files that Trump again pirouetted and publicly backed the legislation. He subsequently signed the bill sent to him.",
      "Again, we\u2019re not holding our breath (and no one should) for evidence implicating Trump in Epstein\u2019s crimes. If that evidence exists, it won\u2019t see the light of day regardless of the legislation. This we know because we know Trump and we know his administration.",
      "But now we also know that congressional Republicans are, when properly motivated by public opinion, capable of pulling on their big-boy pants and doing their jobs.",
      "As Americans of every political persuasion watch their president driving up prices with spastic, rogue tariff policies, violating the Constitution left and right with unauthorized spending cuts and personal enrichment, scuttling due process and the rule of law, militarizing our streets, and threatening the American project in so many other ways \u2014 all while Congress generally sits by, whistling \u2014 here\u2019s hoping they take this as a lesson in the politics of the possible.",

      "The Guardian on the destruction in Gaza",
      "The declaration of a ceasefire in Gaza in October brought initial relief to its inhabitants. Yet officials there said Israeli strikes killed 33 people, including 12 children, on Wednesday; Israel said its troops had come under fire. Another five Palestinians were killed on Thursday. Hundreds have died since the ceasefire was declared. Even if the shelling stops, the destruction of Palestinian life will carry on as Israel continues to throttle aid, and the consequences of two years of war unfold. The World Health Organization warned last month that the health catastrophe would last for generations.",
      "Food remains in short supply. While displaced families shiver in flooded makeshift shelters, with many facing a third winter of homelessness, aid organisations say they cannot deliver stockpiles of tents and tarpaulins. Israel, which denies blocking aid, has designated tent poles as \u201cdual-use\u201d items that could potentially be used for a military purpose. Save the Children reports children sleeping on bare ground in sewage-soaked clothing.",
      "The Guardian last week revealed US plans for the long-term division of Gaza into a \u201cgreen zone\u201d under Israeli and international control, to be redeveloped, and a \u201cred zone\u201d left in ruins; a US official described reunion of the strip as \u201caspirational\u201d. This vision \u2013 with international troops essentially propping up Israeli occupation, and Palestinians drawn to those areas to escape squalor and chaos elsewhere \u2013 echoes disastrous US policies in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "This is the grim underpinning of the UN security council resolution this week, endorsing Donald Trump\u2019s peace proposals. The \u201cboard of peace\u201d looks like a colonial authority overseen by Mr Trump, and perhaps anchored by Tony Blair. Palestinian technocrats, somehow both domestically credible and acceptable to the US and Israel \u2013 a notable feat \u2013 would work beneath it. All this would be possible thanks to an international stabilisation force that the US hopes to see deployed by January. That would be a stretch even if countries prove truly willing to commit troops.",
      "The resolution improved on a draft text and won backing from the Arab world \u2013 and angry rejection from the Israeli right \u2013 by including references to a Palestinian state and Israeli withdrawal. Yet those references are couched in the vaguest terms, as an unguaranteed reward for sufficiently good behaviour, rather than as a recognition of inalienable Palestinian rights. If all goes according to plan, \u201cconditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\u201d. Israeli withdrawal would be based on standards and timeframes agreed by the military itself as well as the US and others.

      "Some believe that this is the best that can be salvaged from current circumstances, given Mr Trump\u2019s presidency; others hope that it is just possible that this unpromising start could allow something better to be forged. But it is hard not to conclude that for some governments, this is more about conscience-salving and reputation-laundering than the best interests of Palestinians. Germany has already announced that it will resume weapons exports to Israel. For Palestinians, \u201cwhat looked like a forever war may be metamorphizing into forever misery\u201d, the political scientist Nathan Brown has warned. Countries that were complicit in a genocidal war have all the more duty to demand better.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has halted all asylum decisions and paused issuing visas for people traveling on Afghan passports days after a shooting near the White House that left one National Guard member dead and another in critical condition.",
      "Investigators continued Saturday to seek a motive in the shooting, with the suspect a 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War and now faces charges including first-degree murder. The man applied for asylum during the Biden administration and was granted it this year under Trump, according to a group that assists with resettlement of Afghans who helped U.S. forces in their country.",
      "The Trump administration has seized on the shooting to vow to intensify efforts to rein in legal immigration, promising to pause entry from some poor countries and review Afghans and other legal migrants already in the country. That is in addition to other measures, some of which were previously set in motion.",
      "Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died after the Wednesday shooting, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, was hospitalized in critical condition.

      "The Trump administration is promising a stricter anti-immigration agenda after an Afghan national was charged in the shooting of two National Guard members",
      "The Trump administration is promising an even tougher anti-immigration agenda after an Afghan national was charged this week in the shooting of two National Guard members, with new restrictions targeting the tens of thousands of Afghans resettled in the U.S. and those seeking to come, many of whom served alongside American soldiers in the two-decade war.",
      "But those still waiting to come were already facing stricter measures as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping crackdown on legal and illegal migration that began when he started his second term in January. And the Afghan immigrants living in the U.S. and now in the administration\u2019s crosshairs were among the most extensively vetted, often undergoing years of security screening, experts and advocates say.",
      "The suspected shooter, who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, \u201cwas vetted both before he landed, probably once he landed, once he applied for asylum,\u201d said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute. \u201cBut more importantly, he was almost certainly vetted extensively and much more by the CIA.\u201d",
      "Haris Tarin, a former U.S. official who worked on the Biden-era program that resettled Afghans, predicted that \"as the investigation unfolds, you will see that this is not a failure of screening. This is a failure of us not being able to integrate \u2014 not just foreign intelligence and military personnel \u2014 but our own veterans, over the past 25 years.\u201d",
      "The program Operations Allies Welcome initially brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome. Almost 200,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under both programs.",
      "Among those brought to the U.S. under the program was the alleged shooter, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who now faces a first-degree murder charge in the death of 20-year-old Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. The other National Guard member who was shot, 24-year-old Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, remains in critical condition.",
      "Those resettlements are now on hold. The State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X.",
      "Trump and his allies have seized on the shooting to criticize gaps in the U.S. vetting process and the speed of admissions, even though some Republicans spent the months and years after the 2021 withdrawal criticizing the Biden administration for not moving fast enough to approve some applications from Afghan allies.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Lakanwal \u201cshould have never been allowed to come here,\u201d Trump called lax migration policies \u201cthe single greatest national security threat facing our nation,\u201d and Vice President JD Vance said Biden\u2019s policy was \u201copening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees.\u201d",
      "That rhetoric quickly turned into policy announcements, with Trump saying he would \"permanently pause all migration\u201d from a list of nearly 20 countries, \u201cterminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions,\u201d and \u201cremove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.\u201d Many of these changes had already been set in motion through a series of executive orders over the past 10 months, including most recently in June.",
      "\u201cThey are highlighting practices that were already going into place,\u201d said Andrea Flores, a lawyer who was an immigration policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations.",
      "Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, and his request was approved in April of this year after undergoing a thorough vetting, according to #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the war.",
      "Flores said the system has worked across administrations: \u201cYou may hear people say, \u2018Well, he was granted asylum under Trump. This is Trump\u2019s problem.\u2019 That\u2019s not how our immigration system works. It relies on the same bedding. No asylum laws have really been changed by Congress.\u201d",

      "This has left the nearly 200,000 Afghans who are currently living across the U.S. in deep fear and shame over the actions of one person in their community. Those in the U.S. are now worrying about their legal status being revoked, while others in the immigration pipeline here and abroad are waiting in limbo.",
      "Nesar, a 22-year-old Afghan who arrived in America weeks after the fall of Kabul, said he had just begun to assimilate into life in the U.S. when the attack happened on Wednesday. He agreed to speak to the AP on condition that only his first name be used for fear of reprisals or targeting by immigration officials.",
      "\u201cLife was finally getting easier for me. I\u2019ve learned to speak English. I found a better job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after this happened two days ago, I honestly went to the grocery store this morning, and I was feeling so uncomfortable among all of those people. I was like, maybe they\u2019re now looking at me the same way as the shooter.\u201d",
      "Two days before the shooting, Nesar and his father, who worked for the Afghan president during the war, had received an interview date of Dec. 13 for their green card application, a moment he said they had been working toward for four years. However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.",
      "Another Afghan national, who also spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said that after fearing for his life under Taliban rule, he felt a sense of peace and hope when he finally received a special immigrant visa to come to the U.S. two years ago.",

But now, he says the actions of an \u201cextremist who, despite benefiting from the safety and livelihood provided by this country, ungratefully attacked two American soldiers,\u201d he and other Afghans will once again face scrutiny.",
      "\u201cIt seems that whenever a terrorist commits a crime, its shadow falls upon me simply because I am from Afghanistan,\u201d he added.",

      "Under the operation this year, more than 60 extra FBI agents, analysts and other personnel were temporarily assigned to field offices in 10 states, ranging from Albuquerque and Phoenix to Seattle, Salt Lake City, Detroit, Minneapolis and Jackson, Mississippi.

      "Reggae music icon Jimmy Cliff, who's unique tone, lyricism and breakthrough role on the silver screen helped make the music of his native Jamaica part of popular culture across the globe, has died at the age of 81, his family said in a statement shared Monday on social media.",
      "\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" Latifa Chambers said in a statement posted on Cliff's Instagram account. \"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him.

      "The couple's children Lilty and Aken also signed the statement.",
      "Cliff was one of Jamaican music's early international stars, emerging as reggae evolved from the sounds of ska and rocksteady in the 1960s and early 1970s. His starring role in the enduring classic movie \"The Harder They Come,\" an entirely Jamaican production, in 1972 cemented his legacy as not only a musician, but a cultural phenom.",
      "Cliff played Ivanhoe \"Ivan\" Martin,  an aspiring singer who came up against the harsh realities of a music business run by self-interested producers, at the expense of artists, and the abundant traps for young Jamaicans trying to survive amid an epidemic of violent gang crime that swept the nation.",
      "\"Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans,\" Cliff told Variety magazine in a 2022 interview to mark the 50th anniversary of the movie's release. \"When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. A real bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. But he had guns and shot a policeman, so he was someone to be feared. However, being a hero was the manner in which [director] Perry [Henzel] wanted to make his name \u2014 an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes.\"",
      "The messages in the movie, just like his music, were timeless.",
      "The title track from \"The Harder They Come,\" along with familiar hits including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"You Can Get It If You Really Want,\" spoke to the struggles of Jamaicans at the time, but they have continued to resonate with audiences around the world since he wrote them.",
      "Cliff, along with other icons such as Bob Marley and Toots Hibbert helped give the music and culture of their relatively small Caribbean nation a global impact that endures today, and far exceeds Jamaica's size in terms of population economy.",
      "His animated onstage presence and high-pitched tone were unmistakable. Cliff released his last single, \"Human Touch,\"   only four years ago. According to The Associated Press, Cliff was nominated for Grammy awards seven times and he won twice, taking best reggae album in 1986 with \"Cliff Hanger,\" and again in 2012 with \"Rebirth.\"",
      "In a tribute posted on his own social media accounts early Monday morning, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called Cliff \"a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world.\"",
      "\"Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul,\" Holness said. \"His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.  We give thanks for his life, his contribution, and the pride he brought to Jamaica ... Walk good, Jimmy Cliff. Your legacy lives on in every corner of our island and in the hearts of the Jamaican people.\"",

    "story": [
      "In 1965, the original musical \"Funny Girl\" was playing at Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre, starring someone who knew her way around a song. That same year, a guy named Joe Allen opened a place a few blocks away. It was the place to be for Broadway stars like Al Pacino and a host of others. Plus, they served a mean cheeseburger.",
      "The cheeseburgers are still there, and so are Broadway's elite. Lea Michele has been coming here since her Broadway debut in the 1990s. \"I just love this place so much,\" she said.",
      "And what would she eat? \"A burger. I mean, it's always so good, so good here, oh my God,\" she said.",
      "But when we met her at Joe Allen's, she wasn't in a burger mood, because she had a show to do. Lea Michele is currently starring in the musical \"Chess.\" In the show, she plays a brilliant strategist for two world champion chess players (played by Aaron Tveit and Nicholas Christopher).",
      "\"Chess\" is a love triangle, a spectacle, and a chance for the stars to raise the roof at the Imperial Theatre \u2013 the same place where Michele made her Broadway debut in 1995 in \"Les Miserables,\" at the age of eight.",
      "Her parents weren't show biz people \u2013 Dad owned a deli \u2013 and before she auditioned, they had no clue their daughter could sing. \"And as we were leaving, I turned to my Mom and I was like, 'I'm gonna get this. I think I'm gonna get this,'\" Michele recalled. \"And she said, 'Things like that don't happen to people like us.'\"",
      "In this case, Mom was wrong: Michele got the part, and went on to even greater heights in the musical \"Spring Awakening,\" and later became a household name in the hit TV show \"Glee.\"",
      "She hit a few bumps along the way, among them a difficult pregnancy with her first child in 2020, and flak on social media that she acted like a diva back in the \"Glee\" days. But things looked up in 2023, when she was asked to step into the shoes of her idol Barbra Streisand, and take over a struggling revival of \"Funny Girl.\"",
      "She said, \"I think that we all grow as we get older. It's hard being in an industry where there is such a spotlight on these phases and times in your life.\"",
      "And what was the pressure like to take over \"Funny Girl\"? It was the first time that I was really sort of in the spotlight after everything that had happened to me personally,\" Michele said. \"I wanted to finally show everyone that I could play this part, and play her really well.\"",
      "Long story short, Michele killed it, and turned a sinking show into a hit, despite suffering a miscarriage during her run. And when she was approached about doing \"Chess,\" she told producers that having another baby came first.\u00a0 \"And so my husband and I ended up doing IVF, which was in its own right very intense and challenging,\" she said. \"But you know, we got pregnant and had our daughter, who is wonderful and wild. And then they, you know, said, 'Would you like to do the show?' 'Absolutely!'\"",
      "Now, the 39-year-old mother of two is back at the Imperial Theatre, where it all began, serving up another knockout performance with a side of gratitude.",
      "I asked, \"What do you think that eight-year-old girl would think, back in that same theatre?\"",
      "\"I think that she'd be so proud, and she would just say, 'Thank you,' 'cause that's all she wanted,\" Michele said. \"And it's still what I want. My love for what I do was definitely reignited during 'Funny Girl.' And I'm very grateful for that. But I'm so happy to be here, and to be home.\"",

      "The man, Johnson Wen, was sent back to Australia and \"has been barred from re-entering Singapore,\" the city-state's immigration authority said in a statement quoted by broadcaster CNA.",
      "Grande and other stars were attending the opening night of the highly anticipated film at Universal Studios in Singapore when 26-year-old Wen jumped a barricade and rushed the actor. He put his arm around Grande.",
      "Viral clips showed Grande's co-star, Cynthia Erivo, rushing to her defense, getting in between the two of them and shoving him away. Wen was then grabbed by security guards and dumped back over the barricade.",
      "Footage shows Erivo and others on the red carpet comforting Grande.",
      "Wen was arrested hours later and charged with \"being a public nuisance.\" Last week, a court sentenced him to nine days in jail.",
      "After the incident, Wen shared a video on Instagram and thanked Grande for \"letting (him) jump on the Yellow Carpet\" with her.",
      "Singapore District Judge Christopher Goh, who issued the jail sentence, called the Australian \"attention seeking.\"",
      "Wen, who is alleged to have disrupted other global sports events and concerts, \"showed a pattern of behaviour\" which suggested that he will do it again, the judge had said before last week's ruling. The jail term was far below the maximum penalty afforded by law: three months in jail, a fine of $1,500, or both.",

      "\"Before we started shooting, both of us had a conversation about making sure that we would take care of each other and make the space that we needed for each other, and take, you know, give each other what we needed, be generous with each other in this thing, because we knew it was a big undertaking,\" Erivo said. \"We knew we had a big responsibility, but we knew neither of us could really do that alone.\"",

    "summary": "Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham, a critic of government vaccine mandates, has been quietly appointed to one of the CDC's top positions.",
    "story": [
      "Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham, a critic of COVID-19 vaccines, has been named second-in-command at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "While there has not been an official announcement about Abraham's role, a CDC spokesperson confirmed with CBS News Atlanta that he was listed in the Atlanta-based agency's address book as principal deputy director. A Health and Human Services spokesperson has also confirmed his appointment.",
      "Abraham, a 70-year-old former Republican congressman and doctor from rural northeast Louisiana, served three terms in the House of Representatives before losing his bid for governor in 2019. He was appointed surgeon general in December 2023.",
      "In February, Abraham ordered his staff to stop engaging in media campaigns and community health fairs to encourage vaccinations, saying in a memo that the Louisiana Department of Health \"will no longer promote mass vaccination.\" The announcement was made the same day that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was sworn in to serve as President Trump's health secretary.",
      "In a letter posted on the Louisiana Department of Health's website, Abraham decried \"blanket government mandates\" for vaccines and criticized the CDC's COVID-19 vaccination push, saying individuals should make their own decisions about vaccinations.",
      "\"Government should admit the limitations of its role in people's lives and pull back its tentacles from the practice of medicine,\" Abraham argued.",
      "Dr. Nirav Shah, an epidemiologist who served in the position under former President Biden's administration, criticized the appointment on X.",
      "\"Dr. Abraham has been on the wrong side of several important public health issues over the past decade,\" Shah wrote. \"His track record, which includes undermining confidence in vaccines and minimizing the risk of outbreaks, disqualifies him from steering an agency charged with protecting all Americans.\"",
      "Abraham's appointment comes as Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has intensified attacks on some components used in vaccinations. Earlier this month, a CDC webpage was\u00a0updated with language claiming that studies have not ruled out linking vaccines to the development of autism. Kennedy later told the\u00a0New York Times in an interview that he personally directed the agency to update the page.",
      "The CDC has remained without a permanent director since August, after Kennedy fired\u00a0Dr. Susan Monarez less than a month after the Senate confirmed her to lead the agency. Monarez testified in front of Congress in September that Kennedy had pressured her to change CDC guidance over childhood vaccinations.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 13:52:54 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration tapped a Biden-era rule to negotiate lower prices on 15 widely used medications for seniors.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has negotiated lower prices for 15 widely used medications covered by Medicare, with the federal government saying the effort will cut spending on those drugs by 44%, or about $12 billion. So will the initiative help save money for seniors?",
      "That's less clear, given that Medicare enrollees are already protected by a cap on drug costs. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\u00a0said Monday the new prices will save the 55 million people enrolled in the Part D pharmaceutical plan a total of about $685 million.",
      "Individuals' out-of-pocket reductions are likely to vary based on whether they use one or more of the drugs covered under the new agreement and if they've reached their annual spending cap. On average, however, with 5.3 million people using the newly discounted drugs, that equates to savings of roughly $129 per Medicare enrollee.",
      "CMS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the projected individual savings under the new Medicare pricing plan.",
      "The lower drug prices were arranged through the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a measure to negotiate prices for some of Medicare's most expensive drugs. Before the 2022 law, Medicare was prohibited from negotiating with pharmaceutical firms to secure more favorable drug prices for participants in the government health program.",
      "Under the new agreement, lower prices for the 15 drugs will take effect in 2027 for medications bought through Medicare's Part D prescription plan, CMS\u00a0said. The discounts will range from 38% to 85% off the medications' list prices, according to the agency.",
      "The best-known drugs covered by the agreement include Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy, popular medications used for diabetes treatment and weight loss, while other drugs on the list are used to treat common diseases such as asthma and prostate cancer.",
      "The cost of prescription drugs ranks among the top concerns of seniors, according to AARP.",
      "Starting in 2025, the Inflation Reduction Act also introduced a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap for seniors. Because that spending limit is adjusted annually for inflation, it could reach about $2,200 in 2027 based on current trends. Medicare enrollees pay nothing for covered prescriptions above that amount. In other words, the negotiated prices for the 15 drugs could help seniors lower their costs until they hit that threshold.",
      "About 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D coverage used the 15 drugs to treat diseases such as diabetes and asthma, CMS said. The medications account for $40.7 billion in spending in Medicare Part D.",
      "Aside from savings that individuals might see on their prescriptions, the lower drug pricing will benefit Medicare itself, Merith Basey, executive director of Patients For Affordable Drugs, an advocacy group for lowering prescription costs, told CBS News.",
      "\"Medicare is using its bargaining power to lower prices on the most expensive drugs covered by the program,\" Basey said. \"The savings gained from the new, lower negotiated prices are what allow the program to pay for the out-of-pocket cap.\"",
      "The program's ability to negotiate drug costs also represents \"the most powerful tool we currently have in place to rein in drug prices and hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable,\" she added.",
      "Medicare's negotiations are separate from deals negotiated by President Trump to lower prices for Zepbound, Ozempic and Wegovy, announced earlier this month. Under that agreement \u2014 which covers eligible patients on Medicare, Medicaid and the planned TrumpRX pharmaceutical website \u2014 the monthly cost of the GLP-1 drugs will range from $245 to $350, down from\u00a0as high as $1,350 per month.",
      "However, the price for Medicare enrollees for Wegovy and Ozempic under the earlier deal will be $245, less than the $274 negotiated by CMS. In Monday's announcement, CMS didn't specify how the two programs might work together.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, CMS said the earlier deal's pricing is \"expected to supersede\" the prices stipulated under IRA.",

      "Thousands of Airbus A320 airliners around the world might require a software update, potentially causing flight delays or cancellations during the busy Thanksgiving holiday weekend.",
      "The emergency update stems from an incident Oct. 30 when a JetBlue flight traveling from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, experienced an issue with its flight controls. The plane dropped about 100 feet in seven seconds, according to preliminary flight data from Flightradar24, and was diverted to Tampa, Florida.",
      "Between 15 and 20 people were injured and taken to area hospitals upon\u00a0landing, according to Vivian Shedd, a spokesperson for Tampa Fire Rescue.",
      "Airbus identified an apparent issue relating to \"intense solar radiation,\" which \"may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls\" and recommended an emergency software update to the A320 family of aircraft \u2013 a common passenger plane for U.S. carriers.",
      "The European Union Aviation Safety Agency, the EU's equivalent to the Federal Aviation Administration, issued an emergency order Friday grounding Airbus A320 family aircraft containing a certain hardware and software combination.",
      "The order goes into effect Saturday at 7 p.m. EST. At that point planes awaiting the updates would be essentially grounded. The order allows for the planes to be flown up to three times without passengers to get them to a location for the fix.",
      "Airbus sources told CBS News that 5,000 to 6,000 airplanes will require software updates.",
      "The FAA is expected to issue an emergency order soon.",
      "Several U.S. carriers use the Airbus A320 family in their fleet. Spirit and Frontier only fly the A320 family of planes, with many popular carriers maintaining several hundred in their fleet.",
      "Delta flies about 315 A320 jets, United has about 200 planes and American has around 480 planes.",
      "United told CBS News the order impacts six aircraft in its Airbus fleet. Delta expects only a small portion of its A320 fleet, less than 50 aircraft, to be impacted by the updates.",
      "American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News Friday evening that it had downgraded the number of impacted aircraft from more than 340 to 209, and that it expected the majority of those 209 to be updated by Friday \"and through the night.\"",
      "\"All aircraft will be completed ahead of the EASA Emergency Airworthiness Directive taking effect tomorrow at 6 p.m. CT,\" American said in a statement.",
      "Airlines for America, the trade association for the leading U.S. airlines, predicted that carriers will fly a record 31 million passengers from last Friday, Nov. 21, through this coming Monday.

    "published": "Fri, 28 Nov 2025 15:36:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The S&amp;P 500 closed near its Oct. 28 record, buoyed by optimism that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates next month.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks gained in a short Friday session to close near a record high, capping a five-day rally that helped the S&P 500 index erase nearly all its losses from earlier in the month.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 36 points, or 0.5%, to close at 6,849, 42 points shy of its Oct. 28 record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 289 points, or 0.6%, to close at 47,716. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7% on Friday but ended November with a decline of 1.5% because of losses for some big tech stocks.",
      "Stock indexes closed at 1 p.m. EDT on Friday due to the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "The multi-day rebound came after a largely volatile month for stocks, sparked by concerns about a possible bubble in artificial intelligence and tech stocks. AI chipmaker Nvidia lost 1.8% Friday and closed the month with a double-digit loss. Oracle tumbled 23% in November while Palantir Technologies sank 16%.",
      "\"The market needs to prove it can sustain this momentum, but right now, the weakness after Nvidia's earnings looks like it could be more of a short-term AI-selling climax than a sign of heightened bearishness,\" Chris Larkin, Managing Director of trading and investing at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley, said in an email.",
      "Some investors have expressed worry that an AI bubble\u00a0could burst, triggering devastating financial losses. Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals.",
      "Some tech stocks did notch monthly gains, most notably Alphabet, which rose nearly 14%, due to excitement about its recently released Gemini AI model.",
      "The market turned around on hopes that the Federal Reserve would again cut interest rates at its meeting next month. Recent comments from Fed officials have given traders more confidence that the central bank will again cut interest rates at its meeting that ends Dec. 10.",
      "Traders are betting on a nearly 87% probability that the Fed will cut next month, according to data from CME Group.",
      "The central bank, which has already cut rates twice this year in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market, is facing an increasingly difficult decision on interest rates as inflation rises and the job market slows. Cutting interest rates further could help support the economy as employment weakens, but it could also fuel inflation. The latest round of corporate earnings reports was mostly positive, but economic data has been mixed.",
      "The minutes of the Fed's most recent meeting in October indicate there are likely to be strong divisions among policymakers about the Fed's next step.",
      "Investors also had their eye on retail stocks as they wait to see if shoppers rushed to take advantage of the annual Black Friday sales event. Macy's fell 0.3% while Kohl's gained 1.4%. Dick's Sporting Goods dropped 0.5%. Among specialty retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch rose 2.9% and American Eagle Outfitters gained 0.7%.",
      "Amid the volatility in tech stocks, traders moved money into other parts of the market. Pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Merck each rose more than 20% for the month. Travel-related companies such as Marriott and Expedia also posted strong monthly gains.",
      "Earlier, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were halted for hours due to a technical issue at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CME said the problem was tied to an outage at a CyrusOne data center.",
      "Treasury yields rose slightly, with the 10-year yield at 4.02%.",

    "summary": "Tech giants including Alibaba, Amazon and Meta are counting on AI as the \"killer app\" that convinces consumers to try smart glasses.",
    "story": [
      "If seeing the world through the eyes of artificial intelligence sounds appealing, a growing number of technology companies have just the thing: AI eyeglasses.",
      "The latest entrant is from Alibaba, which on Thursday started selling smart glasses that let wearers access the Chinese online retailer's Qwen AI app with the touch of a button. Consumers can use the device, dubbed Quark AI Glasses, to search the internet, automatically compile meeting notes, make payments, listen to music and manage their schedule, among other functions.",
      "Consumers can also use the glasses' built-in camera to snap a picture of a product and instantly price it on Alibaba's e-commerce site, Taobao. The glasses, which start at 3,799 yuan (roughly $537), are only available for purchase in China, according to Alibaba.",
      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",
      "One obstacle AI eyewear will have to overcome to gain broader acceptance, according to security experts: privacy. Smart glasses capture, store and share personal data, while their capacity to record and stream video raises thorny questions about filming people without their consent, according to legal experts.",

Still, holiday spending this year could top $1 trillion for the first time, according to a forecast from the National Retail Federation, which expects roughly 187 million people to shop between Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year.",

    "summary": "AI is swiftly reshaping America's labor market, performing many technical and cognitive tasks across a range of industries, study says.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence can do the work currently performed by nearly 12% of America's workforce, according to a recent\u00a0study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "The researchers, relying on a metric called the \"Iceberg Index\" that measures a job's potential to be automated, conclude that AI already has the cognitive and technical capacity to handle a range of tasks in technology, finance, health care and professional services.",
      "The index simulated how more than 150 million U.S. workers across nearly 1,000 occupations interact and overlap with AI's abilities. Specifically, it measures exposure to AI capabilities and how the rapidly emerging technology overlaps with workers' occupational skills.",
      "The study doesn't seek to shed light on how many workers AI may already have displaced or could supplant in the future. To what extent such tools take over job functions performed by people depends on a number of factors, including individual businesses' strategy, societal acceptance and possible policy interventions, the researchers note.",
      "AI's uses extend far beyond some of its most visible applications, such as writing computer code, the researchers note. Among the ways employers across different industries are using AI:",
      "Financial services firms use AI for document processing and analytical support\u00a0Health care providers are adapting AI to handle administrative tasks, allowing clinical staff to focus on patient careManufacturers use the tech for quality control, including automating inspectionsLogistics operators are implementing AI to handle fulfillment",

      "Manufacturers use the tech for quality control, including automating inspections",
      "Logistics operators are implementing AI to handle fulfillment",
      "The study analyzed workers' distinct skills and compared them to the abilities of more than 13,000 AI tools. In some cases, AI can augment human efforts, while in other types of work the technology is far more transformative, according to the researchers.",
      "For example, AI can streamline filling out paperwork, freeing nurses up to spend more time with patients. It can also quickly and accurately produce software code, forcing software engineers with limited skills to shift their focus.",
      "In addition, \"[F]inancial analysts will not disappear, but AI systems may demonstrate capability across significant portions of document-processing and routine analysis work,\" the researchers said. \"This reshapes how roles are structured and which skills remain in demand, without necessarily reducing headcount.\"",
      "AI is also already doing\u00a0some of the entry-level jobs\u00a0that have historically been reserved for recent college graduates or relatively inexperienced workers, the report notes.",
      "\"AI systems now generate more than a billion lines of code each day, prompting companies to restructure hiring pipelines and reduce demand for entry-level programmers,\" the researchers wrote. \"These observable changes in technology occupations signal a broader reorganization of work that extends beyond software development.\"",

      "Garza said he informed his manager, J.D. Aupperle, about the comments on Jan. 10 and claims Aupperle did not encourage him to report the incident to human resources.",
      "Garza was then \"abruptly terminated from employment\" just weeks later, the lawsuit says.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 13:52:54 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration tapped a Biden-era rule to negotiate lower prices on 15 widely used medications for seniors.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has negotiated lower prices for 15 widely used medications covered by Medicare, with the federal government saying the effort will cut spending on those drugs by 44%, or about $12 billion. So will the initiative help save money for seniors?",
      "That's less clear, given that Medicare enrollees are already protected by a cap on drug costs. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\u00a0said Monday the new prices will save the 55 million people enrolled in the Part D pharmaceutical plan a total of about $685 million.",
      "Individuals' out-of-pocket reductions are likely to vary based on whether they use one or more of the drugs covered under the new agreement and if they've reached their annual spending cap. On average, however, with 5.3 million people using the newly discounted drugs, that equates to savings of roughly $129 per Medicare enrollee.",
      "CMS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the projected individual savings under the new Medicare pricing plan.",
      "The lower drug prices were arranged through the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a measure to negotiate prices for some of Medicare's most expensive drugs. Before the 2022 law, Medicare was prohibited from negotiating with pharmaceutical firms to secure more favorable drug prices for participants in the government health program.",
      "Under the new agreement, lower prices for the 15 drugs will take effect in 2027 for medications bought through Medicare's Part D prescription plan, CMS\u00a0said. The discounts will range from 38% to 85% off the medications' list prices, according to the agency.",
      "The best-known drugs covered by the agreement include Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy, popular medications used for diabetes treatment and weight loss, while other drugs on the list are used to treat common diseases such as asthma and prostate cancer.",
      "The cost of prescription drugs ranks among the top concerns of seniors, according to AARP.",
      "Starting in 2025, the Inflation Reduction Act also introduced a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap for seniors. Because that spending limit is adjusted annually for inflation, it could reach about $2,200 in 2027 based on current trends. Medicare enrollees pay nothing for covered prescriptions above that amount. In other words, the negotiated prices for the 15 drugs could help seniors lower their costs until they hit that threshold.",
      "About 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D coverage used the 15 drugs to treat diseases such as diabetes and asthma, CMS said. The medications account for $40.7 billion in spending in Medicare Part D.",
      "Aside from savings that individuals might see on their prescriptions, the lower drug pricing will benefit Medicare itself, Merith Basey, executive director of Patients For Affordable Drugs, an advocacy group for lowering prescription costs, told CBS News.",
      "\"Medicare is using its bargaining power to lower prices on the most expensive drugs covered by the program,\" Basey said. \"The savings gained from the new, lower negotiated prices are what allow the program to pay for the out-of-pocket cap.\"",
      "The program's ability to negotiate drug costs also represents \"the most powerful tool we currently have in place to rein in drug prices and hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable,\" she added.",
      "Medicare's negotiations are separate from deals negotiated by President Trump to lower prices for Zepbound, Ozempic and Wegovy, announced earlier this month. Under that agreement \u2014 which covers eligible patients on Medicare, Medicaid and the planned TrumpRX pharmaceutical website \u2014 the monthly cost of the GLP-1 drugs will range from $245 to $350, down from\u00a0as high as $1,350 per month.",
      "However, the price for Medicare enrollees for Wegovy and Ozempic under the earlier deal will be $245, less than the $274 negotiated by CMS. In Monday's announcement, CMS didn't specify how the two programs might work together.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, CMS said the earlier deal's pricing is \"expected to supersede\" the prices stipulated under IRA.",

    "summary": "Aviation experts worry that the recent government shutdown could make it hard for the U.S. to recruit a new generation of air traffic controllers.",
    "story": [
      "The government shutdown highlighted a fragile link in the nation's aviation system: finding enough air traffic controllers to keep flights on schedule. The 43-day closure, during which controllers were required to work without pay, has only heightened that challenge.",
      "\"It's a good job with good benefits, but partisan fighting over appropriations is not an ideal situation to try to bring in new air traffic controllers and convince them that this is a good career field,\" Tim Kiefer, a retired air traffic controller who is now a professor of air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, told CBS News. \"It's not a positive to try to bring people into this industry by saying, 'You never know if you're not going to get paid.'\"",
      "The shutdown saw a spike in the number of controllers choosing to retire, according to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy. The spectacle could also scare away younger workers from entering the field, Kiefer said.",
      "\"If you are a brand new person looking to enter a career, you may be thinking twice if you have to worry whether you're going to be paid or not. That may be a deterrent, and they might find another job because of that,\" he added.",
      "A spokesperson from the Department of Transportation told CBS News that \"the failure to pay air traffic controllers for 44 days created uncertainty, drove many experienced controllers out of the profession and harmed the recruitment pipeline.\"",
      "\"No one wants to enter a job where their paycheck could be held hostage,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. had roughly\u00a011,700\u00a0certified professional controllers and certified controllers in training, leaving the nation some 4,000 short of the FAA's target staffing level. The agency expects to hire at least 8,900 new air traffic controllers through 2028, while nearly 7,000 are projected to leave over the same period.",
      "The FAA hit its hiring target in 2025, bringing in 2,026 new air traffic controllers, according to the agency.",
      "\"This administration is working all avenues from increasing starting salaries for controllers to streamlining the hiring process to effectively bring about the Golden Age of Travel and ensure America has the safest airspace in the world,\" the Transportation Department spokesperson said.",
      "What are the qualifications?",
      "On the FAA's website, Duffy describes controlling air traffic as \"one of the best, most rewarding \u00a0jobs in America.\" He also highlighted \"the urgent need to do all that we can to recruit more people to join in our shared mission of safety in our skies.\"",
      "Recruiting prospective air traffic controllers is one thing, but getting them to stick with the roughly four years of training required to be certified by the FAA is another matter, according to industry experts.",
      "\"The washout rate at various stages of the controller recruitment and training process is high,\" Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation, a group promoting libertarian principles, told CBS News.",
      "Before someone qualifies to train at the FAA's Air Traffic Controller Academy in Oklahoma City, Okla., job candidates must undergo a rigorous application process. To even apply through USAJobs, the federal government's official employment site, they must meet the following criteria:",
      "Be a U.S. citizenBe under the age of 31Pass the FAA air traffic pre-employment tests, including the Air Traffic Controller Specialists Skills Assessment Battery (ATSA)Speak English clearly enough to be understood over communications equipmentHave one year of progressively responsible work experience, or a Bachelor's degree, or a combination of at least one year of post-secondary education and work experience",
      "Be a U.S. citizen",
      "Be under the age of 31",
      "Pass the FAA air traffic pre-employment tests, including the Air Traffic Controller Specialists Skills Assessment Battery (ATSA)",
      "Speak English clearly enough to be understood over communications equipment",
      "Have one year of progressively responsible work experience, or a Bachelor's degree, or a combination of at least one year of post-secondary education and work experience",
      "Aspiring controllers must also pass an exam that the FAA\u00a0says\u00a0predicts candidates' \"aptitude to be an air traffic controller.\" Within a week, they are notified if they have passed.",
      "Stephen Abraham, a retired air traffic controller formerly based at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, told CBS News that the aptitude exam weeds out many job candidates.",
      "\"It's an assessment that determines if you have the right mental makeup to be an air traffic controller,\" he said, noting that people can not prepare or study for the test. \"If you succeed, they send you to Oklahoma City for eight to 12 weeks, where your training is more tailored toward success.\"",
      "Candidates who pass the test must then undergo comprehensive medical and background checks before they begin training at the academy. The medical red flags include using certain types of contact lenses to correct their vision, which is automatically disqualifying, and abnormal blood pressure.",
      "According to the FAA, fewer than 10% of applicants meet the agency's requirements to work as an air traffic controller and gain admission to the training program.",
      "How much do controllers earn?",
      "Once enrolled at the Oklahoma City academy, students spend months learning the basics of controlling the nation's airspace, such as understanding where to position planes on tabletop models of airports, Abraham explained. As they progress, they start using simulators to practice managing air traffic.",
      "Other training focuses on how to communicate with pilots and other controllers assigned to different parts of the airspace, as well as how to determine the best flight routes based on changing weather conditions and other factors.",
      "In time, trainees are assigned to an air traffic control facility, typically a control tower at a small airport with lighter plane traffic, where they spend an additional two to four years working as controllers under the supervision of more experienced staff.",
      "Joining the FAA academy isn't the only path to becoming a controller. Candidates can instead attend a college that offers an FAA-certified curriculum, and then proceed directly to on-the-job training.",
      "In 2024 (the last year for which federal data is available), the median annual wage for air traffic controllers was $144,580, according\u00a0to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "But pay varies widely based on experience and location. Annual income for less experienced controllers at smaller airports is closer to $60,000, according to aviation experts.

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:49:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Past-due balances are becoming a reality for many U.S. households as they struggle to keep up with costlier utility bills.",
    "story": [
      "Americans' energy bills are piling up, forcing them deeper into debt and even triggering power shutoffs.",
      "As of June, nearly one in 20 households went into collections or fell in arrears on their utility bills, according to a new\u00a0joint report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. The problem was even more pronounced in parts of the South and Appalachia, where one in 12 households was already in collections or on the verge of it.",
      "In the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the report found.",
      "More Americans are falling behind on their utility payments due to\u00a0rising energy prices, alongside a jump in costs for other essentials, ranging from child care to housing.",
      "\"When we see families unable to pay their utility bills, it raises alarm bells about a crisis of home heating and electricity, but it also raises alarm bells about people's ability to deal with their cost of living across the board,\" said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation.",
      "Residential electricity prices rose by 10.5% between January and August 2025, one of the fastest increases in a decade, government data analyzed by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), an educational and policy organization, shows. Natural gas is still the most popular way Americans heat their homes, although a growing\u00a0share are using electricity.",
      "A combination of high interest rates, rising natural gas costs and an increase in demand from data centers has pushed up prices, according to NEADA.",
      "The issue will likely come into sharper focus this winter when millions of consumers face heating bills. NEADA predicts that Americans will see their energy bills rise nearly 8% this winter to an average of roughly $976 per month.",
      "More Americans at risk of shutoffs",
      "When people fail to pay their energy bills on time, it can lead to electricity shutoffs, or when a utility turns off a household's power until people pay the balance, along with a so-called reconnection fee.",
      "Most states have some sort of safeguard against utility shutoffs when the temperature dips below a certain level, but not all. States without cold-weather protection include Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, according to the Energy Justice Lab, a joint project of Indiana University and the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Despite these protections, Americans are becoming increasingly vulnerable to shutoffs, experts told CBS News.",
      "While no official national count of utility cutoffs exists, NEADA estimates that 3.5 million American households had their power cut off at some point in 2024 based on public data reported by utility companies. That number is expected to swell to 4 million this year, NEADA estimates.",
      "\"Past due balances climbing, particularly for lower-income families, suggest that shutoffs are going to become much more prevalent,\" the Century Foundation's Margetta Morgan said.",
      "Con Edison, a utility serving New York City and Westchester County in New York, has cut off almost 168,000 customers at some point this year, according to data NEADA shared with CBS News. That's more than five times the number of shutoffs the utility reported last year.",
      "Most Americans whose power is cut off have services restored within a few days, according to Mark Wolfe, NEADA's executive director. Still, the shutoffs can create major disruptions to Americans' day-to-day lives as they lose refrigeration, internet and lighting. Pipes can also freeze, and residents could get sick if their apartments get too cold, Wolfe added.",
      "Shutoffs tend to have a bigger impact on low-income households, given they are already stretched thin by everyday expenses, Wolfe said. Many turn to payday lenders, friends and family or state forgiveness plans to cover reconnection costs or overdue bills, he added.",
      "\"When money is limited, people have to prioritize essentials like food and medicine, and utility bills become one of the few expenses they can postpone,\" Wolfe told CBS News. \"That flexibility gives them a small sense of control, but it also increases the risk of falling behind and facing shutoffs.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-refund-1000-higher-2026-piper-sandler-obbba-big-beautiful-bill/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:44:54 -0500",
    "summary": "The impact of the Republicans' tax and spending law could result in the \"largest refund season of the last decade,\" a Wall Street report says.",
    "story": [
      "Federal tax refunds often represent a family's single largest check of the year, and next year's refunds could be even bigger, with the average payment set to increase by about $1,000 per filer, according to a recent analysis from financial services company Piper Sandler.",
      "That could boost the typical refund check to roughly $4,151 per filer, based on IRS data that shows the average tax refund was $3,151 for the 2025 tax filing season. Americans will file their 2025 individual returns in early 2026, with most people receiving their refunds within 21 days of submitting their forms to the tax agency.",
      "The analysis aligns with other forecasts predicting a bumper year for tax refunds, driven by the \"one big, beautiful\" tax and spending law signed by President Trump in July. The legislation enacted a bevy of new tax breaks retroactive to 2025, including eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, as well as lifting the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "\"When people go to file, they'll be surprised by really, really large refunds,\" Don Schneider, deputy head of U.S. policy at Piper Sandler and one of the report's authors, said in a recent podcast about the analysis. \"In a typical year, we might have about $270 billion in tax refunds, and it'll be that plus another $90 billion.\"",
      "Americans generally aren't adjusting their withholding to reflect the new law's retroactive tax cuts, largely because it's hard for employees to estimate the impact, Schneider added. As a result, when people file their taxes in early 2026, their refunds could be about one-third larger than usual \u2014 that amounts to roughly an extra $1,000 per filer, according to the report's calculations.",
      "\"It could be one of the largest tax refund seasons ever,\" Schneider added.",
      "Still, the impact won't be evenly distributed, with the benefits largely going toward middle- and upper-middle-income households, or those earning between $60,000 to $400,000 per year, according to Piper Sandler.",
      "That echoes earlier tax analyses projecting that higher-income Americans are likely to see a bigger relative boost from the new tax law compared with lower-income households. People who earn over $217,000 a year are likely to get $6 of every $10 in new tax breaks from the law, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis published in July.",
      "Some of the law's benefits won't reach the highest-earning households because of income phase-outs, Piper Sandler noted. For example, the new $40,000 SALT deduction begins to phase out for filers with annual income of more than $500,000.",
      "The lowest-earning households are also likely to see little benefit from parts of the new tax law. For instance, the higher SALT deduction cap only helps people whose state and local taxes exceed the 2025 standard deduction, which stands at $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples.",
      "Because filers must itemize to claim the SALT deduction, lower-income households typically can't take advantage of it, according to tax experts.",
      "\"This isn't going to the very bottom of the distribution. It isn't going to the very top of the distribution either,\" Scheider said.",

      "A previously unknown work by French impressionist painter Auguste Renoir of his toddler son Jean sold for $2.08 million (1.8 million euros) at a Paris auction on Tuesday, the Drouot auction house told AFP.",
      "The oil painting \u2014 \"L'enfant et ses jouets - Gabrielle et le fils de l'artiste, Jean\" (\"The Child and His Toys - Gabrielle and the artist's son, Jean\") \u2014 had never been exhibited or sold before, though versions have been displayed in museums in Washington, D.C., and Paris, according to PBS.",
      "It belonged to Jean's godmother, Jeanne Baudot, a friend and student of Renoir's, who passed the painting on to her heirs.",
      "Believed to have been painted between 1890 and 1895, it features the artist's second son, who went on to become an Oscar-winning filmmaker, shown sitting with his nanny.",
      "Pascal Perrin, an art historian and Renoir expert, lauded the \"exceptional condition of the work, which has undergone no restoration,\" while presenting the canvas.",
      "\"We were particularly surprised by how fresh the painting was,\" Perrin told PBS earlier this month. \"In other words, it is a painting that has retained all of its colors perfectly, which has not been recanvassed, retouched or revarnished.\"",
      "Jean Renoir, born in 1894, went on to receive a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award in 1975, several years before he died at the age of 84. His works include the 1930s classic \"La Grande Illusion,\" which follows two French prisoners of war trying to escape German captivity during World War I.",
      "The painting of him as a child had been valued at 1-1.5 million euros and was acquired by an \"international buyer,\" Drouot said on Tuesday.",
      "\"It is exceptional because, first of all, it is a masterclass of intimacy,\" auctioneer Christophe Joron-Derem told PBS. \"We see this very tender relationship between Jean and Gabrielle, who knows how to control the child so that Renoir can paint him.\"",
      "The high-end art market has dipped in recent years, but lately, record-breaking sales have indicated a revival in demand.",

      "A proposal from the Trump administration would exclude nursing from a list of professional degrees, a move that has drawn outcry from nursing advocates, who warn it could worsen the nation's nurse shortage by limiting how much students can borrow for their training.",
      "The change stems from changes authorized by the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act, which introduced a new cap on borrowing for higher education. Starting July 1, 2026, students enrolled in professional degree programs will be restricted to borrowing $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap.",
      "Students in graduate programs that aren't deemed professional will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Nursing professionals say they're alarmed by the proposed rule's definition of what constitutes a professional degree, which lists some medical fields, including pharmacy, dentistry and medical doctors, but doesn't include nursing. Capping loans for nursing students could ultimately restrict students' access to enrolling in degree programs at a time when the industry is already grappling with a shortage of nurses, they say.",
      "The proposal would create \"obstacles for students who want to pursue advanced degrees, which would most likely lead to decreased students pursuing degrees in nursing,\" Kim Litwack, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Nursing, told CBS News. \"That means there will be less of these professionals joining the workforce.\"",
      "In a statement issued earlier this month, the Education Department said the proposal creates a new definition of a professional student to determine who qualifies for the higher loan limits.",
      "The goal of the changes, including the new loan caps, is to ensure that borrowers won't face \"insurmountable debt to finance degrees that do not pay off,\" said Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent in the statement.",
      "In an email to CBS News, the Education Department said 95% of nursing students won't be impacted by the borrowing cap.",
      "\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" said Ellen Keast, the press secretary for higher education at the agency. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"",
      "What's a professional degree?",
      "Under the Education Department's proposal, a professional degree is one that \"signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession, and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree.\"",
      "The department also said in a\u00a0fact sheet that its definition of a professional degree is used to distinguish programs that qualify for higher loan limits from one another, and is \"not a value judgement about the importance of programs.\"",
      "The programs that it defines as professional include: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry and theology. Students in degree programs that aren't considered professional \u2014 such as those in nursing, physical therapy and physician assistant degrees \u2014 would have lower loan caps under the proposed rule.",
      "Other groups representing professions that were excluded under the proposal also issued objections, such as the Council on Social Work Education, which said it was \"disheartened and concerned.\" The American Academy of Audiology pointed out that audiology isn't included, which it said could discourage students from pursuing careers in the field.",
      "Nursing's exclusion from the list of professional degree programs \"makes no sense,\" said Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association.",
      "In addition to lowering the loan cap, the \"big, beautiful bill\" law also eliminates the Grad PLUS program that allows graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of obtaining a degree.",
      "Kennedy and other nursing industry advocates who disagree with the omission of nursing as a professional degree are hopeful the proposal could be changed before it's adopted.",
      "\"It feels like a miscommunication, and we hope the Department of Education changes the proposed language before the rule comes out for public comment. They did add professions to the list before it was released, so they could have added nurses, which clearly belong,\" she said.",
      "The Education Department said the proposal will be published in the Federal Register, although it didn't specify a date, and will be open for public comment.",
      "\"A real gut punch\"",
      "Olga Yakusheva, an economist and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, said limiting how much money nursing students can borrow could curb entry into the field.",
      "\"It's going to limit the ability of nurses to apply for graduate school, and on the back end, it will limit the number of nurses available in primary care settings and in hospitals,\" she said. \"Communities with shortages of physicians will feel this the most.\"",
      "Patricia Pittman, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, said nurses fill critical medical care gaps in rural communities. The rule could create financial barriers that she says would disincentivize nurses from seeking advanced licensing, which ultimately could harm rural areas.",
      "\"Basically, nobody would be there if it weren't for these nurse practitioners,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Pittman also says it will have a negative effect on morale within the nursing profession.",
      "\"It's a real gut punch, and the result nurses are going to be angry about this,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Criminals are targeting shoppers with fake websites, bogus charities and other fraudulent pitches, according to insights from Visa.",
    "story": [
      "The holiday shopping season is creating fresh openings for scammers looking to snag consumers' payment data, according to Visa's 2025 Holiday Threats Report.",
      "Artificial intelligence is also helping criminals move faster and reach more victims, according to Visa's scam disruption team. AI tools can generate authentic-sounding text for fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your information.",
      "\"Just as regular consumers are excited for shopping season, scammers are also excited, because it gives them opportunities to capitalize on these feelings, and illicitly gather payment data, or other personal information from unsuspecting victims,\" Michael Jabbara, global head of fraud services at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Here are five of the most common types of scams to watch for this holiday season, according to Visa.",
      "Fake retail websites",
      "Websites that appear authentic but have been constructed for the sole purpose of scamming customers are proliferating, according to Visa. These sites can closely mimic popular companies, duping shoppers into handing over credit card information.",
      "Sometimes they ship shoddy goods to customers, but in other cases, they don't bother sending anything.",
      "Jabbara said it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate and copycat sites, and that it's wise to do extra research if your gut instinct says something is awry.",
      "\"Scammers do this for a living and are very good at it. You don't want to underestimate them,\" Jabbara said. \"If a consumer has a feeling that a deal is too good to be true, or a website looks fishy, do some validation.\"",
      "That can include looking at online reviews of the site or going directly to the business's site by typing in its URL, versus clicking on a social media site. For example, open a web browser and type in Gap.com, as opposed to clicking a link in a digital ad promoting T-shirts.",
      "Package delivery scams",
      "Scam artists are sending consumers texts claiming there is a \"delivery problem\" with an online order they probably didn't place. Criminals posing as package delivery services like UPS or FedEx tell consumers they must turn over their credit card information to receive a phony delivery.",
      "This type of scam proliferates around the holidays, when consumers make more online purchases and shippers deal with higher-than-normal volumes of packages, Visa notes.",
      "Criminals may sell and trade your personal information on the dark web, or enroll you in recurring billing cycles you never signed up for. Some consumers might not catch these issues if they don't pay close attention to their credit card statements, according to Visa.",
      "\"They input your payment information into a form and monetize it on different channels,\" Jabbara said.",
      "Jabbara advises that consumers never click on links from unknown senders.",
      "Paying for seasonal work",
      "Fake job offers also crop up during the holidays, when many Americans are trying to earn extra cash to cover gift-giving and travel. Scammers take advantage of that financial pressure.",
      "Visa advises job seekers to apply only through a company's official channels and to avoid any role that requires upfront payments.",
      "\"We see 'job offers' that tell workers they have to pay a fee to apply, or for a background check,\" Jabbara said. \"That is a surefire sign of a scam.\"",
      "Consumers should also verify that any company they're applying to is legitimate, he added.",
      "Travel-related fraud",
      "Scammers are also creating fake travel sites and sending phishing emails targeting people with holiday travel plans.",
      "Make sure to make reservations through trusted travel sites, and if a deal appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. Looking at reviews can help determine if a site is legitimate, Jabbara advises.",
      "Charity scams",
      "The year-end giving season also attracts scammers who exploit people's generosity by setting up phony charities.",
      "Fraudsters may build convincing websites or approach people in person with tap-to-donate schemes, Visa said. As with other scams, it's wise to confirm a charity's legitimacy before donating.",

      "\"Rad Power Bikes firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC's characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe,\" a Rad spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",

    "summary": "Investors are now forecasting that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting, scheduled for Dec. 10.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. stock market rose on Monday, spurred by a jump in tech stocks and renewed expectations that the Federal Reserve may slash its benchmark interest rate at its December meeting.",
      "The S&P 500 climbed 108 points, or 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 294 points, or 0.6%, as of 2:10 p.m. EDT. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 2.7%.",
      "Companies with investments in artificial intelligence saw gains on Monday. Alphabet, which has been getting praise for its newest Gemini AI model, rallied 5.5% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. The jump in tech stocks comes as investors continue to assess the potential of AI-focused businesses, even as questions remain about\u00a0whether an AI bubble is forming.",
      "AI chipmaker Nvidia gained 2.1%.",
      "Stocks also rose on renewed expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates for a third straight time at its Dec. 10 meeting. Traders now place the likelihood of a rate cut around nearly 80%, up from 41% on Thursday, according to data from CME FedWatch.",
      "But Monday's gains were hesitant, and the S&P 500 rallied to a gain of 1% only to halve it within the first 15 minutes of trading, before picking up momentum again.",
      "Stocks have been swinging sharply, not just day to day but also hour to hour, in recent weeks as worries weigh about what the Fed will do with interest rates and whether too much money is pouring into AI and creating a bubble. All the uncertainty is creating the biggest test for investors since an April sell-off, when President Donald Trump shocked the world with his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
      "Still, despite all the recent fear, the S&P 500 remains within 2.8% of its record  set last month.",

      "One of the biggest tests will arrive on Tuesday, when the U.S. government will deliver data showing the inflation rate at the wholesale level in September.",
      "Economists expect the data to show a 2.6% rise from a year earlier, the same inflation rate as August. A higher-than-expected reading could deter the Fed from cutting its main interest rate in December because lower rates can worsen inflation. Some Fed officials have already argued against a December cut in part because inflation has stubbornly remained  above their 2% target.",
      "Monday's rally came at the start of an abbreviated trading week. U.S. markets will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. A day later, it's on to the rush of Black Friday and Cyber Monday.",

      "Bitcoin, meanwhile, continued its sharp swings. It was sitting near $87,600 after bouncing between $82,000 and $94,000 over the last week. It was near $125,000 last month.

    "summary": "A higher Medicare Part B premium in 2026 could erode next year's cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security recipients, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "A higher Medicare premium set to go into effect in 2026 will push the monthly charge above $200 for the first time, with the increase likely to erode next year's cost-of-living increase for millions of Social Security recipients.",
      "The premium for Medicare's Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient services, will rise 9.7% to $202.90, an increase of $17.90 from the current $185 monthly cost, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u00a0said earlier this month. It's the largest increase since 2022, when the Part B premium jumped 15%.",
      "The Part B deductible \u2014 the amount seniors must pay out of pocket before their coverage kicks in\u2014 is also rising about 10%, jumping to $283 next year from this year's $257.",
      "The Part B premium, which is deducted automatically from seniors' monthly Social Security checks, is rising at a rate that's three times that of inflation, partly due to a rise in underlying health care costs, Anne Montgomery, senior health policy expert at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare (NCPSSM), said in a\u00a0blog\u00a0post. The Medicare premium increase means that seniors may not have much room to keep up with inflation, Max Richtman, the president and CEO of the same group, told CBS News.",
      "\"So many rely on [Social Security] for all or most of their income,\" he said. \"This is gonna hurt.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration set next year's cost-of-living increase at 2.8%, which will boost the average Social Security paycheck by $56 to about $2,071 per month.",
      "The Medicare Part B premium hike will consume about a third of next year's COLA, effectively lowering the rate to 1.9% \u2014 far below the current inflation rate of 3%, according to NCPSSM's analysis. People with lower monthly benefits could even see an effective COLA of zero, the group said.",
      "Rising health care costs",
      "Health care costs have been rising for all Americans, contributing to the sticker shock that seniors and other groups are experiencing. In 2023, Americans spent an average of $1,514 on out-of-pocket health care costs, an increase of 9% from 2020 on an inflation-adjusted basis, according to KFF.",
      "Aside from underlying health care inflation, Medicare's costs are also increasing because of increased demand for medical services, CMS said this month.",
      "Working adults will also face higher health care premiums in 2026. Roughly 22 million Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces will also be faced with steep rate hikes if Congress fails to extend premium tax credits, which help lower the cost for the majority of people on ACA plans.",
      "Those credits are set to expire at the end of 2025, which became the main sticking point in the recent government shutdown. Without an extension, Americans who rely on the tax credit could see their costs more than double in 2026, KFF estimates.",
      "Workers with employee-sponsored coverage are also likely to see their costs climb\u00a0next year, with most expected to pay 6% to 7% more for their 2026 plans, according to an analysis from consultant Mercer.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Friday directed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers to pause all asylum decisions in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., according to an internal directive obtained by CBS News and two sources familiar with the order.",
      "The move is the administration's latest effort to tighten the American immigration system after Wednesday's attack, which was allegedly carried out by an Afghan man who was granted asylum by U.S. immigration officials earlier this year.",
      "Asylum officers at USCIS, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, were instructed to refrain from approving, denying or closing asylum applications received by the agency, according to the internal notice and sources, who requested anonymity to describe an action that has not been publicly announced.",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration said it would start a review of asylum approvals under the Biden administration, citing the shooting of the two National Guard members, one of whom has died. The man accused of shooting the soldiers, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who entered the U.S. in 2021 during former President Joe Biden's presidency and was granted asylum this spring under the second Trump administration.",
      "The action relayed to USCIS asylum officers internally on Friday amounts to an indefinite pause on asylum adjudications for all nationalities. Asylum cases are filed by foreigners who claim they will suffer persecution if deported or returned to their home countries because of certain factors, including their race, nationality, religion or political views.",
      "\"Do not enter any decision information for affirmative cases,\" a USCIS notice to asylum officers in one office read, referring to asylum cases overseen by the agency. \"Defensive\" cases, the other type of asylum applications, are filed by those facing deportation and are decided by federal immigration judges at the Justice Department.",
      "Officers were told the pause applied to all USCIS asylum cases, including those filed by Afghans who arrived under a Biden administration resettlement effort dubbed \"Operation Allies Welcome.\" They were also told that in-person appointments for asylum applicants to find out what decisions have been made on their cases would be canceled, at least for Monday.",
      "The guidance said officers could continue asylum application interviews and review cases up to the point of making a decision. \"Once you've reached decision entry, stop and hold,\" the directive said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News Friday, USCIS Director Joe Edlow confirmed CBS News' reporting.",
      "\"USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,\" Edlow said. \"The safety of the American people always comes first.\"",
      "According to Homeland Security officials, Lakanwal was allowed to enter the U.S. in September 2021 through the humanitarian parole policy, which the Biden administration used to resettle tens of thousands of Afghans evacuated following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. He applied for asylum in 2024 and his application was granted earlier this year, the officials said.",
      "Following Wednesday's shooting, the Trump administration has unveiled a series of immigration measures it argues will bolster the government's ability to mitigate the chances of similar attacks.",
      "Officials first announced an indefinite pause on the processing of all legal immigration applications \u2014 ranging from citizenship and green card cases, to requests for work permits and asylum \u2014 filed by applicants from Afghanistan.",
      "USCIS' director, Joseph Edlow, then announced he had ordered, at President Trump's direction, a \"full scale, rigorous reexamination\" of green card cases involving nationals affected by a presidential proclamation that fully or partially suspended travel and immigration from 19 countries. That list, released in June and which the White House referred to as a \"travel ban,\" includes Afghanistan and other countries in Asia and the Middle East, such as Iran, as well as African nations, including Somalia and Sudan. Mr. Trump's order also applies to nationals of Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela.",
      "USCIS published a policy Thursday that allows adjudicators to cite concerns about the inability to properly vet and identify green card applicants from the group of 19 countries as a potential reason to deny their cases.",
      "\"Certain countries (including but not limited to Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and Venezuela) lack a competent or central authority for issuing passports and civil documents among other concerns, which directly relates to USCIS' ability to meaningfully assess eligibility for benefit requests including identity, and therefore whether an alien warrants a favorable exercise of discretion,\" USCIS said in its guidance.",
      "Late Thursday, Mr. Trump vowed to \"permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,\" writing on Truth Social that his administration would revoke the citizenship of those it deems \"undermine domestic tranquility\" and deport any foreigner \"who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.\"",

      "Biden signed 162 executive orders during his presidency, according to the American Presidency Project. It's unclear how many were signed using an autopen, though it's not unusual for presidents to revoke their predecessor's directives.",
      "Mr. Trump has already rolled back dozens of Biden's executive orders. The president rescinded nearly 70 of Biden's executive orders shortly after he was sworn in on Jan. 20 for his second term and another 19 on March 14, according to the White House.",

      "President Trump described him as \"a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan, a hellhole on Earth,\" in a video message late Wednesday. He said the suspect's status was extended \"under legislation signed by President Biden.\"",
      "A Department of Homeland Security official told CBS News the suspect was paroled into the U.S. on humanitarian grounds back in 2021. That was the main legal mechanism the Biden administration used to welcome tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees after the Taliban takeover in August 2021.",
      "Lakanwal\u00a0later applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2024 and his application was granted in 2025, the DHS official said. But his request for a green card, which is tied to the asylum grant, is pending.",
      "Many of the Afghan nationals who were admitted to the U.S. in 2021 were issued special immigrant visas offered to those who worked alongside the military during its 20-year war, while others were given a temporary humanitarian status known as parole.",
      "More than 8,000 people from Afghanistan were also granted deportation relief under a separate program called temporary protected status, which Biden extended in 2023 but Mr. Trump chose to end earlier this year.",
      "Suspect had worked with U.S. forces and CIA in Afghanistan",
      "A CIA spokesperson confirmed Thursday that the suspect worked with the U.S. government, including the CIA, during the war in Afghanistan.",
      "CBS News has also learned that the suspect led a team in the former Afghan national armed forces that worked directly with U.S. and British forces.",
      "Operational vetting conducted during the war was aimed largely at ensuring Afghan partner forces would not turn their weapons on U.S. personnel, and former intelligence officials said that the screening was not meant to serve as an immigration clearance.",

      "The former commando told CBS News that Lakanwal was left deeply troubled by the death of a close friend and fellow Afghan commander in 2024, whom he said had unsuccessfully sought asylum in the U.S.",
      "Multiple law enforcement sources told CBS News on Thursday that a running theory of investigators is that the suspect suffered from paranoia and other mental health challenges that indicated he believed authorities sought to deport him from the U.S. Counterterrorism officials said that ISIS and al-Qaeda-aligned narratives often target former U.S. partner forces with messaging that they will be abandoned or deported. While the suspect repeatedly expressed a fear of deportation, investigators have not linked that anxiety to extremist propaganda or a specific organization, officials said. Investigators are searching for evidence of extremist influence.",
      "Suspect placed on a ventilator",
      "The suspect was subdued at the scene of the shooting and taken into custody by National Guard members and law enforcement officers, Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, told reporters Wednesday.",

      "Carroll said the suspect appeared to be \"a lone gunman that raised the firearm and ambushed these members of the National Guard\" as they patrolled near a mass transit station in downtown D.C.",
      "The suspect had four rounds in his handgun initially, multiple sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News. The revolver used in the attack was not registered to the suspect, according to investigators. Instead, it belonged to a deceased Washington state resident. Officials said the number of bullets in the weapon is unusual and remains unexplained.",
      "The first victim \u2014 a female guard member \u2014 was struck immediately and collapsed where she stood. She sustained at least two gunshot wounds during the ambush, the sources said.",
      "Then, the suspect took her weapon and used it to continue shooting, striking the second guard member, according to multiple sources. A third guard member, who was not injured, ultimately returned fire, ending the attack.",
      "One of the victims, 20-year-old Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, has died, Mr. Trump said Thursday. The second victim, Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, was in critical condition after undergoing surgery, Pirro said earlier Thursday.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has lashed out at several female reporters who have asked him questions or written critically of him in recent weeks, calling them \"ugly,\" \"stupid,\" and \"piggy.\"",
      "The most recent incident came at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday night, when CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes asked the president about the suspect in the shooting of two members of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who was let into the U.S. under the Biden administration and granted asylum under the Trump administration.",
      "Cordes pointed out that the inspector general of the Justice Department found that Afghans who entered the U.S. after the fall of Kabul in 2021 had been thoroughly vetted. She asked the president: \"So why do you blame the Biden administration \u2014\"",
      "\"Because they let him in. Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person? Because they came in on a plane, along with thousands of other people that shouldn't be here, and you're just asking questions because you're a stupid person,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "On Wednesday, the president assailed New York Times correspondent Katie Rogers, who co-authored an article on his age and physical stamina in his second term, calling her \"third rate\" and \"ugly, both inside and out.\"",
      "The president's insults at Cordes and Rogers are just the latest in recent weeks that have been aimed at female reporters covering his presidency. While speaking to members of the press on Air Force One earlier this month, the president snapped at Bloomberg White House correspondent Catherine Lucey, telling her \"Quiet. Quiet, piggy.\"",
      "Lucey was asking the president about re uh leasing the files from the Justice Department's investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Asked about the comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump is \"very frank and honest\" with reporters and contrasted the president's willingness to take questions from the press to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"I think the president being frank and open and honest to your faces rather than hiding behind your backs, is, frankly, a lot more respectful than what you saw in the last administration, where you had a president who lied to your face and then didn't speak to you for weeks and hid upstairs and didn't take your questions,\" she said. \"So I think everyone in this room should appreciate the frankness and the openness that you get from President Trump on a near daily basis.\"",
      "A Bloomberg spokesperson told the Washington Post that \"our White House journalists perform a vital public service, asking questions without fear or favor. We remain focused on reporting issues of public interest fairly and accurately.\"",
      "Then last week, while hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office last week, Mr. Trump berated ABC News chief White House correspondent Mary Bruce when she asked about the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. An intelligence report released by the Biden administration concluded that bin Salman ordered the attack on Khashoggi.",
      "Mr. Trump accused Bruce of embarrassing the crown prince with her question and later called her a \"terrible person and a terrible reporter.\" The president said her question was \"horrible\" and \"insubordinate.\"",
      "Wednesday's insult against Rogers was provoked by a New York Times article published Tuesday that examined the frequency of the president's public events and domestic travel, as well as the timing of his appearances on his public schedule. At 79, Mr. Trump is the oldest person elected to serve as president.",
      "Signs of bruising on his right hand as well as swollen ankles have prompted new questions about Mr. Trump's health. The president also revealed to reporters last month that he underwent an MRI during a physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in April.",
      "Rogers' byline on the piece about Mr. Trump's aging in office is listed alongside another reporter, Dylan Freedman, a machine-learning engineer and journalist at the New York Times.",
      "The president attacked the Times and Rogers over the article, which he claimed was a \"hit piece.\" He called the newspaper a \"cheap 'rag'\" that is \"truly an 'enemy of the people.'\"",
      "\"The writer of the story, Katie Rogers, who is assigned to write only bad things about me, is a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.\u00a0 He did not mention the story's co-author.",
      "The New York Times defended the article and Rogers.",
      "\"The Times' reporting is accurate and built on first hand reporting of the facts. Name-calling and personal insults don't change that, nor will our journalists hesitate to cover this administration in the face of intimidation tactics like this,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"Expert and thorough reporters like Katie Rogers exemplify how an independent and free press helps the American people better understand their government and its leaders.\"",
      "The Society of Professional Journalists condemned Mr. Trump's attacks on Bruce and Lucey last week, which it said were not isolated and instead \"part of an unmistakable pattern of hostility \u2014 often directed at women \u2014 that undermines the essential role of a free and independent press.\"",
      "\"Journalists are not props at a photo op \u2014 they are watchdogs for the public,\" Caroline Hendrie, executive director of the group, said in a statement. \"When reporters ask hard questions about the murder of a fellow journalist, that is not an embarrassment. What's embarrassing is a leader trying to silence those questions.\"",

A U.S. official had told CBS News that the Army has received the request and will work to fulfill it quickly.",

      "The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a statement that the \"processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,\" effective immediately.",
      "The announcement came shortly after the Department of Homeland Security announced publicly that the suspected shooter \u2014 who was shot by a Guard member and is now in custody \u2014 was a man named Rahmanullah Lakanwal who entered the U.S. in 2021 under a Biden-era initiative for Afghans called Operation Allies Welcome.",
      "President Trump said in remarks following the shooting: \"We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country.\"",
      "The U.S. military evacuated tens of thousands of people from Afghanistan in 2021, as the United States' two-decade-long war in the country ended with the Taliban returning to power.",

That program was plagued by years of backlogs, however.",
      "Others from Afghanistan applied for asylum \u2014 which is offered to people fleeing persecution \u2014 or visas based on being family members of U.S. citizens or green card holders.",
      "And many were granted less permanent protections like humanitarian parole and temporary protected status, putting them in an uncertain situation with no clear pathway to permanent residency unless they qualified for some other immigration status.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security official told CBS News the shooting suspect was paroled into the U.S. on humanitarian grounds in 2021. Lakanwal later applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2024 and his application was granted in 2025, the DHS official said. But his request for a green card, which is tied to the asylum grant, is pending.",
      "More than 8,000 people from Afghanistan were also granted deportation relief under a separate program called temporary protected status, which Biden extended in 2023 but Mr. Trump\u00a0chose to end earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said Thursday it will be conducting a \"full-scale, rigorous reexamination\" of all green cards for every immigrant from \"a country of concern\" in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. An Afghan national who arrived in the U.S. in 2021 has been arrested as a suspect in Wednesday's attack.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow said Thursday that the order had come at the request of President Trump. Two Homeland Security officials told CBS News there are 19 countries on that list, including Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Sudan, Yemen and Venezuela.",
      "Two members of the West Virginia National Guard, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, were shot Wednesday near the White House in what authorities described as an \"ambush-style attack.\" President Trump on Thursday told reporters that Beckstrom had died from her injuries. Wolfe was in critical condition as of Thursday morning, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said.",
      "The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was shot Wednesday by a member of the National Guard, ending the attack, authorities said. He faces three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed, and he will also be charged with possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, Pirro said Thursday. The charges could still change pending the condition of the guard members.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security identified the suspect in Wednesday's shooting as Lakanwal, an Afghan national who authorities said was paroled into the U.S. in 2021 under a Biden-era program for Afghan nationals called Operation Allies Welcome. The CIA confirmed Thursday that Lakanwal had worked with the agency in Afghanistan.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday that the agency is now reviewing all asylum cases approved under the Biden administration.",
      "It's unclear how wide-ranging Homeland Security's review of the asylum policies will be. The Trump administration ordered an unprecedented review and rescreening of all refugees admitted to the U.S. under the Biden administration earlier this month. Refugees and asylum-seekers have to meet the same legal definition, but arrive in the U.S. under different circumstances.",
      "Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021, and his asylum case was granted earlier this year, while Mr. Trump was in office, a Homeland Security official told CBS News. In her statement, McLaughlin appeared to blame the shooting suspect's approval on a Biden-era court settlement that required the federal government to expedite the processing of Afghan asylum cases.",
      "Since the shooting, the Trump administration had already paused all immigration processing requests from Afghan nationals. An estimated 85,000 Afghans were settled in the U.S. under Operation Allies Welcome after the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. In many cases, they were initially housed at military bases and flown to the U.S. after undergoing processing.",
      "Mr. Trump posted a video on social media on Wednesday night addressing the shooting, calling it an \"act of evil and an act of hatred and an act of terror. It was a crime against our entire nation. It was a crime against humanity.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 19:39:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Federal judges have allowed North Carolina to use a redrawn congressional map designed to give Republicans an additional U.S. House seat.",
    "story": [
      "A panel of federal judges on Wednesday allowed North Carolina to use a redrawn congressional map aimed at flipping a seat to Republicans, as part of a multi-state redistricting campaign ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "The map targets the state's only swing seat, currently held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis. The 1st District has been represented by Black members of Congress continuously for more than 30 years. The state legislature's redrawing effort would shift the district from 48% to 44% Democratic, according to a CBS News analysis.",
      "The three-judge panel unanimously denied preliminary injunction requests after a hearing in Winston-Salem in mid-November. The day after the hearing, the same judges separately upheld several other redrawn U.S. House districts that GOP state lawmakers initially enacted in 2023. They were first used in the 2024 elections, contributing to a Republican gain of three more congressional seats.",
      "North Carolina is one of several states this year in which President Trump has directed the GOP to redraw maps in the middle of the decade \u2014 without courts requiring it \u2014 to avoid losing control of Congress in next year's midterms. Besides North Carolina, Republican-led legislatures or commissions in Texas and Missouri have adopted new, more GOP-friendly maps. A lower court froze Texas' new map last week, but the Supreme Court temporarily paused that ruling days later.",
      "In California, voters countered by adopting new districts drawn to improve Democrats' chances of winning more seats. And the Democratic-led Virginia General Assembly also has taken a step toward redistricting with a proposed constitutional amendment.",
      "Democrats need to gain just three seats to win control of the House and impede Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "North Carolina's Republican-controlled General Assembly gave final approval to the state's district changes on Oct. 22. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's approval wasn't needed.",
      "In a statement, North Carolina Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said the decision \"thwarts the radical left's latest attempt to circumvent the will of the people\" in a state that voted for Trump in 2016, 2020 and 2024.",
      "\"As Democrat-run states like California do everything in their power to undermine President Trump's administration and agenda, North Carolina Republicans went to work to protect the America First Agenda,\" Berger said.",
      "Wednesday's ruling covers two lawsuits.",
      "In one filed by the state NAACP, Common Cause and voters, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction on First Amendment grounds. They say Republican lawmakers unconstitutionally targeted North Carolina's \"Black Belt\" instead of Democratic-voting areas with higher White populations because in 2024 they organized and voted for their preferred candidates and had sued over the 2023 configuration of the district.",
      "In the second lawsuit, filed by voters, the case for a preliminary injunction rested in part on an argument that the use of five-year-old Census data due to the mid-decade redrawing of districts violates the Constitution, including the 14th Amendment's one-person, one-vote guarantee. Additionally, it says lawmakers relied on race in mapmaking in violation of the First and 14th Amendments.",
      "Attorneys for the Republican lawmakers defending the districts wrote that the objectives in redrawing the map were political, not racial, and were part of a \"nationwide partisan redistricting arms race.\" They rejected assertions about old Census data and retaliation over activities protected by the First Amendment, saying they don't align with Supreme Court precedent.",
      "Republicans now hold 10 of North Carolina's 14 House seats \u2014 thanks in part to the 2023 map \u2014 and they hope to flip an 11th under the latest redistricting changes to the 1st District and the adjoining 3rd District. This effort happened in a state where Trump got 51% of the popular vote in 2024 and statewide elections are often close. Candidate filing in these and scores of other 2026 North Carolina races has been slated to begin Dec. 1.",
      "The litigation challenging the October changes to the map said the boundaries approved by Republicans would result in the Black voting-age population in the 1st District falling from 40% in the 2023 map to 32%.",
      "Republicans in part moved counties in the 1st District with significant Black -\u2013 and usually highly Democratic -\u2013 populations to the 3rd District currently represented by Republican Greg Murphy. Recent election results indicate both the 1st and 3rd would be favorable for Republicans.",
      "Many of the same plaintiffs challenging the newly altered 1st District sued earlier over the House map enacted in 2023, alleging that Republicans unlawfully fractured and packed Black voters to weaken their voting power.",
      "But the judges \u2014 all nominated by Republican presidents \u2014 recently dismissed the claims against five other congressional districts and three legislative districts, writing that those who sued failed to prove legislators drew the maps \"with the discriminatory purpose of minimizing or canceling out the voting potential of Black North Carolinians.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Georgia judge on Wednesday agreed to dismiss the state's case against President Trump and his allies stemming from the 2020 presidential election after the local prosecutor who took over the case said he would no longer pursue the charges \"to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality.\"",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee issued a brief order dismissing the case \"in its entirety\" shortly after Peter Skandalakis, who stepped in to replace Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis after she was disqualified from the case, filed a motion informing the court of his decision to abandon the prosecution of Mr. Trump and more than a dozen others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.",
      "Skandalakis wrote in a memo accompanying the notice that overt acts listed in the indictment that were taken by the president and other Republicans \"are not acts I would consider sufficient\" to sustain a racketeering case. Skandalakis said that after reviewing the evidence, he concluded that a federal prosecution was more appropriate than one pursued by the state of Georgia, and said the \"strongest and most prosecutable case\" against those who allegedly sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election was the one being pursued by former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "The president was charged with four federal counts stemming from an alleged effort to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, but Smith dropped the case after Mr. Trump won a second term in the White House.",
      "Steve Sadow, Mr. Trump's lawyer in the Georgia case, said in response to Skandalakis' motion, \"The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified DA Fani Willis is finally over. This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called the prosecution an \"illegal, unconstitutional and unAmerican hoax.\"",
      "\"LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed in the Great State of Georgia,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Mr. Trump and 18 of his associates were indicted by a Fulton County grand jury in August 2023 under Georgia's racketeering law and were accused of coordinating a scheme to thwart certification of the 2020 election results in the state. The indictment capped an extraordinary and historic five months, across which the president was charged in four separate cases involving allegations of conduct that bookended his first term in office. Mr. Trump was the first former president to be charged with a crime.",
      "Two of those cases were brought by Smith and involved federal offenses, and a third was brought by the Manhattan District Attorney and stemmed from an alleged \"hush money\" payment to an adult film actress before the 2016 election. Smith ended his prosecutions of the president \u2014 one related to the 2020 election and the other involving his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents after leaving office in January 2021 \u2014 after he won a second term.",
      "In the New York case, Mr. Trump was found guilty of 34 state felony counts of falsifying business records in June 2024 and has appealed the conviction.",
      "Mr. Trump was initially charged with 13 felony counts in Georgia, but several have been dismissed in the years since the indictment. He pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. Four of the president's 18 co-defendants accepted plea deals from prosecutors.",
      "The prosecution in Fulton County moved the slowest of the criminal cases involving the president, and proceedings were derailed for months by the bombshell revelation that Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, had a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, whom she hired as a special prosecutor to assist in the investigation into Mr. Trump and his allies.",
      "The two acknowledged the relationship but said it didn't begin until months after Wade was hired in November 2021.",
      "The trial court judge overseeing the case, Scott McAfee, held a multi-day hearing to examine whether Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because of her relationship with Wade and travels with him, during which both prosecutors testified.",
      "McAfee ultimately declined to disqualify Willis from the case but said Wade had to step aside, which he did. But Mr. Trump and a group of his co-defendants appealed the ruling.",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals reversed McAfee's decision in December and said disqualification of Willis was the only remedy to restore public confidence in the integrity of the proceedings. The Georgia Supreme Court turned away Willis' appeal\u00a0in September, leaving the ruling mandating her removal from the case against Mr. Trump intact.",
      "The Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia, which of Skandalakis is the executive director, was tasked with finding a replacement to take over the case from Willis. He announced earlier this month that he would helm the prosecution himself after several others contacted declined to do so.",

    "story": [
      "Indiana's Republican legislature leaders announced Tuesday that they will be reconvening next week to consider a\u00a0redistricting\u00a0plan that could deliver two more GOP congressional seats, eliminating Democrats from the state's congressional delegation.",
      "Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston, reversing course after a months-long dispute, said Tuesday that the lower chamber would reconvene Monday to take up redrawing the state's congressional map. State Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray announced Tuesday that the Senate would reconvene on Dec. 8 to \"make a final decision\" on \"any redistricting proposal from the House.\"",
      "President Trump congratulated Indiana Republicans, posting on social media, \"I am glad to hear the Indiana House is stepping up to do the right thing, and I hope the Senate finds the Votes.\"",
      "Indiana, a state Mr. Trump won by 19 points, has become the latest battleground in the redistricting wars. The state is currently represented by seven Republicans and two Democrats, and Mr. Trump and his allies have sought to redraw the state's congressional districts to make the two districts represented by Democrats more favorable to Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump and others in the administration have pressed\u00a0Indiana Gov. Mike Braun on the issue, and the governor said last month that he'd call on the legislature to reconvene for a special session in November to consider it. But Bray insisted publicly that the votes weren't there, and when the legislature convened, they simply agreed to meet again in January for the regular session.",
      "The president and his allies stepped up attacks on Republicans in the legislature, with Mr. Trump calling some out by name on social media and promising they'd face primaries.",
      "In recent days, Indiana Republicans have said they have been victims of harassment and swatting attempts. State Sen. Andy Zay confirmed a bomb threat was called in to his business. Braun said last week \"these threats to lawmakers, including those received by me and my family in recent days, need to stop.\"",
      "Bray acknowledged \"the issue of redrawing Indiana's congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state.\"",
      "Redistricting normally occurs every 10 years after the conclusion of the decennial census. But since Republicans hold such a narrow majority in the House going into the 2026 midterm elections, Mr. Trump has been pushing GOP-led states to undertake mid-decade redistricting to draw more Republican districts.\u00a0Texas Republicans convened this summer to redraw the state's congressional maps to garner up to five more seats for the GOP.",
      "The effort gained national attention, leading California Gov. Gavin Newsom to push forward with a ballot initiative that would redraw the state's map to net up to five seats for Democrats, which the state's\u00a0voters overwhelming approved on Nov. 4. Other states scrambled to redraw their own maps, although some states require independent commissions to redraw their congressional map while others can be redrawn simply by state lawmakers.",
      "But lawmakers face increasingly tight time limits ahead of the 2026 midterm elections as filing deadlines loom for candidates. Candidates will also need to get to know their new districts during the primary season. Other races could be impacted as well. Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas is now mulling a Senate run, since her district was redrawn to be more friendly to Republicans.",
      "Redistricting plans are being challenged in court, though. A federal court in El Paso ordered\u00a0Texas to return to the 2021 map earlier this month, and Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton immediately appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. The high court temporarily halted the lower court's ruling, effectively letting Texas return \u2014 at least for now \u2014 to the maps it passed over the summer.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 13:23:50 -0500",
    "summary": "The expiration of TPS policy for Haitian immigrants would make them eligible for deportation, unless they have other legal means to stay in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration announced Wednesday a renewed effort to terminate the Temporary Protected Status of more than 350,000 Haitian immigrants, saying they will be eligible for deportation in early February unless they have other legal means to remain in the U.S.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made the decision after the Trump administration's initial attempts to end the TPS protections of hundreds of thousands of Haitians earlier this year were stalled in federal court.",
      "Noem acknowledged the humanitarian and political problems faced by crisis-stricken Haiti \u2014 including what she called \"widespread gang violence\" \u2014 but said extending the TPS policy would be at odds with U.S. interests.",
      "\"Based on the Department's review, the Secretary has determined that while the current situation in Haiti is concerning, the United States must prioritize its national interests and permitting Haitian nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the U.S. national interest,\" the official DHS termination notice said.",
      "The TPS program for Haiti is now set to expire on Feb. 3, and the termination is expected to affect 352,959 beneficiaries, DHS said in its notice. Trump administration officials have urged TPS holders whose status is set to lapse to self-deport or face the prospect of being detained and forcibly removed from the U.S.",
      "TPS allows beneficiaries to work and live in the U.S. without fear of deportation for time periods outlined by DHS. The humanitarian program was created by Congress in 1990 to allow administrations to grant a temporary safe haven to foreigners from countries facing an armed conflict, an environmental disaster or other emergencies.",
      "The Biden administration vastly expanded the TPS policy, offering the protections to hundreds of thousands of new arrivals from Afghanistan, Haiti, Ukraine, Venezuela and other countries. Some of those who benefit from TPS entered the U.S. illegally, most commonly along the southern border, while others arrived legally on temporary visas or programs.",
      "As part of its government-wide immigration crackdown, the second Trump administration has sought to dismantle most TPS programs, revoking or moving to revoke legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Afghans, Burmese, Cameroonians, Haitians, Hondurans, Nepalis, Nicaraguans, Syrians, Sudanese and Venezuelans.",
      "The Trump administration has argued the TPS policy has been abused by Democratic administrations, exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, even though it is designed to be temporary in nature. In some cases, it has argued conditions in countries with TPS have improved and in other cases, it has said that extending the program would not further U.S. interests, even if conditions in the affected nations remain dire.",
      "In its notice Wednesday, DHS argued the TPS policy for Haiti was a magnet for illegal immigration, and that continuing the program posed national security and public safety risks. It cited concerns about its ability to properly vet Haitian migrants, and cases of some TPS holders from Haiti being implicated in immigration fraud or national security investigations.",

    "story": [
      "For the first time, FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker is explaining why he decided to announce his resignation just one day after Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race.",
      "\"Look, it's a complicated, emotional decision to leave. But ideologically, there's no doubt that the mayor and I disagree on some very fundamental things to me,\" Tucker, who was appointed to the role in August 2024, told \"CBS Mornings\" in his first interview since handing in his resignation letter on Nov. 5.",
      "In a closely-watched decision last week, Tucker's police counterpart, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch accepted Mamdani's offer to stay in her role. Months before the election, Mamdani softened his sharp criticism of the NYPD and clarified that he is \"not running to defund the police,\" distancing himself from old social media posts.",
      "Despite his public apology to the NYPD, Tucker said Mamdani still has some work to do when it comes to winning over the support of first responders. Beyond that, some of Mamdani's stances, like his refusal to support Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, have alarmed many Jewish New Yorkers.",
      "\"I think it's a factor [in my decision to resign], no doubt,\" said Tucker, who is Jewish. \"And I don't want to tell you that it's the only factor. But I believe that the things that I have heard the mayor say would make it difficult for me to continue on in such a senior executive role in the administration.\"",
      "According to exit polls, 31% of Jewish New Yorkers voted for Mamdani, with 65% voting for independent opponent Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani won every borough but Staten Island.",
      "In an October debate, Mamdani, who will make history as New York City's first Muslim mayor, vowed to \"be the mayor who doesn't just protect Jewish New Yorkers, but also celebrates and cherishes them.\"",
      "However, Tucker and some prominent Jewish leaders \u2013 like Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, the senior rabbi at New York City's Central Synagogue \u2013 aren't convinced by the mayor-elect's words of reassurance. In an October sermon, Buchdal accused Mamdani of contributing \"to a mainstreaming of some of the most abhorrent antisemitism.\"",
      "\"More importantly than hearing it, we want to see it,\" Tucker said.",
      "He pointed to Mamdani's response to a protest last week outside of an Upper East Side synagogue hosting an event to support Jewish emigration to Israel, during which activists shouted threats. A Mamdani spokesperson was later quoted saying he \"discouraged the language,\" adding in an apparent nod of support to the protesters that \"these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law.\"",
      "Tucker said Mamdani should have come out quickly to condemn the behavior and rhetoric.",
      "\"You know, I don't know that the public has heard appropriately from him,\" he said.",
      "Inside headquarters in Brooklyn, where the FDNY coordinates responses to emergencies across America's biggest city, Tucker says they're still waiting for outreach from Mamdani.",
      "\"I haven't had any personal conversations with the mayor-elect. I haven't heard from anyone in his incoming administration, nor has the department. And so I only hope that is not an indicator of their\u00a0 feelings about the FDNY. I'd like to think they think everything is going so well here that they don't need to transition so fast,\" he joked.",

    "summary": "The number of immigration detainees without criminal records held in detention after getting arrested by ICE has increased by over 2,000% since the start of the second Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "The number of immigration detainees without criminal records who are held in federal detention centers after getting arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement has increased by over 2,000% since the start of the second Trump administration in January, according to official government data.",
      "The statistics, published online by ICE as part of a transparency requirement mandated by Congress, illustrate the wide-ranging scope of President Trump's mass deportation campaign.",
      "On Nov. 16, the government figures show, ICE was holding 65,135 people in detention facilities throughout the U.S., the highest level ever publicly reported by the agency, which was created in 2003 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. CBS News first reported the record detention levels earlier this month, citing internal data.",
      "The official figures indicate that 30,986 \u2013 or 48% \u2014 of the ICE detainees in custody as of Nov. 16 lacked any criminal charges or convictions in the U.S. and were being held solely because of civil violations of U.S. immigration law. ICE calls them \"immigration violators.\"",
      "Those with criminal convictions represented about 26%, or 17,171, of all ICE detainees on Nov. 16. The data show 16,978 individuals \u2014 another 26% of ICE's detainee population \u2014 had criminal charges.",
      "The statistics released by ICE do not specify the severity and nature of the charges or convictions for the detainees with criminal histories. They could range from violent or serious felonies, to misdemeanors and immigration-related crimes, such as illegal re-entry into the U.S.",
      "Illegal presence in the U.S., including after overstaying a visa, is not a crime by itself and is generally handled as a civil matter in immigration court. While illegal entry into the U.S. is a federal misdemeanor crime for a first-time offense with a 5-year statute of limitations, those accused of doing so typically have their cases treated as civil immigration violations, absent additional criminal activity.",
      "While all three categories of ICE detainees \u2014 immigration violators, those with criminal charges and those with criminal convictions \u2014 have grown under the second Trump administration, the statistics published by the agency indicate the non-criminal group has seen the most rapid and pronounced rise.",
      "ICE's detention population includes individuals arrested by that agency, typically in communities or jails inside of the U.S., as well as detainees transferred by Customs and Border Protection. Most detainees initially arrested by CBP, most commonly along the U.S.-Mexico border, historically have lacked criminal histories in the U.S. because many have not lived in the country for significant periods or at all.",
      "As of Nov. 16, 52,510 of ICE's detainees had been initially taken into custody by that agency, while 12,625 had been arrested by CBP.",
      "When focusing solely on ICE detainees initially arrested by that agency \u2014 and not CBP \u2014 the figures show a 2,143% spike in non-criminal detainees from Jan. 26 (945) to Nov. 16 (21,194). The number of detainees initially arrested by ICE who have convictions or criminal charges increased by 73% and 226%, respectively, during that same time period, according to the ICE data.",
      "The latest figures also indicate that for the first time, non-criminal detainees arrested by ICE outnumber those with criminal convictions. From Sept. 21 to Nov. 16, non-criminal detainees increased by about a third, while the number of detained with criminal convictions remained nearly flat.",
      "The numbers underscore that while the Trump administration has said its deportation effort would mainly focus on criminals deemed to be \"the worst of the worst,\" a growing share of those swept up under its crackdown are immigrants accused of living in the U.S. illegally but who otherwise lack any criminal history.",
      "At the same time, some senior Trump administration officials, including border czar Tom Homan and acting ICE director Todd Lyons, have said anyone encountered by immigration authorities and found to be in the U.S. illegally will be arrested, even if they're not the intended target of an operation. Those so-called \"collateral arrests\" had been largely banned under Biden-era rules the Trump administration scrapped.",
      "The government has the legal authority to arrest, detain and process for deportation anyone suspected of violating U.S. immigration law, irrespective of any criminal activity. But some of those individuals may be eligible for forms of legal relief, such as asylum, that can stall or halt their deportation.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the administration is \"targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens\u2014including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists.\" She said 70% of those arrested by ICE had criminal charges or convictions, but did not specify a timeframe or offer a breakdown to support the percentage.",
      "McLaughlin also said detainees listed as non-criminals could have warrants or criminal histories outside of the U.S., or otherwise pose a threat to national security. But DHS has not released data showing how many people fall into those categories.",

      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that Ukraine's government had \"agreed to a peace deal\" brokered by the Trump administration to stop Russia's nearly four-year assault. The American official and Ukraine's national security adviser Rustem Umerov said a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Umerov voiced optimism that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could travel to the U.S. before the end of November to finalize an agreement. CBS News was first to report on Sunday that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Zelenskyy.",
      "\"The Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal,\" the U.S. official told CBS News. \"There are some minor details to be sorted out but they have agreed to a peace deal.\"",
      "The news came as U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was in Abu Dhabi to meet with Russian officials, two U.S. officials and two diplomatic sources who were not authorized to speak publicly told CBS News. A fifth source with knowledge of the talks also confirmed Driscoll's presence in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Taking to Truth Social\u00a0on Tuesday afternoon, President Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"",
      "The president said he directed his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and that Driscoll would meet with the Ukrainians.",
      "\"I will be briefed on all progress made, along with Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages.\"",
      "Later Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that \"we're making progress.\" Asked what points of disagreement remain, he said, \"standard things,\" but \"people are starting to realize it's a good deal for both parties.\"",
      "On Tuesday morning, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u00a0wrote on X, \"Over the past week, the United States has made tremendous progress towards a peace deal by bringing both Ukraine and Russia to the table. There are a few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out and will require further talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Russia, the invading force, to what was agreed to in Abu Dhabi, and there were no details from U.S. or Ukrainian officials about what is in the latest proposal. Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which include U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all together at the same time.",
      "Speaking earlier on Tuesday, veteran Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that while Russia \"appreciates the U.S.' position, which is taking the initiative in resolving the Ukrainian conflict,\" Moscow \"operates professionally, not leaking information before formal agreements are reached ... Russia expects the U.S. to inform it of the results of consultations with Ukraine and Europe in the near future.\"",
      "Lavrov stressed that, while Russia was still waiting to receive \"from our American colleagues\" an updated version of the peace proposal, Moscow expected it to include basic tenets agreed between Presidents Trump and Putin during their August meeting in Alaska.",
      "\"Key proposals of Trump's plan are based on understandings reached in Anchorage,\" Lavrov said. He said those principles were \"reflected in the plan\" proposed last week by the White House, \"which we welcomed \u2014 President Putin said that.\"",
      "\"We are ready to discuss concrete formulations because there are a whole row of questions that need to be clarified,\" Lavrov said, adding: \"If there will be no spirit and letter of Anchorage on the key understandings that we have fixated, then it will be a different situation in principle.\"",
      "Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which involve U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all meeting together at the same time.",
      "Umerov also\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0that the country's negotiators had \"reached a common understanding on the core terms\" of an agreement discussed among U.S., European and Ukrainian officials in Geneva over the weekend.",
      "\"We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps. We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine's President to the U.S. at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump,\" Umerov said.",
      "A Trump administration official said there was no agreement for Zelenskyy to come to the U.S. as of late Tuesday morning, but that if a meeting does happen in the coming days, it could take place at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "A U.S. military official in Abu Dhabi told CBS News Driscoll spent hours negotiating Tuesday with Russian representatives, going in and out of meetings all day.",
      "\"We remain very optimistic,\" the official said. \"Secretary Driscoll is optimistic. Hopefully, we'll get feedback from the Russians soon. This is moving quick.\"",
      "It is not clear who else is in the U.S. delegation in Abu Dhabi. A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation was also there and has been in contact with Driscoll and his team.",
      "The apparent progress in Abu Dhabi comes amid an intensified push by President Trump to secure a ceasefire in the almost four-year-long Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "A source with knowledge told CBS News that Driscoll was working in Abu Dhabi off of a revised version of the White House's 28-point proposal, following productive negotiations in Geneva.",
      "Over the weekend, Driscoll, Rubio, Witkoff, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and diplomats from Ukraine and European allies attended talks in Geneva, Switzerland. Driscoll's meeting with Russian officials also follows a visit to Ukraine's capital last week.",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, CBS News reported on Sunday.",
      "Last week, CBS News obtained a draft of one Trump administration-backed proposal to end the war. The proposed plan included several provisions that Zelenskyy has rejected in the past, such as a requirement that Ukraine give up its entire Donetsk region \u2014 including parts that aren't occupied by Russia \u2014 and an end to the country's push to join NATO.",
      "There is also an accompanying document related to security guarantees, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday the document specifies that the U.S. intends to offer \"security assurances\" that she said are along the lines of Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which\u00a0commits members to come to the defense of a NATO state that is attacked.",
      "On Saturday, a group of NATO members and other U.S. allies released a joint statement calling the proposed peace plan \"a basis which will require additional work.\"",
      "The White House said in a statement Sunday night that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had \"drafted an updated and refined peace framework\" following the discussions in Geneva. Rubio described one session in Geneva as \"very meaningful\" but added that \"there's still some work left to do, and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed Zelenskyy to reach a deal by Thanksgiving, though Rubio described that deadline as flexible on Sunday.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to believe that he will take the Donetsk region of Ukraine one way or the other \u2014 either through a negotiated settlement or on the battlefield. The Trump administration's negotiations in Geneva began from the premise that Putin is correct.",
      "While that same U.S. official declined to provide a U.S. assessment of whether Ukraine is losing the war in the East, the U.S. official said that the trajectory of the fighting points to Russia taking Donetsk.

    "summary": "DHS Secretary Kristi Noem made the final decision to allow a group of deportees to be handed over to El Salvador after a judge said their flights must be returned to the U.S., the DOJ said.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem made the final decision to allow a group of deportees to be handed over to El Salvador after a judge said their flights must be returned to the United States, the Justice Department said in a court filing Tuesday.",
      "The filing came as U.S. District Judge James Boasberg continues his inquiry into whether the Trump administration violated his orders to halt the mid-March deportation flights, including his verbal directive that the government resort to \"turning around a plane\" if necessary. Boasberg has accused the government of showing a \"willful disregard\" for his rulings.",
      "The administration, the Justice Department argued on Tuesday, \"did not violate\" Boasberg's order, and \"no further proceedings are warranted or appropriate.\"",
      "But the administration did identify which Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department officials were involved in the decision not to turn the deportation flights around.",
      "Shortly after Boasberg issued his rulings, Justice Department official Drew Ensign conveyed them to the DHS and Justice Department leadership, according to Tuesday's filing. Then, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and former Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove offered advice to DHS's acting general counsel, who passed on the advice to Noem.",
      "Noem concluded the class of detainees \"who had been removed from the United States before the Court's order could be transferred to the custody of El Salvador,\" according to the filing.",
      "The filing says this move \"was lawful and was consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the Court's order.\"",
      "The flights in question were part of a Trump administration initiative to send accused Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador, whose government held them in prison for months. The administration argues that gambit was legal under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and warranted as part of its crackdown on violent crime, but it has faced pushback from courts and advocates who argue the deportees weren't given sufficient due process.",
      "One lawsuit brought by migrants led Boasberg to order a temporary halt to removals under the Alien Enemies Act, including by returning deportation flights that had already taken off. But the midair flights continued on to El Salvador. Boasberg accused the government of disobeying those orders, and said there is probable cause to hold the government in contempt of court.",
      "The administration has long denied that it disobeyed Boasberg, pointing to discrepancies between his written and verbal orders on March 15. The judge blocked a set of Alien Enemies Act deportations in his written order, but unlike in his verbal order earlier in the day, he didn't explicitly reiterate that the government must turn around planes that were already en route.",
      "Appeals court judges tossed out Boasberg's finding of probable cause, but a different panel later said that Boasberg, who is the chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., could continue his probe into whether the Trump administration had violated his court order. He signaled last week that he will resume his contempt of court inquiry.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the plaintiffs, has asked for more than half a dozen potential DHS and Justice Department witnesses to be put on the stand in open court to testify about the decision not to turn the planes around.",
      "One witness that the ACLU suggested is former Justice Department attorney Erez Revueni, who has accused the department of trying to defy or mislead judges in several instances, including in the deportation case. The department has denied Reuveni's allegations.",
      "The department responded on Tuesday: \"No live testimony is warranted at this time.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Interior Department said Tuesday the National Park Service is going to start charging the millions of international tourists who visit U.S. national parks each year $100 per person to enter some of the most popular sites, while leaving them out of fee-free days that will be reserved for American residents.",
      "The fee change for international visitors will impact 11 national parks, including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, according to the Interior Department.",
      "As part of the changes, which are set to take effect Jan. 1, foreign tourists will also see their annual parks pass price jump to $250, while U.S. residents will continue to be charged $80, according to the department's statement.",
      "Only approximately 100 of the more than 400 parks in the national park system collect an entrance fee.",
      "The announcement declaring \"America-first entry fee policies\" comes as national parks deal with the strain of a major staff reduction and severe budget cuts, along with recovering from damage during the recent government shutdown and significant lost revenue due to fees not being collected during that time. The park service furloughed well over half its staff during the shutdown.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a post on the social platform X that the changes make sure U.S. taxpayers who support the park service \"continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations!\"",
      "A White House social media post laying out the increased fees ended with the phrase, \"AMERICANS FIRST.\"",
      "The announcement follows a July executive order in which President Donald Trump directed the parks to increase entry fees for foreign tourists.",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump also ordered the Interior Department to give U.S. residents \"preferential treatment\" over foreign visitors regarding \"recreational access rules, including permitting or lottery rules\" that parks might have in place.",
      "In its 2026 fiscal year\u00a0budget proposal\u00a0released in May, the Interior Department estimated that such a surcharge on international visitors would generate more than $90 million annually.",

      "The U.S. Travel Association estimated that in 2018, national parks and monuments saw more than 14 million international visitors. Yellowstone reported that in 2024, nearly 15% of its visitors were from outside the country, which was down from 30% in 2018.",
      "The money made off the new fees will help support the national parks, including with upgrading facilities for visitors and maintenance, according to the statement.",
      "The \"resident-only patriotic fee-free days\" next year include Veterans Day, which was one of the parks' eight free days open to everyone in 2025. The Department of the Interior had announced those days by saying they wanted to ensure that \"everyone, no matter their zip code, can access and enjoy the benefits of green spaces and our public lands.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has directed immigration officials to review the cases of refugees admitted under former President Joe Biden, as part of an unprecedented effort to identify potential reasons that would disqualify them from being able to stay in the U.S., an internal federal government memo obtained by CBS News shows.",
      "The memo, dated Nov. 21 and signed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow, instructs agency officials to investigate the cases of refugees who entered the U.S. over a four-year period, between Jan. 20, 2021, and Feb. 20, 2025.",
      "Edlow directed USCIS officials to review the cases of all refugees admitted during this time period, and to potentially reinterview them. Those investigations and reinterviews, Edlow wrote, would focus on determining whether those individuals met the definition of a refugee when they entered the U.S. and whether there are any legal barriers that would make them ineligible to become permanent residents of the U.S.",
      "The memo also placed an indefinite hold on all pending applications for green cards (or permanent residency) filed by refugees allowed into the country during the timeframe outlined in the memo. Under U.S. law, refugees are eligible for permanent residency one year after being admitted.",
      "Edlow noted that applicants cannot appeal any denials of their green card cases. If the cases of \"principal\" refugees \u2014 or the main applicant if they arrived with their family members \u2014 are rejected, their relatives' cases would also be denied, and they would be stripped of their refugee status, according to the memo. Those whose applications are denied can be placed in deportation proceedings.",
      "Refugees have to prove they suffered or fled persecution abroad based on one of five factors: their race, nationality, religion, political opinion or membership in a social group.",
      "Some 233,000 refugees entered the U.S. between February 2021 and January 2025, a period that largely lines up with the Biden administration, according to federal statistics.",
      "The federal government paused the refugee program shortly after President Trump retook office. Officials have made limited exceptions, mostly for Afrikaners, or people in South Africa who are the descendants of European settlers.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration capped refugee admissions for this fiscal year at 7,500, the lowest level in history. Those slots will \"primarily be allocated among Afrikaners,\" who the Trump administration alleges have faced discrimination in South Africa for being White, and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\" The South African government has denied that Afrikaners are being persecuted.",
      "Before the pause, refugees typically spent years in third countries undergoing medical checks, security screenings and interviews prior to being admitted into the U.S.",
      "But in his memo, Edlow said the Trump administration believes the Biden administration \"prioritized expediency, quantity, and admissions over quality interviews and detailed screening and vetting.\"",

      "Republican Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia has agreed to pay nearly $5.2 million in overdue personal taxes, the latest saga for the former billionaire who has been followed by a trail of financial challenges going back well over a decade.",
      "An attorney for Justice and his wife, Cathy, entered into a joint motion for consent judgment with the federal government on Monday, the same day the government filed a lawsuit saying the couple \"have neglected or refused to make full payment\" for the income taxes dating to 2009. An attorney for the Justice Department's tax division signed off on the agreement.",
      "Justice had a fortune estimated at $1.9 billion last decade by Forbes magazine, which stripped his billionaire title in 2021, when Justice's worth had dwindled to an estimated $513 million. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated that Justice's net worth had disintegrated to \"less than zero\" due to liabilities that far exceeded assets.",
      "A spokesperson for Justice's office didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday.",
      "During a briefing with local media in October, Justice asserted that his companies \"are complicated and complex\" and that his children \"are doing a magnificent job\" running them. He then repeated past assertions that collection efforts against him were politically motivated, before concluding: \"At the end of the day, I'd say just let it be and see how it all plays out.\"",
      "Justice, a former two-term governor who owns dozens of businesses that include coal and agricultural operations, was elected last November to the Senate. He took over the seat vacated by the retiring Joe Manchin, a Democrat who became an independent in 2024 near the end of his second full term.",
      "Justice still has other financial challenges to work out.",
      "The Internal Revenue Service last month filed liens totaling more than $8 million against Justice and his wife on unpaid personal taxes. In September, state tax officials filed $1.4 million in liens against the Justice family's historic hotel, The Greenbrier, and the resort's Greenbrier Sporting Club, over unpaid sales taxes.",
      "Last month, a foreclosure auction on several hundred lots owned by the Justice family at a resort community near Beckley was paused. The auction centered on a dispute between the Glade Springs Village Property Owners Association and Justice Holdings over unpaid fees. The state Supreme Court plans to review the case more closely.",
      "In 2021, the IRS filed liens over $1.1 million in unpaid taxes on the Greenbrier Hotel and an additional $80,000 on the resort's medical clinic. Those debts were paid off later that year.",
      "Justice's family settled debts last year in a separate case to avoid the Greenbrier Hotel's foreclosure. The 710-room hotel, which has hosted U.S. presidents, royalty and congressional retreats, had come under threat of being auctioned off on the steps of a Lewisburg courthouse. That was after JPMorgan Chase sold a longstanding loan taken out by Justice to a credit collection company, Beltway Capital, which declared it to be in default.",
      "The state Democratic Party has said efforts to seize the hotel from Justice were \"a direct consequence of his own financial incompetence.\"",
      "Last year, a union official at the Greenbrier said that Justice's family was at least $2.4 million behind in payments to an employees' health insurance fund, putting workers' coverage at risk. In 2023, dozens of properties owned by the Justice family in three counties were auctioned as payment for delinquent real estate taxes. Others have sought to recoup millions in fines for environmental issues and unsafe working conditions at his company's coal mines.",
      "Justice bought The Greenbrier resort out of bankruptcy in 2009 for $20.1 million. The sporting club is a private equity club and residential community on the property that opened in 2000.",
      "The resort in White Sulphur Springs that dates to 1778 also has a casino, spa and dozens of amenities and employs around 2,000 workers. The resort held a PGA Tour golf tournament from 2010 until 2019 and has welcomed NFL teams for training camp and practices.

      "They go by names like @TRUMP_ARMY\u2014 or @MAGANationX, and their verified accounts proudly display portraits of President Donald Trump, voter rallies and American flags. And they're constantly posting about U.S. politics to their followers, sounding like diehard fans of the president.",
      "But after a weekend update to the social media platform X, it's now clear that the owners of these accounts, and many others, are located in regions such as South Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe.",
      "Elon Musk's X unveiled a feature Saturday that lets users see where an account is based. Online sleuths and experts quickly found that many popular accounts posting in support of the MAGA movement to thousands or hundreds of thousands of followers, are based outside the United States \u2014 raising concerns about foreign influence on U.S. politics.",
      "Researchers at NewsGuard, a firm that tracks online misinformation, identified several popular accounts \u2014 purportedly run by Americans interested in politics \u2014 that instead were based in Eastern Europe, Asia or Africa.",
      "The accounts were leading disseminators of some misleading and polarizing claims about U.S. politics, including ones that said Democrats bribed the moderators of a 2024 presidential debate.",
      "Nikita Bier, X's head of product, announced Saturday that the social media platform is rolling out an \"About This Account\" tool, which lets users see the country or region where an account is based. To find an account's location, tap or click the signup date displayed on the profile.",
      "\"This is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square. We plan to provide many more ways for users to verify the authenticity of the content they see on X,\" Bier wrote.",
      "In countries with punitive speech restrictions, a privacy tool on X lets account holders only show their region rather than a specific country. So instead of India, for instance, an account can say it is based in South Asia.",
      "Bier said Sunday that after an update to the tool, it would 99.99% accurate, though this could not be independently verified. Accounts, for instance, can use a virtual private network, or VPN, to mask their true location. On some accounts, there's a notice saying the location data may not be accurate, either because the account uses a VPN or because some internet providers use proxies automatically, without action by the user.",
      "\"Location data will always be something to use with caution,\" said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech and a former director of the International Fact-Checking Network. \"Its usefulness probably peaks now that it was just exposed, and bad actors will adapt. Meta has had similar information for a while and no one would suggest that misinformation has been eliminated from Facebook because of it.\"",
      "Some of the accounts supported slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as well as President Donald Trump's children. Many of the accounts were adorned with U.S. flags or made comments suggesting they were American. An account called \"@BarronTNews_,\" for instance, is shown as being located in \"Eastern Europe (Non-EU),\" even though the display location on its profile says \"Mar A Lago.\" The account, which has more than 580,000 followers, posted on Tuesday that \"This is a FAN account, 100 % independent, run by one guy who loves this country and supports President Trump with everything I've got.\"",
      "Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS News these types of accounts are fueled by public interest in current events and America's highly polarized politics.",
      "\"It is shining a light on this new rage economy that exists on social media, including X, that takes advantage of current things,\" Krebs said. \"What's the latest event? As we've seen over the last couple of years ... there has been a rightward shift of the platform. And I think what we're really seeing here is foreign-based accounts that are looking to make a little bit of money and taking advantage of this.\"",
      "He added, \"I think X deserves some credit to shine a light, to kind of expose some of these. ... I suspect you'll see a bunch of these accounts lose influence.\"",
      "NewsGuard also found evidence that some X users are spreading misinformation about the location feature itself, incorrectly accusing some accounts of being operated from abroad when they're actually used by Americans. Investigators found several instances where one user created fake screenshots that appear to suggest an account was created overseas.",
      "It's not always clear what the motives of the accounts. While some may be state actors, it's likely that many are financially motivated, posting commentary, memes and videos to draw engagement.",
      "\"For the most visible accounts unmasked this week, money is probably the main motivator,\" Mantzarlis said. \"That doesn't mean that X \u2014 as documented extensively by prior work done by academic and nonprofit organizations that are being attacked and defunded \u2014 isn't also a target for state actors.\"",

    "summary": "Trump housing official Bill Pulte also submitted criminal referrals for investigations into Sen. Adam Schiff, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Trump housing official Bill Pulte, who referred him to the Justice Department earlier this month for an investigation of mortgage and tax fraud allegations.",
      "Swalwell, who entered the California governor's race last week, filed the 19-page federal civil lawsuit in the U.S. Court for the District of Columbia accusing Pulte, the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, of violations of privacy in obtaining Swalwell's mortgage records. The lawsuit also accuses the Trump administration of engaging in a pattern of political retribution through the courts.",
      "\"Pulte's brazen practice of obtaining confidential mortgage records from Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac and then using them as a basis for referring individual homeowners to DOJ for prosecution is unprecedented and unlawful,\" the lawsuit alleged.",
      "Pulte has also submitted criminal referrals to the Justice Department for investigations of Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook.",
      "The Federal Housing Finance Agency did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The allegations against Swalwell are related to the mortgage on his property in Washington, D.C., CBS News previously reported.",
      "Swalwell's lawsuit says that the disclosure of his mortgage records harmed his reputation \"at a critical juncture in his career: the very moment when he had planned to announce his campaign for Governor of California.\"",
      "The civil complaint said that \"before President Trump reassumed office in January 2025, he routinely threatened to use his power to punish his political opponents,\" and then continued that \"after taking office, he wasted little time in following through on those threats.\"",
      "James' criminal case was dismissed Monday after a judge found that the interim U.S. attorney who secured her indictment was improperly appointed. James has also sought to have her case tossed out on other grounds, including that the prosecutions are vindictive and selective.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in August after Pulte accused her of making misrepresentations on mortgage documents. But Cook filed a lawsuit arguing her removal was unlawful, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments in January on whether Mr. Trump can fire her from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 12:16:11 -0500",
    "summary": "The discovery could cast some doubt on the status of Lucy's species as the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the\u00a0species of the famous Lucy, scientists said Wednesday.",
      "The discovery is the latest twist in the tale of human evolution and could even cast some doubt on the status of Lucy's species, Australopithecus afarensis, as the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens.",
      "Until the foot was discovered in Burtele in northeastern Ethiopia in 2009, Lucy's species was thought to be the only human relative living in the area more than three million years ago.",
      "But the appendage clearly does not belong to Lucy's species because it has an opposable toe \u2014 similar to a thumb \u2014 allowing its owner to grab onto tree branches like apes.",
      "The team of scientists who found the mystery foot went on to name a new species, Australopithecus deyiremeda, in 2015 based on some roughly 3.4-million-year-old jaw bones found in Burtele.",
      "The announcement was met with some skepticism in scientific circles. Due to the scarcity of fossils, attempts to add a new branch to the human family tree usually provoke fierce debate.",
      "The team was also unable to say that the foot bones \u2014 dubbed the Burtele foot \u2014 belonged to their new species.",
      "Now, in a study published Tuesday called \"Mystery owner of African hominin foot identified,\" the scientists announced that new fossils including a jawbone with 12 teeth found at the site show that the foot was that of A. deyiremeda.",
      "\"We have no doubt about the Burtele foot belonging to the same species as these teeth and the jaw,\" lead study author, Yohannes Haile-Selassie of Arizona State University, told AFP.",
      "The research also revealed more details about this species, offering further clues about who could have been the true ancestor of us Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Co-existence is deep in our ancestry\"",
      "A CT scan of the teeth suggested that A. deyiremeda was more primitive than its cousin Lucy, the study said.",
      "Isotope analysis of the teeth meanwhile showed that its diet consisted mainly of leaves, fruit and nuts of trees.",
      "The grasping big toe also suggested this human relative spent more time in the trees. Big toes played an important role in human evolution, allowing our ancestors to leave the trees behind and walk on two legs.",
      "A lingering question about A. deyiremeda was how it could have co-existed with Lucy's species at the same place and time, Haile-Selassie said.",
      "The new research suggests that the former spent its time in the forest, more likely eating from trees, while the latter spent more time on the ground, a difference that allowed them to live together.",
      "It also demonstrates that \"co-existence is deep in our ancestry\", Haile-Selassie emphasised.",
      "Earlier this year, in the same region where was Lucy was discovered, archaeologists found 3,000-million-year-old knives that are believed to be some of the first tools ever used on Earth.\u00a0 Rick Potts, the director of the Smithsonian's human origins program and the leader of research on the peninsula, told CBS News that discovery can\u00a0help frame humans' existence\u00a0on the planet.",
      "\"We are the last biped standing, as I call it,\" Potts said. \"All of those other ways of life became extinct. And so that gives us a lot to think about, and it draws attention to the fragility of life, even in our own journey through time.\"",
      "New technologies have made the sites easier to date, and new discoveries across eastern Africa have refined researchers' understanding of human roots. Researchers knew that modern homo sapiens emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago, but it wasn't until recently that they understood that their hominin ancestors began walking on two legs at least 6 million years ago.",
      "Search for the identity of our true ancestor",
      "John McNabb, a paleolithic archaeologist at the UK's University of Southampton not involved in the study, praised the new research.",
      "\"There will always be sceptics, but I think these new finds, and their validation of older ones, will help many researchers to be more accepting of A. deyiremeda,\" he told AFP.",
      "It also \"adds a new player into the mix\" in the search for the identity of our true ancestor, McNabb added.",
      "Because A. deyiremeda was more primitive and had a less human-like foot than Lucy, it is unlikely to dethrone her as the prime suspect in this search, both scientists agreed.",
      "But the discovery \"opens this possibility that we might still find more species within that time period because it looks like the Australopiths were experimenting with bipedality,\" or walking on two legs, Haile-Selassie said.",
      "\"Could there be another species which could be a better candidate to be the ancestor of the genus Homo?\" he asked.",
      "\"We don't know -- it depends on what we find.\"",

    "summary": "Wolf DNA seems to have influenced the size, smelling power and even personality of modern dog breeds, scientists said.",
    "story": [
      "Those tiny, fluffy dogs walking down the street may look cute but beware \u2014 they probably have some wolf in them.",
      "That is the discovery announced on Monday by U.S. scientists, who were surprised to find that nearly two thirds of all dog breeds have a detectable amount of wolf DNA.",
      "And it is not genetic leftovers from when dogs originally evolved from wolves around 20,000 years ago, but instead suggests that domesticated dogs and wild wolves have interbred within the last few thousand years.",
      "This does not mean that \"wolves are coming into your house and mixing it up with your pet dog,\" Logan Kistler, a curator at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "It also seems to have influenced the size, smelling power and even personality of modern dog breeds, the scientists said.",
      "\"The majority of dogs today have low, but detectable levels of post domestication wolf ancestry that has shaped their evolution and conferred unique advantages to their survival in diverse human environments,\" the scientists conclude in a study published on Monday.",
      "Dogs and wolves can produce offspring together, but interbreeding is thought to be rare.",
      "\"Prior to this study, the leading science seemed to suggest that in order for a dog to be a dog, there can't be very much wolf DNA present, if any,\" lead study author Audrey Lin of the American Museum of Natural History said in a statement.",
      "To find out more, the team analyzed thousands of dog and wolf genomes in publicly available databases.",
      "They found that over 64 percent of modern breeds have wolf ancestry, with even tiny chihuahuas carrying around 0.2 percent.",
      "\"This completely makes sense to anyone who owns a chihuahua,\" Lin joked.",
      "Which dogs have the most wolf DNA?",
      "Czechoslovakian and Saarloos wolfdogs had the most wolf DNA, with up to 40 percent.",
      "For breeds used as pets, the most \"wolfy\" was the Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore hound, with around five percent of wolf DNA. Sight hounds such as Salukis and Afghans also ranked high.",
      "While dogs with wolf DNA tended to be bigger, this was not always the case \u2014\u00a0Saint Bernards did not have any.",
      "The research also showed that 100 percent of village dogs \u2014 which live on human settlements but are not anyone's pet -- have wolf ancestry.",
      "Kistler speculated that village dogs, which have more opportunities to get intimate with wolves, could be how wolf DNA was getting into the dog gene pool.",
      "Female wolves separated from their wolf pack by human activities such as habitat destruction could end up breeding with stray dogs, he suggested.",
      "Overall, \"Arctic sled dogs, pariah breeds, and hunting dogs have the greatest wolf ancestry, while on average, terriers, gundogs, and scent hounds have the least,\" the researchers write.",
      "Friendly or territorial?",
      "The researchers also compared their findings to the terms that kennel clubs use to describe the personalities of different breeds.",
      "Breeds with little or no wolf in them were more likely to be described as friendly, easy to train and affectionate.",
      "On the other hand, dogs with more wolf DNA were more often considered to be suspicious of strangers, independent, dignified or territorial.",
      "However, researchers said some descriptors occurred with similar frequency in low wolf and high wolf-content dogs, including \"intelligent,\" \"obedient,\" \"good with children,\" \"dedicated,\" \"calm,\" and \"cheerful.\"",
      "Kistler emphasized that descriptions of breeds are imperfect and do not predict the behavior of any individual dog.",
      "\"Wolves are evolved for specific habitats and specific conditions, and dogs have been carried to every corner of the inhabited world by people,\" he said.",
      "Dogs have simply had to adapt to the places humans took them, and \"wolf genes that gave them advantages in certain contexts,\" he explained.",
      "For example, many Tibetan breeds, such as the fluffy little Lhasa Apso, have a gene called EPAS1 that came from adapting to higher altitudes. Tibetan wolves have the same gene.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have detected what they believe to be lightning on Mars by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
      "The crackling of electrical discharges was captured by a microphone on the rover, a French-led team reported Wednesday.",
      "The researchers documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet of the microphone perched atop the rover's tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",
      "Scientists have been looking for electrical activity and lightning at Mars for half a century, said the study's lead author Baptiste Chide, of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse.",
      "\"It opens a completely new field of investigation for Mars science,\" Chide said, citing the possible chemical effects from electrical discharges. \"It's like finding a missing piece of the puzzle.\"",
      "The evidence is strong and persuasive, but it's based on a single instrument that was meant to record the rover zapping rocks with lasers, not lightning blasts, said Cardiff University's Daniel Mitchard, who was not involved in the study. What's more, he noted in an article accompanying the study in the journal Nature, the electrical discharges were heard \u2014 not seen.",
      "\"It really is a chance discovery to hear something else going on nearby, and everything points to this being Martian lightning,\" Mitchard said in an email. But until new instruments are sent to verify the findings, \"I think there will still be a debate from some scientists as to whether this really was lightning,\" he said.",
      "\"Like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye\"",
      "Lightning has already been confirmed on Jupiter and Saturn, and Mars has long been suspected of having it too.",
      "To find it, Chide and his team analyzed 28 hours of Perseverance recordings, documenting episodes of \"mini lightning\" based on acoustic and electric signals.",
      "Electrical discharges generated by the fast-moving dust devils lasted just a few seconds, while those spawned by dust storms lingered as long as 30 minutes.",
      "\"It's like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye and with plenty of faint zaps,\" Chide said in an email. He noted that the thin, carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere absorbs much of the sound, making some of the zaps barely perceptible.",
      "Mars' atmosphere is more prone than Earth's to electrical discharging and sparking through contact among grains of dust and sand, according to Chide.",
      "\"The current evidence suggests it is extremely unlikely that the first person to walk on Mars could, as they plant a flag on the surface, be struck down by a bolt of lightning,\" Mitchard wrote in Nature. But the \"small and frequent static-like discharges could prove problematic for sensitive equipment.\"",
      "These aren't the first Mars sounds transmitted by Perseverance. Earthlings have listened in to the rover's wheels crunching over the Martian surface and the whirring blades of its no-longer-flying helicopter sidekick, Ingenuity.",
      "Perseverance has been scouring a dry river delta at Mars since 2021, collecting samples of rock for possible signs of ancient microscopic life. NASA plans to return these core samples to Earth for laboratory analysis, but the delivery is on indefinite hold as the space agency pursues cheaper options.",
      "Blue Origin's Blue and Gold NASA satellites en route to study Mars",
      "Earlier this month, Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket that put two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars. The satellites are aiming to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission \u2014 Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers. Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity-assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars. In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth's, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",

    "summary": "The new space station crew includes American Chris Williams, who holds a Ph.D. in astronomy and is a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School.",
    "story": [
      "American astronomer-turned-medical physicist and now NASA astronaut Chris Williams joined two Russian cosmonauts aboard a Soyuz ferry ship Thursday for a Thanksgiving Day flight to the International Space Station.",
      "With commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov at the controls of the Soyuz MS-28/74S spacecraft, flanked on his left by flight engineer Sergey Mikaev and on the right by Williams, the crew's Soyuz 2.1a booster roared to life at 4:27 a.m. Eastern and smoothly climbed away from the Russian-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Nine minutes and 45 seconds later, the Soyuz spacecraft was released from the booster's upper stage, its two solar wings unfolded and the crew set off in pursuit of the space station. Three hours later, they caught up with the orbital outpost and moved in for docking at the lab's Earth-facing Rassvet module at 7:34 a.m. Eastern.",
      "Williams, a former volunteer fire fighter and emergency medical technician who went on to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when he was selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "He and flight engineer Mikaev were making their first space flight on Thursday, while Kud-Sverchkov is a seasoned veteran who logged 185 days aboard the space station in 2020-2021.",
      "\"It's a really great crew,\" Williams said in a NASA interview. \"Sergey and Sergey are both just absolutely wonderful people, really kind, super interested, super intellectually curious, which is really fun. Had a lot of really, really great discussions, just talking and talking about things.",
      "\"It's been been wonderful to both spend some time with them over in Star City, and also to be able to spend some time with them in Houston through our training.\"",
      "The Soyuz MS-28 crew is replacing Soyuz MS-27/73S commander Sergey  Ryzhikov, flight engineer Alexey Zubritsky and NASA astronaut Jonny Kim,  who were launched to the space station last April. They plan to return  to Earth on Dec. 9 to wrap up their eight-month stay on the ISS.",
      "Also  on hand to welcome Williams and his crewmates aboard the station: NASA  Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, Michael Fincke, Japanese astronaut  Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They launched atop a SpaceX  Falcon 9 rocket last August and plan to come home in February or March,  after their replacements \u2014 Crew 12 \u2014 arrive.",
      "All 11 station  fliers planned to gather for a traditional welcome aboard video call to  mission managers and family back in Moscow before a safety briefing and  the start of familiarization with the space station's complex systems.",
      "Williams, an Eagle Scout with a private pilot's license, is a standout among super achievers.",
      "After  graduating from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree in  physics, he was doing radio astronomy research on the way to a  Ph.D. and, \"down the street from my house, there was a volunteer fire  department. And I was like, oh, that sounds like something that could be  kind of like fun and interesting to do.\"",
      "\"So I started  volunteering. Got trained as an EMT and a firefighter, and started just  sort of doing that on a volunteer basis. And I found that I really liked  it. I got a lot of satisfaction out of knowing that ... at the end of  the shift, I would have really made a very direct and immediate positive  impact on somebody's life.\"",
      "He kept that up throughout graduate  school. Then, as he was winding up his doctorate in astrophysics,  Williams said he ran into a doctor he knew at a party who told him there  was \"a big need for physicists in medicine, in particular, in radiation  oncology, where we use radiation to treat cancer.\"",
      "He talked with a few other people, including one who had been an astronomer before switching to medical physics, and \"I was struck by how much of what I knew and had learned as an astronomer would actually be useful and apply very directly to medicine.\"",
      "\"A lot of the math behind (medical) imaging is the exact same math that actually you use in a radio telescope to make an image,\" Williams said. \"It was kind of neat to see that image processing techniques that I'd used as (a radio astronomer) actually carried over pretty directly into medicine.\"",
      "At the time of his selection as an astronaut, Williams was on the staff at Harvard Medical School as a clinical physicist and researcher. He is the second member of the 2021 class of astronauts to fly in space, getting assigned to the Soyuz MS-28 mission shortly after finishing astronaut candidate training.",
      "He said the training for launch on a Russian spacecraft was difficult, primarily because of the travel required. He credited his wife, Aubrey, with keeping the family's life on an even keel throughout.",
      "As for what he looks forward to during his eight-month stay in space, Williams repeated a familiar theme.",
      "\"I've got a lot of different goals, but I think the biggest one, and the thing I'm most excited about, is to truly be able to put my training into practice and to do a really good job to push forward the science and research that we're doing on on the space station.\"",
      "\"I think it's incredibly important. I think it's incredibly interesting and incredibly inspiring, and I feel really lucky to have the opportunity to contribute to that.\"",

      "Earlier this month, another group of Chinese astronauts from the Shenzhou 20 mission faced a nine-day delay in their return to Earth after their craft's window was damaged. They eventually returned using the Shenzhou 21 spacecraft, which had just carried the replacement crew to Tiangong.",
      "While the three-person crew landed safely on Earth, three of their fellow astronauts on the replacement crew were temporarily left without a guaranteed way to return in case of an emergency.",
      "The Shenzhou 20 spacecraft - the damaged one, which for now remains in space - will be brought down to Earth later and assessed, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The space program determined it didn't meet safety standards for transporting the astronauts.",
      "Chinese astronauts have been carrying out missions to the Tiangong space station in recent years as part of Beijing's rapidly progressing space program, initially building out the station module-by-module.",

    "summary": "Tech giants including Alibaba, Amazon and Meta are counting on AI as the \"killer app\" that convinces consumers to try smart glasses.",
    "story": [
      "If seeing the world through the eyes of artificial intelligence sounds appealing, a growing number of technology companies have just the thing: AI eyeglasses.",
      "The latest entrant is from Alibaba, which on Thursday started selling smart glasses that let wearers access the Chinese online retailer's Qwen AI app with the touch of a button. Consumers can use the device, dubbed Quark AI Glasses, to search the internet, automatically compile meeting notes, make payments, listen to music and manage their schedule, among other functions.",
      "Consumers can also use the glasses' built-in camera to snap a picture of a product and instantly price it on Alibaba's e-commerce site, Taobao. The glasses, which start at 3,799 yuan (roughly $537), are only available for purchase in China, according to Alibaba.",
      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",
      "One obstacle AI eyewear will have to overcome to gain broader acceptance, according to security experts: privacy. Smart glasses capture, store and share personal data, while their capacity to record and stream video raises thorny questions about filming people without their consent, according to legal experts.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence can do the work currently performed by nearly 12% of America's workforce, according to a recent\u00a0study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "The researchers, relying on a metric called the \"Iceberg Index\" that measures a job's potential to be automated, conclude that AI already has the cognitive and technical capacity to handle a range of tasks in technology, finance, health care and professional services.",
      "The index simulated how more than 150 million U.S. workers across nearly 1,000 occupations interact and overlap with AI's abilities. Specifically, it measures exposure to AI capabilities and how the rapidly emerging technology overlaps with workers' occupational skills.",
      "The study doesn't seek to shed light on how many workers AI may already have displaced or could supplant in the future. To what extent such tools take over job functions performed by people depends on a number of factors, including individual businesses' strategy, societal acceptance and possible policy interventions, the researchers note.",
      "AI's uses extend far beyond some of its most visible applications, such as writing computer code, the researchers note. Among the ways employers across different industries are using AI:",

      "For example, AI can streamline filling out paperwork, freeing nurses up to spend more time with patients. It can also quickly and accurately produce software code, forcing software engineers with limited skills to shift their focus.",
      "In addition, \"[F]inancial analysts will not disappear, but AI systems may demonstrate capability across significant portions of document-processing and routine analysis work,\" the researchers said. \"This reshapes how roles are structured and which skills remain in demand, without necessarily reducing headcount.\"",

    "story": [
      "They go by names like @TRUMP_ARMY\u2014 or @MAGANationX, and their verified accounts proudly display portraits of President Donald Trump, voter rallies and American flags. And they're constantly posting about U.S. politics to their followers, sounding like diehard fans of the president.",
      "But after a weekend update to the social media platform X, it's now clear that the owners of these accounts, and many others, are located in regions such as South Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe.",
      "Elon Musk's X unveiled a feature Saturday that lets users see where an account is based. Online sleuths and experts quickly found that many popular accounts posting in support of the MAGA movement to thousands or hundreds of thousands of followers, are based outside the United States \u2014 raising concerns about foreign influence on U.S. politics.",
      "Researchers at NewsGuard, a firm that tracks online misinformation, identified several popular accounts \u2014 purportedly run by Americans interested in politics \u2014 that instead were based in Eastern Europe, Asia or Africa.",
      "The accounts were leading disseminators of some misleading and polarizing claims about U.S. politics, including ones that said Democrats bribed the moderators of a 2024 presidential debate.",
      "Nikita Bier, X's head of product, announced Saturday that the social media platform is rolling out an \"About This Account\" tool, which lets users see the country or region where an account is based. To find an account's location, tap or click the signup date displayed on the profile.",
      "\"This is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square. We plan to provide many more ways for users to verify the authenticity of the content they see on X,\" Bier wrote.",
      "In countries with punitive speech restrictions, a privacy tool on X lets account holders only show their region rather than a specific country. So instead of India, for instance, an account can say it is based in South Asia.",
      "Bier said Sunday that after an update to the tool, it would 99.99% accurate, though this could not be independently verified. Accounts, for instance, can use a virtual private network, or VPN, to mask their true location. On some accounts, there's a notice saying the location data may not be accurate, either because the account uses a VPN or because some internet providers use proxies automatically, without action by the user.",
      "\"Location data will always be something to use with caution,\" said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech and a former director of the International Fact-Checking Network. \"Its usefulness probably peaks now that it was just exposed, and bad actors will adapt. Meta has had similar information for a while and no one would suggest that misinformation has been eliminated from Facebook because of it.\"",
      "Some of the accounts supported slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as well as President Donald Trump's children. Many of the accounts were adorned with U.S. flags or made comments suggesting they were American. An account called \"@BarronTNews_,\" for instance, is shown as being located in \"Eastern Europe (Non-EU),\" even though the display location on its profile says \"Mar A Lago.\" The account, which has more than 580,000 followers, posted on Tuesday that \"This is a FAN account, 100 % independent, run by one guy who loves this country and supports President Trump with everything I've got.\"",
      "Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS News these types of accounts are fueled by public interest in current events and America's highly polarized politics.",
      "\"It is shining a light on this new rage economy that exists on social media, including X, that takes advantage of current things,\" Krebs said. \"What's the latest event? As we've seen over the last couple of years ... there has been a rightward shift of the platform. And I think what we're really seeing here is foreign-based accounts that are looking to make a little bit of money and taking advantage of this.\"",
      "He added, \"I think X deserves some credit to shine a light, to kind of expose some of these. ... I suspect you'll see a bunch of these accounts lose influence.\"",
      "NewsGuard also found evidence that some X users are spreading misinformation about the location feature itself, incorrectly accusing some accounts of being operated from abroad when they're actually used by Americans. Investigators found several instances where one user created fake screenshots that appear to suggest an account was created overseas.",
      "It's not always clear what the motives of the accounts. While some may be state actors, it's likely that many are financially motivated, posting commentary, memes and videos to draw engagement.",
      "\"For the most visible accounts unmasked this week, money is probably the main motivator,\" Mantzarlis said. \"That doesn't mean that X \u2014 as documented extensively by prior work done by academic and nonprofit organizations that are being attacked and defunded \u2014 isn't also a target for state actors.\"",
      "Users were divided over the new ability to see an account's location information, with some questioning whether it went too far.",
      "\"Isn't this kind of an invasion of privacy?\" One X user wrote. \"No one needs to see this info.\"",

      "Thousands of Airbus A320 airliners around the world might require a software update, potentially causing flight delays or cancellations during the busy Thanksgiving holiday weekend.",
      "The emergency update stems from an incident Oct. 30 when a JetBlue flight traveling from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, experienced an issue with its flight controls. The plane dropped about 100 feet in seven seconds, according to preliminary flight data from Flightradar24, and was diverted to Tampa, Florida.",

      "\"I haven't heard of anyone step back,\" Morrisey told CBS News in an interview. \"They wanted to stay. They wanted to complete the mission and serve their state and country.\"",
      "Back in August, at President Trump's request, Morrisey was one of several Republican governors that deployed National Guard soldiers to D.C., with West Virginia\u00a0sending somewhere\u00a0between 300 and 400 Guard members.",
      "According to the military's Joint Task Force \u2013 District of Columbia, there are 180 West Virginia Guard members deployed in D.C. as of Friday. They are among about 1,300 out-of-state Guard troops that were dispatched to D.C. as part of the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on crime in the city.",
      "Although Mr. Trump\u00a0has ordered\u00a0an additional 500 Guard personnel to D.C. in response to the shooting, Morrisey repeatedly sidestepped questions on whether West Virginia troops would join that surge.",
      "And though he expressed openness towards it, Morrisey said he will not pre-judge future deployment decisions, and avoided committing additional units.",
      "\"Right now, I'm focusing on the families, the guardsmen, and healing,\" the governor said. \"As time evolves, I'll keep talking with Guard leadership to make the right call.\"",
      "Still, he insisted the mission continues and should not be abandoned in the wake of the shooting.",
      "\"When evildoers come in and commit heinous acts, we can't back down,\" Morrisey said. \"That's exactly what they want.\"",
      "The suspect now faces charges of first degree murder. The former West Virginia attorney general told CBS News that the death penalty should remain \"on the table.\"",
      "Twenty-year-old Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom was killed in Wednesday's shooting, and 24-year-old Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe was critically wounded.",
      "Morrisey, who met Beckstrom's parents at the hospital following her death, described the young soldier as deeply respected among her unit \u2014 someone whose presence \"brought positive energy to every room.\"",
      "\"She was loved and respected greatly,\" Morrisey said. \"There's an energy around her \u2014 people lining up to pay respects, showing sympathy, standing by their friend and the Guard.\"",
      "Wolfe, who remains in intensive care, comes from what Morrisey called \"a rich tradition of service.\" Wolfe's father serves in the Berkeley County Sheriff's Office, and his grandfather earned multiple Purple Hearts. \"His family asked for one thing \u2014 prayers,\" Morrisey said. \"He's fighting for his life.\"",
      "Law enforcement sources told CBS News that following the ambush shooting, the suspected gunman, identified as a 29-year-old Afghan national, was stabbed with a pocketknife by a third Guard member, while a fourth returned fire and shot the suspect multiple times, ending the attack.",
      "President Trump said Thursday that the suspect remains hospitalized in serious condition.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration on Friday directed officials to pause all asylum decisions in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Friday directed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers to pause all asylum decisions in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., according to an internal directive obtained by CBS News and two sources familiar with the order.",
      "The move is the administration's latest effort to tighten the American immigration system after Wednesday's attack, which was allegedly carried out by an Afghan man who was granted asylum by U.S. immigration officials earlier this year.",
      "Asylum officers at USCIS, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, were instructed to refrain from approving, denying or closing asylum applications received by the agency, according to the internal notice and sources, who requested anonymity to describe an action that has not been publicly announced.",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration said it would start a review of asylum approvals under the Biden administration, citing the shooting of the two National Guard members, one of whom has died. The man accused of shooting the soldiers, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who entered the U.S. in 2021 during former President Joe Biden's presidency and was granted asylum this spring under the second Trump administration.",
      "The action relayed to USCIS asylum officers internally on Friday amounts to an indefinite pause on asylum adjudications for all nationalities. Asylum cases are filed by foreigners who claim they will suffer persecution if deported or returned to their home countries because of certain factors, including their race, nationality, religion or political views.",
      "\"Do not enter any decision information for affirmative cases,\" a USCIS notice to asylum officers in one office read, referring to asylum cases overseen by the agency. \"Defensive\" cases, the other type of asylum applications, are filed by those facing deportation and are decided by federal immigration judges at the Justice Department.",
      "Officers were told the pause applied to all USCIS asylum cases, including those filed by Afghans who arrived under a Biden administration resettlement effort dubbed \"Operation Allies Welcome.\" They were also told that in-person appointments for asylum applicants to find out what decisions have been made on their cases would be canceled, at least for Monday.",
      "The guidance said officers could continue asylum application interviews and review cases up to the point of making a decision. \"Once you've reached decision entry, stop and hold,\" the directive said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News Friday, USCIS Director Joe Edlow confirmed CBS News' reporting.",
      "\"USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,\" Edlow said. \"The safety of the American people always comes first.\"",
      "According to Homeland Security officials, Lakanwal was allowed to enter the U.S. in September 2021 through the humanitarian parole policy, which the Biden administration used to resettle tens of thousands of Afghans evacuated following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. He applied for asylum in 2024 and his application was granted earlier this year, the officials said.",
      "Following Wednesday's shooting, the Trump administration has unveiled a series of immigration measures it argues will bolster the government's ability to mitigate the chances of similar attacks.",
      "Officials first announced an indefinite pause on the processing of all legal immigration applications \u2014 ranging from citizenship and green card cases, to requests for work permits and asylum \u2014 filed by applicants from Afghanistan.",
      "USCIS' director, Joseph Edlow, then announced he had ordered, at President Trump's direction, a \"full scale, rigorous reexamination\" of green card cases involving nationals affected by a presidential proclamation that fully or partially suspended travel and immigration from 19 countries. That list, released in June and which the White House referred to as a \"travel ban,\" includes Afghanistan and other countries in Asia and the Middle East, such as Iran, as well as African nations, including Somalia and Sudan. Mr. Trump's order also applies to nationals of Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela.",
      "USCIS published a policy Thursday that allows adjudicators to cite concerns about the inability to properly vet and identify green card applicants from the group of 19 countries as a potential reason to deny their cases.",
      "\"Certain countries (including but not limited to Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and Venezuela) lack a competent or central authority for issuing passports and civil documents among other concerns, which directly relates to USCIS' ability to meaningfully assess eligibility for benefit requests including identity, and therefore whether an alien warrants a favorable exercise of discretion,\" USCIS said in its guidance.",

      "The declaration follows Wednesday's shooting in downtown Washington, D.C., just blocks from the White House, in which a National Guard member was killed and a second Guard member critically wounded. The suspect detained in the shooting has been identified as a 29-year-old Afghan national who was admitted to the U.S. in September 2021, along with thousands of other Afghan refugees, a month after the U.S. withdrew its troops from Afghanistan.",

      "Stock indexes closed at 1 p.m. EDT on Friday due to the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "The multi-day rebound came after a largely volatile month for stocks, sparked by concerns about a possible bubble in artificial intelligence and tech stocks. AI chipmaker Nvidia lost 1.8% Friday and closed the month with a double-digit loss. Oracle tumbled 23% in November while Palantir Technologies sank 16%.",
      "\"The market needs to prove it can sustain this momentum, but right now, the weakness after Nvidia's earnings looks like it could be more of a short-term AI-selling climax than a sign of heightened bearishness,\" Chris Larkin, Managing Director of trading and investing at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley, said in an email.",

      "The central bank, which has already cut rates twice this year in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market, is facing an increasingly difficult decision on interest rates as inflation rises and the job market slows. Cutting interest rates further could help support the economy as employment weakens, but it could also fuel inflation. The latest round of corporate earnings reports was mostly positive, but economic data has been mixed.",

      "Amid the volatility in tech stocks, traders moved money into other parts of the market. Pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Merck each rose more than 20% for the month. Travel-related companies such as Marriott and Expedia also posted strong monthly gains.",
      "Earlier, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were halted for hours due to a technical issue at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CME said the problem was tied to an outage at a CyrusOne data center.",

    "summary": "A 29-year-old Afghan national named Rahmanullah Lakanwal has been identified as the suspected shooter in the ambush that killed one National Guard member and wounded another in D.C., officials say.",
    "story": [
      "An Afghan national named Rahmanullah Lakanwal has been identified as the suspected shooter in the ambush attack that killed one National Guard member and wounded another just blocks away from the White House on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said.",
      "The CIA said Thursday that Lakanwal previously worked with the U.S. government, including the CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar that ended in 2021 following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.",
      "The suspect was shot by another guard member and taken into custody, officials said. He is currently hospitalized. No other suspects have been identified in connection with the shooting, multiple law enforcement sources told CBS News.",
      "U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said Friday the suspect will be charged with murder in the first degree. On Thursday, she said he was facing charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence.",
      "Here's what we know about the suspect so far. This story will be updated as additional information is confirmed.",
      "Suspect entered U.S. 4 years ago",
      "Lakanwal, 29, entered the United States in 2021, multiple law enforcement sources told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said on X\u00a0that the suspect was paroled into the U.S. on Sept. 8, 2021, under a Biden-era program for Afghan nationals called Operation Allies Welcome.",
      "The suspect and his family fled Taliban threats in Afghanistan's Khost province, and relocated to Kabul before being transferred to the United States, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "President Trump described him as \"a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan, a hellhole on Earth,\" in a video message late Wednesday. He said the suspect's status was extended \"under legislation signed by President Biden.\"",
      "A Department of Homeland Security official told CBS News the suspect was paroled into the U.S. on humanitarian grounds back in 2021. That was the main legal mechanism the Biden administration used to welcome tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees after the Taliban takeover in August 2021.",
      "Lakanwal\u00a0later applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2024 and his application was granted in 2025, the DHS official said. But his request for a green card, which is tied to the asylum grant, is pending.",
      "Many of the Afghan nationals who were admitted to the U.S. in 2021 were issued special immigrant visas offered to those who worked alongside the military during its 20-year war, while others were given a temporary humanitarian status known as parole.",
      "More than 8,000 people from Afghanistan were also granted deportation relief under a separate program called temporary protected status, which Biden extended in 2023 but Mr. Trump chose to end earlier this year.",
      "Suspect had worked with U.S. forces and CIA in Afghanistan",
      "A CIA spokesperson confirmed Thursday that the suspect worked with the U.S. government, including the CIA, during the war in Afghanistan.",
      "CBS News has also learned that the suspect led a team in the former Afghan national armed forces that worked directly with U.S. and British forces.",
      "Operational vetting conducted during the war was aimed largely at ensuring Afghan partner forces would not turn their weapons on U.S. personnel, and former intelligence officials said that the screening was not meant to serve as an immigration clearance.",
      "According to a former Afghan commando who spoke with CBS News on Thursday, Lakanwal led a unit of Afghan special forces in the south of the country and worked closely with the international troops.",
      "The former commando told CBS News that Lakanwal was left deeply troubled by the death of a close friend and fellow Afghan commander in 2024, whom he said had unsuccessfully sought asylum in the U.S.",
      "Multiple law enforcement sources told CBS News on Thursday that a running theory of investigators is that the suspect suffered from paranoia and other mental health challenges that indicated he believed authorities sought to deport him from the U.S. Counterterrorism officials said that ISIS and al-Qaeda-aligned narratives often target former U.S. partner forces with messaging that they will be abandoned or deported. While the suspect repeatedly expressed a fear of deportation, investigators have not linked that anxiety to extremist propaganda or a specific organization, officials said. Investigators are searching for evidence of extremist influence.",
      "Suspect placed on a ventilator",
      "The suspect was subdued at the scene of the shooting and taken into custody by National Guard members and law enforcement officers, Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, told reporters Wednesday.",
      "The suspect has been sedated and placed on a ventilator since the shooting, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News. The treatment has complicated efforts to interview him and retain biometrics.",
      "Police say suspect was \"lone gunman\" who \"ambushed\" National Guard",
      "Carroll said the suspect appeared to be \"a lone gunman that raised the firearm and ambushed these members of the National Guard\" as they patrolled near a mass transit station in downtown D.C.",
      "The suspect had four rounds in his handgun initially, multiple sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News. The revolver used in the attack was not registered to the suspect, according to investigators. Instead, it belonged to a deceased Washington state resident. Officials said the number of bullets in the weapon is unusual and remains unexplained.",
      "The first victim \u2014 a female guard member \u2014 was struck immediately and collapsed where she stood. She sustained at least two gunshot wounds during the ambush, the sources said.",
      "Then, the suspect took her weapon and used it to continue shooting, striking the second guard member, according to multiple sources. A third guard member, who was not injured, ultimately returned fire, ending the attack.",
      "One of the victims, 20-year-old Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, has died, Mr. Trump said Thursday. The second victim, Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, was in critical condition after undergoing surgery, Pirro said earlier Thursday.",
      "The guard members were on \"high visibility patrols,\" Carroll said, part of a monthslong deployment of National Guard troops from D.C. and several states ordered by Mr. Trump.",
      "Suspect drove from Washington state",
      "Pirro said Thursday morning that the suspect drove to D.C. from Bellingham, in Washington state, with \"the intended target of coming to our nation's capital.\" She said the suspect lived with his wife and, officials believe, five children.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said a search warrant had been executed at the suspect's last known address in Washington state. Based on what was found at the address, law enforcement were able to find people associated with him in San Diego.",
      "\"During that process, we seized numerous electronic devices to include cellphones, laptops, iPads and other material that is being analyzed as we speak,\" Patel said. \"Interviews were conducted and are going to continue to be conducted, and we will go anywhere in the country or the world where the evidence leads us.\"",
      "Multiple family members of the suspect in Washington state have been interviewed by investigators following a search of the suspect's Bellingham home, multiple law enforcement sources told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "U.S. intelligence analysts are combing the suspect's communications and online footprint for signs of international coordination or ideological radicalization, multiple U.S. officials said. An early review of his social media and messaging channels has not revealed links to foreign handlers or extremist groups.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security had earlier spelled his last name as Lakamal.",

      "Pirro said Thursday that both Guard members had been sworn into Guard duty less than 24 hours before the attack. The National Guard's joint task force for the district later clarified that the two had been serving in the district since August, and they were deputized before the attack to maintain their status to conduct patrols.",

The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who was let into the U.S. under the Biden administration and granted asylum under the Trump administration.",
      "Cordes pointed out that the inspector general of the Justice Department found that Afghans who entered the U.S. after the fall of Kabul in 2021 had been thoroughly vetted. She asked the president: \"So why do you blame the Biden administration \u2014\"",
      "\"Because they let him in. Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person? Because they came in on a plane, along with thousands of other people that shouldn't be here, and you're just asking questions because you're a stupid person,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "On Wednesday, the president assailed New York Times correspondent Katie Rogers, who co-authored an article on his age and physical stamina in his second term, calling her \"third rate\" and \"ugly, both inside and out.\"",
      "The president's insults at Cordes and Rogers are just the latest in recent weeks that have been aimed at female reporters covering his presidency.

      "Asked about the comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump is \"very frank and honest\" with reporters and contrasted the president's willingness to take questions from the press to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"I think the president being frank and open and honest to your faces rather than hiding behind your backs, is, frankly, a lot more respectful than what you saw in the last administration, where you had a president who lied to your face and then didn't speak to you for weeks and hid upstairs and didn't take your questions,\" she said. \"So I think everyone in this room should appreciate the frankness and the openness that you get from President Trump on a near daily basis.\"",
      "A Bloomberg spokesperson told the Washington Post that \"our White House journalists perform a vital public service, asking questions without fear or favor. We remain focused on reporting issues of public interest fairly and accurately.\"",
      "Then last week, while hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office last week, Mr. Trump berated ABC News chief White House correspondent Mary Bruce when she asked about the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. An intelligence report released by the Biden administration concluded that bin Salman ordered the attack on Khashoggi.",
      "Mr. Trump accused Bruce of embarrassing the crown prince with her question and later called her a \"terrible person and a terrible reporter.\" The president said her question was \"horrible\" and \"insubordinate.\"",
      "Wednesday's insult against Rogers was provoked by a New York Times article published Tuesday that examined the frequency of the president's public events and domestic travel, as well as the timing of his appearances on his public schedule. At 79, Mr. Trump is the oldest person elected to serve as president.",
      "Signs of bruising on his right hand as well as swollen ankles have prompted new questions about Mr. Trump's health. The president also revealed to reporters last month that he underwent an MRI during a physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in April.",
      "Rogers' byline on the piece about Mr. Trump's aging in office is listed alongside another reporter, Dylan Freedman, a machine-learning engineer and journalist at the New York Times.",
      "The president attacked the Times and Rogers over the article, which he claimed was a \"hit piece.\" He called the newspaper a \"cheap 'rag'\" that is \"truly an 'enemy of the people.'\"",
      "\"The writer of the story, Katie Rogers, who is assigned to write only bad things about me, is a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.\u00a0 He did not mention the story's co-author.",
      "The New York Times defended the article and Rogers.",
      "\"The Times' reporting is accurate and built on first hand reporting of the facts. Name-calling and personal insults don't change that, nor will our journalists hesitate to cover this administration in the face of intimidation tactics like this,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"Expert and thorough reporters like Katie Rogers exemplify how an independent and free press helps the American people better understand their government and its leaders.\"",
      "The Society of Professional Journalists condemned Mr. Trump's attacks on Bruce and Lucey last week, which it said were not isolated and instead \"part of an unmistakable pattern of hostility \u2014 often directed at women \u2014 that undermines the essential role of a free and independent press.\"",
      "\"Journalists are not props at a photo op \u2014 they are watchdogs for the public,\" Caroline Hendrie, executive director of the group, said in a statement. \"When reporters ask hard questions about the murder of a fellow journalist, that is not an embarrassment. What's embarrassing is a leader trying to silence those questions.\"",

    "story": [
      "An image of an ID badge circulating widely online that shows the suspect in the shooting of the National Guard members says he was assigned to the \"Kandahar Strike Force\" or \"03\" unit, one of a number of so-called \"Zero Units\" that worked closely with U.S. and other foreign forces during the war in Afghanistan. A former senior Afghan military source confirmed to CBS News that the ID badge is authentic.",
      "A U.S. official briefed on the shooting investigation and a former senior Afghan National Defense and Security Forces member told CBS News that the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had been part of a \"Zero Unit,\" an Afghan intelligence unit and paramilitary force that worked with the CIA. The units were exclusively composed of\u00a0Afghan nationals\u00a0and operated under the umbrella of the National Directorate of Security, or NDS, the intelligence agency established with CIA backing for Afghanistan's previous, U.S.-backed government. They were considered by the U.S. and its international partners to be among the most trusted domestic forces in Afghanistan.",
      "Those units are often labeled \"death squads\" by human rights groups. The units were known in Afghanistan for their secrecy and alleged brutality, and members were implicated in numerous extrajudicial killings of civilians, particularly during night raids.",
      "The U.S. official briefed on the investigation confirmed the suspect had been disturbed by the casualties in this unit and, more recently, deeply troubled by the killing of his close friend overseas.",
      "The image of the ID badge also carries the words \"Firebase Gecko,\" which was the name of a base used by the CIA and special forces in Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan, inside what was previously the compound of the Taliban's founding leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Thursday the suspect had previously worked \"with the U.S. Government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.\"",
      "Lt. Gen. Sami Sadat, a former commanding general of the Afghan National Special Operations Corps, told CBS News that Lakanwal worked for the \"03\" unit for eight years. A former senior Afghan general under the U.S.-backed government told CBS News on Thursday that \"03 unit, also known as The Kandahar Strike Force (KSF), was under special forces directorate of NDS. They were the most active and professional forces, trained and equipped by the CIA. All their operations were conducted under the CIA command.\" Lakanwal was part of the unit's operations team, Sadat said.",
      "\"He was known for being responsible and professional within his team and had strong anti-Taliban views,\" Sadat said.",
      "\"While we could not establish any connection between him and any terrorist organization, we also cannot completely rule it out,\" Sadat said. \"However, we can confirm that his background does not show any links to terrorists.\"",
      "Lakanwal's family faced serious threats from the Taliban, which led him to relocate them from their native Khost province to Kabul, Sadat said. In the U.S., Sadat said Lakanwal was \"generally calm and maintained a clean record, though he suffered from PTSD.\"",
      "As a member of a Zero Unit, the suspect would have been virtually guaranteed a route to asylum in the U.S. because members of these elite units were high on the list for\u00a0Taliban retaliation\u00a0after the group retook control of the country. Many members of these units played key roles in the August 2021\u00a0evacuation from Kabul, in return for a guarantee of space on a flight for themselves and their families out of Afghanistan.",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Afghanistan's current Taliban government, and officials in Kabul did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment on the arrest in Washington.",

      "To pull off their schemes, fraudsters are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence.

    "summary": "The review comes after an Afghan national who arrived in the U.S. in 2021 was arrested in the shooting of two National Guard members.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said Thursday it will be conducting a \"full-scale, rigorous reexamination\" of all green cards for every immigrant from \"a country of concern\" in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. An Afghan national who arrived in the U.S. in 2021 has been arrested as a suspect in Wednesday's attack.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow said Thursday that the order had come at the request of President Trump. Two Homeland Security officials told CBS News there are 19 countries on that list, including Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Sudan, Yemen and Venezuela.",
      "Two members of the West Virginia National Guard, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, were shot Wednesday near the White House in what authorities described as an \"ambush-style attack.\" President Trump on Thursday told reporters that Beckstrom had died from her injuries. Wolfe was in critical condition as of Thursday morning, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said.",
      "The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was shot Wednesday by a member of the National Guard, ending the attack, authorities said. He faces three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed, and he will also be charged with possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, Pirro said Thursday. The charges could still change pending the condition of the guard members.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security identified the suspect in Wednesday's shooting as Lakanwal, an Afghan national who authorities said was paroled into the U.S. in 2021 under a Biden-era program for Afghan nationals called Operation Allies Welcome. The CIA confirmed Thursday that Lakanwal had worked with the agency in Afghanistan.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday that the agency is now reviewing all asylum cases approved under the Biden administration.",
      "It's unclear how wide-ranging Homeland Security's review of the asylum policies will be. The Trump administration ordered an unprecedented review and rescreening of all refugees admitted to the U.S. under the Biden administration earlier this month. Refugees and asylum-seekers have to meet the same legal definition, but arrive in the U.S. under different circumstances.",
      "Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021, and his asylum case was granted earlier this year, while Mr. Trump was in office, a Homeland Security official told CBS News. In her statement, McLaughlin appeared to blame the shooting suspect's approval on a Biden-era court settlement that required the federal government to expedite the processing of Afghan asylum cases.",
      "Since the shooting, the Trump administration had already paused all immigration processing requests from Afghan nationals. An estimated 85,000 Afghans were settled in the U.S. under Operation Allies Welcome after the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. In many cases, they were initially housed at military bases and flown to the U.S. after undergoing processing.",
      "Mr. Trump posted a video on social media on Wednesday night addressing the shooting, calling it an \"act of evil and an act of hatred and an act of terror. It was a crime against our entire nation. It was a crime against humanity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also noted that the suspect had come to the U.S. under the Biden-era program and vowed to \"reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country.\"",
      "\"No country can tolerate such a risk to our country,\" Mr. Trump added, while pivoting to discussing Somali immigrants in Minnesota.",
      "Earlier this week, CBS News reported that the Trump administration directed immigration officials to review the cases of refugees admitted under former President Joe Biden, as part of an unprecedented effort to identify potential reasons that would disqualify them from being able to stay in the U.S.",

      "Snapped last month by the Gemini South telescope \u2014 half of the International Gemini Observatory on Cerro Pach\u00f3n, a mountain in Central Chile \u2014 the aptly named Butterfly Nebula is 2,500 to 3,800 light-years away in the constellation Scorpius. A single light-year is 6 trillion miles.",
      "At the heart of this bipolar nebula is a white dwarf star that cast aside its outer layers of gas long ago. The discarded gas forms the butterfly-like wings billowing from the aging star, whose heat causes the gas to glow.",

      "\"This picturesque object was chosen as a target for the 8.1-meter [26.5-foot] telescope by students in Chile as part of the Gemini First Light Anniversary Image Contest,\" NoirLab wrote on its website. \"The contest engaged students in the host locations of the Gemini telescopes to celebrate the legacy that the International Gemini Observatory has built since its completion, marked by Gemini South's First Light in November 2000.\"",
      "It's not known exactly when NGC 6302 was discovered, NoirLab says, but a 1907 study by American astronomer Edward E. Barnard is often credited. Scottish astronomer James Dunlop could also have discovered it in 1826.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have detected what they believe to be lightning on Mars by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
      "The crackling of electrical discharges was captured by a microphone on the rover, a French-led team reported Wednesday.",
      "The researchers documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet of the microphone perched atop the rover's tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",
      "Scientists have been looking for electrical activity and lightning at Mars for half a century, said the study's lead author Baptiste Chide, of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse.",
      "\"It opens a completely new field of investigation for Mars science,\" Chide said, citing the possible chemical effects from electrical discharges. \"It's like finding a missing piece of the puzzle.\"",
      "The evidence is strong and persuasive, but it's based on a single instrument that was meant to record the rover zapping rocks with lasers, not lightning blasts, said Cardiff University's Daniel Mitchard, who was not involved in the study. What's more, he noted in an article accompanying the study in the journal Nature, the electrical discharges were heard \u2014 not seen.",
      "\"It really is a chance discovery to hear something else going on nearby, and everything points to this being Martian lightning,\" Mitchard said in an email. But until new instruments are sent to verify the findings, \"I think there will still be a debate from some scientists as to whether this really was lightning,\" he said.",
      "\"Like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye\"",
      "Lightning has already been confirmed on Jupiter and Saturn, and Mars has long been suspected of having it too.",
      "To find it, Chide and his team analyzed 28 hours of Perseverance recordings, documenting episodes of \"mini lightning\" based on acoustic and electric signals.",
      "Electrical discharges generated by the fast-moving dust devils lasted just a few seconds, while those spawned by dust storms lingered as long as 30 minutes.",
      "\"It's like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye and with plenty of faint zaps,\" Chide said in an email. He noted that the thin, carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere absorbs much of the sound, making some of the zaps barely perceptible.",
      "Mars' atmosphere is more prone than Earth's to electrical discharging and sparking through contact among grains of dust and sand, according to Chide.",
      "\"The current evidence suggests it is extremely unlikely that the first person to walk on Mars could, as they plant a flag on the surface, be struck down by a bolt of lightning,\" Mitchard wrote in Nature. But the \"small and frequent static-like discharges could prove problematic for sensitive equipment.\"",
      "These aren't the first Mars sounds transmitted by Perseverance. Earthlings have listened in to the rover's wheels crunching over the Martian surface and the whirring blades of its no-longer-flying helicopter sidekick, Ingenuity.",
      "Perseverance has been scouring a dry river delta at Mars since 2021, collecting samples of rock for possible signs of ancient microscopic life. NASA plans to return these core samples to Earth for laboratory analysis, but the delivery is on indefinite hold as the space agency pursues cheaper options.",
      "Blue Origin's Blue and Gold NASA satellites en route to study Mars",
      "Earlier this month, Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket that put two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars. The satellites are aiming to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission \u2014 Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers. Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity-assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars. In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth's, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",

    "story": [
      "The Ukrainian President's chief of staff Andriy Yermak, who was also part of Ukraine's peace deal negotiations with the U.S., has resigned after his home was raided in a major investigation into corruption in the country.",
      "Two national agencies investigating a $100 million energy sector corruption scandal involving top Ukrainian officials in the country said they had searched Yermak's office.",
      "President Zelenskyy announced Yermak's resignation in a video message, where he said he didn't want there to be \"any questions about Ukraine.\"",

      "Yermak himself \u2014 a powerful figure in Ukraine and a key participant in ongoing talks with the U.S., as the Trump administration pushes for a ceasefire to end Russia's nearly four-year war on the country \u2014 also confirmed that authorities had searched his apartment.",
      "\"The investigators are facing no obstacles,\" Yermak wrote in a post on the messaging app Telegram. He added that he was cooperating fully with them and his lawyers were present.",
      "The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office are Ukrainian anti-corruption watchdogs.",
      "Two of Yermak's former deputies \u2014 Oleh Tatarov and Rostyslav Shurma \u2014   left the government in 2024 after watchdogs investigated them for financial wrongdoing. A third deputy, Andrii Smyrnov, was investigated for bribes and other wrongdoing but still works for Yermak.",
      "The scandal has heaped more problems on Zelenskyy as he seeks continued support from Western countries for Ukraine's war effort and tries to ensure continued foreign funding. The European Union, which Ukraine wants to join, has told Zelenskyy he must crack down on corruption.",
      "Zelenskyy faced an unprecedented rebellion from his own lawmakers earlier this month after investigators published details of their energy sector investigation.",
      "In July, Zelenskyy faced the first major protests against himself and his government since Russia launched its full-scale invasion over a bill he signed into law giving Ukraine's prosecutor general, a political appointee roughly equivalent to the U.S. attorney general, more power over the two anti-corruption agencies.",
      "Some critics argued that the new law was political retribution following the charges being filed against his former deputy Smyrnov, and the move fueled concern that Ukraine could backslide into some degree of the authoritarianism that was the default under former, pro-Russian President\u00a0Viktor Yanukovych, who was known for his close ties to oligarchs.",
      "Although Yermak has not been accused of any wrongdoing, several senior lawmakers in Zelenskyy's party said Yermak should take responsibility for the energy sector scandal in order to restore public trust. Some said that if Zelenskyy didn't fire him, the party could split, threatening the president's parliamentary majority. But Zelenskyy defied them.",
      "The president urged Ukrainians to unite and \"stop the political games\" in light of the U.S. pressure to reach a settlement with Russia.",

    "story": [
      "Hong Kong\u00a0\u2014 The death toll from a fire that tore through a Hong Kong residential complex climbed to 128 on Friday as more bodies were found in the blackened towers, authorities said. Meanwhile, another eight people involved in the towers' renovation were arrested.",
      "Secretary for Security Chris Tang told reporters at the scene that the search for victims was continuing and the death toll could still rise. The fire at the Wang Fuk Court complex started Wednesday afternoon and was only fully extinguished Friday morning. Dozens of people, including firefighters, were injured in the blaze.",
      "Firefighters were still combing through the high-rise complex apartment-by-apartment in a final attempt to find anyone alive after the massive fire engulfed seven of the complex's eight towers in one of the city's deadliest blazes ever recorded.",
      "Crews were prioritizing apartments from which they had received more than two dozen calls for assistance during the blaze, but which they were unable to reach due to the intensity of the fire, Derek Armstrong Chan, a deputy director of Hong Kong Fire Services told reporters early Friday morning.",
      "\"Our firefighting operation is almost complete,\" he said.",
      "The fire started midafternoon Wednesday in one of the Wang Fuk Court complex's eight towers, jumping rapidly from one to the next as bamboo scaffolding covered in netting, in place for renovations, caught ablaze until seven buildings were engulfed.",
      "It took more than 1,000 firefighters some 24 hours to bring the five-alarm blaze under control, and almost two days later, smoke still continued to drift out of the charred skeletons of the buildings from the occasional flare-up.",
      "The final search of the buildings was expected to be complete later Friday, at which point officials have said they will officially end the rescue phase of the operation at the complex in Tai Po district, a northern suburb near Hong Kong's border with mainland China.",
      "It was unclear how many people could be inside the buildings, which had almost 2,000 apartments and some 4,800 residents. Hong Kong leader John Lee said early Thursday morning that officials had not been able to make contact with 279 residents.",
      "\"We will endeavor to force entry into all the units of the seven blocks concerned so as to ensure that there is no other possible casualties,\" Chan said.",
      "He said an updated figure on the number of missing people could not be calculated until the search and rescue operation was complete.",
      "The apartments from which a total of 25 unanswered rescue calls were received, which are being prioritized, were primarily on higher floors, where the fire was last extinguished, he said.",
      "More than 70 people were injured in the blaze, including 11 firefighters, and about 900 people were housed in temporary shelters.",
      "Most of the casualties were in the first two buildings to catch fire, Chan said.",
      "Arrests amid investigation into the deadly blaze",
      "The apartment complex housed many older people. It was built in the 1980s and had been undergoing a major renovation. Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency said on Thursday it was investigating possible corruption relating to the renovation project.",
      "Authorities on Friday arrested seven men and one woman, ranging in age from 40 to 63, including scaffolding subcontractors, directors of an engineering consultant company and project managers supervising the renovation, the Independent Commission Against Corruption said in a statement.",
      "On Thursday, three men, the directors and an engineering consultant of a construction company, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, and police said company leaders were suspected of gross negligence.",
      "Police have not identified the company where the suspects worked, but The Associated Press confirmed Prestige Construction & Engineering Company was in charge of renovations in the tower complex. Police have seized boxes of documents from the company, where phones rang unanswered Thursday.",
      "Authorities suspected some materials on the exterior walls of the high-rise buildings did not meet fire resistance standards, allowing the unusually fast spread of the fire. There was also word on Friday that fire alarm systems in at least some of the buildings affected may not have been functioning properly.",
      "Police also said they found plastic foam panels - which are highly flammable - attached to the windows on each floor near the elevator lobby of the one unaffected tower. The panels were believed to have been installed by the construction company but the purpose was not clear.",

    "story": [
      "An image of an ID badge circulating widely online that shows the suspect in the shooting of the National Guard members says he was assigned to the \"Kandahar Strike Force\" or \"03\" unit, one of a number of so-called \"Zero Units\" that worked closely with U.S. and other foreign forces during the war in Afghanistan. A former senior Afghan military source confirmed to CBS News that the ID badge is authentic.",
      "A U.S. official briefed on the shooting investigation and a former senior Afghan National Defense and Security Forces member told CBS News that the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had been part of a \"Zero Unit,\" an Afghan intelligence unit and paramilitary force that worked with the CIA. The units were exclusively composed of\u00a0Afghan nationals\u00a0and operated under the umbrella of the National Directorate of Security, or NDS, the intelligence agency established with CIA backing for Afghanistan's previous, U.S.-backed government. They were considered by the U.S. and its international partners to be among the most trusted domestic forces in Afghanistan.",
      "Those units are often labeled \"death squads\" by human rights groups. The units were known in Afghanistan for their secrecy and alleged brutality, and members were implicated in numerous extrajudicial killings of civilians, particularly during night raids.",
      "The U.S. official briefed on the investigation confirmed the suspect had been disturbed by the casualties in this unit and, more recently, deeply troubled by the killing of his close friend overseas.",
      "The image of the ID badge also carries the words \"Firebase Gecko,\" which was the name of a base used by the CIA and special forces in Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan, inside what was previously the compound of the Taliban's founding leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Thursday the suspect had previously worked \"with the U.S. Government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.\"",
      "Lt. Gen. Sami Sadat, a former commanding general of the Afghan National Special Operations Corps, told CBS News that Lakanwal worked for the \"03\" unit for eight years. A former senior Afghan general under the U.S.-backed government told CBS News on Thursday that \"03 unit, also known as The Kandahar Strike Force (KSF), was under special forces directorate of NDS. They were the most active and professional forces, trained and equipped by the CIA. All their operations were conducted under the CIA command.\" Lakanwal was part of the unit's operations team, Sadat said.",
      "\"He was known for being responsible and professional within his team and had strong anti-Taliban views,\" Sadat said.",
      "\"While we could not establish any connection between him and any terrorist organization, we also cannot completely rule it out,\" Sadat said. \"However, we can confirm that his background does not show any links to terrorists.\"",
      "Lakanwal's family faced serious threats from the Taliban, which led him to relocate them from their native Khost province to Kabul, Sadat said. In the U.S., Sadat said Lakanwal was \"generally calm and maintained a clean record, though he suffered from PTSD.\"",
      "As a member of a Zero Unit, the suspect would have been virtually guaranteed a route to asylum in the U.S. because members of these elite units were high on the list for\u00a0Taliban retaliation\u00a0after the group retook control of the country. Many members of these units played key roles in the August 2021\u00a0evacuation from Kabul, in return for a guarantee of space on a flight for themselves and their families out of Afghanistan.",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Afghanistan's current Taliban government, and officials in Kabul did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment on the arrest in Washington.",

    "story": [
      "Police in Hong Kong\u00a0have arrested three men from a construction company on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with a blaze that has killed at least 94 people and left hundreds of others missing in the city's deadliest fire in years.",
      "The fire that started Wednesday afternoon spread across seven of the complex's eight buildings, though the blazes on four of the towers were under control by morning, the city's fire services said.",
      "Officials said at least 70 people were injured, including 11 firefighters, with many suffering from burns and smoke inhalation. About 900 people were evacuated to temporary shelters overnight.",
      "Fire Services Department Director Andy Yeung said a firefighter was among the dead, and that the 37-year-old had been a firefighter for nine years. \"All of our colleagues are deeply saddened by the loss of such a devoted comrade,\" he said in a news release.",
      "As firefighters fought for a second day to extinguish the blaze, rescuers holding flashlights were going from apartment to apartment at the charred towers as thick smoke poured out from some windows at the Wang Fuk Court complex, a dense cluster of buildings housing thousands of people in Tai Po district, a northern suburb near Hong Kong's border with the mainland.",
      "Officials said firefighters were still working on a handful of apartments and trying to enter all of the units in the seven towers to ensure there were no further casualties.",
      "\"Our firefighting operation is almost complete,\" said Derek Armstrong Chan, deputy director of Fire Services Operations. Firefighters were working hard \"to prevent the debris and embers from flaring up. What's next is the search and rescue operation,\" he added.",
      "It was unclear how many people remained missing or trapped. Hong Kong leader John Lee said contact had been lost with 279 people early Thursday. Authorities did not provide updates on the missing people or how many were still inside the ravaged buildings Thursday during a news conference.",
      "Video showed rescuers searching in some apartments in the dark. Orange flames were still seen from inside several windows, though the whole complex was now largely a blackened ruin.",
      "It was not immediately known how the fire started, but officials said the flames started on the external scaffolding on one of the buildings, a 32-story tower, and later spread inside the building and then to nearby buildings, likely aided by windy conditions.",
      "The raging fire sent up a column of flames and thick smoke as it spread through the bamboo scaffolding that had been set up around the exterior of the complex. Live video from the scene showed firefighters aiming water at the intense flames from high up on ladder trucks as the skies darkened, with smoke billowing from windows and red-hot embers falling to the ground.",
      "Fire chiefs said high temperatures at the scene made it difficult for crews to mount rescue operations.",
      "Authorities suspected some materials on the exterior walls of the high-rise buildings did not meet fire resistance standards, as the rapid spread of the fire was unusual.",
      "Police also said they found foam materials that are highly flammable outside the windows on each floor near the elevator lobby of the one unaffected tower, believed to be installed by a construction company.",
      "\"We have reason to believe that those in charge of the construction company were grossly negligent,\" said Eileen Chung, a senior superintendent of police. The three men arrested, aged 52 to 68, are the directors and an engineering consultant of the firm.",
      "The blaze was first reported in the mid-afternoon and was upgraded by nightfall  to a level-5 alarm, the highest level of severity, the Fire Services Department said.",
      "Firefighters deployed more than 140 fire trucks and more than 60 ambulances to the scene.",
      "Police said they received multiple reports of people trapped in the affected buildings. Records show the housing complex consisted of eight blocks with almost 2,000 apartments housing about 4,800 people. It was built in the 1980s and had recently been undergoing a major renovation.",
      "Lo Hiu-fung, a Tai Po District Council member, told local TV station TVB earlier Wednesday that most of the residents trapped in the fire were believed to be elderly people.",
      "\"Nearby residents please stay indoors and close doors and windows and stay calm and avoid going to areas affected by fire incidents,\" the Hong Kong Fire Services Department wrote on Facebook.",
      "Chinese leader\u00a0Xi Jinping\u00a0on Wednesday expressed condolences to the firefighter who died and extended sympathies to the families of the victims, according to state broadcaster CCTV.",
      "Tai Po is a suburban area in the northern part of Hong Kong and near the border with the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen.",

    "story": [
      "A rare crystal and diamond Faberg\u00e9 egg crafted for Russia's ruling family before it was toppled by revolution is going up for auction, valued at more than $26 million.",
      "Christie's auction house says the Winter Egg\u00a0is just one of seven of the opulent ovoids remaining in private hands. It will be offered for sale at Christie's London headquarters on Tuesday.",
      "The 4-inch-tall egg is made from finely carved rock crystal, covered in a delicate snowflake motif wrought in platinum and 4,500 tiny diamonds. It opens to reveal a removable tiny basket of bejewelled quartz flowers symbolizing spring.",
      "Margo Oganesian, the head of Christie's Russian art department, likened it to a luxurious Kinder Surprise chocolate.",
      "The Winter Egg is a superb example of craft and design, \"the 'Mona Lisa' for decorative arts,\" Oganesian said.",
      "One of just two created by female designer Alma Pihl, the egg was commissioned by Czar Nicholas II for his mother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, as an Easter present in 1913. Pihl's other egg is owned by Britain's royal family.",
      "Craftsman Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9 and his company created more than 50 of the eggs for Russia's imperial family between 1885 and 1917, each elaborately unique and containing a hidden surprise. Czar Alexander III started the tradition by presenting an egg to his wife each Easter. His successor, Nicholas II, extended the gift to his wife and mother.",
      "The Romanov royal family ruled Russia for 300 years before it was ousted by the 1917 revolution. Nicholas and his family were executed in 1918.",
      "Bought by a London dealer for 450 pounds when the cash-strapped Communist authorities sold off some of Russia's artistic treasures in the 1920s, the egg changed hands several times. It was believed lost for two decades until it was auctioned by Christie's in 1994 for more than 7 million Swiss francs ($5.6 million at the time). It sold again in 2002 for $9.6 million.",
      "Now it is expected to surpass the record $18.5 million paid at a 2007 Christie's auction for another Faberg\u00e9 egg created for the Rothschild banking family.",
      "There are 43 surviving imperial Faberg\u00e9 eggs, most in museums.",

    "summary": "Researchers have documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have detected what they believe to be lightning on Mars by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
      "The crackling of electrical discharges was captured by a microphone on the rover, a French-led team reported Wednesday.",
      "The researchers documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet of the microphone perched atop the rover's tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",
      "Scientists have been looking for electrical activity and lightning at Mars for half a century, said the study's lead author Baptiste Chide, of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse.",
      "\"It opens a completely new field of investigation for Mars science,\" Chide said, citing the possible chemical effects from electrical discharges. \"It's like finding a missing piece of the puzzle.\"",
      "The evidence is strong and persuasive, but it's based on a single instrument that was meant to record the rover zapping rocks with lasers, not lightning blasts, said Cardiff University's Daniel Mitchard, who was not involved in the study. What's more, he noted in an article accompanying the study in the journal Nature, the electrical discharges were heard \u2014 not seen.",
      "\"It really is a chance discovery to hear something else going on nearby, and everything points to this being Martian lightning,\" Mitchard said in an email. But until new instruments are sent to verify the findings, \"I think there will still be a debate from some scientists as to whether this really was lightning,\" he said.",
      "\"Like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye\"",
      "Lightning has already been confirmed on Jupiter and Saturn, and Mars has long been suspected of having it too.",
      "To find it, Chide and his team analyzed 28 hours of Perseverance recordings, documenting episodes of \"mini lightning\" based on acoustic and electric signals.",
      "Electrical discharges generated by the fast-moving dust devils lasted just a few seconds, while those spawned by dust storms lingered as long as 30 minutes.",
      "\"It's like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye and with plenty of faint zaps,\" Chide said in an email. He noted that the thin, carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere absorbs much of the sound, making some of the zaps barely perceptible.",
      "Mars' atmosphere is more prone than Earth's to electrical discharging and sparking through contact among grains of dust and sand, according to Chide.",
      "\"The current evidence suggests it is extremely unlikely that the first person to walk on Mars could, as they plant a flag on the surface, be struck down by a bolt of lightning,\" Mitchard wrote in Nature. But the \"small and frequent static-like discharges could prove problematic for sensitive equipment.\"",
      "These aren't the first Mars sounds transmitted by Perseverance. Earthlings have listened in to the rover's wheels crunching over the Martian surface and the whirring blades of its no-longer-flying helicopter sidekick, Ingenuity.",
      "Perseverance has been scouring a dry river delta at Mars since 2021, collecting samples of rock for possible signs of ancient microscopic life. NASA plans to return these core samples to Earth for laboratory analysis, but the delivery is on indefinite hold as the space agency pursues cheaper options.",
      "Blue Origin's Blue and Gold NASA satellites en route to study Mars",
      "Earlier this month, Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket that put two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars. The satellites are aiming to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission \u2014 Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers. Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity-assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars. In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth's, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",

      "\"We need to sit down and discuss this seriously,\" Putin told reporters at the end of a three-day visit to Kyrgyzstan. He described U.S. President Donald Trump's 28-point peace plan\u00a0as \"a set of issues put forward for discussion\" rather than a draft agreement.",
      "\"If Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they occupy, hostilities will cease. If they don't withdraw, we will achieve this by force,\" the Russian leader said.",
      "Kremlin officials have had little to say so far about the peace plan put forward last week by Trump. Since Russia's invasion of its neighbor, Putin has shown no willingness to budge from his goals in Ukraine despite Trump's push for a settlement.",
      "Putin has previously demanded that Ukraine completely withdraw from the entirety of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia regions before Russia considers any sort of \"peace negotiations\" - notably including areas of each of those oblasts that Russia does not occupy. He also wants to keep Ukraine from joining NATO and hosting any Western troops, allowing Moscow to gradually pull the country back into its orbit.",

Sidelined European leaders, fearing for their own security amid Russian aggression, are angling for deeper involvement in the process.",
      "Analysts say Putin is attempting to outwait the commitment of Western countries to supporting Ukraine's war effort. Trump has previously signaled he could walk away from efforts to stop the fighting if there is no progress. European officials say Putin is stalling because Russia wants to grab more of Ukraine before accepting any deal.",

      "The Ankara leg of Pope Leo's visit was to be brief. By Thursday evening, he's set to depart for Istanbul, where the spiritual heart of the papal visit will unfold over the coming days, including events tied to the anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, a pivotal gathering of bishops, summoned by then-Roman Emperor Constantine I in 325 A.D., which, among other things, set the date for Easter to be marked.",

    "story": [
      "Two French prisoners escaped from jail after sawing through the bars of their cells and using bedsheets to get out of the facility, a prosecutor said Thursday.",
      "Guards noticed the break-out shortly before dawn, the prisons' authority said. The facility is in the eastern city of Dijon.",
      "The pair \"seem to have sawn through bars\" and \"fled using bed sheets,\" Dijon prosecutor Olivier Caracotch said. He did not provide further details on how exactly they used the bedding.",
      "Union official Ahmed Saih, who represents prison officers at the facility, said the inmates used \"old-fashioned, manual saw blades\".",
      "The fugitives are a 19-year-old man held in pre-trial detention since October 2024 for attempted murder in a drug-related case, and a 32-year-old man incarcerated since 2023 over threats and violence against a partner, Caracotch said.",
      "\"Warning about the risk of a jail break for months\"",
      "The prison break comes 10 days after another escape in the western city of Rennes. A 37-year-old convict, who had more than year left to serve for theft, fled during an outing with fellow prisoners to the city's planetarium. It was not immediately clear if he had been caught. The prison's director was fired by Gerald Darmanin, France's justice minister who is pushing through a plan to lock up the most dangerous drug traffickers in supermax prisons.",
      "France has some of the worst prison overcrowding in Europe, ranking third worst after Slovenia and Cyprus, according to a Council of Europe report published\u00a0in July. In early October, the national average was 135 inmates per 100 places available. Dijon prison, built in 1853, is in poor condition, with 311 inmates for 180 places, according to the justice ministry.",
      "\"Prison is very hard here,\" an inmate released on Thursday after eight months, told AFP. \"There were three of us in a cell: two on bunk beds and one sleeping on the floor.\"",
      "Staff unions have complained that the state is neglecting normal jails as it moves narco criminals into new supermax prisons. Three prison directors' unions criticized Darmanin in a statement on Wednesday, before the Dijon escape. They accused him of \"devoting all the resources of a debt-ridden state\" to the high-security prisons for those accused of drug trafficking and jihadist attacks, and neglecting the \"vast majority\" of other jails.",
      "\"While the justice minister parades around in overfunded facilities, other (prison) services are suffering,\" they said in a joint statement.",
      "Saih said there had been reports of saw blades found inside the Dijon prison, and that staff had \"been warning about the risk of a jail break for months.\" He called for more staff and better equipment, including \"gratings that cannot be sawn through.\"",

      "With commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov at the controls of the Soyuz MS-28/74S spacecraft, flanked on his left by flight engineer Sergey Mikaev and on the right by Williams, the crew's Soyuz 2.1a booster roared to life at 4:27 a.m. Eastern and smoothly climbed away from the Russian-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Nine minutes and 45 seconds later, the Soyuz spacecraft was released from the booster's upper stage, its two solar wings unfolded and the crew set off in pursuit of the space station. Three hours later, they caught up with the orbital outpost and moved in for docking at the lab's Earth-facing Rassvet module at 7:34 a.m. Eastern.",
      "Williams, a former volunteer fire fighter and emergency medical technician who went on to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when he was selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "He and flight engineer Mikaev were making their first space flight on Thursday, while Kud-Sverchkov is a seasoned veteran who logged 185 days aboard the space station in 2020-2021.",
      "\"It's a really great crew,\" Williams said in a NASA interview. \"Sergey and Sergey are both just absolutely wonderful people, really kind, super interested, super intellectually curious, which is really fun. Had a lot of really, really great discussions, just talking and talking about things.",
      "\"It's been been wonderful to both spend some time with them over in Star City, and also to be able to spend some time with them in Houston through our training.\"",
      "The Soyuz MS-28 crew is replacing Soyuz MS-27/73S commander Sergey  Ryzhikov, flight engineer Alexey Zubritsky and NASA astronaut Jonny Kim,  who were launched to the space station last April. They plan to return  to Earth on Dec. 9 to wrap up their eight-month stay on the ISS.",

They launched atop a SpaceX  Falcon 9 rocket last August and plan to come home in February or March,  after their replacements \u2014 Crew 12 \u2014 arrive.",
      "All 11 station  fliers planned to gather for a traditional welcome aboard video call to  mission managers and family back in Moscow before a safety briefing and  the start of familiarization with the space station's complex systems.",
      "Williams, an Eagle Scout with a private pilot's license, is a standout among super achievers.",
      "After  graduating from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree in  physics, he was doing radio astronomy research on the way to a  Ph.D. and, \"down the street from my house, there was a volunteer fire  department. And I was like, oh, that sounds like something that could be  kind of like fun and interesting to do.\"",
      "\"So I started  volunteering. Got trained as an EMT and a firefighter, and started just  sort of doing that on a volunteer basis. And I found that I really liked  it. I got a lot of satisfaction out of knowing that ... at the end of  the shift, I would have really made a very direct and immediate positive  impact on somebody's life.\"",
      "He kept that up throughout graduate  school. Then, as he was winding up his doctorate in astrophysics,  Williams said he ran into a doctor he knew at a party who told him there  was \"a big need for physicists in medicine, in particular, in radiation  oncology, where we use radiation to treat cancer.\"",
      "He talked with a few other people, including one who had been an astronomer before switching to medical physics, and \"I was struck by how much of what I knew and had learned as an astronomer would actually be useful and apply very directly to medicine.\"",
      "\"A lot of the math behind (medical) imaging is the exact same math that actually you use in a radio telescope to make an image,\" Williams said. \"It was kind of neat to see that image processing techniques that I'd used as (a radio astronomer) actually carried over pretty directly into medicine.\"",
      "At the time of his selection as an astronaut, Williams was on the staff at Harvard Medical School as a clinical physicist and researcher. He is the second member of the 2021 class of astronauts to fly in space, getting assigned to the Soyuz MS-28 mission shortly after finishing astronaut candidate training.",
      "He said the training for launch on a Russian spacecraft was difficult, primarily because of the travel required. He credited his wife, Aubrey, with keeping the family's life on an even keel throughout.",
      "As for what he looks forward to during his eight-month stay in space, Williams repeated a familiar theme.",
      "\"I've got a lot of different goals, but I think the biggest one, and the thing I'm most excited about, is to truly be able to put my training into practice and to do a really good job to push forward the science and research that we're doing on on the space station.\"",
      "\"I think it's incredibly important. I think it's incredibly interesting and incredibly inspiring, and I feel really lucky to have the opportunity to contribute to that.\"",

      "Bloomberg on Tuesday night published another transcript of an Oct. 14 phone call between Witkoff and Ushakov in which Witkoff appeared to coach Ushakov on how to negotiate with Mr. Trump, and that Russians expected the proposal between Witkoff and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner to be friendly to them.",
      "\"Now, me to you, I know what it's going to take to get a peace deal done: Donetsk and maybe a land swap somewhere,\" Witkoff said, according to the transcript. \"But I'm saying instead of talking like that, let's talk more hopefully because I think we're going to get to a deal here. And I think Yuri, the president will give me a lot of space and discretion to get to the deal.\"",

      "\"No, but it's a standard thing, you know, because he's got to sell this to Ukraine,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He's got to sell Ukraine to Russia. That's what he's that's what a dealmaker does. You got to say, look, they want this. You got to convince him of this. You know, that's a very standard form of negotiation. I haven't heard it, but I heard it was standard negotiation. And I would imagine he's saying the same thing to Ukraine, because each party has to give and take.\"",

    "summary": "The discovery could cast some doubt on the status of Lucy's species as the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the\u00a0species of the famous Lucy, scientists said Wednesday.",
      "The discovery is the latest twist in the tale of human evolution and could even cast some doubt on the status of Lucy's species, Australopithecus afarensis, as the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens.",
      "Until the foot was discovered in Burtele in northeastern Ethiopia in 2009, Lucy's species was thought to be the only human relative living in the area more than three million years ago.",
      "But the appendage clearly does not belong to Lucy's species because it has an opposable toe \u2014 similar to a thumb \u2014 allowing its owner to grab onto tree branches like apes.",
      "The team of scientists who found the mystery foot went on to name a new species, Australopithecus deyiremeda, in 2015 based on some roughly 3.4-million-year-old jaw bones found in Burtele.",
      "The announcement was met with some skepticism in scientific circles. Due to the scarcity of fossils, attempts to add a new branch to the human family tree usually provoke fierce debate.",
      "The team was also unable to say that the foot bones \u2014 dubbed the Burtele foot \u2014 belonged to their new species.",
      "Now, in a study published Tuesday called \"Mystery owner of African hominin foot identified,\" the scientists announced that new fossils including a jawbone with 12 teeth found at the site show that the foot was that of A. deyiremeda.",
      "\"We have no doubt about the Burtele foot belonging to the same species as these teeth and the jaw,\" lead study author, Yohannes Haile-Selassie of Arizona State University, told AFP.",
      "The research also revealed more details about this species, offering further clues about who could have been the true ancestor of us Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Co-existence is deep in our ancestry\"",
      "A CT scan of the teeth suggested that A. deyiremeda was more primitive than its cousin Lucy, the study said.",
      "Isotope analysis of the teeth meanwhile showed that its diet consisted mainly of leaves, fruit and nuts of trees.",
      "The grasping big toe also suggested this human relative spent more time in the trees. Big toes played an important role in human evolution, allowing our ancestors to leave the trees behind and walk on two legs.",
      "A lingering question about A. deyiremeda was how it could have co-existed with Lucy's species at the same place and time, Haile-Selassie said.",
      "The new research suggests that the former spent its time in the forest, more likely eating from trees, while the latter spent more time on the ground, a difference that allowed them to live together.",
      "It also demonstrates that \"co-existence is deep in our ancestry\", Haile-Selassie emphasised.",
      "Earlier this year, in the same region where was Lucy was discovered, archaeologists found 3,000-million-year-old knives that are believed to be some of the first tools ever used on Earth.\u00a0 Rick Potts, the director of the Smithsonian's human origins program and the leader of research on the peninsula, told CBS News that discovery can\u00a0help frame humans' existence\u00a0on the planet.",
      "\"We are the last biped standing, as I call it,\" Potts said. \"All of those other ways of life became extinct. And so that gives us a lot to think about, and it draws attention to the fragility of life, even in our own journey through time.\"",
      "New technologies have made the sites easier to date, and new discoveries across eastern Africa have refined researchers' understanding of human roots. Researchers knew that modern homo sapiens emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago, but it wasn't until recently that they understood that their hominin ancestors began walking on two legs at least 6 million years ago.",
      "Search for the identity of our true ancestor",
      "John McNabb, a paleolithic archaeologist at the UK's University of Southampton not involved in the study, praised the new research.",
      "\"There will always be sceptics, but I think these new finds, and their validation of older ones, will help many researchers to be more accepting of A. deyiremeda,\" he told AFP.",
      "It also \"adds a new player into the mix\" in the search for the identity of our true ancestor, McNabb added.",
      "Because A. deyiremeda was more primitive and had a less human-like foot than Lucy, it is unlikely to dethrone her as the prime suspect in this search, both scientists agreed.",
      "But the discovery \"opens this possibility that we might still find more species within that time period because it looks like the Australopiths were experimenting with bipedality,\" or walking on two legs, Haile-Selassie said.",
      "\"Could there be another species which could be a better candidate to be the ancestor of the genus Homo?\" he asked.",
      "\"We don't know -- it depends on what we find.\"",

    "summary": "The budget will be allocated over eight years as part of the island's strategy to deter a China's threats of invasion",
    "story": [
      "Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te announced a $40 billion budget for arms purchases on Wednesday. The plans include building an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome, as the U.S. pressures the island to increase its defense spending.",
      "According to the leader, this budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033, and comes after Lai already pledged to raise defense spending to 5% of the island's GDP, as part of his strategy amid China's threats of invasion.",
      "\"China's threats to Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific region are escalating,\" Lai said on Wednesday. \"Recently, various types of military intrusions, maritime gray zones and disinformation campaigns have been occurring in Japan, the Philippines and around the Taiwan Strait, causing deep unease and distress to all parties in the region.\"",
      "\"Taiwan, as the most important and most critical part of the first island chain, must demonstrate our determination and take on a greater responsibility in self-defense,\" he said, referring to the string of islands stretching from Japan's East China Sea through the Philippines in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Last week, Japan said that it\u00a0scrambled aircraft after detecting a suspected Chinese drone near its southern island of Yonaguni, which is close to Taiwan.",
      "Currently, Taiwan has set an increase in its defense budget to 3.3% of its GDP for 2026, allocating $949.5 billion Taiwan dollars ($31.18 billion). President Donald Trump has demanded Taiwan raise its defense spending to as much as 10% of GDP, a proportion well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend.",
      "The U.S. State Department on Wednesday said it welcomes Taiwan's budget announcement and \"supports Taiwan's acquisition of critical defense capabilities, commensurate with the threat it faces.\"",
      "It also said it welcomes commitments by Lai's administration to increase defense spending to at least 5% of GDP by 2030, \"which demonstrates resolve to strengthen Taiwan's self-defense capabilities.\"",
      "Taiwan, a self-ruled island, is claimed by China. In recent years, China has deployed warplanes, navfy ships and drones toward the island on a daily basis in military exercises as part of its efforts to exert pressure.",
      "Wellington Koo, Taiwan's defense minister, said Wednesday the $40 billion is an upper limit for the special budget and that it will be used to buy precision-strike missiles and work toward the joint development and procurement between Taiwan and the U.S. of equipment and systems.",
      "Lai also said his government would focus on finding ways to increase its defense against Beijing's \"psychological warfare\" as China attempts to \"weaken our unity.\" He said the government will monitor and increase public awareness of China's interference attempts during major events and elections.",

They fell ill on Nov. 12 and went to a hospital by taxi for treatment before returning to the hotel. They became sick again\u00a0the following day and were taken to the hospital by ambulance.",
      "The children \u2014 Kadir Muhammet, 6, and Masal, 3 \u2014 died that day. Their mother, Cigdem, died on Nov. 14, while their father, Servet, died on Nov. 17.",
      "A preliminary report submitted to the prosecutor's office found there was phosphine gas, an insecticide metabolite, on towels, masks and swab samples taken from various parts of the hotel room, Anadolu Agency reported late Tuesday.",
      "The autopsy also confirmed the family had not been poisoned by food, ruling out initial suspicions of street food consumed during their tour of the city.",
      "Two other tourists staying at the hotel suffered nausea and vomiting and were hospitalized, Anadolu reported.",

    "story": [
      "Update: A Russian government spokesperson said Wednesday it's \"premature\" to say resolution is close. Read more here.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that Ukraine's government had \"agreed to a peace deal\" brokered by the Trump administration to stop Russia's nearly four-year assault. The American official and Ukraine's national security adviser Rustem Umerov said a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Umerov voiced optimism that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could travel to the U.S. before the end of November to finalize an agreement. CBS News was first to report on Sunday that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Zelenskyy.",
      "\"The Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal,\" the U.S. official told CBS News. \"There are some minor details to be sorted out but they have agreed to a peace deal.\"",
      "The news came as U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was in Abu Dhabi to meet with Russian officials, two U.S. officials and two diplomatic sources who were not authorized to speak publicly told CBS News. A fifth source with knowledge of the talks also confirmed Driscoll's presence in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Taking to Truth Social\u00a0on Tuesday afternoon, President Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"",
      "The president said he directed his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and that Driscoll would meet with the Ukrainians.",
      "\"I will be briefed on all progress made, along with Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages.\"",
      "Later Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that \"we're making progress.\" Asked what points of disagreement remain, he said, \"standard things,\" but \"people are starting to realize it's a good deal for both parties.\"",
      "On Tuesday morning, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u00a0wrote on X, \"Over the past week, the United States has made tremendous progress towards a peace deal by bringing both Ukraine and Russia to the table. There are a few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out and will require further talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Russia, the invading force, to what was agreed to in Abu Dhabi, and there were no details from U.S. or Ukrainian officials about what is in the latest proposal. Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which include U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all together at the same time.",
      "Speaking earlier on Tuesday, veteran Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that while Russia \"appreciates the U.S.' position, which is taking the initiative in resolving the Ukrainian conflict,\" Moscow \"operates professionally, not leaking information before formal agreements are reached ... Russia expects the U.S. to inform it of the results of consultations with Ukraine and Europe in the near future.\"",
      "Lavrov stressed that, while Russia was still waiting to receive \"from our American colleagues\" an updated version of the peace proposal, Moscow expected it to include basic tenets agreed between Presidents Trump and Putin during their August meeting in Alaska.",
      "\"Key proposals of Trump's plan are based on understandings reached in Anchorage,\" Lavrov said. He said those principles were \"reflected in the plan\" proposed last week by the White House, \"which we welcomed \u2014 President Putin said that.\"",
      "\"We are ready to discuss concrete formulations because there are a whole row of questions that need to be clarified,\" Lavrov said, adding: \"If there will be no spirit and letter of Anchorage on the key understandings that we have fixated, then it will be a different situation in principle.\"",
      "Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which involve U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all meeting together at the same time.",
      "Umerov also\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0that the country's negotiators had \"reached a common understanding on the core terms\" of an agreement discussed among U.S., European and Ukrainian officials in Geneva over the weekend.",
      "\"We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps. We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine's President to the U.S. at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump,\" Umerov said.",
      "A Trump administration official said there was no agreement for Zelenskyy to come to the U.S. as of late Tuesday morning, but that if a meeting does happen in the coming days, it could take place at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "A U.S. military official in Abu Dhabi told CBS News Driscoll spent hours negotiating Tuesday with Russian representatives, going in and out of meetings all day.",
      "\"We remain very optimistic,\" the official said. \"Secretary Driscoll is optimistic. Hopefully, we'll get feedback from the Russians soon. This is moving quick.\"",
      "It is not clear who else is in the U.S. delegation in Abu Dhabi. A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation was also there and has been in contact with Driscoll and his team.",
      "The apparent progress in Abu Dhabi comes amid an intensified push by President Trump to secure a ceasefire in the almost four-year-long Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "A source with knowledge told CBS News that Driscoll was working in Abu Dhabi off of a revised version of the White House's 28-point proposal, following productive negotiations in Geneva.",
      "Over the weekend, Driscoll, Rubio, Witkoff, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and diplomats from Ukraine and European allies attended talks in Geneva, Switzerland. Driscoll's meeting with Russian officials also follows a visit to Ukraine's capital last week.",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, CBS News reported on Sunday.",
      "Last week, CBS News obtained a draft of one Trump administration-backed proposal to end the war. The proposed plan included several provisions that Zelenskyy has rejected in the past, such as a requirement that Ukraine give up its entire Donetsk region \u2014 including parts that aren't occupied by Russia \u2014 and an end to the country's push to join NATO.",
      "There is also an accompanying document related to security guarantees, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday the document specifies that the U.S. intends to offer \"security assurances\" that she said are along the lines of Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which\u00a0commits members to come to the defense of a NATO state that is attacked.",
      "On Saturday, a group of NATO members and other U.S. allies released a joint statement calling the proposed peace plan \"a basis which will require additional work.\"",
      "The White House said in a statement Sunday night that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had \"drafted an updated and refined peace framework\" following the discussions in Geneva. Rubio described one session in Geneva as \"very meaningful\" but added that \"there's still some work left to do, and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed Zelenskyy to reach a deal by Thanksgiving, though Rubio described that deadline as flexible on Sunday.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to believe that he will take the Donetsk region of Ukraine one way or the other \u2014 either through a negotiated settlement or on the battlefield. The Trump administration's negotiations in Geneva began from the premise that Putin is correct.",
      "While that same U.S. official declined to provide a U.S. assessment of whether Ukraine is losing the war in the East, the U.S. official said that the trajectory of the fighting points to Russia taking Donetsk. The official indicated that the Russian progress in the eastern frontline city of Pokrovsk, which is a logistics hub for Ukraine, was not a positive sign for Kyiv's defensive prospects. Russian media often refers to Pokrovsk as the \"gateway\" to Ukraine's industrial Donbas region.",

      "Adam woke up at the hospital six days later and learned that he had been diagnosed with a heart disease called dilated cardiomyopathy, which prevents the heart from pumping blood around the body effectively.",
      "After weeks of recovery and a procedure to have a Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator put in his chest, Adam was finally allowed to go home \u2014 where he was reunited with Polly.",

      "\"A gentle walk after meals helps digestion and reduces reflux,\" he said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Even light activity helps the stomach process food and reduces the pressure that leads to heartburn. No matter how appealing it may seem, Shachner recommends avoiding the post-feast nap.",
      "4. Not knowing your triggers",
      "Some foods and drinks are more likely to cause trouble. Common triggers include fatty or fried dishes, tomato sauces, citrus, chocolate, peppermint, alcohol, coffee and carbonated drinks, according to the doctor.",
      "\"Everyone\u2019s triggers are a little different, so paying attention to which foods cause discomfort is important,\" he added.",
      "Staying upright for at least two to three hours after eating helps the stomach empty more efficiently and prevents acid reflux. (iStock)",
      "5. Ignoring symptoms",
      "An occasional bout of heartburn isn\u2019t usually cause for concern, but if you\u2019re having symptoms two or more times a week, or if over-the-counter remedies stop working, the doctor said it's important to pay attention.",

      "\"That\u2019s when it\u2019s time to see a doctor for a full evaluation,\" he said.",
      "Chronic reflux can signal gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can cause long-term damage if left untreated.",

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., has opened a commanding lead in the New York Republican primary for governor, locking down endorsements from GOP county chairs, state lawmaker and Conservative Party leaders across the state, a consolidation of support that party officials say leaves Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman with virtually no path to the nomination.",
      "Stefanik\u2019s backing now accounts for more than 75% of the New York Republican Party\u2019s weighted vote, an overwhelming advantage that makes her the presumptive nominee and would require any rival to petition his or her way onto the ballot.",

Her strong support across the state only continues to grow as she earns more endorsements from prominent GOP leaders, including 40 out of New York\u2019s 45 Conservative Party organizations. New York Republicans are wholly united behind the common goal of firing Kathy Hochul to save New York, and they have entrusted their full confidence in Elise to do so.\"",
      "That consolidation extends well beyond the county chairs. Fourteen Republican state senators, including Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt, have endorsed Stefanik for governor. So have 10 county executives from across New York, adding weight from suburban, upstate and rural regions that traditionally anchor GOP turnout.

      "EXCLUSIVE \u2013 Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley \u2013 the South Texas nonprofit long known for its migrant shelter run by Sister Norma Pimentel \u2013 has been suspended from receiving federal funds and now faces a rare six-year debarment after a Department of Homeland Security investigation found major grant violations, according to internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) documents shared exclusively with Fox News Digital.",
      "The action, taken by FEMA on behalf of DHS on Nov. 19-20, follows months of warnings and data reviews that auditors say uncovered sweeping inaccuracies, large gaps in migrant records and significant billing outside federally allowed timeframes.",
      "The suspension applies only to this South Texas affiliate, not to Catholic Charities USA or any other Catholic Charities chapters nationwide.",

      "Investigators also alleged at least 248 instances in which the nonprofit billed the government for services outside the 45-day window federal rules allow for migrants released from DHS custody.",
      "FEMA concluded the group provided assurances that its spreadsheets were accurate and compliant, statements the agency said were \"false\" or \"not entirely truthful,\" according to the documents.",
      "The proposed punishment is unusually severe. While federal debarments typically run three years, DHS is seeking a six-year ban due to what it describes as a pattern of \"pervasive\" problems that spanned multiple programs and multiple years.",

      "Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley (CCRGV) now has 30 days to respond, submit documentation or request a meeting to argue it remains \"presently responsible.\" If it does not, the six-year ban would likely go into effect.",
      "The DHS findings center heavily on migrant intake data the nonprofit submitted to justify millions of dollars in payments through FEMA\u2019s Emergency Food and Shelter-Humanitarian program (EFSP-H) and its newer Shelter Services Program. FEMA said it asked the group to provide names, A-numbers, countries of origin and evidence of DHS encounters for individuals it claimed to assist. In response, the nonprofit told the agency all migrants had A-numbers recorded and asserted its spreadsheets were accurate within a 4.99% margin of error.",

      "Auditors said the reality was far different. In sample sets reviewed by the agency, A-numbers were frequently missing, truncated to four digits, or replaced with phone numbers and other stray entries. Error rates reached 21%, 26% and 42% across three spreadsheets, the documents show. When FEMA tested 100 names, it could not find 61 of them in DHS systems at all.",
      "Investigators also stressed the Rio Grande chapter's 45-day rule violations. Under federal guidelines, NGOs may only bill for food, shelter or transport for migrants within 45 days of their release from DHS custody.",
      "FEMA told the organization it found at least 248 cases where billing dates occurred after that window had closed, raising concerns that federal dollars were used for services outside what the law allows. The agency wrote that such activity could amount to \"potential criminal activity,\" though DHS has not said whether it plans to refer the case for criminal review.",

FEMA said corrective-action plans were copied forward almost verbatim year to year, without meaningful improvements.",
      "Catholic leaders have recently pushed back against efforts to cut funding. Pope Leo XIV praised Catholic Charities USA this fall as \"agents of hope,\" commending its 168 agencies for decades of work with migrants, refugees and the poor.",
      "Pimentel, who leads the Rio Grande Valley branch, has for years been a national figure in migrant ministry. Her Humanitarian Respite Center once processed more than 1,500 migrants per day at the height of mass crossings. She has been publicly praised by the Vatican for her humanitarian work and has spoken out against a return to the Remain in Mexico policy, saying families forced to wait in Mexico suffered \"tremendously.\"",
      "But her organization has also been a political focal point. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has pursued cases against several Catholic migrant shelters, accusing them of encouraging illegal immigration and operating illegal \"stash houses,\" including his suit against Annunciation House in El Paso. A judge earlier this year blocked Paxton from deposing Sister Norma in that separate matter.",
      "The suspension now places the Rio Grande Valley operation under simultaneous federal and state scrutiny. It is not yet clear whether other local shelters or municipal partners can absorb the South Texas caseload if the nonprofit ultimately loses federal funds. CCRGV currently serves far fewer migrants than in prior years, but remains one of the region\u2019s key intake points.",

In 2024, just weeks after the presidential election, Kirk delivered a Thanksgiving statement on the importance of being thankful. Communio president JP De Gance says it is a message that is still relevant in 2025.",
      "\"I think Charlie's message repeats those messages of Thanksgivings long ago when we were at different times, we've had setbacks as a country, we have had sufferings as a country, we had losses as a country and the message of Thanksgiving is that in all things we can be grateful,\" De Gance told Fox News Digital on Tuesday. \"We can look to God above, and thank him both for all of our many blessings and then even, you know, it's through our sufferings that we so frequently grow to become better men and women.\"",

      "What winds up being served for Thanksgiving dinner, who shows up \u2014 or doesn't \u2014 and whether politics gets mentioned, can reflect broader shifts in ideology and culture.

Costs were a primary reason for the shift, along with wanting to spend more time with family and not worry about cooking.",

      "The length of time spent at the dinner table can also be quite telling.",
      "In 2018, university researchers analyzed smartphone location data pings and determined that \"politically diverse\" Thanksgiving dinners tended to be significantly shorter than those dinners involving a family of entirely like-minded individuals. The study, conducted in 2018, showed the average dinner was 30 minutes to 50 minutes shorter at tables full of politically diverse folks, while a study measuring the same thing in 2020 found politically diverse dinners to be about 24 minutes shorter on average.",

      "It is hard to say overall whether Thanksgiving diners have gotten longer or shorter, but according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service, people typically spend around 128 minutes on meal preparation and cleanup, 89 minutes on eating and drinking, and about 148 minutes socializing, according to a long-term analysis conducted between 2003 and 2015.",
      "According to the National Turkey Federation, 94% of Americans plan to celebrate Thanksgiving.",

      "The turkey product brand noted that 55% of Americans were \"open to trying Thanksgiving recipes from different cultures,\" particularly via side dishes.",
      "Even the changing treatment of the turkeys used for the presidential pardon has shifted slightly over the years.",
      "In the early-2000s, turkeys that were presented were sometimes unnamed, or treated more anonymously, but more recently it has become standard to dub the turkeys with names and humanize them a bit. That trend also mirrors a shift toward better care for the pardoned turkeys over the years."

    "story": [
      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "Android users have been dealing with a steady rise in financial malware for years. Threats like Hydra, Anatsa and Octo have shown how attackers can take over a phone, read everything on the screen and drain accounts before you even notice anything wrong. Security updates have helped slow some of these strains, but malware authors keep adapting with new tricks.",
      "The latest variant spotted in circulation is one of the most capable yet. It can silence your phone, take screenshots of banking apps, read clipboard entries, and even automate crypto wallet transactions. This threat is now known as Android BankBot YNRK, and it is far more advanced than typical mobile malware.",

      "HOW ANDROID MALWARE LETS THIEVES ACCESS YOUR ATM CASH",
      "Android banking malware is getting harder to spot as attackers use new tricks to take over phones and drain accounts. (Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "BankBot YNRK hides inside fake Android apps that appear legitimate when installed. In the samples analyzed by researchers at Cyfirma, the attackers used apps that impersonated official digital ID tools. Once installed, the malware begins profiling the device by collecting details such as brand, model and installed apps. It checks whether the device is an emulator to avoid automated security analysis. It also maps known models to screen resolutions, which helps it tailor its behavior to specific phones.",
      "To blend in, the malware can disguise itself as Google News. It does this by changing its app name and icon, then loading the real news.google.com site inside a WebView. While the victim believes the app is genuine, the malware quietly runs its background services.",
      "One of its first actions is to mute audio and notification alerts. This prevents victims from hearing incoming messages, alarms or calls that could signal unusual account activity. It then requests access to Accessibility Services. If granted, this allows the malware to interact with the device interface just like a user. From that point onward, it can press buttons, scroll through screens and read everything displayed on the device.",
      "BankBot YNRK also adds itself as a Device Administrator app. This makes it harder to remove and helps it restart itself after a reboot. To maintain long-term access, it schedules recurring background jobs that relaunch the malware every few seconds as long as the phone is connected to the internet.",
      "What does the malware steal",
      "Once the malware receives commands from its remote server, it gains near-complete control of the phone. It sends device information and installed app lists to the attackers, then receives a list of financial apps it should target. This list includes major banking apps used in Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and India, along with several global cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "With Accessibility permissions enabled, the malware can read everything shown on the screen. It captures UI metadata such as text, view IDs and button positions. This helps it reconstruct a simplified version of any app's interface. Using this data, it can enter login details, swipe through menus or confirm transfers. It can also set text inside fields, install or remove apps, take photos, send SMS, turn call forwarding on and open banking apps in the background while the screen appears inactive.",
      "In cryptocurrency wallets, the malware acts like an automated bot. It can open apps such as Exodus or MetaMask, read balances and seed phrases, dismiss biometric prompts, and carry out transactions. Because all actions happen through Accessibility, the attacker never needs your passwords or PINs. Anything visible on the screen is enough.",
      "The malware also monitors the clipboard, so if users copy OTPs, account numbers or crypto keys, the data is immediately sent to the attackers. With call forwarding enabled, incoming bank verification calls can be silently redirected. All of these actions happen within seconds of the malware activating.",

The Play Store is not perfect, but it offers scanning, app verification and regular take-downs that greatly reduce the risk of installing infected apps.",
      "System updates often patch security issues that attackers exploit to bypass protections. Updating your apps is just as important, since outdated versions may contain weaknesses. Turn on automatic updates so that your device stays protected without you having to check manually.",
      "A password manager helps you create long, unique passwords for every account. It also saves you from typing passwords directly into apps, which reduces the chance of malware capturing them from your clipboard or keystrokes. If one password gets exposed, the rest of your accounts remain safe.",

It cannot stop malware that takes over your device, but it significantly limits how far an attacker can go with stolen credentials.",
      "GOOGLE ISSUES WARNING ON FAKE VPN APPS",
      "Malware often abuses permissions such as Accessibility or Device Admin because they allow deep control over your phone. Check your settings to see which apps have these permissions and remove anything that looks unfamiliar. Also, look through your installed apps and uninstall any tool or service you do not remember adding. Regular reviews help you spot threats early before they can steal data.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "BankBot YNRK is one of the most capable Android banking threats discovered recently. It combines device profiling, strong persistence, UI automation and data theft to gain full control over a victim's financial apps. Because much of its activity relies on Accessibility permissions, a single tap from the user can give attackers complete access. Staying safe means avoiding unofficial APKs, reviewing installed apps regularly and being cautious of any sudden request to enable special permissions.",

The FDA has approved its first human trial built to test whether its fully implantable device can restore speech for people with paralysis. This milestone gives the Austin company a strong position in a competitive space, shaping the future of neural technology.",
      "Paradromics received Investigational Device Exemption status for the Connect-One Early Feasibility Study using its Connexus BCI.

      "BRAIN IMPLANT TURNS THOUGHTS INTO DIGITAL COMMANDS",
      "How the brain implant works",
      "The implant uses hundreds of tiny electrodes to capture detailed signals from the motor cortex where the brain forms sounds and shapes words. (Paradromics)",
      "Paradromics developed a fully implantable speech-focused brain device called the Connexus BCI. The company designed it to capture detailed neural signals that support real-time communication for people who cannot speak. This system uses high-resolution electrodes and an implanted wireless setup to record activity from individual neurons involved in forming speech.",
      "The Connexus BCI has a titanium body with more than 400 platinum-iridium electrodes placed just below the brain's surface. Each electrode is thinner than a human hair. These electrodes record neural firing patterns in the motor cortex, where the brain controls the lips, tongue and larynx.",
      "Surgeons place the implant under the skin and connect it with a thin cable to a wireless transceiver in the chest. That transceiver sends data through a secure optical link to a second transceiver worn on the body. The external unit powers the system with inductive charging similar to wireless phone chargers.",
      "The collected signals then move to a compact computer that runs advanced language models. It analyzes the neural activity and converts it into text or into a synthetic voice based on the user's past recordings.",
      "Inside the Paradromics BCI human trial",
      "The trial begins with two participants. Each person will receive one 7.5-millimeter-wide electrode array placed 1.5 millimeters into the part of the motor cortex that controls the lips, tongue and larynx. During training sessions, the volunteers will imagine speaking sentences while the device learns the neural signatures of each sound.",
      "This is the first BCI trial that formally targets real-time synthetic voice generation. The study will also test whether the system can detect imagined hand movements and translate those signals into cursor control.",
      "If early results meet expectations, the trial could expand to ten people. Some participants may receive two implants to capture a richer set of signals.",
      "HOW A TINY RETINAL IMPLANT IS HELPING PEOPLE REGAIN THEIR SIGHT",
      "Cyberguy reached out to Paradromics for comment and received the following statement:",
      "Researchers are testing whether Paradromics\u2019 fully implantable brain device can turn neural activity into real-time speech for people with paralysis. (Synchron)",
      "\"Communication is a fundamental human need. For people with severe motor impairment, the inability to express themselves with family and friends or request basic needs makes living difficult. The FDA approved clinical study for the Connexus Brain-Computer Interface is the first step toward a future where commercially available neurotech can restore the ability to naturally speak and seamlessly use a computer.",
      "The fully implanted Connexus BCI is designed to record brain signals from individual neurons, capturing the massive amounts of data required for high performance applications like speech restoration and complex mouse and keyboard hand actions. Built from proven medical-grade materials, Connexus BCI is engineered for daily long-term use, backed by more than three years of stable pre-clinical recordings.",
      "How Paradromics compares to other BCI companies",
      "Paradromics joins Synchron and Neuralink at the front of the implanted BCI race. Synchron uses a stent-like device placed in a blood vessel to record broad neural patterns. Neuralink uses flexible threads with many recording sites to capture high-bandwidth signals from individual neurons.",
      "Paradromics sits in the middle of these two approaches by using a fully implantable system that still captures single-neuron detail. Researchers believe this design may offer long-term stability for everyday communication.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could make a major difference for people who have lost their ability to speak after ALS, stroke or spinal cord injury. A system that converts thought into speech could help them talk in real time and regain independence. It may also allow hands-free computer control, which can improve daily living.",
      "If the trial succeeds, the tech could change how assistive communication devices work and speed up patient access to advanced tools.",
      "During the trial, volunteers imagine speaking while advanced AI models learn their neural patterns and convert those signals into text or a synthetic voice. (Paradromics)",

That service sold ready-made Microsoft login copies used to steal more than 5,000 sets of credentials, including accounts tied to over 20 US healthcare organizations. Subscribers paid as little as $12 a day to send thousands of phishing emails.",

      "What makes QRR so effective",
      "QRR uses about 1,000 domains. Many are real sites that were parked or compromised, which helps the pages pass as legitimate. The URLs also follow a predictable pattern that can look normal to users at a glance.",
      "The kit includes automated filtering that detects bots. It sends scanners to harmless pages and sends real people to the credential-harvesting site. Attackers can manage campaigns inside a control panel that logs traffic and activity. These features let them scale up quickly without technical skill.",

    "story": [
      "Former White House chief information officer Theresa Payton joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how OpenTable is surveilling its users and Google's warning to VPN users about a recent security threat.",
      "Maybe you order sparkling water, start every meal with an appetizer or prefer dining right when the restaurant opens. You might not track these habits. OpenTable might.",
      "Some restaurants are now seeing new AI-assisted tags about diners when they book a table. These tags can note drink patterns, spending levels, review habits and last-minute cancellations.",
      "These insights surfaced after Kat Menter, a host at a Michelin-starred restaurant who posts about food under the name Eating Out Austin, spotted the new \"AI-assisted\" tags at work. She shared a look at the system in a TikTok video that quickly caught attention. Media outlets then confirmed the test with additional restaurants.",

      "WOULD YOU EAT AT A RESTAURANT RUN BY AI?",
      "The AI tags pull from reservation and POS data to highlight patterns like drink choices, spending ranges and dining habits across visits. (Jeffrey Greenberg/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "How OpenTable gathers this information",
      "OpenTable integrates with POS (Point of Sale) platforms such as Toast or Epos. These systems handle orders, payments and timing during a meal. When your contact details match your OpenTable account, the platform can connect your visit to your profile.",
      "This can include arrival time, general order details, time spent and bill totals. Reporting shows that these items help OpenTable generate AI summaries of non-identifiable guest data when the restaurant uses a supported POS system and has enabled data sharing. You do not need to book through OpenTable for this to happen. You only need an account and matching contact information.",
      "Some users who pulled their data through OpenTable's privacy request form saw very limited information. Basic contact details and a list of past reservations were the main items. That suggests the insight level depends on which restaurants use POS integrations and how long they have used them.",
      "Why restaurants want these insights",
      "Restaurants have tracked guest preferences for years. Staff may note favorite dishes or preferred seating. They may watch for frequent lateness or recurring celebrations. This helps them shape a smooth visit.",
      "OpenTable's AI-summarized guest insights aim to offer a simplified version of these notes. They highlight drink categories, spending ranges or behavior patterns. However, Menter notes the tags can be off base. A single business dinner can mark someone as a high spender. Eating with friends who order cocktails can make a person look like a cocktail lover. Because of this, Menter treats the tags as loose suggestions rather than reliable signals.",
      "THAT'S NOT A HUMAN TALKING TO YOU IN THE FAST FOOD DRIVE-THRU",
      "How the AI works",
      "OpenTable says the AI does not process personal guest data. Instead, it is employed for high-level classification and categorization of large, anonymized data sets. For instance, the AI analyzes various point-of-sale descriptions (like \"glass of cabernet\") to consistently categorize them as \"red wine,\" \"white wine,\" etc., without ever interacting with specific guest profiles.",
      "The platform says these insights can help staff suggest dishes or set a relaxed pace. OpenTable also says the use of POS information depends on the privacy settings you choose, and you can review, adjust or opt out of data sharing at any time. Still, the privacy policy uses broad terms like dining preferences.",
      "A TikTok video from a Michelin-starred restaurant host first revealed the AI-assisted diner tags now being tested in OpenTable\u2019s Pro tools. (iStock)",
      "\"Guest insights are the engine of personalization, allowing restaurants to optimize their service and deliver the kind of thoughtful hospitality that both benefits the business and offers a special experience for the diner,\" an OpenTable representative told CyberGuy. \"These insights come from a mix of sources \u2014 including OpenTable, our restaurant partners, and POS partners \u2014 and are limited to non-confidential information.\"",
      "\"They might help a server suggest a dish you\u2019ll love or recognize that you prefer a more relaxed dining pace,\" the representative said. \"We also share these insights across our network so restaurants can learn and improve the hospitality experience for everyone, not just individual guests. You\u2019re in charge of what data you share. Through your OpenTable preferences and settings, you can review, adjust, or opt out of data sharing at any time. What we share with restaurants is guided by the choices you\u2019ve made in your privacy preferences.\"",
      "What data gets shared and how to limit it",
      "If a diner is opted in, OpenTable shares your name, contact details, party size and special requests with the restaurant you book. The company also confirms that participating restaurants share POS data with OpenTable. This can include items ordered, bill totals and how long you stayed. OpenTable then turns this into aggregated insights.",
      "RESTAURANT INSIDERS SHARE THE SECRETS OF SNAGGING HARD-TO-GET RESERVATIONS",
      "OpenTable reportedly shares insights across its broader restaurant network. This applies only where enabled and only for restaurants on the OpenTable Pro plan, and is a feature in Beta.",

These AI-assisted tags give restaurants extra insight, but they also remind you how much of your behavior gets logged behind the scenes. By checking your privacy settings and turning off POS data sharing, you keep more control over what follows you from one meal to the next. Staying aware makes a big difference. It helps you enjoy your night out without wondering who's tracking your habits or how your data might appear on a screen. With a few quick choices, you can shape what restaurants see and keep your preferences truly personal.",

      "Google officially shut down remote control features for first and second generation Nest Learning Thermostats last month. Many owners assumed the devices would stop talking to Google once the company removed smart functions.",

      "Researcher finds unexpected data uploads from old Nest devices",
      "Security researcher Cody Kociemba uncovered this quiet data flow after digging into the backend as part of a repair bounty challenge run by FULU, a right-to-repair group cofounded by electronics repair expert and YouTuber Louis Rossmann. The challenge asked developers to restore lost smart features for unsupported Nest devices. Kociemba teamed up with the open-source community and created No Longer Evil, software that brings smart functionality back to these aging thermostats.",

      "Researcher Cody Kociemba uncovered the ongoing data uploads while building a tool to restore smart functions. (Google)",

      "Ambient light data",
      "Kociemba says the volume of logs was extensive. He turned off the incoming data because he never expected the devices to remain connected to Google after the shutdown.",
      "Google previously said unsupported models will \"continue to report logs for issue diagnostics.\" However, Kociemba points out that Google cannot use that data to help customers anymore because support is fully discontinued. That makes the continued data flow even more puzzling.",
      "AI FLAW LEAKED GMAIL DATA BEFORE OPENAI PATCH",
      "CyberGuy contacted Google for comment, and a spokesperson provided us with the statement,",
      "\"The Nest Learning Thermostat (1st and 2nd Gen) is no longer supported in the Nest and Home apps, but temperature and scheduling adjustments can still be made directly on the unit. These devices will soon be unpaired and removed from all user accounts. Diagnostic logs, which are not tied to a specific user account, will continue to be sent to Google for service and issue tracking. Users who prefer to stop providing these logs can simply disconnect their device from Wi-Fi via the on-device settings menu.\"",
      "The thermostats continue reporting temperature, motion and light data even though official support has ended.",
      "Why this discovery matters",
      "Google cut access to remote control, security updates, software updates and status checks through the Nest and Google Home apps. Owners can no longer rely on the devices for key smart features. Yet the thermostats still push data to Google, creating a one-way connection that helps the company more than the customer.",
      "Users do not benefit from the logs because support has been discontinued. Google cannot use these logs to diagnose problems or offer help. That raises questions about transparency and user choice for people who assumed the connection ended.",
      "The FULU bounty that sparked the discovery",
      "FULU's bounty program encouraged developers to build tools that restore functionality to devices abandoned by their makers. After reviewing submissions, FULU awarded Kociemba and another developer known as Team Dinosaur the top bounty of $14,772 for bringing smart features back to early Nest models.",

      "If you keep one of these unsupported Nest thermostats on your network, you can take a few simple steps to protect your privacy. These tips help reduce what the device sends to Google and lower your exposure.",
      "Start by checking what Google has linked to your home devices. Visit myactivity.google.com and look for thermostat logs or events you do not expect.",
      "A guest network keeps the thermostat away from your main devices. This limits what the thermostat can reach and helps prevent broader access.",
      "Some routers let you stop individual devices from sending data to the internet. This cuts off log uploads while still letting the thermostat control heating and cooling.",
      "If the device menu still offers cloud settings, turn off anything related to remote access or online diagnostics. Even partial controls help reduce data flow.",
      "Check your connected devices in your Google settings. Remove any old Nest entries that no longer serve a purpose. This stops leftover links that may still send data.",
      "Some routers send analytics back to the router maker. Turn off cloud diagnostics to reduce the footprint of unsupported smart products.",
      "Unsupported devices lose security updates. If you cannot isolate the thermostat on your network, consider upgrading to a model that still receives patches.",
      "Pro Tip: Reduce your footprint with a data removal service",
      "A data removal service can help you cut down on the amount of personal information available to data brokers. This adds another layer of privacy that supports your smart home security.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Smartphone banking has made life easier, but it has also opened new opportunities for cybercriminals.",
      "Over the past few years, we have seen Android malware steal passwords, intercept OTPs and even take remote control of phones to drain accounts. Some scams focus on fake banking apps, while others rely on phishing messages that trick you into entering sensitive details.",
      "Security researchers have now discovered a new threat that goes a step further. Instead of simply stealing login information, this malware gives thieves the ability to walk up to an ATM and withdraw your money in real time.",

      "Android malware like NGate tricks users into downloading fake banking apps that steal sensitive data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the NGate malware works",
      "The Polish Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT Polska) discovered a new Android malware called NGate that uses NFC activity to access a victim's bank account. This malware monitors contactless payment actions on the victim's phone and forwards all transaction data, including the PIN, directly to a server controlled by attackers. It does not just copy card details. Instead, it waits until the victim taps to pay or performs a verification step, then captures the fresh, one-time authentication codes that modern Visa and Mastercard chips generate.",
      "To pull this off, attackers need to infect the phone first. They typically send phishing messages claiming there is a security problem with the victim's bank account. These messages often push people to download a fake banking app from a non-official source. Once the victim installs it, the app walks them through fake verification prompts and requests permissions that allow it to read NFC activity. As soon as the victim taps their phone or enters their PIN, the malware captures everything the ATM needs to validate a withdrawal.",
      "MANAGE ANDROID APPS WITH THE NEW 'UNINSTALL' BUTTON",
      "Once installed, the malware captures NFC tap-to-pay codes and PINs the moment the victim uses their phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What attackers do with the stolen data at the ATM",
      "The attackers rely on speed. The one-time codes generated during an NFC transaction are valid for only a short period. As soon as the infected phone captures the data, the information is uploaded to the attacker's server. An accomplice waits near an ATM, holding a device capable of emulating a contactless card. This could be another phone, a smartwatch or custom NFC hardware.",
      "When the data arrives, the accomplice presents the card-emulating device at the ATM. Since the information contains fresh, valid authentication codes and the correct PIN, the machine treats it like a real card. The ATM authorizes the withdrawal because everything appears to match a legitimate transaction. All of this happens without the criminal ever touching the victim's physical card. Everything depends on timing, planning and getting the victim to unknowingly complete the transaction on their own phone.",
      "Criminals use the stolen, time-limited codes at an ATM to make real withdrawals without the victim\u2019s card. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from Android NGate malware",
      "As attacks like NGate become more sophisticated, staying safe comes down to a mix of good digital habits and a few simple tools that protect your phone and your financial data.",
      "Most malicious banking apps spread through direct links sent in texts or emails. These links lead to APK files hosted on random servers. When you install apps only from the Play Store, you get Google's built-in security checks. Play Protect regularly scans apps for malware and removes harmful ones from your device. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices. Even if attackers send convincing messages, avoid installing anything from outside the official store. If your bank wants you to update an app, you will always find it on the Play Store.",
      "One careless tap on a fake bank alert can hand criminals everything they need. Strong antivirus software can stop most threats before they cause damage. It scans new downloads, blocks unsafe links and alerts you when an app behaves in ways that could expose your financial data. Many threats like NGate rely on fake banking apps, so having real-time scanning turned on gives you an early warning if something suspicious tries to install itself.",

      "Security patches fix vulnerabilities that attackers use to hijack permission settings or read sensitive data. Updates also improve how Android monitors NFC and payment activity. Turn on automatic updates for both the operating system and apps, especially banking and payment apps. A fully updated device closes many of the holes that malware tries to exploit.",
      "Phishing attacks often direct you to fake websites or fake app login pages that look identical to the real thing. A password manager saves your credentials and fills them in only when the website or app is authentic. If it refuses to autofill, it is a clear sign that you are on a fake page. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Two-factor authentication gives you a second layer of protection, even if your password is compromised. App-based authenticators are more secure than SMS codes because they cannot be intercepted as easily. For banking apps, enabling 2FA adds friction for attackers trying to perform unauthorized actions. Combined with strong passwords from a password manager, it significantly reduces the chance of account takeover.",
      "Attackers rely on urgency to trick you. They often claim that your card is blocked, your account is frozen or a payment needs verification. These messages push you to act fast and install a fake app. Always pause and check your bank's official channels. Contact the bank through verified customer care numbers or the official app. Never click links or open attachments in unsolicited messages, even if they look legitimate.",
      "Most people install apps and forget about them. Over time, unused apps pile up with unnecessary permissions that increase risk. Open your phone's permission settings and check what each app can access. If a simple tool asks for access to NFC, messages or accessibility features, uninstall it. Attackers exploit these excessive permissions to monitor your activity or capture data without your knowledge.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Cybercriminals are now combining social engineering with the secure hardware features inside modern payment systems. The malware does not break NFC security. Instead, it tricks you into performing a real transaction and steals the one-time codes at that moment. This makes the attack difficult to spot and even harder to reverse once the withdrawal goes through. The best defense is simple awareness. If a bank ever urges you to download an app from outside the Play Store, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Keeping your phone clean is now as important as keeping your physical card safe.",

      "How the DoorDash breach happened",
      "The company traced the incident back to a social engineering attack. An employee fell for a lure that gave hackers access to DoorDash systems.

      "Fake VPN apps are spreading across Android devices by posing as trusted privacy tools. (iStock)",
      "How fake VPN apps lure users",

      "DELETE THE FAKE VPN APP STEALING ANDROID USERS' MONEY",

      "Scammers now use AI tools to design ads, phishing pages and fake brands with alarming speed. This gives them the power to reach large groups of victims with very little effort.",
      "Why malicious VPN apps are spreading",
      "Fake VPN apps remain one of the most effective tools for attackers. These apps request sensitive permissions and often run silently in the background. Once active, they can collect browsing data, cryptocurrency wallet details or private messages.",
      "According to Google, the most dangerous apps pretend to be known enterprise VPNs or premium privacy tools. Many promote themselves through adult ads, push notifications and cloned social media accounts.",
      "How to recognize a genuine VPN app",
      "Google recommends installing VPN services only from trusted sources. In Google Play, legitimate VPNs include a verified VPN badge to show that the app passed an authenticity check.",
      "A real VPN will never ask for access to your contacts, photos or private messages. It will not ask you to sideload updates or follow outside links for installation.",
      "Be careful with free VPN claims. Many free privacy tools rely on excessive data collection or hide malware inside downloadable files.",
      "Ways to stay safe from fake VPN apps",
      "Staying ahead of these fake VPN scams starts with a few smart habits that make your device much harder for attackers to target.",
      "Stick to the Google Play Store. Avoid links from ads, pop-ups or messages that try to rush you. Many fake VPN campaigns depend on off-platform downloads because they cannot pass the Play Store security checks.",
      "Google now includes a special VPN badge that verifies an app has passed an authenticity review. This badge confirms that the developer followed strict guidelines and that the app went through additional screening.",

      "A genuine VPN only needs network-related permissions. If a VPN asks for access to photos, contacts or messages, treat it as a major warning sign. Restrict permissions when possible.",
      "Sideloaded apps bypass Google's security filters. Attackers often hide malware inside APK files or update prompts that promise extra features. If you're unfamiliar with the term, sideloading means installing apps outside the Google Play Store, usually by downloading a file from a website, email or message. These apps never go through Google's safety checks, which makes them far riskier to install.",
      "Fake VPN ads often claim your device is already infected or that your connection is not secure. Real privacy apps do not use panic-based marketing.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake VPN apps are becoming a major threat to Android users as scammers exploit the rising demand for privacy tools and home network security. Attackers hide behind familiar logos, aggressive ads and AI-powered campaigns to push apps that steal data the moment you install them. Staying safe requires careful downloading habits, attention to permissions and a healthy amount of skepticism toward anything that claims instant privacy or premium features for free.",

      "The ambush shooting of two National Guard members near the White House is fueling fresh scrutiny of the vetting of Afghan evacuees, with former FBI special agent Nicole Parker telling Fox News Digital the screening process during the rushed 2021 withdrawal was essentially a \"free-for-all.\"",
      "Tens of thousands of Afghans were evacuated to the U.S. in the wake of the withdrawal and subsequent Taliban takeover of the country. The chaotic nature of the operation raised concerns at the time from Republicans, and in official reports, that some evacuees were not properly vetted and could have catastrophic consequences.",
      "\"They said it is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode because we've just allowed all of these people into our country,\" Parker told Fox News Digital.",
      "In August 2022, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., revealed that a whistleblower said 324 individuals had entered with derogatory information, while a 2022 report by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) separately found the department failed to properly vet Afghan evacuees entering the U.S., creating potential national security risks.",

      "Parker told Fox News Digital that FBI agents worked with Department of Defense contractors in foreign countries to screen Afghans, but the State Department repeatedly overrode security concerns.",
      "\"There were individuals that were not being recommended to come to the United States, yet they were being overridden by the Biden State Department,\" Parker said. \"Initially, it was a free-for-all and no one was being vetted.\"",
      "The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the claims.",
      "The OIG report noted that during the evacuation, the Pentagon moved Afghan evacuees to a network of temporary staging bases known as \"lily pads\" in countries like Germany, Qatar, Spain and Italy. Evacuees stayed there only days or weeks as U.S. officials attempted rapid screening and collected biographic and biometric data before sending them to the United States.",
      "The inspector general found the lily pads were rushed, understaffed and inconsistent, leading to major documentation gaps, missing records and vetting shortcuts.",
      "Jason Pack, the chief executive officer at Media Rep Global Strategies, a public relations and crisis communications firm, told Fox News Digital that \"it was a massive humanitarian operation, but it also carried unavoidable risk.\"",
      "\"That evacuation moved more than seventy thousand people into the country in a short period of time,\" Pack said. \"Records were scattered, databases were incomplete, and screening teams were processing people at a pace that made perfect vetting impossible. Cases like this force investigators to go back and examine those files with fresh eyes.\"",
      "Under OAW, DHS used humanitarian parole \u2014 normally approved on a case-by-case basis \u2014 to quickly process tens of thousands of Afghans into the U.S., bypassing the special immigrant visa (SIV) and refugee programs, which can take years.",
      "While the administration touted a multilayered process using multiple Pentagon, DHS and FBI databases, the audit found \"critical data\" was not always available and that evacuees were admitted without full vetting.",

      "Parker said it was almost impossible to vet evacuees because they arrived with no verifiable documents or records, leaving nothing to run through intelligence or criminal databases, putting citizens, law enforcement and the National Guard at risk. The two West Virginia National Guard members remain in critical condition after being shot just blocks from the White House.",
      "\"America is full of people we do not know. We don\u2019t know who they are, where they are, or what sleeper cells are here,\" she said.",

      "\"Whatever their cause or motive may be, we should not have to live in fear in the nation's capital, especially by one who came here from a foreign country, and through a process that was so absurd that he came through and was released into this country,\" Pirro said. \"This is what happens in this country when people who are not properly vetted are let in.\"",

      "Meanwhile, a Pentagon inspector general report in February 2022 revealed that at least 50 evacuees were brought to the U.S. whose information indicated \"potentially serious security concerns,\" and that officials were unable to locate dozens with derogatory information.",
      "Hawley also uncovered an August 2021 email directive instructing U.S. officials to prioritize filling evacuation flights and to \"err on the side of excess,\" allowing passengers to board even if their qualifications were not completely uncertain.

      "Pope Leo XIV is using his very first foreign trip to make a statement that blends symbolism with geopolitical consequences. By landing in Turkey this morning for the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea and then into Lebanon\u2019s ongoing economic and political freefall, the pope is stepping directly into places where Christianity once flourished.",
      "His presence signals two messages at once: a bid to revive unity among Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant communities, and a warning to regional governments that persecution and instability will not go unnoticed. It\u2019s an early test of how he intends to wield the soft power of the papacy.",
      "Matthew R. Petrusek, Ph.D., senior director of the Word on Fire Institute, told Fox News Digital that the trip sends a clear signal about the priorities of the new pontiff. \"Pope Leo has signaled early in his papacy that one of his primary objectives is to give hope to Christians who live in regions where they face persecution or other difficulties living out their faith. By traveling to Turkey and Lebanon, I think Leo is telling Christians both in those countries and across the globe, \u2018You are not forgotten; the Church stands with you.\u2019\"",

      "In Turkey, he will commemorate the 1700th anniversary of the First Council of Nicaea. The landmark council convened in 325 AD in the ancient city of Nicaea, now Iznik, and produced the Nicene Creed, a central statement of Christian belief shared by Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants.",
      "On Thursday, the pope will fly by helicopter to Iznik for a prayer at the archaeological remains of the basilica where the council met.",
      "Petrusek emphasized the symbolic weight of this moment. \"Christianity is a creedal religion \u2014 it is based on shared, free assent to unchanging doctrines about Jesus Christ and the Church that give consistency and coherence to Christianity around the world. The Nicene Creed forms the backbone of Christian identity.\"",

      "To underline the anniversary, Leo issued an apostolic letter on Nov. 23 titled \"In the Unity of Faith,\" highlighting the Creed\u2019s enduring role in unifying Christian communities. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said the document stresses the relevance of Nicaea\u2019s teachings for Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants today.",
      "Petrusek said the pope\u2019s approach makes a broader statement about unity. \"The Creed includes the words, \u2018I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.\u2019 I believe Pope Leo is also signaling that he wants to do everything within his power, in cooperation with the Holy Spirit, to heal the rifts that, sadly, still prevent Christ\u2019s Church from being \u2018one.\u2019\"",

      "The second half of the journey will take the pope to Lebanon, a country that last hosted a papal visit more than a decade ago. The late Pope Francis had hoped to travel there but was unable to do so due to his declining health.",
      "Lebanon remains home to the largest proportion of Christians in the Middle East, but the population has plummeted due to economic collapse, emigration and political paralysis. The Associated Press reported that the pope will meet political leaders, Christian and Muslim clerics and families affected by overlapping crises.

      "Petrusek said papal visits have a profound emotional impact. \"It is hard to overestimate the positive effect having the pope visit your country has for Catholics, especially those who are suffering because of their faith. It is a reminder that the \u2018Church\u2019 is not an abstraction but, rather, a historical reality that goes back to Jesus Christ himself.\"",
      "He added that the pope\u2019s presence carries a message for governments in the region. \"In addition to his message of hope to the faithful, his presence in these countries communicates to those responsible for persecuting Christians, \u2018Your crimes are not taking place in the dark; the world is watching.\u2019\"",

They call them treaties. We never acknowledged them. We continued to call them documents\u2026 Essentially, Mr. Putin said, \u2018Sign these or there will be other means\u2026\u2019 And we did not sign them.

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s new executive order directing the State and Treasury departments to pursue terrorism designations for specific Muslim Brotherhood chapters marks one of the most significant shifts in U.S. policy toward the movement in decades.",
      "Signed on Nov. 24, it launches the first formal review of Brotherhood branches in Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon under U.S. designation laws and redefines how Washington treats Islamist movements with political and militant wings.",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, praised the move, calling it essential for national security. \"The Muslim Brotherhood and its branches encourage, facilitate and provide resources for conducting jihadist terrorism across the world,\" he said, urging Congress to advance his Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act of 2025.",

      "Supporters of Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood take part in a protest near the Jordanian border with the occupied West Bank, on May 21, 2021. (Khalil Mazraawi/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Washington has long debated whether the Brotherhood is a unified global movement or a loose network of national branches with different agendas and levels of militancy. That dispute stalled previous attempts to designate the group. Trump\u2019s order bypasses that debate and directs federal agencies to examine individual chapters that analysts say already meet the legal thresholds.",
      "Mariam Wahba, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said in a statement that the directive \"replaces years of debate with concrete action\" and forces U.S. agencies to assess Brotherhood entities that function as \"real organizations with leadership structures, financing channels and documented ties to terrorist groups.\" She said the order \"treats Islamist actors according to their behavior, not their branding.\"",
      "Across the Arab world, the Brotherhood has been banned for years. Egypt outlawed it in 2013 after accusing the movement of radicalization and efforts to undermine state institutions. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates designated it soon after, calling it a direct threat to national stability. Bahrain issued similar findings. Jordan dissolved its local chapter this year following arrests tied to illicit weapons activity. Austria has also taken legal action against Brotherhood-linked networks as part of its counter-extremism framework.",
      "Officials in these countries say the Brotherhood uses a blend of religious preaching, political activism, charitable institutions and media platforms to shape public opinion and challenge state authority.",
      "In the West, the Brotherhood operates far more freely. In the United States, Brotherhood-linked organizations function through charities, advocacy centers, mosques, student associations and community groups. This openness has raised concerns among counterterrorism officials, especially after a U.S. federal investigation in the early 2000s uncovered an internal Brotherhood memorandum describing its work in America as a long-term effort to influence and weaken Western institutions from within.",
      "A French government-commissioned report earlier this year warned of the Brotherhood's influence in the country, but Paris has yet to officially implement a ban.",

      "Egyptian protesters chant anti-Muslim Brotherhood slogans as they attend a rally in Tahrir Square, in Cairo on Nov. 30, 2012. (AP)",
      "The document, according to Mind Israel think tank research, reflects the Brotherhood\u2019s belief in \"long-term social influence\" through education, welfare networks and media.",
      "The movement was founded in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna in Egypt after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The Brotherhood promoted Islam\u2014according to experts\u2014as the solution to modern political crises and relied on outreach, services and media to expand its base. Influential thinkers like Sayyid Qutb later inspired jihadist movements such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State group.",
      "Although the Brotherhood historically maintained a symbolic \"general guide\" in Egypt, the movement now operates as a decentralized network across the Middle East, Africa, Europe and North America. Wahba noted that this fragmentation explains why earlier U.S. attempts to impose a blanket designation failed. Instead, Trump\u2019s order adopts the model used when the United States designated Hamas, the Brotherhood\u2019s Gaza branch, in 1997: target the components \"that engage in violence, not the ideology itself.\"",
      "The decision also comes amid growing Israeli concern about a resurgent Islamist bloc backed by Turkey and Qatar.

      "The rolling plains of Kenya\u2019s Maasai Mara and the millions of animals that live there face a shiny new intrusion: a gleaming Ritz-Carlton safari camp.",
      "With private plunge pools, butler service and panoramic views commanding more than $5,000 a night, the 20-hectare lodge has become a luxury lightning rod for controversy.",
      "Leaders of the Maasai \u2014 an ethnic group of traditionally nomadic herders with ancestral ties to the area \u2014 and conservationists warn the new tourist destination threatens a migration corridor vital to the movement of vast numbers of animals and have filed a lawsuit to halt its operations.",
      "What's at stake, they argue, is not just a new lodge, but the accelerating pressures of tourism on wildlife, biodiversity and the very spectacle that draws these tourists in the first place.",
      "The camp opened on Aug. 15 during the height of the Great Migration, where millions of wildebeest, zebras and other grazing animals move back and forth between the Serengeti plains in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR) in Kenya, a process that researchers say allows animals to find food and water and maintain genetic diversity among herds.",
      "Tourists have long flocked to the savannah by the hundreds of thousands, hoping to witness one of the largest movements of mammals in the world, as herds cross rivers and plains teeming with predators.",
      "But the new camp, which boasts \u201cfront-row seats to one of the world's greatest natural wonders\u201d on its website, may threaten the migration that visitors come to witness, conservations and Maasai leaders say.",
      "The Ritz-Carlton camp, on a bend in the Sand River, sits on \u201cone of the most favored corridors for these animals,\u201d Maasai elder Meitamei Olol Dapash told NBC News in an interview Sunday.",
      "\u201cAny guide will tell you, that is the crossing they use,\u201d said Dapash, who filed a lawsuit in August in a Kenyan court against Ritz-Carlton's owner, Marriott International, the world\u2019s largest hotel chain, as well as the project\u2019s local owner and operator, Lazizi Mara Limited, and Kenyan authorities.",
      "Dapash, executive director of the Institute for Maasai Education, Research and Conservation (MERC), who has a PhD in Sustainability Education from Prescott College in Arizona, alleges in the lawsuit that the 20-suite camp obstructs the crucial migration corridor and is asking the court to restore the land to its original condition.",
      "He told NBC News in an interview there had been instances of wildebeest turning back to avoid the camp and that an elephant was seen struggling to find a path across the river after using the location for more than a decade.",
      "\u201cAttachment to the land and to the wildlife exists up to this very day,\u201d Dapash said, adding that the Maasai had seen populations dwindling. The new camp, he added, \u201cwas the last straw for us, we just didn\u2019t want to let this happen.\u201d",
      "The Kenya Wildlife Service government agency pushed back at claims the lodge has impacted wildebeest migration, citing monitoring data that it says shows it does not \u201cfall within, obstruct, or interfere with any wildebeest migration corridors\u201d and adding that migrating wildebeest \u201care using the entire breadth of the Kenya-Tanzania border.\u201d",
      "It said that \"all ecological, environmental and regulatory requirements were thoroughly met and validated.\"",
      "Marriott International told NBC News that the development underwent an environmental impact assessment (EIA) \u201cin full compliance with\u201d Kenya's environmental protections.",
      "The company said it is committed to \u201cthe principles of responsible tourism\u201d but declined to comment on Dapash's claims that the Ritz-Carlton blocked a key route for local wildlife or its own steps to mitigate the construction's impact, saying these were matters for Narok County, which manages the reserve on the Maasai\u2019s behalf.",
      "Narok County did not respond to NBC News' request for comment. In court documents seen by NBC News, the county claims that the safari camp complies with the Maasai Mara Management Plan, which imposes a moratorium on new developments amid concerns that poorly regulated tourism was stifling wildlife migration and threatening the reserve\u2019s ecosystem.",
      "Lazizi Mara Limited said the moratorium is part of the case before the court, adding: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t\u202fwant to comment on\u202fissues\u202fthat are pending determination.\u201d",
      "Dapash told NBC News that he had \"no issue with business, but this is not just about hotel, it is about the long-term survival of the game reserve.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel like we are losing the land, we are losing the wildlife,\u201d he said.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid mounting concerns about the health of the 580-square-mile reserve, where tourist numbers have nearly tripled in recent decades. The Maasai Mara National Reserve reported over 300,000 tourists in 2023. In 1980, total visitor entry was 114,000.",
      "Tourism in the Mara generates an estimated $20 million annually and thousands more indirectly, according to the reserve. In 2023, tourism across the country contributed around 7% of Kenya's gross domestic product, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.",
      "But the rapid growth in lodges and camps has sometimes clashed with conservation efforts.",
      "\u201cA hotel is never just a hotel,\u201d Dr. Chloe Buiting, a vet and wildlife researcher working in the Maasai Mara, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s infrastructure, it\u2019s roads, it\u2019s changes to the water and the resources and the use of land.\u201d",
      "Seasonal variation in the availability and quality of food forces animals to move around, said Joseph Ogutu, a Kenyan researcher at the University of Hohenheim in Germany. But he said developments like the Ritz-Carlton are having \u201ca negative effect on migration, because most of these facilities are close to rivers where animals either drink water or breed or seek refuge.\u201d",
      "Dapash's cause has also found support among experts and tourism groups.",
      "Grant Hopcraft, a professor of conservation ecology at the University of Glasgow, who has been collaring migratory wildebeest in the Serengeti-Mara since 1999, presented maps and data to the court in October showing \u201cregular cross-border movement of wildebeest\u201d at the location of the lodge, according to his affidavit.",
      "RIDE International, a U.S.-based nonprofit providing cultural exchanges and immersive tours in East Africa, has also thrown its support behind Dapash's lawsuit.",
      "The Mara has been suffering for a long time, said Riley Jon Blackwell, the company's executive director, with \u201clarge hotel chains coming in and trying to service the luxury guests who command to see the best of the best for wildlife.\u201d",
      "The Ritz-Carlton safari camp was \u201cnot surprising,\u201d he added in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a culmination of a long time, of a direction of things leading this way.\u201d",
      "The camp holds a 2.2-star rating on Google Reviews, with many posters criticizing its environmental impact. Others have praised their stay at the park.",
      "A court is scheduled to hear the case in December.",
      "If Dapash is successful with his lawsuit, Buiting said it could \u201cset a very interesting precedent\u201d for future developments in the reserve.",
      "\u201cFrom a legal perspective, this could actually be groundbreaking, a turning point,\u201d she added."

    "summary": "How does \"Maxton Hall\" Season 2 end? Harriet Herbig-Matten and Damian Hardung break it down.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains major spoilers for the ending of \"Maxton Hall\" Season 2.",
      "\"Maxton Hall\" finished its season on a major cliffhanger \u2014 but this time it's Ruby who's left in a heartbreaking lurch.",
      "The Prime Video German teen drama is beloved for its soapy plots, angsty relationship dynamics and powerful chemistry between leads James Beaufort (Damian Hardung) and Ruby Bell (Harriet Herbig-Matten).",
      "But their enemies-to-lovers romance has brought plenty of strife to their lives due to the class difference between them (hence the subtitle, \"The World Between Us.\")",
      "If it wasn't clear from Season 1, Season 2 has firmly established that James' father, Mortimer (Fedja van Hu\u00eat), is the show's big bad. In the wake of the death of his wife \u2014 which was revealed in the last minutes of the Season 1 finale \u2014 his efforts to control his children, James and Lydia (Sonja Wei\u00dfer), only intensified.",
      "He circumvents their efforts to modernize the family's company, seemingly removes them from their mother's will and of course, tries force James and Ruby apart. First, by getting Ruby's scholarship rescinded, and then, by forcibly taking over the Bell family's bakery.",
      "But it's final manipulation that makes up Season 2's shocking final moments.",
      "What Happens at the End of 'Maxton Hall' Season 2?",
      "The final few moments of \"Maxton Hall\" Season upend all of Ruby's efforts to secure her future as a student at Oxford.",
      "In Episode 6, which dropped Nov. 28 on Prime Video, it's revealed that professor Graham Sutton (Eidin Jalali) has been having an affair with a student. Since Season 1, he's had on-again, off-again trysts with Lydia Beaufort, who's now pregnant with twins. He's summoned before school leaders, including Mortimer, to explain what happened.",
      "During that meeting, it's revealed the affair was discovered via a photo. (Remember: In Episode 5, Elaine (Eli Riccardi), who's in love with James, and Cyril (Ben Felipe), who's long pined for Lydia, discovered Lydia and Graham embracing in the woods during a school function and took a photo as evidence.)",
      "But when Graham sees the photo that started the inquest, it turns out to be a picture not of him and Lydia, but of him and Ruby from a school gala in Season 1.",
      "The scene then cuts to a meeting with Ruby, her mother and the headmaster. He tells her she's been expelled from Maxton Hall and will never attend Oxford.",
      "The final minutes of the show feature no dialogue, just an acoustic rendition of \"Chasing Cars.\"",
      "As Ruby walks out into the courtyard in tears, Lydia watches as Graham is escorted from Maxton Hall by police in handcuffs.",
      "Exchanging no words, James hugs a shell-shocked Ruby.",
      "Damian Hardung tells TODAY.com it's unclear what James understands is happening in that moment.",
      "\"What we see right now only is obviously, how beautifully Harriet has acted out that scene, and just seeing everything being destroyed, and just looking at her face and reading that off of her eyes,\" Hardung says. \"He's just in complete shock, but he doesn't know which direction to go.\"",
      "It's made more emotional because \" a moment before, everything was perfect,\" Hardung adds. After his character cheated on Ruby in Episode 1, James pursued therapy and finally, the couple seemed on a healthier, more secure relationship path.",
      "Herbig-Matten says throughout the season her character was \"in conflict with herself.\"",
      "\"She knows that she has to let him go, and that he has to fix himself and she's not responsible for his feelings and loss, and that he's getting back in these toxic behaviors or character traits,\" she says. (\"What do you mean?\" Hardung jokingly interjects.)",
      "She identifies the turning point for her character as James' speech in Episode 3. Filling in as a last minute speaker for Ruby's gala, James opened up about his mother's death and his mental health \u2014 even at the risk of his father's ire.",
      "\"She's deciding to give him a second chance, and I think I love that about her,\" Herbig-Matten says.",
      "But true to form, it all could fall apart after that finale.",
      "\"I think that's this roller coaster of 'Maxton Hall,'\" Hardung says. \"And a part of the reason why this show is so successful is because we just have such a dense high and low-point structure throughout the entire episodes.\"",
      "But Season 2 almost ended on a different scene entirely, the actors say.",
      "How the Season Was Originally Supposed to End",
      "Herbig-Matten and Hardung say originally, the show creators wanted to cut the scenes where she finds out about her expulsion and sobs to James.",
      "\u201cWe were all like, we need this ending,\u201d Herbig-Matten says. \u201cI need this ending for my character.\u201d",
      "They watched the show at a screening around June 2025, and \"it was ending on Graham ... seeing the photo,\" Hardung says.",
      "\"But then the audience wouldn't have known what does that mean to Ruby, what does that mean to the couple,\" Hardung adds.",
      "\"We saw it all on the screen. We're like, 'You can't do it,'\" he continues.",
      "After a \"whole conversation,\" they changed the ending to include the scenes of Ruby reacting.",
      "\"Now we got our ending back,\u201d Hardung says."

      "Calum Hood: It's definitely not a singular conversation that we have at the start of every album. We don't all sit down together and be like, \"OK, what have we accomplished?\"",
      "I feel like we've lived so much life in this band, we intuitively know the different paths that we've taken. And it's very much an intuition-lead thing, moving into a new album process, examining what's happening in everyone's lives, and seeing where that collectively wants to go.",
      "Luke Hemmings: \"No. 1 Obsession\" was the first one. And that was like, \"OK, this feels like it's ticking all the boxes.\" It felt very 5SOS, reclaiming back a bit of that punk rock, garage spirit, but had lyrics that felt very eye catching, even though it's ear catching, I guess.",
      "And that was the one to beat for a while. It felt like a nice blueprint to go from there, because it takes a minute to figure out what the next album's sounds going to be like. You're sort of stabbing in the dark for a while \u2014 especially after the last album had a very specific sound and feeling to it. We love challenging that on the next album, trying to totally 180-flip ... (and saying) what does it feel like if we did the opposite?",
      "LH: Sonically, it has a lot of dance elements in it, like New York and London, Cassius, Prodigy, those dancier acts that still feel like they have a rawness to them. And it's mixed (with a sound) only 5SOS could do; ironic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, but with lots of wisdom behind it. There's a little bit of social satire and self- deprecating humor in it. The sound is a mix of the pop rock, punk, garage band we started as, but mixed in with more dance element roots.",
      "That kind of sounds confusing as f---. (Laughs.) So I don't know.",
      "Michael Clifford: I don't think so.",
      "I think we're finally old enough \u2014\u00a0we're not old, sorry \u2014 we're young enough. We've been doing this for a minute, not too long, but we've been doing it for a little bit and we are able to understand a little bit more, just get perspective on things. I think that it was crucial for us to be able to have that perspective in order to make an album that has those types of themes in it.",
      "And like Luke said, trying to flip it on its head and trying to do the opposite of the last thing that we did, I think, was what we found so exciting about this.",
      "This has been the first time that we've really made an album knowing what we wanted it to look like and feel like in mind. We sort of had an idea of the theme and the feeling that we wanted this to evoke. So it made making it a lot easier and more inspiring. When you can see something in your head, sometimes it's more inspiring to get there because you're not shooting in the dark and like, \"I wonder what this is gonna be like?\" You kind of have an idea and you can drive the ship there.",
      "CH: It's definitely a cool feeling. These guys are kind of the only other three that can really resonate with my life's journey the last 15 years. I gain a lot of comfort from that. And it differs within our last albums, where a lot of the songs thematically come very personally. It's very personal-led, that's how we start songs. But this album felt more \u2014 there was a togetherness of the theme of the album and conceptually that felt really fresh and new. And there's definitely, subconsciously, a lot of healing from that, too.",
      "LH: I feel good. The last show we did, the \"Five Seconds of Summer Show,\" it felt like we unlocked our full evolution, or almost full evolution, as a band with mixing in the 10-year anniversary skits. It was more of treating it as an entertainment piece, as opposed to just ... (getting) out there and crank(ing) out some songs and play as a band. But it had multimedia and it was blurring the lines between the video and then the on-screen and onstage. It was really fun to do and it felt like the most \"us\" a show has been.",
      "So this time, because the characters that we have in this album, their egos are a bit more inflated, the show will reflect that. The people that have the big heads in \"Telephone Busy\" \u2014 those guys are making the show. They're behind the wheel and they're kind of crazy.",
      "MC: They've got some damage.",
      "LH: (Laughs.) It'll be like the 5SOS show we did but on steroids.",
      "MC: Not even steroids.",
      "LH: What's crazier than steroids?",
      "MC: Nothing that's appropriate to say on the TODAY show.",
      "CH: No, no, it's like Green Goblin-esque.",
      "LH: So if the Green Goblin was the fifth. Does that make any sense? (Laughs.)",
      "MC: I don't know. It's not as heady and narrative as that, but it sometimes made approaching concepts \u2014 and like Calum was saying \u2014 instead of going into the meaning of a song and being like, \"Do I personally resonate with this?\" It was more about like, \"Does my place within this story we're trying to tell, how do I embody that?\" Rather than trying to do anything that's too narratively driven. We always are going to be ourselves. We're just  ourselves in an alternate universe.",
      "LH: It's like the larger than life version of ourselves and we're back together. Especially after doing separate solo things, now together \u2014 we are like super, super 5SOS, I guess.",
      "CH: SuperSOS.",
      "MC: The conversation that we had behind it was like, we're our best, biggest versions of ourselves \u2014 well I'm the best, biggest version of myself when I'm doing my solo music \u2014\u00a0but also when I do the band's music. So they're the best versions of themselves when they're in the band.",
      "LH: This is a confusing read. (Laughs).",
      "CH: I agree, you're not your best version.",
      "MC: No, I said I am.",
      "LH: You're not your best version right now. (Laughs.)",
      "LH: We were telling people when we first started that we're going to be a band for 10, 15, 20, 30 years. And everyone, when you're 16 and 17, they're like, \"OK, cool,\" because usually the life cycle of a boy band is short. It's like a butterfly or something.",
      "MC: I think Ash has something to say as well.",
      "Ashton Irwin (mid-hair and makeup): What? ... Don't talk to me while I'm getting my makeup done.",
      "LH: You can legitimately quote that.",
      "I don't know if I'd tell (my younger self) anything. I'd just maybe, I'd just give him a soft drink. Maybe a cheeky pat on the back would be nice.",
      "CH: Maybe a foot-long Subway sandwich. Call it a day.",
      "LH: We've been telling people we're going to be a band for this long and I'm really happy that we stuck it out. We have a f------ amazing fan base that let us change and evolve and experiment with new sounds and looks and everything, and I still feel the same. And that's crazy to be some people's No. 1 obsession still. Sometimes I just feel like I'm a walking ghost.",
      "MC: Can I get a drink on the rocks?"

      "Elizabeth Taylor seemed larger-than-life on screen, and according to Neil Zevnik, her personal chef for nearly a decade in the \u201890s, she also threw larger-than-life parties at home.",
      "\u201cWe always did an enormous single table,\u201d Zevnik tells TODAY.com of her Thanksgiving dinners, attended by 40-plus guests at her ranch-style home in Bel Air, California. Formerly an actor, he worked as Taylor\u2019s chef from 1991 until 1999.",
      "Zevnik says, while he would typically only cook for her, holidays were a special case. As he prepared the feast, movers would remove all her furniture from her living and trophy rooms to make space for a square of banquet tables, which he says he also decorated.",
      "\u201cI would literally take off my shoes and have to get up there on the table,\u201d he says. \u201cI would do these very elaborate centerpieces with fabrics and vases of flowers and tchotchkes and candles.\u201d",
      "Taylor liked to seat all at the same table, he says, adding that kids, adults, celebrities and noncelebs all sat together, \u201cbecause then who gets to sit with her?\u201d",
      "For turkey day, Zevnik would prepare traditional fare: turkey, mashed potatoes, classic bread stuffing, cornbread sausage stuffing, sweet potato casserole, green beans, creamed pearl onions, fresh cranberry peach relish and a mince meat pie.",
      "\u201cYou know, she liked cranberry jelly out of the can, sliced,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cHer two favorite things for Thanksgiving would be turkey wings and gravy, and the turkey wings needed to be crispy and crunchy and salty, and she wanted several of them,\u201d Zevnik recalls. \u201cLots of gravy.\u201d",
      "Scroll to the bottom for his crispy turkey wing recipe.",
      "Taylor required her chef to make extra portions of those two dishes so there would be plenty to pile on her plate as well as leftovers.",
      "On days when she wasn\u2019t entertaining, Taylor\u2019s solo meals were casual \u2014 but never boring.",
      "\u201cGenerally, we wouldn\u2019t make a whole lot of plans in advance,\u201d Zevnik says. He would arrive to cook during the day and provide her options \u201cprepped to a certain point,\u201d as well as her favorites that he could easily whip up.",
      "\u201cAt some point, she\u2019d say, \u2018Okay, what do we got today?\u2019\u201d he says. He would ask her what she was in the mood for: salty, crunchy, creamy, healthy, etc. \u201cThen we would go from there.\u201d",
      "Every afternoon, Zevnik says Taylor would have him cook for everyone working at the house. \u201cAll the staff would gather and sit down together in the kitchen.\u201d",
      "Taylor was very open to trying new cuisines, but since she was brough up in the U.K., she especially loved British foods, like roast beef with Yorkshire pudding and Marmite.",
      "She was also a fan of sweets \u2014 in fact, she loved Zevnik\u2019s \u201ctoffee fudgies\u201d so much, she had a fridge stocked with them in her bedroom.",
      "Zevnik has since worked for a long list of celebrities \u2014 Reese Witherspoom, Jennifer Garner, Pierce Brosanan and Charlize Theron, to name a few \u2014 but those years with Taylor still inspire him.",
      "\u201cShe was one of the most loyal and giving people I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d he says. She began her AIDS advocacy in the \u201880s, when most celebrities refused to help, and eventually established the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation. \u201cShe didn\u2019t give a f--- what people thought. She did what she thought was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "When she disliked a stew he made, he recalls, she \u201ckind of ate a little bit of it, and then was kind of done.\u201d",

      "Brendan Fraser's new film, \u201cRental Family,\u201d explores belonging, authenticity\u00a0and one unconventional business model.",
      "The Oscar winner portrays Phillip, a struggling middle-aged American living in Tokyo taking a number of small gigs in hopes of getting another big break. He then gets an opportunity with a business that forever changes his life: a \"rental family\" agency.",
      "Essentially, actors like Philip get paid to play stand-in roles in strangers' lives. They can get hired to pose as family members, friends, partners, people whom they've had affairs with and now must apologize to their spouses, or whomever the client needs.",
      "\u201cRental Family\u201d is not based on a true story. However, it does bring to light the very real family rental businesses in Japan.",
      "Director Hikari tells TODAY.com that upon learning of the services, she discovered \u201cthat people are really longing for connection\u201d amid feelings of isolation.",
      "The film shows an initially hesitant Phillip after he gets hired as a stand-in-fianc\u00e9 for a woman who wants to stage a wedding so she can move to a different country with her female partner.",
      "He is also \u201cbooked\u201d to fill in the role of a long-lost father for a young girl named Mia (Shannon Mahina Gorman). Her, mother Hitomi (Shino Shinozaki), believes if her daughter has a complete family, her chances at being accepted into a prestigious school will be better.",
      "Then, the daughter of an aging Japanese actor, Kikuo (Akira Emoto), hires Philip to pose as a journalist and interview him before he loses his memory. While he pretends to write a story about the former star, they begin to form a friendship.",
      "In 2018, director Hikari began exploring the \u201crent-a-family industry\u201d and discovered that it started in the \u201880s.",
      "\u201cCurrently there are about 300 companies that exist in Japan,\u201d the director said in press notes. \u201cIn a big city like Tokyo, or even a countryside town, you can feel so isolated. \u2026 Every single person I spoke to was looking for connection. Even though they\u2019re paying for the service, they find a friendship within that two or three hours they spend together. And the actors who become the surrogates, they are also 100% invested in the relationship and find their own connection in the community. The roles may seem fake but the emotion is real.\u201d",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com, Hikari recalls the moment she knew rental services were \u201creally doing something very important to people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "There was a man that couldn\u2019t get in touch with his daughter for a long time, she says, \u201cand before he passed away, he really wanted to reconnect, but he couldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo he hired somebody who looked like his daughter and asked her to come to the hospital so that he (could) apologize and say how much he loved her before he passed away,\u201d she says.",
      "Actor Mari Yamamoto, who portrays rental family agency employee Aiko, believes that people are looking for \u201ca temporary solution\u201d when they rent somebody.",
      "Telling TODAY.com, \u201cWhat starts out as a transactional relationship turns into something genuine. And I think that\u2019s the beauty of this service. The people that we\u2019ve spoken to who actually work in this industry have told us stories of how they get so much out of providing this service.\u201d",
      "Ryuichi Ichinokawa, founder of real life Heart Project business in Japan, told the Associated Press that he\u2019s hired dozens of people to pretend to be journalists for vacant events and people to pose as significant others and accompany them for special events or appointments, as well as pretend family members.",
      "\u201cI am being of service to people. I hope they will be happy,\u201d Ichinokawa told the publication, stressing that clients find the service comforting and healing. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I am acting. I really get angry if that\u2019s what the situation requires.\u201d",
      "Actor Takehiro Hira, who portrays Shinji, the owner of the rental family, calls the services a step to healing in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cSometimes it becomes too much. Sometimes (they) just can\u2019t take it anymore. So rather than going to seek professional help... and you might be shy, then you can rent and use services like this to do the patchwork on the wound.\u201d",
      "Hira also spoke to someone who works at an agency and got a request from an older lady seeking the services of a younger person.",
      "\u201cJust to sleep in the next room so that she would feel safe and comfortable,\u201d the actor says. \u201cI have an 80-year-old some mother living by herself in Tokyo and she doesn\u2019t ask me to come back home. But maybe on some lonely night she might feel (scared), so that sort of puts everything in context.\u201d",
      "Miwa Yasui, a University of Chicago professor who also researches how culture influences mental health, told AP that Japan has grappled with loneliness, high suicide rates and mental illness stigma. Yasui noted that Japan as a collective culture tends to hide mental health challenges and adults are pressured to maintain harmony and take care of the family.",
      "Additionally, Chikako Ozawa-de Silva, author of \u201cThe Anatomy of Loneliness: Suicide, Social Connection and the Search for Relational Meaning in Contemporary Japan\u201d and a professor at Emory University, also told AP that the rental family business puts a \"band-aid\" on a deeper problem.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not against that,\u201d Ozawa-de Silva said. \u201cIf people can buy time by renting a family, while pursuing much better long-term solutions, I think the rental family could be a very, very beneficial thing.\u201d",
      "Hikari's goal was to make audiences ask themselves the role they would hire someone to play in their lives, as well as share a reminder to connect with real people.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to make a movie that connects the audience,\u201d she shares with TODAY.com. \u201cAnd have them look within themselves or pick up the phone and say, \u2018Hey, what are you doing?\u2019\u201d",
      "She also wanted people to understand the nuances of the business and how it could be interpreted in different countries.",
      "\u201cHere in America too, there are people who volunteer to be beside somebody who\u2019s elderly, who wants somebody to hold their hand and watch them go to the next journey,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very different but I think every culture has certain things that are (similar).\u201d",
      "What Hikari says is most \u201cbeautiful\u201d is that people just want \u201cto be there for each other.\u201d"

    "summary": "In an interview Malala Yousafzai speaks about her new memoir, friendship, marriage, and her life since being shot by the Talbian.",
    "story": [
      "Over a decade after being shot in the head on a bus in Pakistan and becoming a global activist for women\u2019s rights in the Middle East, Malala Yousafzai is reintroducing herself \u2014 in her own words.",
      "\u201cThere is more to my life,\u201d she tells TODAY.com, explaining that her new memoir, \u201cFinding My Way,\u201d explores her \u201cjourney through college years, making friends, finding love and learning more about my activism and talking about mental health.\u201d",
      "She says it was \u201cimportant for people to know the true me\" through her book: \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the activist perfect version of me. It\u2019s the more real version of me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy story has already been out there in the public eye, and I think it\u2019s a very one-dimensional story that is related to something that happened to me at age 15,\u201d she continues. \u201cI had been defined by the Taliban shooting for such a long time, I wanted to share more about myself.\u201d",
      "In October 2012, Yousafzai was the victim of targeted shooting by members of the Taliban, following years of public activism and national recognition in Pakistan. The shooting drew global attention and further ignited Yousafzai\u2019s activism, leading her to be named among TIME magazine\u2019s \u201c100 Most Influential People in the World\u201d in 2013. The following year, at the age of 17, Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for young people\u2019s education rights.",
      "When asked what she finds is the most misunderstood part of her story, Yousafzai says, \u201cthat I am actually a funnier person than people think.\u201d",
      "\u201cI actually like to have moments of laughter and joy,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is one of the ways in which I cope with the workload and all that I have experienced. I like spreading joy.\u201d",
      "Prior to the shooting that altered the course of her life, Yousafzai says she was \u201cthis jolly and fun, entertaining\u201d kid growing up in Pakistan \u2014 adding she was even \u201ca bit mischievous\u201d and \u201cliked to get into trouble.\u201d",
      "But once she moved to the United Kingdom to attend Oxford University, \u201ceverything changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt that I had to live up to the expectation of being an activist. I received so many awards and titles at such a young age that I thought maybe all of this means I cannot be a normal girl anymore,\u201d Yousafzai explains. \u201cI think I was not true to myself as an activist.\u201d",
      "Starting college, Yousafzai says she had the \u201cwrong perception of what the activist life should look like,\u201d which she assumed meant she didn\u2019t have access to \u201cnormal things,\u201d like making friends and falling in love.",
      "\u201cSomehow you have to be stronger and more courageous at everything. You cannot have moments of breakdowns, moments of self doubt,\u201d she says. She would tell herself in difficult times, \u201c\u2018No, you\u2019re supposed to be brave and strong and you\u2019re not going to feel a different way.\u2019\u201d",
      "Over the course of her time at Oxford, however, Yousafzai\u2019s perceptions were shattered and reconstructed.",
      "She tells TODAY.com, \u201cI fell in love, I made friends, I had a mental health breakdown \u2014 all of those things happened all at once. I felt like I was a different person, and I\u2019m grateful for it because it helped me grow.\u201d",
      "How Friendship, a Bong, Therapy and Love Changed Malala Yousafzai\u2019s Life",
      "When she first arrived at Oxford, Yousafzai says she \u201csigned up for every club and society\u201d to meet as many people as possible, despite it feeling \u201cquite awkward and embarrassing\u201d at the time. She adds, \u201cI do not regret it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI struggled to make friends, I struggled to have these normal moments of joy,\u201d she continues. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made a deliberate choice to actually socialize, to actually choose socializing over studying at college, because I wanted to make friends. I wanted to connect with my old self and somehow relive my childhood in my 20s.\u201d",
      "She assumed her fellow classmates would expect her to be \u201ca very serious, boring person, that I only talk about activism,\u201d Yousafzai says, adding, \u201cI just also thought that people may not approach me, thinking that I have nothing fun to say to be part of their friend circle.\u201d",
      "Feeling the pressure to \u201clive up to the expectation\u201d she thought others already set for her, Yousafzai says she realized that people can \u201cinternalize expectation so much that we lose personal identity.\u201d",
      "She explains she had to \u201cdo a lot of unlearning\u201d around who she thought she was.",
      "Once Yousafzai found her people, the \u201cunlearning\u201d began.",
      "\u201cFriendship actually changed me as a person,\u201d she says, noting that the people she surrounded herself with provided the \u201csafest place\u201d to truly express herself without judgement.",
      "One night when her friends were smoking out of a bong, Yousafzai says she opted to try it for the first time, not expecting to be brought back seven years earlier, to October 2012.",
      "\u201cThat brought back flashbacks of the Taliban attack,\u201d she reveals. \u201cThen, after that, I started getting panic attacks and anxiety, and it went on for months.\u201d",
      "When her friend suggested she see a therapist, Yousafzai says she was reluctant, explaining that conversations around mental health are \u201ctaboo\u201d with \u201ca lot of stigma attached to it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember my first therapy session. I told the therapist all the problems that I had, and then said, \u2018OK, give me the medication. Let\u2019s just fix it,\u2019\u201d Yousafzai says, laughing. \u201cShe helped me understand that this is not how it works. It\u2019s actually a process.\u201d",
      "Through therapy Yousafzai has been able to redefine \u201cbravery and courage,\u201d saying she now understands that \u201cwhen you decide to still do what you believe in, even in these moments of difficulty, maybe that is true courage and bravery.\u201d",
      "Amid her therapy journey, Yousafzai had another curve ball thrown her way, emotionally speaking: She fell in love.",
      "\u201cI was excited, I was thrilled, but I was also scared and worried,\u201d Yousafzai recalls of falling for her now husband, Asser Malik.",
      "In Pakistani culture, a couple is not supposed to live together until they tie the knot, she explains. Because she wanted to live with Malik, Yousafzai says she suddenly had to consider the \u201cheavy and overwhelming\u201d decision around marriage.",
      "\u201cI had been so scared of marriage growing up because I saw girls married off when they were still in school, and it just meant that their future, their dreams, were taken away. But I also knew that marriage has meant more compromises for women from their career and many other things in their lives,\u201d she says. \u201cSomehow, just the concept of marriage as an institution just scared me.\u201d",
      "Along with her research, which included reading a myriad of books by \u201camazing feminist authors,\u201d Yousafzai says specific conversations with Malik ultimately led to her agreeing to marry him \u2014 \u201cand I do not regret it for a second.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew that he was the right person because he had so much respect for me. He made me feel comfortable with myself. Of course, we were in love with each other, but I started loving myself, and that was a big change,\u201d Yousafzai says. \u201cSo when you are with the right person, life becomes more beautiful.\u201d",
      "Reflecting on 15-Year-Old Malala Yousafzai",
      "It\u2019s been 13 years since Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban at just 15. Now 28, she has a message for that teenage girl.",
      "\u201cMy younger self was very strong and determined, and I want to tell her that I\u2019m still determined, but I have grown beautifully so much in these years,\u201d Yousafzai says. \u201cI know that there have been moments of difficulty, but all of that has transformed me into the person I am today.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am a young woman and I am really happy with where I am because I am working for the right to education for every girl, because I was also once shot for speaking out for girls, and I was banned from learning,\u201d she continues.",
      "\u201cSo I want to see that change for girls everywhere, that no girl should witness that. And I\u2019m trying to do everything that I can in my capacity to make the world a better place for girls like you.\u201d",
      "\u201cFinding My Way,\u201d Yousafzai\u2019s newest memoir, was released Oct. 21."

      "He was 81.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia. I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists, and coworkers who have shared his journey with him,\u201d his wife, Latifa Chambers, wrote on Instagram.",
      "He was best known for songs including \u201cMany Rivers to Cross,\u201d and \u201cThe Harder They Come,\u201d the title song for the movie of the same name from 1972, which featured Cliff. The film\u2019s soundtrack was a major international success and did much to spread the appeal of Jamaican reggae.",
      "Born in Jamaica in 1944, Cliff scored his first local hit aged just 14 with \u201cHurricane Hattie\u201d and would go on to win two Grammy awards and pick up seven nominations.",
      "He was only one of two Jamaicans to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, alongside Bob Marley. He was inducted in 2010, with an introductory speech from Wyclef Jean. An essay commemorating Cliff from writer Rob Bowman said that if he had done nothing but star in \u201cThe Harder They Come,\u201d he would have merited inclusion.",

    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "Marissa Bode first saw \"Wicked\" at the age of 12 after her mother surprised her with tickets to see the Broadway show.",
      "What she didn't know then was that merely a decade later, she'd find herself starring in the big-screen version opposite Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande in a blockbuster that smashed box office records after its release in 2024.",
      "\"I'm so grateful for this experience and \u2014 especially my first ever experience,\" Bode, 25, tells TODAY.com. \"I'm definitely grateful for that ... to be a part of something so big.\"",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d fans will likely remember that Bode\u2019s character, Nessarose, is born unable to walk because her mother ate too many milk flowers during her pregnancy out of fear of having another baby with green skin like Nessarose's maligned sister, Elphaba (Erivo).",
      "The show has been on Broadway since 2003, but, Bode is the first actor who uses a wheelchair to be cast in the role of Nessarose.",
      "In \"Wicked\" Part 1, Bode's character is full of youthful hope and in love with Boq (Ethan Slater), the Munchkin boy she falls for while at a dance at the Ozdust Ballroom, and whom she believes returns her affection.",
      "Fast forward to \"Wicked: For Good. Set one year later, Nessarose is Munchkinland's newest governor, a dark, controlling workaholic who learns Boq, her true love, has actually been pining for Glinda (Grande) the entire time.",
      "It's this betrayal that sets Nessarose up as one of the sequel's villains \u2014 a label Bode says is largely undeserved.",
      "\"I think Nessa is totally misunderstood. I think sometimes people can mix the bigger picture and just write her off as the villain or inherently evil,\" Bode says. \"But I think the point of the film is to really show that all of these characters really have so many layers.\"",
      "In \"Wicked: For Good,\" Nessarose transforms from a happy, young girl to an isolated, cold woman \u2014 a metamorphosis Bode calls \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven the whole dance scene, I think that hit close to home, because I do have other disabled friends where something similar has happened,\u201d Bode explains.",
      "\u201cWhere people are friends with them from a distance or they are asked out, but it\u2019s only for a photo op or something to make the other person feel good type of thing, rather than really caring about them and discarding them when they\u2019re no longer either useful or can benefit them,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Instead of being immoral, Nessarose is simply a product of her circumstances, Bode says.",
      "\"It's her just desperately wanting to hang on to the parts that she feels are good in her life. Wanting to really, so deeply, hold onto the moment of her at the dance, which was one of the happiest nights of her life really,\" she says of her character.",
      "\u201cThen when she finds out that all of it wasn\u2019t true and, in addition to being abandoned by her sister \u2014 or at least that\u2019s how she feels \u2014 and really having nobody left at the end of the day, I think there\u2019s moments of her being like, \u2018Well, I have nothing else to lose,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Nessarose and her estranged sister do briefly reunite after the ousted witch returns to Munchkinland seeking to drum up support for her campaign to restore animals' rights.",
      "After Nessarose confronts Elphaba for her perceived abandonment, she attempts to help Nessarose reunite with Boq. In the process, she makes Nessarose fly, restoring her child-like joy, if only for a brief moment.",
      "The pivotal scene is symbolic in more ways than one.",
      "\u201cI think with a song like \u2018Defying Gravity,\u2019 where one of the lyrics is, \u2018Everyone deserves a chance to fly,\u2019 to me, that\u2019s not just physically flying, it\u2019s also metaphorically and feeling like you\u2019re on top of the world or feeling like you do finally have control of your life in some way and flying on that high,\u201d Bode says.",
      "As for how that felt to film?",
      "\u201cI physically had fun flying in the air. What was most tricky for me was pretending like I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Bode recalls. \u201cI do laugh in it, but going from that and then bringing it back down after, I think was the trick for sure.\u201d",
      "But when she shows Boq that she can fly, he tells her she no longer needs him. He asks if he can leave and profess his love for Glinda.",
      "\"When Boq sees Nessa flying, there's a real clear connection between her and Elphaba in that way,\" Slater tells TODAY.com. \"I think, yes, it's magic, but it's also the kind of power that Elphaba has to fly. So I think that, in some ways, informs where the fear goes.\"",
      "Nessarose reacts by trying to force him to love her \u2014 through magic. She attempts to cast a love spell using Elphaba's Grimmerie, but it results in Boq's heart shrinking. To save his life, Elphaba turns him into the Tin Man of \"The Wizard of Oz\" lore.",
      "The physical transformation into the Tin Man took Slater up to five hours. But Slater suggests Boq remains more similar than different.",
      "\"I think it was really important to me that Boq, pre-transformation, is the same Boq, post-transformation. From his point of view, the world around him is changing, and he's just responding to it,\" Slater says.",
      "Nessarose and Boq both meet tragic fates in \"Wicked.\" Boq loses his humanity, while Nessa dies after Madame Morrible brings a tornado (yes, that tornado) to Oz, resulting in a house falling on her.",
      "But the characters' actors are looking to the future. Slater is set to star in the play \"Marcel on the Train,\" which opens on Broadway Feb. 22.",
      "Bode says she's grateful for the opportunity she's had to be part of something so epic, but at the same time, is ready to move on.",
      "\"I think I'm just someone that can't have the same scenery for too long,\" she explains. \"I love playing around and wearing a number of different hats, so I'm looking forward to the future.\""

      "The bromance between Jonathan Bailey and Jeff Goldblum is the real deal.",

      "During what Bailey and Goldblum mourn as their final joint interview of the \"Wicked: For Good\" press tour, the two friends banter, ponder plot points (spoilers ahead!) and discuss why the film is exactly the right movie at the right time.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Jonathan Bailey: We were just talking about that.",
      "Jeff Goldblum: We were just talking about that because ...",
      "JB: He lands in the opening sequence of his spinoff (laughing).",
      "JG: The Gregory Maguire books, I think there are seven of them, I think there's a lot of material that probably answers a lot of questions. I was just asking (Maguire) about what happens to Fiyero ... what is that nothingness place? I think it's described in some of those books. What are they going to do?",
      "You saw the movie? Did you get the idea that (Fiyero) is now eternal? Lives forever as a straw person? I have to see it many more times.",
      "JB: (Elphaba and Fiyero) have a family.",
      "JG: They have children ... you were saying. In the books, they have children.",
      "JB: Yes.",
      "JG: There are a bunch of books. And Frank Baum (author of \"The Wizard of Oz\") wrote a bunch of books at the beginning of the 1900s, so there's material galore.",
      "JB: I just want a film called \"Wizard\" with Jeff (laughing). But you would play every part like \"Big Momma\u2019s House.\"",
      "JG: I\u2019d like to see \"Momma\u2019s House.\" Or, I'd like to see Fiyero and Elphaba in the \"Dunescape.\"",
      "JB: We'll call it ... \"Making Hay.\" (Laughing)",
      "JG: \"Making Hay,\" excellent. (Laughing)",
      "JB: Making hay, all day and night. (Laughing)",
      "JG: I think, it's very serious. It's like \"Scenes From a Marriage,\" and we cover the next 20 years of their relationship.",
      "JB: It was all prosthetics. There\u2019s no CGI, there\u2019s no special effects. It\u2019s an extraordinary thing to be in any sort of film that celebrates the creative arts in the way that (\u201cWicked\u201d) does and I think everyone\u2019s been able to flex years of craft.",
      "It was four-and-a-half hours every morning. It was Mark (Coulier), who\u2019s an extraordinary designer, who came up with this burlap texture and it was the first conversation I had with Frances (Hannon), to think about where the literal transformation ends.",
      "There's so much that we sort of explored, the physicality, obviously with a nod to Ray Bolger (the original Scarecrow in \"The Wizard of Oz\").",
      "There's footage of a camera test which made me ... I kind of started crying because it was so reminiscent of \"The Wizard of Oz,\" and it was me and Ethan (Slater) as the Tin Man and Bethany Weaver as Dorothy.",
      "They had a chalk slate and we just walked up and down the yellow brick road and we were just exploring the characters. That was almost one of my highlights, actually.",
      "JG: I'd like to see that. There are many things about the ending that intrigue me now. What's the nothingness like? What happens to them? You know, Boq, that's very interesting and savage, his whole thing, it fascinates me. But the two ladies, our main story, wooooow!",
      "JB: The Grimmerie really comes alive.",
      "JG: And does Elphaba now not have the powers that she did with the Grimmerie? And why couldn't she have trusted (Glinda) perhaps? There's a lovely line, \"I have to be wicked so you can be good.\" Glinda is amazing, why couldn't (Elphaba) trust that, \"Hey, we're going to be OK. Don't try to contact us, etc., etc.. Don't tell anybody that we faked it.\"",
      "Or, or is the loss that Glinda experiences the portal, the thing that triggers her power, her ability to go through that loss of the greatest love that she's ever had, really, with Elphaba? Does that trigger her ability to that power?",
      "JB: I think what's going to happen is \"Dune\" Part 3 is coming out in cinemas next year, and I think Fiyero and Elphaba are just going to walk into the shot ...",
      "JG: (Both laughing) And you'll go, \"People ... \"",
      "JB: \"Timmy?",
      "JG: \"Timothee Chalamet?\"",
      "JB: I think the answers always lie in the Grimmerie.",
      "I do think it's particularly thrilling to see the Grimmerie come alive and for someone \u2014 Ariana (Grande) charts so brilliantly \u2014 is that the absolute knowledge that (Glinda) has no magic and she no power. To see the Grimmerie come alive, feels to me, like a transference and a conversation between the two women.",
      "JG: Certainly, Elphaba telepathically kind of does that as they commune with each other across the space.",
      "Does Glinda? ... Good question. Does Glinda go, \"I don't think I did that. Are you out there somewhere?\" Maybe it's meant to be ambiguous. Ask Jon M. Chu this question because every moment means something and he, I'm sure, intends and has excavated all the logic behind all of that.",
      "JB: As we know with grief, as well, is that these people do always exist in a different form, don't they? So, in a metaphysical sense, they are still living on together.",
      "JG: Yes, you've changed me for good, meaning both those things, of course, forever.",
      "JB: There's so much hope and optimism in this story and that lies with seeing other sides and being curious about other perspectives. And what a time to be celebrating that idea.",
      "JG: Empathy. Empathy. A valuable commodity, now more than ever. If this movie isn't a machinery for the spread of empathy, I don't know what is.",
      "JB: And it just takes one person. It can be one act of kindness. It can have a ripple effect and one intentional act of radicalism that can inspire and shift.",
      "JG: The pebble in the lake and the spreading rings."

    "summary": "Scientists have discovered that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belonged to a previously unknown ancient relative similar to Lucy.",
    "story": [
      "In the latest twist in human evolution, scientists have discovered that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belonged to a previously unknown ancient relative.",
      "Dated to around 3.4 million years ago, the species was likely similar to Lucy, an ancient human relative who lived in the area at around the same time, according to a study published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature.",
      "But researchers found that the Burtele foot \u2014 named after the place in northeastern Ethiopia where it was discovered in 2009 \u2014  was unmistakably different.",
      "With an opposable big toe resembling a human thumb, the fossilized Burtele foot suggests its owner was a skilled climber, spending more time in the trees than Lucy, the study said.",
      "For decades, Lucy\u2019s species was considered the ancestor of all later hominids \u2014 an ancient relative more closely related to humans, including Homo sapiens, than to chimpanzees.",
      "Scientists were unable to confirm the foot belonged to a new species until they were able to study new fossils, including a jawbone with 12 teeth, that were found at the same site.",
      "After identifying them as Australopithecus deyiremeda, they found the Burtele foot belonged to the same species.",
      "John Rowan, an assistant professor in human evolution at Britain\u2019s University of Cambridge, said their conclusion was \u201cvery reasonable.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow we have much stronger evidence that, at the same time, there lived a closely related but adaptively distinct species,\u201d Rowan, who was not associated with the study, told NBC News in an email Thursday.",
      "The study also looked at how these species shared the same environment. The research team, led by Yohannes Haile-Selassie from Arizona State University, concluded that the new species spent much of its time in the forest.",
      "Lucy, or Australopithecus afarensis, likely roamed the ground, the study said, before going on to suggest that the two species likely had different diets and used the landscape in different ways.",
      "Multiple examinations of the newly found teeth indicated that A. deyiremeda was more primitive than Lucy and likely relied on a diet of leaves, fruit and nuts, the study said.",
      "\u201cThese differences meant that they were unlikely to be directly competing for the same resources,\u201d said Ashleigh L.A. Wiseman, an assistant research professor at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, which is also based at the U.K.\u2019s University of Cambridge.",
      "Highlighting the broader impact of this discovery on our understanding of evolution, Wiseman said in an email Thursday that the findings reminded us \u201cthat human evolution wasn\u2019t a straight ladder with one species turning into the next.\u201d",
      "Instead, she said, it should be viewed as a family tree with several so-called \u201ccousins\u201d alive at the same time, and each having a different way of surviving. \u201cDid they interact? We will likely never know the answer to that question,\u201d she added.",
      "Rowan also contended that as the number of well-documented human-related species grows, so do our questions about our ancestry. \u201cWhich species were our direct ancestors? Which were close relatives? That\u2019s the tricky part,\u201d he said. \u201cAs species diversity grows, so do the number of plausible reconstructions for how human evolution played out.\u201d",
      "And Wiseman cautioned against making definitive species assignments, as those should rest on well-preserved parts of skull and fossils that belong to multiple associated individuals. While the new research strengthens the case for A. deyiremeda\u2019s existence, she said, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t remove all other alternative interpretations.\u201d"

      "HONG KONG \u2014 President Donald Trump has spoken with the leaders of U.S. ally Japan and rival superpower China amid the pair\u2019s escalating dispute over Taiwan.",
      "Trump\u2019s surprise call Monday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, was followed by a call with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who angered China earlier this month with comments on the Beijing-claimed island democracy.",
      "Both China and Japan said Trump initiated the calls, which the White House has not confirmed.",
      "The dispute began when Takaichi, who was elected last month, told lawmakers that a hypothetical Chinese attack on self-ruling Taiwan, which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory, could threaten Japan\u2019s survival and trigger a military response from Tokyo.",
      "It was the first time such an explicit remark had been made by a sitting prime minister of Japan, which like the United States has long been deliberately vague as to whether it would intervene militarily in the event of an attack on Taiwan.",
      "China, which describes Taiwan as its \u201ccore of core interests,\u201d has responded with outrage, taking the dispute to the United Nations, advising its citizens against traveling to Japan and seeking economic retaliation against Japanese seafood, movies, concerts and more.",
      "On Monday, China criticized Japan\u2019s plan to deploy missiles on an island near Taiwan as a deliberate attempt to \u201ccreate regional tension and provoke military confrontation,\u201d while Japan scrambled a fighter jet after it detected a Chinese drone flying between Taiwan and the Japanese island of Yonaguni.",
      "Though Takaichi has refused Beijing\u2019s demands that she retract her \u201cerroneous\u201d remarks, her government says Japan\u2019s policy on Taiwan has not changed and it continues to favor a peaceful resolution to the issue.",
      "Trump has not publicly commented on the dispute, though his ambassador to Japan, George Glass, has said Tokyo can count on U.S. support in the face of Chinese \u201ccoercion.\u201d",
      "Takaichi said Tuesday that she reaffirmed Japan\u2019s close cooperation with the U.S. in her call with Trump, which she said he initiated.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump mentioned that he and I are extremely good friends, and that I should call him any time,\u201d she told reporters, according to Reuters.",
      "Trump seemingly hit it off with Takaichi during a visit to Japan last month, which was followed by a meeting with Xi in South Korea to address tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies over trade and other issues.",
      "Trump said he had a \u201cvery good\u201d call with Xi, their first since that meeting, and that U.S.-China relations were \u201cextremely strong.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cNow we can set our sights on the big picture.\u201d",
      "Trump reaffirmed plans announced last month for him to visit Beijing in April, followed by a U.S. visit by Xi later in the year. He said he and Xi discussed Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans, Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and the illicit international flow of fentanyl ingredients. Taiwan was not mentioned in Trump\u2019s post.",
      "That is good news for Taiwan amid growing pressure from China and questions about Trump\u2019s commitment to its security, suggesting that \u201cfrom the U.S.\u2019 perspective, there is nothing about Taiwan that has changed,\u201d said Lev Nachman, a professor of political science at National Taiwan University.",
      "Xi also said the U.S. and China had \u201cgenerally maintained a steady and positive trajectory,\u201d according to a readout of the call published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday that the call was initiated by the U.S. side.",
      "Unlike Trump\u2019s post, the Chinese readout of the call heavily emphasized Taiwan, whose \u201creturn to China\u201d Xi said was an important part of the post-World War II international order.",
      "Taiwan, a former Japanese colony, was handed to the Republic of China government after Japan\u2019s defeat in 1945, only for that government to retreat to Taiwan a few years later after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong\u2019s communist forces. The island has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "Taiwan Premier Cho Jung-tai said Tuesday that for the 23 million people of Taiwan, there was \u201cno option of returning\u201d to China.",
      "\u201cWe must once again emphasize that the Republic of China is a fully sovereign and independent nation,\u201d he told reporters in Taipei, using Taiwan\u2019s formal name.",
      "The Trump-Xi call is a \u201cvery good signal\u201d that the strategic competition between the U.S. and China is under control, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in China, though a \u201cdramatic breakthrough is hard to imagine.\u201d",
      "Taiwan has not been a major focus of U.S.-China relations in recent months, with Trump saying it \u201cnever came up\u201d during his meeting with Xi. The Chinese readout of their Oct. 30 meeting also failed to mention Taiwan, which is unusual.",
      "The Trump-Xi call comes after the U.S. announced two arms sales to Taiwan in the space of a week, the first since Trump returned to office in January. They include an advanced missile system worth almost $700 million and $330 million in fighter jet and other aircraft parts.",
      "China objects to such sales by the U.S., which has no official relations with Taiwan but is legally bound to provide the island with weapons for its defense.",
      "What China is seeking from Trump, Nachman said, is assurance that the U.S. is not going to loudly weigh in on the Taiwan dispute on Takaichi\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cFrom Beijing\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s important that other countries realize that there will be punishments for countries that take this pro-Taiwan stance,\u201d he said.",
      "The lack of comments from Trump on the issue, Nachman said, \u201ctells me that the U.S. has no desire to publicly make this about Taiwan more than it\u2019s already become.\u201d"

      "As his fellow countrymen celebrate Thanksgiving, the first American pontiff\u2019s plate will be full on a six-day tour of Turkey and Lebanon that will be closely scrutinized. He plans to meet with religious and political leaders, lead Mass in both countries and try to provide a boost to long-suffering Christian communities throughout the region.",
      "Ahead of his trip, Leo shared a Thanksgiving message with NBC News in which he encouraged all people \u201cto say \u2018thank you\u2019 to someone\u201d and \u201cto recognize that we have all received so many gifts, first and foremost the gift of life.\u201d",
      "Gifts were shared aboard his flight to the Turkish capital, Ankara, including a pecan pie handed to him by an NBC News correspondent. Leo told journalists that along with other church leaders, he hoped \u201cto announce, transmit, proclaim how important peace is throughout the world and to invite all people to come together to search for greater unity.\u201d",
      "Later, in his first overseas speech since his election in May to lead the 1.4 billion-member church, Leo told Turkish political leaders that the world was experiencing \u201ca heightened level of conflict on the global level, fueled by prevailing strategies of economic and military power.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must in no way give in to this,\u201d he added. The future of humanity is at stake.\u201d",
      "Some had speculated that the Chicago-born Leo might choose the U.S. for his first trip, or Peru, where he served for many years as a missionary and later as a bishop and archbishop, becoming a naturalized citizen in 2015.",
      "But for Miles Pattenden, a Catholic Church historian at the U.K.\u2019s University of Oxford, the choice of the Middle East was \u201cnot such a surprise,\u201d and it was sending out a message that the region \u201cis the heart of Christianity.\u201d",
      "Turkey, where Leo will stay until Sunday, was the \u201cobvious choice\u201d because it was the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, Christianity\u2019s first ecumenical council, Pattenden told NBC News in a telephone interview Wednesday.",
      "Convened by Emperor Constantine, who made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, the meeting of bishops and church leaders \u201cproduced the Nicaean creed, which is the standard statement of what Christians believe,\u201d including the affirmation that Jesus was the son of God, Pattenden said.",
      "He added that it was \u201cabsolutely foundational\u201d to what Christians, including Catholics, believe today.",
      "Leo will pray with the spiritual leader of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, at the site of the 325 A.D. gathering in what is known today as Iznik, before they sign a joint declaration in a sign of Christian unity.",
      "\u201cWe all understand that 1,000 years of division has inflicted a deep wound that cannot be healed easily,\u201d Bartholomew told the respected Greek daily Kathimerini recently, according to The Associated Press."

      "President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will \u201cpermanently pause\u201d all immigration from what he called \u201cthird world countries\u201d and demanded a program of \u201creverse migration\u201d as he intensified his rhetoric after the National Guard shooting in Washington, D.C.",
      "Trump offered few details as he disparaged and vowed to remove millions of migrants in the U.S. in a lengthy social media post late on Thanksgiving that came hours after he confirmed the death of National Guard soldier Sarah Beckstrom, 20, in the shooting.",
      "Officials have said that Wednesday\u2019s attack on two troops was  carried out by an Afghan national who worked with a CIA-backed group during the long war in Afghanistan. The incident has served as a catalyst for Trump to escalate his anti-immigrant rhetoric into pledges that would likely face court challenges if enacted and further undermine America\u2019s global standing as a nation welcoming to immigrants.",
      "\u201cI will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden\u2019s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "On Friday, the State Department took the first step: stopping issuance of U.S. visas for all Afghan nationals.",
      "\"The Department of State has IMMEDIATELY paused visa issuance for individuals traveling on Afghan passports,\" the State Department said in a post on X. \"The Department is taking all necessary steps to protect U.S. national security and public safety.\"",
      "Additionally, Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said on X that \"USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.\"",
      "It was not clear exactly which other countries Trump was referring to, with the phrasing used in the past to refer to poorer nations. The Department of Homeland Security referred a reporter from the Reuters news agency to the 19 countries listed in a travel ban in June, mainly in Africa and the Middle East.",
      "The comments drew swift criticism from two U.N. agencies, which on Friday urged the U.S. to continue to accept asylum-seekers.",
      "The president also threatened to \u201cend all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our country\u201d and to \u201cdenaturalize migrants who undermine domestic security.\u201d",
      "In remarks that will cause alarm among migrant advocacy and civil liberties groups, Trump said the government would deport any foreign national who was \u201cnon-compatible with Western Civilization.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cOnly REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration also said Thursday that the government would re-examine the status of green card holders from 19 countries \u201cof concern,\u201d including Afghanistan.",
      "In a subsequent post, Trump said that \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Somali migrants were \u201ccompletely taking over the once great state of Minnesota.\u201d",
      "Trump has previously threatened action against Somalis and last week said he would end temporary protected status \u2014 which prevents deportations to dangerous countries \u2014 for Somali migrants in Minnesota, many of whom have fled a brutal civil war in the East African country.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how many people this would affect, but a report made for Congress in August put the number of people covered by the program nationally at 705. The president also attacked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as \u201cretarded\u201d and said Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who was born in Somalia, \u201cprobably came into the U.S.A. illegally\u201d and is from a \u201cdecadent, backward, and crime ridden nation.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats, if enacted by legislation or executive orders, are likely to be challenged in the courts. In his first term, Trump banned people from several majority-Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa from entering the U.S. This was challenged, but eventually the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the ban\u2019s legality.",
      "Migrant advocacy groups have called for calm and warned against using the D.C. attack to call for a wider crackdown on immigration or to remove the rights of Afghan residents.",
      "\u201cUsing this horrific attack as an excuse to smear and punish every Afghan, every refugee, or every immigrant rips at something very basic in our Constitution and many faiths: the idea that guilt is personal, not inherited or collective,\u201d the Council on American-Islamic Relations said in a statement early Friday.",
      "U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence said at a Geneva press briefing: \u201cThey are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.\u201d",
      "U.N. refugee agency spokesperson Eujin Byun said: \u201cWhen people who need protection arrive in their territory, they have to have a due process of asylum. And then they have to have access to territory,\u201d she said, adding that the overwhelming majority of refugees are law-abiding members of the host community.",
      "The term \u201cthird world\u201d originated in the Cold War era to describe a country that wasn\u2019t aligned with the western NATO alliance or the USSR and the Warsaw Pact. This later evolved into shorthand for describing economically underdeveloped nations, particularly ones with high levels of poverty.",
      "The term has been used to describe several African nations, but until the late 20th century was also attached to descriptions of China.",
      "Economists and health experts have for years said the phrase is inaccurate, derogatory and outdated. The World Bank and other global institutions no longer use the phrase and some have suggested also avoiding its successor, \u201cdeveloping countries.\u201d"

      "The rolling plains of Kenya\u2019s Maasai Mara and the millions of animals that live there face a shiny new intrusion: a gleaming Ritz-Carlton safari camp.",
      "With private plunge pools, butler service and panoramic views commanding more than $5,000 a night, the 20-hectare lodge has become a luxury lightning rod for controversy.",
      "Leaders of the Maasai \u2014 an ethnic group of traditionally nomadic herders with ancestral ties to the area \u2014 and conservationists warn the new tourist destination threatens a migration corridor vital to the movement of vast numbers of animals and have filed a lawsuit to halt its operations.",
      "What's at stake, they argue, is not just a new lodge, but the accelerating pressures of tourism on wildlife, biodiversity and the very spectacle that draws these tourists in the first place.",
      "The camp opened on Aug. 15 during the height of the Great Migration, where millions of wildebeest, zebras and other grazing animals move back and forth between the Serengeti plains in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR) in Kenya, a process that researchers say allows animals to find food and water and maintain genetic diversity among herds.",
      "Tourists have long flocked to the savannah by the hundreds of thousands, hoping to witness one of the largest movements of mammals in the world, as herds cross rivers and plains teeming with predators.",
      "But the new camp, which boasts \u201cfront-row seats to one of the world's greatest natural wonders\u201d on its website, may threaten the migration that visitors come to witness, conservations and Maasai leaders say.",
      "The Ritz-Carlton camp, on a bend in the Sand River, sits on \u201cone of the most favored corridors for these animals,\u201d Maasai elder Meitamei Olol Dapash told NBC News in an interview Sunday.",
      "\u201cAny guide will tell you, that is the crossing they use,\u201d said Dapash, who filed a lawsuit in August in a Kenyan court against Ritz-Carlton's owner, Marriott International, the world\u2019s largest hotel chain, as well as the project\u2019s local owner and operator, Lazizi Mara Limited, and Kenyan authorities.",
      "Dapash, executive director of the Institute for Maasai Education, Research and Conservation (MERC), who has a PhD in Sustainability Education from Prescott College in Arizona, alleges in the lawsuit that the 20-suite camp obstructs the crucial migration corridor and is asking the court to restore the land to its original condition.",
      "He told NBC News in an interview there had been instances of wildebeest turning back to avoid the camp and that an elephant was seen struggling to find a path across the river after using the location for more than a decade.",
      "\u201cAttachment to the land and to the wildlife exists up to this very day,\u201d Dapash said, adding that the Maasai had seen populations dwindling. The new camp, he added, \u201cwas the last straw for us, we just didn\u2019t want to let this happen.\u201d",
      "The Kenya Wildlife Service government agency pushed back at claims the lodge has impacted wildebeest migration, citing monitoring data that it says shows it does not \u201cfall within, obstruct, or interfere with any wildebeest migration corridors\u201d and adding that migrating wildebeest \u201care using the entire breadth of the Kenya-Tanzania border.\u201d",
      "It said that \"all ecological, environmental and regulatory requirements were thoroughly met and validated.\"",
      "Marriott International told NBC News that the development underwent an environmental impact assessment (EIA) \u201cin full compliance with\u201d Kenya's environmental protections.",
      "The company said it is committed to \u201cthe principles of responsible tourism\u201d but declined to comment on Dapash's claims that the Ritz-Carlton blocked a key route for local wildlife or its own steps to mitigate the construction's impact, saying these were matters for Narok County, which manages the reserve on the Maasai\u2019s behalf.",
      "Narok County did not respond to NBC News' request for comment. In court documents seen by NBC News, the county claims that the safari camp complies with the Maasai Mara Management Plan, which imposes a moratorium on new developments amid concerns that poorly regulated tourism was stifling wildlife migration and threatening the reserve\u2019s ecosystem.",
      "Lazizi Mara Limited said the moratorium is part of the case before the court, adding: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t\u202fwant to comment on\u202fissues\u202fthat are pending determination.\u201d",
      "Dapash told NBC News that he had \"no issue with business, but this is not just about hotel, it is about the long-term survival of the game reserve.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel like we are losing the land, we are losing the wildlife,\u201d he said.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid mounting concerns about the health of the 580-square-mile reserve, where tourist numbers have nearly tripled in recent decades. The Maasai Mara National Reserve reported over 300,000 tourists in 2023. In 1980, total visitor entry was 114,000.",
      "Tourism in the Mara generates an estimated $20 million annually and thousands more indirectly, according to the reserve. In 2023, tourism across the country contributed around 7% of Kenya's gross domestic product, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.",
      "But the rapid growth in lodges and camps has sometimes clashed with conservation efforts.",
      "\u201cA hotel is never just a hotel,\u201d Dr. Chloe Buiting, a vet and wildlife researcher working in the Maasai Mara, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s infrastructure, it\u2019s roads, it\u2019s changes to the water and the resources and the use of land.\u201d",
      "Seasonal variation in the availability and quality of food forces animals to move around, said Joseph Ogutu, a Kenyan researcher at the University of Hohenheim in Germany. But he said developments like the Ritz-Carlton are having \u201ca negative effect on migration, because most of these facilities are close to rivers where animals either drink water or breed or seek refuge.\u201d",
      "Dapash's cause has also found support among experts and tourism groups.",
      "Grant Hopcraft, a professor of conservation ecology at the University of Glasgow, who has been collaring migratory wildebeest in the Serengeti-Mara since 1999, presented maps and data to the court in October showing \u201cregular cross-border movement of wildebeest\u201d at the location of the lodge, according to his affidavit.",
      "RIDE International, a U.S.-based nonprofit providing cultural exchanges and immersive tours in East Africa, has also thrown its support behind Dapash's lawsuit.",
      "The Mara has been suffering for a long time, said Riley Jon Blackwell, the company's executive director, with \u201clarge hotel chains coming in and trying to service the luxury guests who command to see the best of the best for wildlife.\u201d",
      "The Ritz-Carlton safari camp was \u201cnot surprising,\u201d he added in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a culmination of a long time, of a direction of things leading this way.\u201d",
      "The camp holds a 2.2-star rating on Google Reviews, with many posters criticizing its environmental impact. Others have praised their stay at the park.",
      "A court is scheduled to hear the case in December.",
      "If Dapash is successful with his lawsuit, Buiting said it could \u201cset a very interesting precedent\u201d for future developments in the reserve.",
      "\u201cFrom a legal perspective, this could actually be groundbreaking, a turning point,\u201d she added."

      "\u201cAt the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,\u201d USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said Thursday afternoon in a statement on X.",
      "Edlow said that protecting the country \u201cremains paramount\u201d and that \u201cthe American people will not bear the cost of the prior administration\u2019s reckless resettlement policies.\u201d",
      "Asked for details on which countries are considered \u201cof concern,\u201d USCIS pointed to a June presidential proclamation listing 19 countries \"considered deficient with regards to screening and vetting.\" Afghanistan is one of the countries on the list, which also includes Haiti, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "The USCIS announcement comes a day after two National Guard members were shot near the White House. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds, Trump said Thursday night, while 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe remained hospitalized in critical condition. They were in Washington as part of Trump\u2019s deployment of federal troops to several U.S. cities.",
      "Federal prosecutors say the suspect, an Afghan national who once assisted American forces, was resettled in the U.S. under a program called Operation Allies Welcome during the Biden administration following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Thursday morning that her office is reviewing the suspect\u2019s immigration history and the vetting process that allowed his entry into the country.",
      "In a long post on X Friday, Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Joe Kent claimed that 85,000 Afghans were admitted to the U.S. under Biden without the \u201crigorous vetting that has protected us in the past.\u201d",
      "He continued, saying that the suspect was \"only vetted to serve as a soldier to fight against the Taliban, AQ, & ISIS IN Afghanistan, he was NOT vetted for his suitability to come to America and live among us as a neighbor, integrate into our communities, or eventually become an American citizen.\"",
      "Those admitted under the Operation Allies Welcome program were required to undergo \"biometric and biographic screenings\" by law enforcement and counterterrorism authorities, according to a fact sheet prepared by the Biden administration.",
      "The suspect's immigration process continued into the Trump administration. He was granted asylum in April of this year, which typically occurs two weeks after a final interview with immigration authorities.",
      "In a video released by the White House, Trump called the attack in Washington, D.C., an \u201cact of terror\u201d and said additional National Guard troops would be deployed to the nation's capital.",
      "The administration said shortly after Trump's remarks that all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals will be halted indefinitely.",
      "Authorities have not provided a motive, but D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said \u201cthis is a targeted shooting,\u201d and that the suspect appeared to target the guard members.",
      "Four senior law enforcement sources briefed on the investigation said the suspect has been identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
      "Speaking with NBC News on Wednesday, a relative of Lakanwal said he arrived in the U.S. in September 2021 after serving in the Afghan Army for 10 years, alongside U.S. Special Forces. Lakanwal was living in Bellingham, Washington, with his wife and five children, the relative said.",
      "\u201cWe were the ones that were targeted by the Taliban in Afghanistan,\u201d said the relative. \u201cI cannot believe it that he might do this.\u201d",
      "A CIA spokesperson said Thursday that the alleged shooter \u201cpreviously worked with the USG (U.S. government), including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar that ended in 2021 following the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Asked Thursday night about Lakanwal's vetting and the fact that he worked with the CIA, Trump responded: \"He went cuckoo. I mean, he went nuts. And that happens too, it happens too often with these people,\" an apparent reference to Afghans who came to the U.S. around the time of the 2021 withdrawal."

      "Hong Kong\u2019s Secretary for Security Chris Tang told reporters Friday that 89 bodies could not yet be identified. Seventy-nine people were injured, he said. Tang declined to identify the genders and ages of the deceased, saying the investigation was ongoing and the data incomplete.",

      "The deadliest blaze in the Chinese territory in seven decades has nonetheless fueled calls for greater accountability and transparency from the local government over potential regulatory negligence.",

The 48-year-old said her family had managed to escape, adding, \u201cI really hope there are survivors. I\u2019m wishing for a miracle to happen.\u201d",

      "Styrofoam on the windows, which was \u201chighly flammable,\u201d fueled the blaze to spread rapidly upward and extend to six more buildings, he said, adding that the flames shattered glass and penetrated interiors, burning both inside and outside the buildings simultaneously.",
      "The intense heat then ignited the bamboo scaffolding, which also sparked secondary fires when it fell down, he said.",
      "\u201cAlthough the mesh netting met certain flame-retardant requirements, they could still catch fire when exposed to high temperatures,\u201d Tang said. \u201cBamboo scaffolding could also catch fire,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are only flame-retardant. And this is our initial assessment of the situation.\u201d",
      "Within hours, Hong Kong\u2019s Independent Commission Against Corruption said in a statement that it had set up a \u201ctask force to launch a full investigation into possible corruption\u201d and eight people had been arrested including \u201cconsultants, scaffolding subcontractors and middleman.\u201d",

      "The cause of the fire also remains under investigation, which may take three to four weeks to complete, officials said at the Friday news briefing.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand why measles matters,\u201d said Dr. Kate O\u2019Brien, director of the WHO\u2019s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. \u201cIts high transmissibility means that even small drops in vaccine coverage can trigger outbreaks, like a fire alarm going off when smoke is detected first.\u201d",
      "That is, measles is often the first disease to pop up when vaccination rates overall drop.",
      "\"When we see measles cases, it signals that gaps are almost certainly likely for other vaccine-preventable diseases like diphtheria or whooping cough or polio, even though they may not be setting off the fire alarm just yet,\" O'Brien said at a media briefing Monday, ahead of the release of the WHO's Progress Toward Measles Elimination report, published Friday in its Weekly Epidemiological Record.",
      "Indeed, whooping cough cases are also rising in the United States and are on track to be the most in a decade. More than 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In 2024, there were an estimated 11 million measles infections worldwide, according to the report, nearly 800,000 more than were recorded in 2019.",
      "Last year, 59 countries reported large measles outbreaks. In 2025, the United States joined the list of countries.",
      "Elimination status threatened",
      "The ongoing outbreaks threaten the so-called measles elimination statuses of some countries.",
      "Elimination means a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. (Only one virus \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated, or wiped out permanently, worldwide.)",
      "In total, 81 countries had reached elimination status in 2024, according to the WHO. Canada eliminated measles in 1998. Two years later, the United States did the same.",
      "Elimination status means a country has the capacity to stop an outbreak when measles cases arrive from abroad, O'Brien said. If vaccination rates are high enough, the virus won't have enough unvaccinated people to infect, halting an outbreak in its tracks.",
      "But vaccination rates in the United States are falling: An NBC News investigation revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots.",
      "The key determining factor for a country to lose its measles elimination status is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.",
      "Canada met that threshold this month. The United States could be next if scientists can trace current cases to a Texas outbreak that began in January.",
      "Nearly all of the samples analyzed from those early cases were identified as a genotype of measles called D8, according to a CDC report published in April.",
      "The D8 genotype was recently detected in a South Carolina outbreak.",
      "Preliminary results from specimens sent from South Carolina to CDC labs \"are the same type, D8, that is seen in other settings in the United States,\" Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health, said at a news briefing Tuesday.",
      "Additional genetic sequencing is needed to make a definitive link between the Texas outbreak and the one in South Carolina, as well as outbreaks in Utah and Arizona. A South Carolina Department of Public Health spokesman said the agency \"expects those results in the next few weeks.\"",
      "Bell said that as of Tuesday, 58 cases had been reported in South Carolina, mostly in Spartanburg County in the northwest part of the state.",
      "An outbreak along the border of Arizona and Utah continues to grow. The Arizona Department of Health Services reported 153 cases this week, nearly all in Mohave County.",
      "Cases in Utah have reached 102, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services. While the bulk of those cases are linked to the cluster at the Utah-Arizona border, case numbers are also rising near Salt Lake City. NBC affiliate KSL reported that eight students at a high school in Wasatch County had been diagnosed.",
      "As of Wednesday, the CDC had reported 1,798 confirmed measles cases in 42 states in 2025. Three people, an adult in New Mexico and two little girls in Texas, have died."

      "The White House had said Monday that no meeting was scheduled.",
      "Ukrainian and U.S. delegations reached \"a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed in Geneva,\" Rustem Umerov, a top official in Zelenskyy\u2019s government, said on X early Tuesday without elaborating on the details.",

      "\"The principles in this document can be developed into deeper agreements. It is in our shared interest that security is real,\" Zelenskyy posted Tuesday on X. \"I count on continued active cooperation with the American side and President Trump.

      "\"We firmly believe security decisions about Ukraine must include Ukraine \u2014 that was our position in Geneva and always \u2014 security decisions about Europe must include Europe,\" he said.",

      "Four more people were arrested Tuesday in connection with the Oct. 19 heist at the Louvre Museum, Paris prosecutors announced.",
      "All four \u2014 two men, aged 38 and 39, and two women, 31 and 40 \u2014 are from the Paris region, Laure Beccuau, a prosecutor for the city, said in a statement.",
      "With the new arrests, a total of eight people are now facing charges in connection with the case. Three men and one woman had already been charged with organized theft and criminal conspiracy to commit crimes and offenses, according to the statement.",
      "Last month, the group allegedly duped security systems and used power tools in broad daylight to steal millions in jewelry from the famed Paris museum. They ultimately made off with invaluable jewels once worn by France\u2019s queens and empresses, officials told NBC News.",
      "The Ministry of Culture confirmed the jewels stolen included a necklace and a pair of earrings from the Marie-Louise collection; a necklace, earrings and a tiara from from the Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Queen Hortense collection; and a brooch, bodice bow and a tiara from the collection of Empress Eug\u00e9nie.",
      "The stolen jewels are worth an estimated $102 million and have yet to be turned over to Parisian officials.",
      "At least two of the stolen items, including Empress Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s crown, were apparently dropped on the way out, part of a trail of clues to the group suspected in the theft.",
      "The thieves, whom French Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez called \"experienced,\" used power tools, including a disc cutter, to break into the Galerie d\u2019Apollon through a window, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. A crane lift mounted on a truck was outside of the window and was brought in to aid in the heist, which took place at 9:30 a.m., as the museum was opening.",
      "The heist took only about seven minutes and prompted the museum to close for the day \u2014 a rarity, officials said.",
      "Prior to the heist, the Louvre was urged by a French court of auditors to speed up the modernization of its security systems. The process has been delayed, and was expected to be completed by 2032, according to a report."
